20
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:41,647
Thanks.

21
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:59,328
Xiaoqi,

22
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,007
we're at work.

23
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:16,848
I'm taking this.

24
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:41,888
Fang Leng.

25
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:46,888
Here's the meeting minutes.

26
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:48,568
Thanks.

27
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:50,527
Hold on.

28
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,408
Don't you have anything to say to me?

29
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,767
Yes.

30
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:01,168
Statistics.

31
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:02,767
You asked me to do this.

32
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,408
That's all.

33
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,247
Thanks.

34
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:06,568
Good work.

35
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:11,608
Wait, that's not right.

36
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:19,848
Mr. Fang,

37
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,328
the meeting is at 3 pm.

38
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:24,687
Mr. Fang.

39
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,568
Mr. Fang.

40
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,527
Are you all right?

41
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:33,687
Mr. Han,

42
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:37,328
I have a boyfriend.

43
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,207
I mean

44
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,888
I have a male friend.

45
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:40,608
Mr. Fang,

46
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,608
can you have friends with your temper?

47
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,527
You didn't make that up, did you?

48
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,448
So, did your male friend

49
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,008
encounter any problem?

50
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,848
This male friend of mine

51
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,408
was kissed by a girl.

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,328
(Oh my god, someone kissed Mr. Fang.)

53
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,647
He hoped the girl would
give him an explanation,

54
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:06,487
but the girl

55
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,168
didn't explain anything to him

56
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,767
and suddenly kept her distance.

57
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:11,888
I don't get it.

58
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,568
(Ms. Chai gave him
the silent treatment.)

59
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,168
(That's new.)

60
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,768
(This must be karma.)

61
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,648
Mr. Fang,

62
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,048
in this day and age,

63
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,687
a kiss is nothing.

64
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,687
What is there to explain about a kiss?

65
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:27,848
Mr. Fang, you...

66
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,528
It wasn't his first kiss, right?

67
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,327
I'm not sure.

68
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,648
(Ms. Chai stole Mr. Fang's first kiss.)

69
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,168
That's awesome.

70
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:48,968
I remember that
we're getting paid today.

71
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:49,807
Mr. Fang,

72
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,288
if Ms. Chai...

73
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,327
If the girl who kissed your friend

74
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,687
suddenly kept her distance,

75
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,927
according to my analysis,

76
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,447
she's playing hard to get.

77
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,168
There's no way her brain

78
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,848
would ever come up with such a trick.

79
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:10,848
It doesn't matter.

80
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,327
Most importantly,

81
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,208
does your friend

82
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,687
have feelings for her?

83
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,088
If he does, then it's very simple.

84
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,007
Be proactive.

85
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,048
Approach her if he can.

86
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,807
(Sister Chai: Well done.)
I have been ignoring Fang Leng all day.

87
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:41,968
As Mr. Fang's assistant,

88
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,048
I think you're going too far.

89
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,687
How can you do this to Mr. Fang?

90
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,168
However, as a wingman,

91
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,887
I think you did a great job.

92
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,127
Mr. Fang

93
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:53,728
falls head over heels for you.

94
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,007
Are you

95
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,807
playing hard to get?

96
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:00,687
You found out.

97
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,208
Yes.

98
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,208
I feel like I did a poor job just now.

99
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,127
Was my acting

100
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:06,208
a little too much?

101
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,127
Your expression

102
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,127
and emotional state

103
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,127
were on point.

104
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,048
Really?

105
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,127
It was great.

106
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,007
However,

107
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,007
it lacked physical coordination.

108
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,288
For example,

109
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,288
flick and wave.

110
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,447
Look.

111
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,088
Flick and wave.

112
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,528
Roll your eyes

113
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,447
to express your disdain.

114
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:26,408
Disdain.

115
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,447
Disdain.

116
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:30,968
Relax a little.

117
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:31,887
Disdain.

118
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,127
Yes, that's right.

119
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,088
- Relax.
- Xiaoqi,

120
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,408
Mr. Fang wants to see you in his office.

121
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:37,327
Okay.

122
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,327
He wants to see me.

123
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:39,048
Good luck.

124
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,007
Remember to use this trick.

125
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:41,848
I will.

126
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:43,408
Yes.

127
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:44,408
Disdain.

128
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:50,528
Hi.

129
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:51,487
You were looking for me?

130
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:52,648
Take a seat.

131
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,408
He chases

132
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:57,687
and she runs away.

133
00:06:58,887 --> 00:06:59,728
He says,

134
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:01,208
"You have to be responsible

135
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:02,728
for my first kiss."

136
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,890
(Fang Leng)

137
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,567
It's the fried chicken from yesterday.

138
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,127
I found a really delicious
fried chicken shop.

139
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:14,007
I'll take you there tonight

140
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,367
to make it up to you.

141
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:16,408
Fried chicken?

142
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,487
Again?

143
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,048
I'm tired of it.

144
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:25,447
Didn't you say yesterday
that you liked fried chicken?

145
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,567
Why are you suddenly tired of it?

146
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,608
I have many favourite foods.

147
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:33,608
Steamed lamb, steamed bear's
paw and steamed deer antler.

148
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:34,648
Roast duck, roast goose
and roast chicken.

149
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,728
Braised duck, braised
goose and braised chicken.

150
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,247
- Baked duck, goose and chicken.
- What's wrong with you?

151
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,528
Can't a fried chicken
drumstick satisfy you?

152
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,807
It's just a drumstick after all.

153
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:46,848
Chai Xiaoqi,

154
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:48,687
can you take responsibility for once?

155
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,288
Listen, you have to stay loyal.

156
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,728
If you didn't like chicken
drumstick in the first place,

157
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,247
you shouldn't have messed with it

158
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,728
or make requests midway.

159
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:57,848
You can't keep your distance
from the chicken drumstick

160
00:07:57,848 --> 00:07:59,608
without saying a word!

161
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,088
What does the chicken drumstick care?

162
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,408
Of course I care!

163
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,168
I mean, the chicken drumstick.

164
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm baffled.

165
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,408
Then I won't eat chicken
drumsticks from now on.

166
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:10,968
I'll eat duck leg instead.

167
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,327
What are you doing?

168
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:21,927
Chai Xiaoqi,

169
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:24,288
what are you up to?

170
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,927
(Why does playing hard to get
annoy him so much?)

171
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:30,487
I...

172
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,248
I don't know what you're saying.

173
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,207
What am I up to? What else can I do?

174
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,447
I have a lot of work to do.

175
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,248
I was dragged in by you to talk about
chicken drumsticks and whatnot

176
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:39,528
for a long time.

177
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,528
Unbelievable.

178
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,687
All right, that's enough. I'm leaving.

179
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,408
What?

180
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:52,727
Do you know what you did wrong?

181
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,288
Ms. Chai.

182
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,888
How can you be so irresponsible?

183
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,087
Disdain.

184
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,368
Under the relentless questioning
by the demanding boss,

185
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,927
let's see how she will

186
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,168
turn the tables.

187
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,207
Mr. Fang.

188
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,488
Aren't you in charge of
assigning tasks to Chai Xiaoqi?

189
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:27,768
Let me ask you.

190
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,888
Why does an office girl

191
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,408
have so much work to do?

192
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,368
I... Mr. Fang,

193
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,248
I didn't arrange any task for her.

194
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,967
Didn't you assign the task of liaising

195
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:36,927
with The One design company

196
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,768
to her?

197
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,207
Mr. Fang,

198
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,087
are you regretting your decision?

199
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,727
Mr. Fang, the meeting is in ten minutes.

200
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,168
Hello, I am looking for Mr. Wang.

201
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,288
One moment, please.

202
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,488
Someone is looking for Mr. Wang.

203
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:13,807
Sure.

204
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,408
Mr. Wang went out.

205
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,607
Please come back on another day.

206
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,168
However, I made an appointment with him

207
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,488
to meet at 3 pm.

208
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:22,008
One leaving the office
impromptu is normal.

209
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,567
It's no big deal.

210
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:24,528
This...

211
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:25,847
Mr. Jiang.

212
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,087
It's you.

213
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:31,927
Do you remember

214
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:33,727
we met at that party the other day?

215
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:35,847
I remember.

216
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,087
Are you

217
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,648
here today to liaise with us?

218
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:41,807
Yes, I came to speak to Mr. Wang.

219
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,128
However, she said Mr. Wang
was not in the office.

220
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,648
So I am going to go back.

221
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,128
Let's talk again next time.

222
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,248
What's the project?

223
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:48,927
You can speak to me directly.

224
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,087
In summary,

225
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,368
I think establishing a R&D department

226
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:55,847
is necessary.

227
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,048
Again, we propose

228
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,768
a plan for the R&D department.

229
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,727
Mr. Fang,

230
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,368
the products from our company's
makeup department

231
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,168
are enough to meet
the consumers' needs.

232
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,528
Unnecessarily establishing
a R&D department

233
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,048
will not only increase the cost,

234
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,727
it cannot guarantee the consumers'

235
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,888
acceptance of new product concepts.

236
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,048
So, I think,

237
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,447
we can drop the idea

238
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,288
for good.

239
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,087
Although our company's products

240
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,727
have a fixed customer base,

241
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,528
whenever there is a chance

242
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,327
to expand the customer base,

243
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,727
we shouldn't sit on the existing merits

244
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:30,847
and remain complacent.

245
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,447
What's wrong with existing merits?

246
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,048
You are too young.

247
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:39,128
So you always think about
breaking new records.

248
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:40,488
Sometimes,

249
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:42,327
old things are the best.

250
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,368
Ask everyone if you don't believe me.

251
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:45,567
Are you the only one who thinks

252
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,408
it's helpful for the company to
establish a R&D department?

253
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,528
I think

254
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,807
Mr. Fang's words

255
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,607
makes sense.

256
00:11:59,087 --> 00:11:59,847
In the past,

257
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,607
I also thought that
forming a R&D department

258
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:02,727
was unnecessary.

259
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,567
However, Mr. Fang taught me a lesson

260
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,648
with his actions.

261
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:06,807
Enough. If there's anything
wrong with your eyes,

262
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:07,847
you should see a doctor.

263
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:10,607
Just because we're experienced,

264
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,648
it doesn't mean
our decisions have been correct.

265
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,128
Young people can
indeed bring the company

266
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,927
innovation and energy.

267
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,567
If Mr. Fang is confident

268
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:19,567
in bringing more value to the company

269
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,128
through the R&D department,

270
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,447
I think it should be approved.

271
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,528
Yes, that's right.

272
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:26,288
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

273
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,648
Mr. Fang,

274
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,048
I didn't expect you
to convince Mr. Zhou.

275
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,408
Fine.

276
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,368
Let's see

277
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:43,488
what kind of value this R&D department

278
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,288
can bring to the company.

279
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,488
If you let the board down,

280
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,727
you'll be solely responsible.

281
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,008
Uncle Kang.

282
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:53,768
Mr. Fang,

283
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,648
Uncle Kang is worried about us.

284
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:58,847
Watch out for hair loss.

285
00:12:59,048 --> 00:12:59,648
You...

286
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:07,567
Mr. Fang.

287
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,168
Establishing a R&D
department is a big deal.

288
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,847
I think we should celebrate it.

289
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,368
Celebrate it?

290
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,607
Has Chai Xiaoqi got off from work?

291
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:18,888
No way.

292
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,128
Ms. Chai went out

293
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,648
to liaise with The One design company.

294
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:22,847
This company

295
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,327
is hard to please.

296
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:25,687
It is inevitable that
Ms. Chai will have to

297
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,528
visit their company frequently.

298
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:33,488
Mr. Fang,

299
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:35,008
people call this

300
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,768
shooting yourself in the foot.

301
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:46,488
Mr. Fang,

302
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,528
how about dessert? It'll lift your mood.

303
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,327
That's easier than I thought.

304
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:59,008
It's not as troublesome as Mr. Han said.

305
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:01,927
It's almost time for dinner.

306
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,048
I'll treat you to a meal.

307
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:04,447
No, it's fine.

308
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,008
I'm going home in a moment.

309
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:08,368
This is the second time we meet.

310
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,048
I mean fate brought us together.

311
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,048
It's fine, seriously.

312
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,087
I'll treat you to fried chicken.

313
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:12,687
Let's go.

314
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:17,807
Eat slowly.

315
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:18,967
No one is fighting with you.

316
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,248
Should I order another portion

317
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:23,327
for you to bring home?

318
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:25,408
You're making me feel bad.

319
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,207
Lady boss,

320
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,447
can you give me three
portions for takeaway?

321
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,807
Sure, one moment, please.

322
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:31,567
Thanks.

323
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,048
Aren't you eating?

324
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:38,607
I don't usually eat fried stuff.

325
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,048
Neither does Fang Leng.

326
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,207
Do all domineering
bosses not eat junk food?

327
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,488
Then I will.

328
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:47,847
Are you and Mr. Fang

329
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:49,528
very close?

330
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,967
I'm exploited by him.

331
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:56,248
What's the matter? Do you know him?

332
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,447
I saw him at the party.

333
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:02,168
You two left. He held your hand,

334
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,408
as if you were going to elope.

335
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,008
Are you two

336
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,727
in a relationship?

337
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:10,768
Eat slowly.

338
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:15,607
Don't let your imagination run wild.

339
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,488
In a relationship?

340
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,368
I told you he's exploiting me.

341
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,168
Why are we stopping here?

342
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,368
Mr. Han said

343
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,888
you made a reservation here tonight.

344
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,048
It's okay.

345
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:29,207
Just drive back.

346
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,048
Okay.

347
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,447
Wait a minute.

348
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,727
Eat slowly.

349
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:44,768
You...

350
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,888
Hello.

351
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,528
Hang on, my boss is here.

352
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,888
I'll go first, thank you.

353
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:13,927
Go ahead.

354
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:14,687
Bye.

355
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,168
It was fun today. Thanks.

356
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:16,888
I'm leaving.

357
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:17,687
Bye.

358
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:21,967
- Chai Xiaoqi!
- Yes, boss?

359
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,607
How may I help you?

360
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,288
Didn't you say you
didn't like fried chicken?

361
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,207
My horoscope is an air sign.

362
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,528
My thoughts are inconsistent.

363
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:32,727
I may not like it in the morning,

364
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,607
but I'd change my mind in the afternoon.

365
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:34,807
What's wrong with that?

366
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,248
What are you doing?

367
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:39,288
What are you doing?

368
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:40,567
Hey.

369
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,567
Hello.

370
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:43,607
Do you like fried chicken?

371
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:45,368
You can have it.

372
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,128
Someone gave me this.

373
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,488
Are you giving it away just like that?

374
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,087
Someone?

375
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,128
What?

376
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:53,648
Sorry, I'll take this

377
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,528
- Chai Xiaoqi, listen up.
- What's going on?

378
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:01,368
Those are mine!

379
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:01,847
Starting today,

380
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,408
you can only eat the fried
chicken I bought for you.

381
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:04,847
Don't eat other people's fried chicken.

382
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:06,647
- Put me down.
- Get into the car.

383
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:07,728
Are you out of your mind?

384
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:11,847
Fang Leng!

385
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:16,928
What are you doing?

386
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,688
I want to be like that.

387
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,690
(Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop)

388
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,688
Staff recruitment,

389
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:30,768
shop promotion

390
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:31,847
and R&D of new products.

391
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:34,087
All these require a certain
level of financial support.

392
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,847
If you can find investors to
get the necessary funding,

393
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,448
it'll undoubtedly be a shortcut
on your entrepreneurship journey.

394
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:41,607
Xiaoqi,

395
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,567
I have something to discuss with you.

396
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:44,407
In the future,

397
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,167
should you date Mr. Fang,

398
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,887
can you ask him to invest

399
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:49,167
in our milk tea shop?

400
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,887
Let me tell you, if
Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop

401
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:54,567
opens 100,000 chains
across the country,

402
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,887
we can get listed for sure.

403
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,127
By the way, I forgot to ask you.

404
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,407
Is the trick of playing hard
to get I told you about

405
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:00,607
working?

406
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,528
Not only I failed to captivate him,

407
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,248
in fact, I think I've angered him.

408
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:05,928
If you're counting on me,

409
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,928
your store will probably go bankrupt.

410
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:13,167
Why is it so hard to get rich overnight?

411
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,407
Let me tell you, Chai.

412
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:16,567
Actually, getting rich overnight

413
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:17,647
isn't about the boss,

414
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:18,847
but his mother.

415
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:19,847
Recently,

416
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,248
I've discovered a literary
website called Jinhai.

417
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,728
Novels about domineering bosses
with a score of 9.0 or above

418
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,607
share a common and classic plot.

419
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,607
The boss' mother finds the heroine

420
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,087
and gives her 5 million RMB

421
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:31,928
to leave the boss.

422
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,327
5 million RMB.

423
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,127
Welcome.

424
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,087
Which one of you is Chai Xiaoqi?

425
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,830
(Zhou Siqin, Fang Leng's stepmom
Eying on Future Group and Fang Leng)

426
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,150
(Danger)

427
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,448
You're Chai Xiaoqi?

428
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,688
We need to talk.

429
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:03,887
I'm booking the entire venue.

430
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,647
Sorry, Miss,

431
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,768
it costs a lot to book the entire venue.

432
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,167
No problem.

433
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,528
What a domineering lady.

434
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,528
Xiaobu, you heard her.

435
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,327
Good luck.

436
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
(Closed)

437
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,048
Why is it closed for business?

438
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,008
Sorry,

439
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,567
someone booked the entire venue.

440
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,968
I was going to grab coffee.

441
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,048
(Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop)
Come back later.

442
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,390
(Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop)

443
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,208
I've investigated.

444
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,567
From the group's beauty line

445
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,807
to R&D department,

446
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:52,968
I know

447
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,248
you're the one who's
been helping Fang Leng.

448
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,127
The boss' mother finds the heroine

449
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:58,647
and gives her 5 million RMB

450
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,688
to leave the boss.

451
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,847
No matter how much money you give me,

452
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,688
I will never leave Fang Leng.

453
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,567
That's not what I mean.

454
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,728
- Listen to me.
- That's enough.

455
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:12,968
Love is priceless.

456
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,087
I'm not dating Fang Leng

457
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,367
for money either.

458
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:17,448
It is because you are
dating. That's why I am...

459
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:18,968
That's why you want to
send me away with money,

460
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,647
right?

461
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:20,768
Rest assured.

462
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,127
I won't agree to do it.

463
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,807
You've really misunderstood.

464
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,008
I'm not paying to chase you away.

465
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,887
I'm paying for you to stay.

466
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,167
Let me be straightforward with you.

467
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:33,647
Let's work together.

468
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:35,367
Work together?

469
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:37,968
(Doesn't she dislike Fang Leng?)

470
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,488
(Why would she work with me?)

471
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,448
It's simple.

472
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,647
You just need to report to me

473
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,288
Fang Leng's every move.

474
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:46,688
The meetings he is in,

475
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:48,008
the clients he meets

476
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,208
and the projects he does.

477
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:50,647
I'll give you this amount.

478
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:51,647
How about that?

479
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:52,928
(5 million RMB?)

480
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,528
(It finally matches
the plot in the novels.)

481
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,127
If you want me to betray Fang Leng,

482
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,528
you have to pay this amount.

483
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,167
You're young,

484
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,407
but ambitious.

485
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:04,048
Fine.

486
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:05,528
I'll pay you double,

487
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:06,968
as long as you complete the task.

488
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,127
Are you willing to pay me RMB10 million

489
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:12,248
just to get Fang Leng's
information from me?

490
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,087
You wish.

491
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,968
Inside this card is RMB100,000.

492
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,528
If you don't want to do it, never mind.

493
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:25,567
I'm professional.

494
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:46,887
Come in.

495
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:52,208
Mr. Fang.

496
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,847
Why are you delivering coffee?

497
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:58,928
Ms. Chai is on leave.

498
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:01,968
She's fine.

499
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:03,887
She'll come back to work soon.

500
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,327
There's nothing to worry about.

501
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:06,688
Come back.

502
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:13,488
You're hiding something from me.

503
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,448
Actually...

504
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,248
Actually, it's nothing.

505
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:23,847
It's just that, I saw

506
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,208
Ms. Chai and Zhou Siqin sit together.

507
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,928
Zhou Siqin even gave her a card.

508
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:31,407
Of course it's Zhou Siqin's fault.

509
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:33,008
We should trust Ms. Chai.

510
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:35,968
Mr. Fang, if you are angry,

511
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:36,887
just vent it.

512
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,327
Don't let it affect your health.

513
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,887
The coffee is too hot. I'll do it.

514
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,448
Mr. Fang, don't worry.

515
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:47,288
To me,

516
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:48,807
you will always be my boss.

517
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:49,807
Who you're dating doesn't matter.

518
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,048
Even if you lose your lover this time,

519
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,567
your assistant is still here.

520
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:55,248
Mr. Fang, do you feel better now?

521
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,008
I just wanted a sip of coffee.

522
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,127
If Ms. Chai really betrays you,

523
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:06,567
what do you plan to do?

524
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:08,647
I don't think she's that kind of person.

525
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:10,127
Great.

526
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:12,167
Trust your own judgment.

527
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,728
There's no need to be troubled by it.

528
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,488
However, she seems to have received
money from Zhou Siqin recently.

529
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,295
Is it because of the day after tomorrow?

530
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:24,095
So you've been extra sensitive lately.

531
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,855
You're afraid that the people
around you whom you trust

532
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:27,736
will leave your side.

533
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:31,936
Chai Xiaoqi took part

534
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,216
in several important company projects.

535
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:35,135
I don't want Zhou Siqin

536
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,815
to have an opportunity of
destroying the company.

537
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:39,135
Any judgement or idea on the matter?

538
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:43,416
In fact, the details of human body
movements and expression

539
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:45,335
can express one's heart.

540
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,535
Try to observe.

541
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,936
After an ordinary person
gets a huge sum of money,

542
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:51,896
he or she will usually
relieve their stress

543
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,256
through impulsive spending.

544
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:00,815
Girls,

545
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,656
buy whatever you want.

546
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,055
It's all on me.

547
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:05,256
I'm rich.

548
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,815
Xiaoqi is the best!

549
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:09,496
It's so pretty.

550
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,775
- It's so pretty.
- Welcome.

551
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,176
This is the new product in our store.

552
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:14,135
Registered members
can enjoy new discounts.

553
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:15,335
We don't need a discount at all.

554
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:17,055
We have money today.

555
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,656
Buy it!

556
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,416
Whoever that gives us a discount

557
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,416
is looking down on us.

558
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,135
That's right.

559
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,456
I like this dress.

560
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:22,095
Buy it!

561
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:24,055
This one is nice, too.

562
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,456
- Buy it!
- This is nice.

563
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:26,295
Am I right?

564
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:26,976
Buy it.

565
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:28,575
- Just buy it if you like it.
- There's also this.

566
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,216
Bill, please.

567
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,335
It's beautiful, isn't it?

568
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,535
It's different from your usual clothes.

569
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:47,815
Then I'll buy it.

570
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:50,256
Miss, your friends have
already chosen their dresses.

571
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,216
Here's your bill.

572
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:51,736
Okay.

573
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:53,256
I'm also buying this one on me.

574
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:53,936
No problem.

575
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,990
(Total 24,899.00)

576
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,775
I'll buy theirs first.

577
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:00,936
I'm not buying this one.

578
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:01,976
Why not?

579
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,575
This one is so nice, isn't it, Xiaobu?

580
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:04,775
You must buy it.

581
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:08,416
The fabric is so little and thin.

582
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,615
Why is it so expensive?

583
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,936
This is a limited edition
handcrafted item of our shop.

584
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,775
Is it beyond your budget?

585
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,176
- I...
- You're mean.

586
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:16,815
Xiaoqi is very rich now.

587
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:19,335
Sorry, that's not what I mean.

588
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,775
I think, after putting it on,

589
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:23,176
the fabric feels a bit prickly.

590
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,656
It feels uncomfortable.

591
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,375
Really?

592
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,696
This is hypoallergenic mild
cotton and linen material.

593
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,135
It absolutely won't irritate the skin.

594
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:30,375
Is that so? However,

595
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,775
I think it feels a little
tight around the waist.

596
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,095
It's a little uncomfortable.

597
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:36,016
This is the waistband
effect of the dress,

598
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,135
which is gentle and pressure-free.

599
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,016
Besides, you'll shape
up and lose weight.

600
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:42,416
This colour is not very nice.

601
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,855
This is the rose pink hue

602
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:45,135
put together by the designer.

603
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,416
It's also patented.

604
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:49,135
(Other than the price,)

605
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,855
(it's virtually perfect.)

606
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:55,135
It's okay, I'll think about it.

607
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:56,256
We'll buy these first.

608
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:56,896
Sure.

609
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,135
Xiaoqi, you have been shopping for hours

610
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,375
and you bought nothing for yourself.

611
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,335
Yes, Xiaoqi.

612
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,176
We're out here shopping.

613
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:04,135
At least pick yourself a gift.

614
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,416
It's okay, I'll buy your dresses first.

615
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,815
However, this one is really pretty.

616
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:07,696
Yes.

617
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:34,775
Fang Leng.

618
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,216
After an ordinary person
gets a huge sum of money,

619
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:40,216
he or she usually relieves stress

620
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:40,855
through impulsive spending.

621
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,216
This is for you. Take it.

622
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:44,335
You...

623
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:50,095
Did anyone make him upset?

624
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,855
Is it because you gave him too little?

625
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,815
(Fang Leng)
They bought a lot of luxury goods.

626
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,456
(Fang Leng)
I think she's working for Zhou Siqin.

627
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,990
(Dr. Zhang)

628
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,930
(Chai Xiaoqi invited you
to Yiguoduan group)

629
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,470
(Hot pot dinner at Chai's milk tea shop
at 8 pm tomorrow. See you there.)

630
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:19,295
Everyone, hot pot dinner
at Chai's milk tea shop,

631
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:22,095
(Fang Lie: Noted)
at 8  pm tomorrow. See you there.

632
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,736
Haven't you always wanted
to meet Chai Xiaoqi?

633
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:33,535
(Fang Leng)
Now you have a chance.

634
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,790
(Tomorrow is an off day but I need
to work, is there a pretty girl?)

635
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,490
(Dr. Zhang)

636
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,575
Coming.

637
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:54,256
Okay.

638
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,256
Do you still have milk tea?

639
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,295
It's you.

640
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:03,976
I just moved to Sunny Apartment's

641
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,256
Building 6.

642
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,416
I live in Building 7.

643
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,896
We will be neighbours from now on.

644
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:09,896
Do you work part-time here?

645
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,256
Yes, I am here with my friends.

646
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,736
I come and help out once in a while.

647
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:15,535
However, our shop is closed now.

648
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,055
I can't give you milk tea.

649
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,176
Hold on a second.

650
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:20,615
Here you go.

651
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:22,055
Thank you.

652
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:26,416
By the way, does your store
deliver food and drinks?

653
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,696
Of course.

654
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:29,216
Hang on.

655
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:30,456
Add me on WeChat.

656
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:33,496
I've sent you a request.

657
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:34,095
Okay.

658
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:36,416
All right, I'll leave first.

659
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,016
Okay.

660
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:37,976
Let's keep in touch via WeChat.

661
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,696
- Bye.
-Bye.

662
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,456
Xiaoqi.

663
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:47,815
That young man

664
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,375
is quite handsome.

665
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:50,736
He's my client.

666
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,216
Is he?

667
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:52,855
Yes.

668
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:55,696
I'm relieved.

669
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,055
I'm telling you.

670
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,575
I'm a die-hard fan of
your relationship with Leng.

671
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,176
If you change your mind halfway,

672
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,815
I'll be the first to disagree.

673
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:03,656
Don't worry, Chai.

674
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:04,775
He's just one of my tasks.

675
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:05,496
I won't.

676
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:08,055
I like your attitude.

677
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,535
You have a clear and simple goal.

678
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:13,055
Xiaoqi,

679
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:14,815
why did you suddenly think

680
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,256
of treating us to hot pot?

681
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,936
It's all because of
that petty Fang Leng.

682
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,216
He's upset that I gave him
too few gifts yesterday.

683
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,615
He ignored me.

684
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:23,295
However, Chai said that

685
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,016
there's nothing that
a hot pot couldn't solve.

686
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,416
If not, then make it two hot pot meals.

687
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:31,055
Who's Long plus Bow [*Zhang, a Chinese
character] in our group?

688
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,496
I did research on
this guy's Moments.

689
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,016
He seems to have opened
a psychiatric clinic of his own.

690
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:39,256
I think he's an honorary
professor at an university.

691
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:40,855
Forget him.

692
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,496
He must be an old doctor.

693
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:43,815
I'm going to get the food.

694
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:45,375
Me, too.

695
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:46,256
Fang Leng.

696
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:49,496
Which one is Xiaoqi?

697
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:11,095
Mulong Yunhai.

698
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:15,216
You're finally back.

699
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:20,936
You still miss me after
all this while, right?

700
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,256
I'm your Chaichai.

701
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:27,855
Chaichai?

702
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,775
- Have you forgotten?
- Chaichai?

703
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,575
Five years ago,

704
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:33,615
you left without saying goodbye.

705
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,256
I haven't heard from you since.

706
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:40,256
Do you have any idea how
I spent the past five years?

707
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:41,295
Miss,

708
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,896
you must be mistaken.

709
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,775
I think this is our first meeting.

710
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:46,855
Chai,

711
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,375
this is Dr. Zhang.

712
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,656
He's a psychiatrist.

713
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:51,896
He just came back from England
after five years of studying abroad.

714
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:54,456
So, I don't think he's the
person you're referring to.

715
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,575
Chai, did you get the wrong person?

716
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:59,456
You look the same.

717
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:01,936
You must be him, unless...

718
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:09,335
My Mulong was bald.

719
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,855
He's been wearing a wig.

720
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,375
However, your hair is real.

721
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:14,335
That's right.

722
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,335
No way.

723
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:17,095
Am I really mistaken?

724
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:20,855
What's going on?

725
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:21,815
I have no idea.

726
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,095
This... I...

727
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:23,896
No.

728
00:31:23,936 --> 00:31:26,216
You must have secretly gone
for a hair transplant, right?

729
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,375
It turns out really good.

730
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,095
My hairline has receded a little lately.

731
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,135
Can you introduce me to your doctor?

732
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:33,135
Miss,

733
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:34,936
I'm really just a psychiatrist.

734
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,256
I don't know how to
do a hair transplant.

735
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,216
You've really got the wrong person.

736
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:42,615
Then show me your right hand.

737
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:46,896
My Mulong

738
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,736
has a mole on his right palm.

739
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:50,815
However, you

740
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,855
don't have one.

741
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,736
It seems I'm really mistaken.

742
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,535
I'm sorry.

743
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:02,535
How embarrassing.

744
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:03,615
I'll check on her.

745
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:04,936
Wait, this...

746
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,095
You asked me to take a look at Xiaoqi.

747
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,775
What's with that lady,

748
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,976
grabbing my hair and saying
I got a hair transplant?

749
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:12,936
No idea.

750
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:17,775
However, Chai Xiaoqi chased her.

751
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:21,575
She looked as if she
had nothing to hide.

752
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,016
She didn't try to avoid
your glance either.

753
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,736
I don't think she's
working for Zhou Siqin.

754
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,580
Fang Leng.

755
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,775
Don't just stand there. Come and sit.

756
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:32,176
Go ahead.

757
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,656
Chai, are you crying?

758
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:39,416
Were you pretending?

759
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,135
Finally, a handsome guy came.

760
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,896
Why would I cry?

761
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:45,775
Of course I have to
make myself beautiful.

762
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:46,936
Let me ask you.

763
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,936
Have I been good to you?

764
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:49,736
Absolutely.

765
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:52,855
So, should you repay me?

766
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:53,575
Yes.

767
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,976
Then, listen up.

768
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,736
Later, when we eat,

769
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:57,456
you must make sure

770
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:58,896
I sit with Dr. Zhang,

771
00:32:58,896 --> 00:32:59,736
got it?

772
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:02,135
Leave it to me.

773
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:08,375
Wait.

774
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,375
I remember that chair is broken.

775
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:11,456
Is it?

776
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,535
Yes, I can't let a guest
sit on a broken chair.

777
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,416
Sit over there, sorry.

778
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,176
The ingredients are here.

779
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,095
Come on.

780
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,055
Take whatever you want to eat.

781
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:24,976
Grab a seat. Come on.

782
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,815
There's garlic and parsley.

783
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:28,656
Fang Lie,

784
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,095
switch seats with me.

785
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:31,615
Why?

786
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:33,295
I think it's fine for me to sit here.

787
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:37,936
I prefer your seat.

788
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,216
Switch with me.

789
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,216
How observant.

790
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,575
Why can't I turn on the switch?

791
00:33:58,575 --> 00:33:59,496
Chai, do you know how to fix this?

792
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:02,295
- Why doesn't this light up?
- I know how to fix it.

793
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:03,775
I'm good at it.

794
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:04,775
Look.

795
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,735
Dear,

796
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:10,816
you forgot to plug in the power.

797
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,016
Look. It's all right.
Just sit over there.

798
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:13,615
I'll sit here.

799
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:14,296
I'll plug it in.

800
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:15,776
I'm going to get the food.

801
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:16,496
All right.

802
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,296
It's cold today,

803
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:20,215
just the right time for hot pot.

804
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:21,856
We must eat well.

805
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:24,816
Eat more meat.

806
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,580
(Be at ease.
If Xiaoqi took money from Zhou Siqin,)

807
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
(she would treat us at an upscale restaurant.)

808
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,615
The food is here.

809
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:34,856
Lobster,

810
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:36,735
abalone and beef.

811
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:41,695
Come on, put the beef there.

812
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,055
Xiaoqi,

813
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,615
did you win the lottery?

814
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:49,135
It's the sky drops pasty simply.

815
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,615
So it's a windfall, right?

816
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,816
Isn't that everyone's dream?

817
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:57,535
I don't simply take advantage of others,

818
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:59,135
but when an opportunity
presented itself,

819
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:00,255
of course I'd take it.

820
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:01,776
Come on, let's eat.

821
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:03,655
I'm going to get a drink.

822
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:06,896
You don't know where
the wine is stored, do you?

823
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,655
I'll help you.

824
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:08,416
No.

825
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,095
Why are you still angry?

826
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:14,296
Well,

827
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:16,416
let me tell you.

828
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:18,776
About the gift, it's
the thought that counts.

829
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:20,296
Look at how cute it is.

830
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,055
There's also this.

831
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,615
This is the card given
to me by Zhou Siqin.

832
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:26,175
There's a total of RMB 100,000 in it.

833
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,416
I bought Xiaobu and Chai

834
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,016
some clothes and electronics,

835
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:31,575
as well as the drinks
and ingredients outside.

836
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,376
There's probably only RMB 50,000 left

837
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,615
for you and the R&D department.

838
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:37,535
I'll put it in your pocket.

839
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,575
Well, why did she give you money?

840
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,816
She has a good eye.

841
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:44,095
She knows that I'm your trusted aide.

842
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:45,776
So she wants me to be her spy.

843
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:48,936
So you're telling me everything?

844
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,135
Of course.

845
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:52,016
I definitely can't trust her, right?

846
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,055
Also,

847
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:55,776
the best way to deal
with sugar-coated shells

848
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,936
is to eat the sugar

849
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,215
and hit the shell back.

850
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:02,615
Xiaoqi,

851
00:36:02,615 --> 00:36:03,816
have you got the wine?

852
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:04,936
I'm coming.

853
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:06,896
I'll bring them the wine.

854
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:31,655
I see.

855
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:34,976
Such a cute little duck.

856
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:37,456
Mr. Fang,

857
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,896
aren't you going to
have hot pot with them?

858
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:41,135
I am about to.

859
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:42,416
By the way,

860
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,215
I want to explain to you

861
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:47,416
about something.

862
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:48,896
Xiaoqi

863
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:50,976
isn't petty.

864
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,255
In fact, yesterday,

865
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,416
she bought us gifts.

866
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:56,976
However, she didn't buy

867
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:58,055
a dress that she really liked.

868
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,255
Nowadays, there aren't many

869
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:01,376
innocent girls like her.

870
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,416
So, please cherish her.

871
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,416
Thanks, Chai.

872
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:19,016
This

873
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:22,175
is the 1982 Lafite that I have
treasured for many years.

874
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,535
I never take it out

875
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,376
for normal occasions.

876
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,215
That's good wine.

877
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:30,896
What a happy day today.

878
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:32,175
Also, we have a new friend.

879
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:33,896
I wish us happiness.

880
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:35,896
Cheers.

881
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,030
(Red wine, alcohol by volume 14%
Human use it to avoid reality)

882
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:47,695
Why aren't you drinking?

883
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,776
(There isn't any
reaction in particular.)

884
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,936
(It appears that alcohol is
ineffective against robots.)

885
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:57,016
It tastes good.

886
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,376
You've eaten eight meatballs.

887
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,055
This is mine.

888
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:05,655
Wait, you ate an entire
plate of shrimp paste.

889
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:06,296
You...

890
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:07,055
Stop arguing.

891
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:08,095
Fang Lie.

892
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:09,336
Thanks, Fang Leng.

893
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:10,575
You've had a lot of food.

894
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:11,416
Don't waste food.

895
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,615
Come on, Xiaoqi, eat more lobster.

896
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:14,496
This is yours.

897
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:15,095
Thanks.

898
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:15,856
Fang Leng.

899
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:17,456
What a quick change of attitude.

900
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,496
I haven't eaten fresh seafood
since I returned to China.

901
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:20,936
Don't eat so much.

902
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:25,655
Eat.

903
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:28,776
Anyway, the money for
seafood is from your mother...

904
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:35,695
It's what you can earn right away.

905
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,695
As long as you become a great painter,

906
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,456
you can buy as much as you want.

907
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:41,135
It makes sense.

908
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:47,135
Here.

909
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:51,055
Sister,

910
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:54,336
this is Chai Xiaoqi's recent

911
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,095
expenditure record.

912
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:56,776
Yesterday,

913
00:38:56,776 --> 00:38:58,655
she went to SKB to shop for clothes.

914
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:00,976
In the afternoon, she went
to the seafood market

915
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:01,496
and bought...

916
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:02,615
Lobster and abalone.

917
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,976
Sister, how did you know?

918
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,215
Chai Xiaoqi is unbelievable.

919
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,575
I asked her to report
Fang Leng's every move to me.

920
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:10,535
Look at

921
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:11,575
what she said to me.

922
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,210
Report, Madam Zhou,
Fang Leng ate hot pot at 8.30 pm.

923
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,856
He had some vegetables and pig brain.

924
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,135
He doesn't like seafood.

925
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:19,976
Tell me.

926
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:21,856
Is she a fool?

927
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:23,655
It can't be.

928
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:26,135
The first time I spoke to her,

929
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,175
I was cheated of RMB 1,000.

930
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:30,336
It's probably her first time
being an undercover.

931
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,296
So she's not familiar with her job.

932
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:34,215
RMB 100,000 is almost gone.

933
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,376
All I know is that Fang Leng loves
dipping sauces in sesame oil.

934
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:43,856
Haven't you thrown it away yet?

935
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:45,255
How childish.

936
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,296
It's cute.

937
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,575
Nice.

938
00:39:58,695 --> 00:39:59,776
So,

939
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:01,976
you sent her this information?

940
00:40:02,896 --> 00:40:03,936
I took her money after all.

941
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,175
At least I got to do something.

942
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:06,936
I'm a trustworthy person, you know?

943
00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:09,135
Xiaoqi,

944
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:10,456
give me a hand.

945
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:11,135
Okay.

946
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:12,735
I'm going to help her.

947
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,376
How did the observation go?

948
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,535
Well, I think Xiaoqi

949
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:26,816
doesn't even seem like a human.

950
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:27,976
What?

951
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:31,535
Humans are the most complex beings.

952
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,655
However, look at her.

953
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,016
Xiaoqi is so naive.

954
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,575
You can't tell if she has any desire

955
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:37,896
or selfishness at all.

956
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,695
She simply loves you.

957
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:44,175
However, she still took
money from Zhou Siqin.

958
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:44,856
Yes.

959
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:46,776
She took the money

960
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,255
and put the headband on you next.

961
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,255
I saw it.

962
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:51,776
Don't worry.

963
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,456
Chai told me just now.

964
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:55,456
Xiaoqi has liked you for a long time.

965
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:56,896
If it wasn't because

966
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:57,976
of your poker face,

967
00:40:57,976 --> 00:40:58,816
the progress between you two

968
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:00,336
shouldn't have been this slow.

969
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:02,575
When it comes to love,

970
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,615
the worst fear is not indecision,

971
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:07,655
but one not knowing how he or she feels.

972
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,856
Your friends and wingmen

973
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:12,496
can help you to solve your indecision.

974
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,296
As for

975
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:15,856
whether you like her or not,

976
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:23,936
only you know.

977
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,336
Thanks.

978
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:27,735
I'll get going.

979
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,175
Are you all right, Xiaobu? You...

980
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,150
(Failed to process alcohol)

981
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,280
(Entering drunk mode)

982
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:55,496
Hurry, come on.

983
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:56,575
Walk straight.

984
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,016
Walk straight.

985
00:41:58,856 --> 00:41:59,856
Walk straight, Xiaobu.

986
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,496
Let's drink more.

987
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:03,976
Put the drink...

988
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,456
Go ahead. It's up to you.

989
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:09,615
Xiaoqi,

990
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:12,215
you helped me to deal with Zhou Siqin.

991
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,416
In return,

992
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:14,776
I'll take you to a mall.

993
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:15,615
Sure.

994
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,095
However, aren't the malls closed

995
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,496
