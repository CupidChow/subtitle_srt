00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,140
(The host is awesome.)
(So brave!)

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,030
(So great!)
Here we go. Can you see me?

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,360
Xiaoqi!

22
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,480
My foot cramps.

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Are you cold?

24
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,230
My foot cramps.

25
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,390
Don't move.

26
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,600
No.

27
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,670
Don't push yourself too hard.

28
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,440
What if something happens to you?

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,670
I'm fine. See?

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,600
Wait.

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Hold on.

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,920
That's enough, Xiaoqi.

33
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,670
(Is that Mr. Fang in rescue?)
Look.

34
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,280
(I was frightened, but I'm fine.)
I've been in the water for so long,

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,660
(Why are you working so hard?)
I've been in the water for so long,

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,600
but my makeup hasn't worn off. See?

37
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,950
It still stays.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,270
The mascara and brow pencil

39
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,390
didn't come off.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,830
This proves that
Future Group's cosmetics

41
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,880
are of good quality.

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,390
So please support us.

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
Next up is the gym.

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,830
See you in a bit.

45
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,320
Bye.

46
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Take a break.

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,200
You can continue another day.

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
That won't do.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,160
We can't let all our effort go to waste.

50
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,670
If we give up now,

51
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,760
they won't trust

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
our products anymore.

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,160
Anyway, what brings you here?

54
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,790
Did you watch my live stream?

55
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,760
I am your boss.

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,920
It is normal to follow up
on your work progress.

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,510
Dry up yourself.

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,440
Leave it to me.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,790
What are you doing?

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm fine.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,100
(Please take care!)
(Why are you working so hard?)

62
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,560
Take a break.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,950
If I stop now,

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
the viewers will start flaming again.

65
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,680
I can do this.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes, I can.

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,760
I'll continue.

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,680
I'll accompany you.

69
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,560
We will do it together.

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,900
(That jump was great!)
(Let's do it together!)

71
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,000
One.

72
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,590
One.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,320
Keep going.

74
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,150
You can do it, Xiaoqi! Come on!

75
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,830
Slowly.

76
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,760
Hang in there.

77
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,560
Why is this so tiring?

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
- Get up.
- Slow down.

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,950
No need to pull so hard.

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
Why don't you do it, too?

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080
Don't just talk the talk.

82
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,140
♪Who hides in my heart?♪

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,240
Look. I ship them.

84
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
- They are so sweet together.
- Goodness.

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,350
This couple is worth following.

86
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,200
- This is so romantic.
- You're right.

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,950
Look at them.

88
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,640
Seriously, they should

89
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
just get married.

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,830
Mr. Fang is not around.

91
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
So you're just lazing around?

92
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,320
Let's go.

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,270
Every couple has a matchmaker

94
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,390
who helps them in silence.

95
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh, no.

96
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,760
He won't think I'm doing this
on purpose, will he?

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
You have such poor balance.

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,510
Don't do live streaming
in the gym anymore.

99
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,300
(My favourite couple! Buying now!)
(So cool! Help!)

100
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,270
(I'm going to the civil affairs bureau.)
It's almost time.

101
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,830
I've been exercising for so long,

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
but look how well

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
(Mr. Fang, go live.)
my makeup looks despite all the sweat.

104
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,800
(Is there another live, Mr. Fang? I want to watch.)
It looks perfect, doesn't it?

105
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,320
Future Group's cosmetics are the best!

106
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,080
She's right.

107
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
(Due to this, I'm buying the cosmetics.)
We have recently received

108
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,950
a lot of bad reviews on the Internet.

109
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,800
Here, I would like to

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,390
thank you for your continued trust

111
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
and support during this period.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
In the future, we will
definitely develop

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,560
better products to repay you.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
That's all for today's live stream.

115
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,710
Thank you for watching.

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,020
(Mr. Fang's smile is nice.)
(I got my favourite novel's male lead.)

117
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,910
Why is everyone
complimenting your good looks?

118
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,470
No one cares about my makeup.

119
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,000
Why?

120
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,460
(What a match in heaven.)
(Mr. Fang's smiling at me.)

121
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,270
(So handsome.)
Because our cosmetics are good.

122
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,270
Look.

123
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,080
The foundation didn't come off at all.

124
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,940
(Don't end this.)
(I need more, don't end this.)

125
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,640
Bye.

126
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,470
(Future Group's cosmetics have been widely praised.)
Count yourself lucky this time.

127
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,160
How was it?

128
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,710
Did I perform well this time?

129
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,400
Can I continue to stay in the company?

130
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,440
Listen.

131
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,280
What are you doing?

132
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,800
You are

133
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,400
too reckless and relentless.

134
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,230
You are pushing yourself too hard.

135
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,470
- Also...
- Fine.

136
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,110
Gosh.

137
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,800
If you don't want me to stay, fine.

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
I'll just do delivery again.

139
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,320
Did I say I would fire you?

140
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,710
Wasn't that your intention

141
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,990
when you said I had so many flaws?

142
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,080
Go back and have a good rest.

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,590
Don't be late for work
tomorrow morning.

144
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,750
Seriously?

145
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
Oh, my!

146
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,470
Why are you so nice?

147
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,800
You're too kind, Fang Leng.

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,710
You are the best boss in the world.

149
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,800
The best boss!

150
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,680
Are you serious?

151
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,590
Why are you so nice?

152
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,080
Can you perform better?

153
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,590
Sure, no problem.

154
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,080
Well done for today.

155
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,630
I'll buy you dinner.

156
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,470
Are you serious?

157
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,350
Fang Leng.

158
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,040
Mwah.

159
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,080
What is that?

160
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,920
Thank you.

161
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,620
(Sunny Apartment)

162
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Their Australian lobster is delicious.

163
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,710
The foie gras and caviar
are also delicious.

164
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,110
I wonder when I'll
get to eat them again.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,990
This time, treat it as
a reward from the company.

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,630
You've saved the company
from a bad review crisis.

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,710
If only the company had more crises.

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,800
What are you doing?

169
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,950
I'm sure you are bored at home alone.

170
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,440
So I'll be happy to keep you company.

171
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,990
Actually, there's no one
at my home either.

172
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,870
We can hang out

173
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,110
and chat.

174
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,710
Please let me in.

175
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll leave as soon as Xiaobu returns.

176
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,280
Thank you.

177
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,440
No.

178
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,560
- Don't worry.
- Thanks for sending me home.

179
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,520
You're welcome.

180
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,990
You know what?

181
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,320
Actually, my brother also lives here.

182
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,950
But don't be surprised.

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,990
He's a workaholic.

184
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,470
He has to work late every day.

185
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,560
You won't bump into him.

186
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,800
By the way,

187
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,560
let's go to the science
museum again next week.

188
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,040
After repairing the computer,

189
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,110
let's have dinner together.

190
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,950
I will ask my brother
for pocket money in advance.

191
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,520
Brother, I'm in pain.
I've broken my leg.

192
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
I urgently need money.

193
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,520
Done.

194
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,160
Shall I transfer the money to you now?

195
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,080
Fang Lie.

196
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes.

197
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,160
So, when are you
going to break your leg?

198
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm sorry, brother.

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,630
What's your fault?

200
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,470
I shouldn't have lied to you.

201
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,040
I shouldn't have been in
a relationship without your knowledge

202
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,470
and had you found out.

203
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,230
No, I mean,

204
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,320
I should have told you the truth.

205
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,710
No wonder you've been
spending so much money lately.

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,920
Lift it properly.

207
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,750
You should understand

208
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,080
that I helped you because
I supported your dream,

209
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
not because I wanted you to be idle

210
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,280
and waste your time.

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
What are you talking about?

212
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,870
Why is it a waste of time

213
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,280
to be with Xiaobu?

214
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,920
Maybe the two of them

215
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,710
are mutually in love.

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,440
Exactly.

217
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,830
Well said.

218
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,440
She has sharp eyes.

219
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,200
They can understand me so well,

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
why can't you?

221
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,400
By the way, may I know who you are?

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,110
I'm Xiaobu's friend, Xiaoqi.

223
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,990
Brother.

224
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,800
You denied it before at the spa hotel

225
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,710
How could you find me
a future sister-in-law

226
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,160
without my permission?

227
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,830
No wonder you didn't

228
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,830
answer my calls recently.

229
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,710
Don't speak nonsense.

230
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm not in that kind
of relationship with her.

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,920
Who says so?

232
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,680
Xiaoqi works for Future group

233
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,920
and helped you dispel
rumours on the live stream.

234
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,160
If you are not in a relationship,

235
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
would she help you that much?

236
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,950
Brother.

237
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,200
At least I am a responsible man.

238
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,830
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

239
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,280
You really disappoint me.

240
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,800
- I have to go back to my painting.
- Stop right there.

241
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,630
Do you think sadfishing
will work for me?

242
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,470
Xiaoqi, you and Xiaobu are friends.

243
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,990
Help me convince him.

244
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,750
Why don't you talk nicely?

245
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,440
Wait.

246
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
Something is off.

247
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,230
Tell me, Xiaobu.

248
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,280
How come you never told me

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,830
that you and my future
sister-in-law are good friends?

250
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,630
That's right.

251
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,590
Xiaoqi.

252
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,470
You never told me about this either.

253
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,590
Why didn't I tell you?

254
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,110
It's because

255
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I wanted you to guess.

256
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,230
You are smart enough to guess.

257
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,280
She's right.

258
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,230
Could it be that...

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
you forgot to tell me?

260
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,990
Clever.

261
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
You are so smart.

262
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,080
You forgot to tell me, right?

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,080
That's right.

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,920
Xiaoqi, you are too forgetful.

265
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,950
- Yes.
- Gosh.

266
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,560
My bad.

267
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,400
It's okay.

268
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,680
We are fated.

269
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
Let's turn the page.

270
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
Once you marry my brother,

271
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,990
we'll be a family. Am I right, brother?

272
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm not done with you yet.

273
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,470
Brother.

274
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,110
Let's go.

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
Take care.

276
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,590
Well done.

277
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,470
Well done to you, too.

278
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,750
That's why, brother,

279
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,750
love is a sentiment for artists.

280
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,400
No.

281
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,280
The best source of inspiration.

282
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,470
It may seem like I'm
wasting my time in relationships,

283
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,470
but I'm actually trying to be creative.

284
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,920
Van Gogh, Monet and Gauguin

285
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
all died of love.

286
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Brother, can you stop

287
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,590
being so negative?

288
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,800
You are too much.

289
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,950
Xiaobu also teaches me to draw.

290
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,350
Brother.

291
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,230
Can you stop pulling that long face?

292
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,590
Smile. Come on.

293
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Whatever.

294
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,710
You can date all you want,

295
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,710
but don't ever lie to me again.

296
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,920
Don't worry, brother.

297
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,400
You have my words.

298
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,520
I promise to only lie to
mother from now on.

299
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,830
By the way, brother,

300
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,520
I watched the live stream.

301
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,950
How's the company?

302
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,400
Who exactly is behind this?

303
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,350
Probably a rival.

304
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,830
Focus on your drawing.

305
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,110
It's none of your business.

306
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,440
You are the best brother.

307
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,470
I'm driving.

308
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,320
Red light!

309
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,160
Let me hug you.

310
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,800
Go and hug Xiaobu.

311
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,520
Come on.

312
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,590
Don't fool around.

313
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,320
I haven't gone that far with her.

314
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,800
Great.

315
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm sure they won't find out

316
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,960
that you are having
a relationship with Fang Lie

317
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,830
so that I can approach Fang Leng.

318
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,430
I think so, too.

319
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,520
Our excuse just now was...

320
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,110
impeccable!

321
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,430
By the way, Xiaoqi,

322
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,910
Many viewers ship you two together.

323
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,000
You guys are a hot topic
in various social media.

324
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,870
Has his attitude
towards you changed?

325
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,240
He always gives me the cold shoulder...

326
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,670
and wants me to stay away from him.

327
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,430
Although I work
by his side every day,

328
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,150
I can't get close to him.

329
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,630
But you helped him with

330
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,830
such a serious issue today.

331
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,390
He will certainly soon find out

332
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,190
that you are a reliable person.

333
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,910
Asking you to do odd jobs

334
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,630
is a big waste of talent.

335
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,520
Is that so?

336
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,670
And tomorrow,

337
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,240
he might give you
a promotion and a pay rise.

338
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,240
Then you can get close to him
and complete the mission.

339
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
Really?

340
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,190
I can be his personal bodyguard

341
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,390
or secretary 24/7.

342
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,560
Mr. Fang.

343
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,520
Do you have something to tell me?

344
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,870
Collate and analyse

345
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,040
all the negative reviews
on the Internet.

346
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,870
Submit the report to
Assistant Han within two days.

347
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,800
Hasn't that been dealt with already?

348
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
Indeed, the malicious rumours

349
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,430
have been resolved.

350
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,190
Still, we can't ignore
the honest reviews

351
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,830
of consumers to our products.

352
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,760
Only by learning this lesson

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,630
can we improve
the competencies of our products.

354
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,870
Are you sure you don't have

355
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,870
anything else to say to me?

356
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,760
Stay focused.

357
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,670
Don't laze around on your desk.

358
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,500
(The item is not matching
with the image.)

359
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,670
(Not too good, like a small kid.)
What's all this?

360
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,280
Efficiency is all about teamwork.

361
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,150
And team

362
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,960
is all about friendship.

363
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,280
I caught you sleeping at work.

364
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,960
Ms. Chai.

365
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,390
I feel like I'm going to be fired.

366
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,830
Did your boss get fed up with your flattery?

367
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,190
No.

368
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,660
(Project information)

369
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,240
(Project information)
Look at this company.

370
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,430
(Project information)
It was founded this year,

371
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,800
but it has reached the top
in just a few months.

372
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,040
They come out strong

373
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,560
and intimidating.

374
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,590
I feel like

375
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,800
a tortured slave

376
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,190
coordinating with this company.

377
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,240
If I fail this time,

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
Mr. Fang will hate me.

379
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,430
Don't be sad. It's all right.

380
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,080
Think about it.

381
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,150
The general company temperament

382
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,190
is certainly ordinary.

383
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,430
But when it comes to
a top company in the industry,

384
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,350
of course they need to

385
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,760
show their superiority.

386
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,350
Cheer up.

387
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Sit up straight.

388
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,480
I want to ask you some questions.

389
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Don't be sad.

390
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,760
Ms. Chai.

391
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,590
Do you think

392
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,960
we're friends?

393
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,190
We are

394
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,910
brothers.

395
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,910
That's even better!

396
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,910
If Mr. Fang fires me,

397
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,240
you have to put in a good word for me.

398
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,430
Did you say you had questions for me?

399
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,390
Don't worry.

400
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,000
If you have any problems at work,

401
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm here to help you.

402
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,630
Hold on.

403
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,150
Xiaoqi, I'll get going.

404
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

405
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,910
Are you still working?

406
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
Yes, I have too much to do.

407
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,350
So I'll stay.

408
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,590
You can leave first.

409
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,590
Don't wait for me.

410
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,870
I don't need a ride either. Thanks.

411
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,430
Bye.

412
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,150
I just want to root for you.

413
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,560
I can do this!

414
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,630
She's hardworking.

415
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,080
Not bad.

416
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,590
Mr. Fang.

417
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,480
What are you looking at?

418
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,110
The glass is dusty.

419
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,520
Ask the cleaning lady
to clean it tomorrow.

420
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,110
The cleaning lady cleans it every day.

421
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,040
No dust at all.

422
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,040
That's all from me.

423
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,320
Do you have any comments?

424
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,390
Yes.

425
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,590
Hold on.

426
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,800
Ms. Chai.

427
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,150
I compared the cosmetics

428
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,040
(The top five global brands)
of Future Group

429
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,350
with these top international brands.

430
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,480
I have found that
the reason they continue to

431
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,720
hold a place in the hearts of consumers

432
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,150
is because they have developed
exclusive brand products

433
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,910
thanks to their high-tech technology.

434
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,480
Now, take a look at this.

435
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,110
(CBB, moist and long-lasting makeup)
This CBB foundation, for example,

436
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,000
contains the herbal ingredient in it.

437
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,630
It's easy to apply, nourishes the skin

438
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,240
and is suitable for all skin types.

439
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,390
(Brand new luxurious silky formula)
And this Jiaohong's lipstick.

440
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,800
(Contains royal jelly and mango)
It contains royal jelly

441
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,110
and mango in it.

442
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,350
It is also very nourishing.

443
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,830
(Smooth and long-lasting)
And this loose powder of Givendon

444
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,150
(Fine powder and oil control)
consist of oil control

445
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,000
(Anti-blue light and slow down oxidation)
and sunscreen ingredients.

446
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,670
So I think

447
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,350
if we could invent

448
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,800
such an innovative product,

449
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
it would be a sensation

450
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,000
in the beauty industry, too.

451
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,590
That's all from me.

452
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,870
Ms. Chai.

453
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,830
Mr. Fang asked for

454
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,390
the managers' opinions,

455
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,350
not yours.

456
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,110
My bad.

458
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,430
To be honest,

459
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,870
I have thought about this.

460
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,000
Our company is constantly

461
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,910
coming up with new products

462
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,280
and surprises for customers.

463
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,040
But like she said,

464
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,080
we are indeed lacking a classic

465
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,110
signature product.

466
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,110
However, with the current
level of our technology,

467
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,320
it's still difficult to achieve
technological innovation.

468
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,390
He's right.

469
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,520
Other brands have
their own research departments.

470
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,910
They can keep the core
technology of their production

471
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,080
in their own hands.

472
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,520
So I hope that our company can now

473
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,320
set up a research department
of its own immediately.

474
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,000
Future production plans

475
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,390
and all research

476
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,630
will be handled by
the Research Department.

477
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,670
My dear Xiaobu.

478
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,150
In order to help me with my mission,

479
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,280
you've gone from being
a highly intelligent AI secretary

480
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,390
to an art teacher.

481
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,630
Thanks a lot.

482
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,390
Don't mention it, Xiaoqi.

483
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,800
It is you who worked so hard

484
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,150
to collect hormones
and get close to Fang Leng.

485
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,910
You've had tough times.

486
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

487
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,110
Good thing we'll be getting

488
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,520
hormone element soon.

489
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,320
Then we don't need it anymore.

490
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,240
Tomorrow,

491
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,870
throw your resignation
letter at Fang Leng.

492
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,430
Before that, I want to do something.

493
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,280
What is it?

494
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,870
I'm tired

495
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,150
of reading these books.

496
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,150
(How to Control the Domineering President Part Three)
They are ridiculous.

497
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,590
(The Domineering President's Favourite)
The CEO characters are either

498
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,960
cold-hearted

499
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,240
or psychos.

500
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
The rich families are either
fighting for the fortune

501
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,830
or fighting over lovers.

502
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,590
How nice it is now.

503
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,760
Sitting in the office

504
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,350
waiting for his hormones.

505
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,910
Once it is invented,

506
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,630
we can finally go home.

507
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,830
Say,

508
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,080
it takes a year to do research

509
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
on the hormone element.

510
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,240
Will there be any
changes within this period?

511
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,910
He is the president.

512
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,910
He has decided to
set up a research department.

513
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,870
What is there to worry about?

514
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,870
You're right.

515
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,240
Sister, don't worry.

516
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,670
He can't do anything without

517
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,910
the support of the board.

518
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,040
Apart from you, there's also

519
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,350
Mr. Zhou in the board, right?

520
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,080
The day after tomorrow
is the group's annual meeting.

521
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,760
if Fang Leng manages
to convince Mr. Zhou

522
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,320
and announce his decision
at the cocktail party,

523
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,630
then his position will be secure.

524
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
No way.

525
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,830
Mr. Zhou is

526
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,870
a very conservative person.

527
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,720
He has long despised the way Fang Leng

528
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,040
has spent so much
effort on the beauty line.

529
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,350
This time we don't even have to act.

530
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,390
We'll just wait and see
for the big show.

531
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,540
(Mr. Zhou's assistant, a flatterer)

532
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,820
(Hi, Han, Mr. Zhou is not able
to make it today, sorry.)

533
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,560
Mr. Zhou's assistant said

534
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,320
Mr. Zhou is not coming again

535
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,720
due to an urgent matter.

536
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
If he didn't want to come,
he could have just said so,

537
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,150
instead of using the same excuse.

538
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,520
It was exactly the same every time.

539
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,430
He's so disingenuous.

540
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,000
Is Mr. Zhou going to

541
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,630
the cocktail party tomorrow?

542
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,280
That's for sure.

543
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,800
His assistant, Ma,

544
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,150
posted on his feed three days ago,

545
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,760
(Mr. Zhou's assistant, a flatterer)
saying that he is looking forward

546
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,350
(Looking forward to attending the party with boss.)
to attending the party with his boss

547
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,080
and feels like on cloud nine.

548
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,630
I hate this kind of flatterer.

549
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,080
Then I'll meet him
at the party tomorrow.

550
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,280
There will be many young
entrepreneurs at the party tomorrow.

551
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Entrepreneurs like high-value women.

552
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,350
Xiaoqi.

553
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,960
Will Mr. Fang take you

554
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,350
to the party tomorrow?

555
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,240
Isn't it time for you two to
make an official announcement?

556
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
What party?

557
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,190
Don't you know?

558
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,910
It seems that Mr. Fang
wants to surprise you.

559
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,280
What are you talking about?

560
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,590
Hasn't he exploited me enough?

561
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,280
How can he possibly
let me go to a party?

562
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
No way.

563
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,110
Sweet and cruel romance,

564
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,000
with a lot of thrills and excitement!

565
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,390
You're new to the company.
Don't get into

566
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,350
- the gossiping culture.
- Mr. Fang.

567
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,520
Are you guys so free?

568
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,670
Study this information.

569
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,760
You will coordinate the tasks.

570
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,830
You are such

571
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,110
a bad boss.

572
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,800
Xiaoqi.

573
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,280
Didn't you say you'd just be

574
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
a perfunctory staff?

575
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,960
But you're too diligent now.

576
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,630
You don't know him.

577
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,830
He thinks it's a crime
for staff to take a break.

578
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,760
He wouldn't even let me go

579
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,080
to a cocktail party.

580
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,350
He's so mean.

581
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,190
Exactly.

582
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,430
When did you buy this?

583
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
- I didn't.
- It's so pretty.

584
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,670
There are also heels here.

585
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,150
See you downstairs

586
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,350
tomorrow night at 8pm.

587
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,720
Who said he wouldn't
let you go to the party?

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,350
He's even got your dress ready.

589
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,480
No way.

590
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,520
See you downstairs
tomorrow night at 8pm.

591
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
Fang Leng is so thoughtful.

592
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,320
I bet

593
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,520
he wants me to be
a waiter at the party.

594
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,000
He even prepared

595
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,150
my uniform.

596
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,430
I can't believe you, Fang Leng.

597
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,190
Oh, my god!

598
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,910
Isn't this

599
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,910
the latest gown that's been displayed

600
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,720
at Jubilee House?

601
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,080
Oh, my god.

602
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,430
Isn't this their
limited edition crystal heels?

603
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,350
I've been dreaming of having it.

604
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,240
Did Mr. Fang give you these?

605
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,870
I didn't expect that

606
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,830
would spend so much
effort to chase a girl.

607
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
Could he have misplaced it?

608
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,670
If I get the wrong idea

609
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
and wear this to the party,

610
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,800
won't I look silly?

611
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm so tired anyway.

612
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,110
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

613
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,830
Chai.

614
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,720
If you like it, you can have it.

615
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,040
It's okay.

616
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,080
That won't do.

617
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,520
I am a person of principle.

618
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,960
This is Mr. Fang's gift to you.

619
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,080
I can't take it.

620
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,000
Unless

621
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,630
I look particularly good in it.

622
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,350
Shall I try it?

623
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,240
Xiaoqi.

624
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,800
Will there be lots
of delights at the party?

625
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,590
Mr. Fang.

626
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,280
Ms. Chai has helped our company

627
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,800
to solve such a big crisis,

628
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,150
but you haven't
expressed your gratitude.

629
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,520
And you invited her to a party

630
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,800
by just handing a note.

631
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,390
If it were me,

632
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,720
I wouldn't go either.

633
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,150
So what do you think

634
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,430
I should have done?

635
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,480
You should have

636
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,000
shown your enthusiasm

637
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,320
and charisma. For example...

638
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,800
Xiaoqi.

639
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
May I have the honour

640
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,150
to be my date at the party?

641
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,630
You make eye contact,

642
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,350
draw near to her

643
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,320
and show your affection.

644
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,150
Although falling is a bit of a cliché,

645
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,190
they still look good together.

646
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,080
I starved all day

647
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,480
so that I can fit this dress.

648
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,110
Do I look good?

649
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,150
You are...

650
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,390
stepping on me.

651
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,870
I'm sorry.

652
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,830
I can't really wear high heels.

653
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,190
I sprained my ankle three times.

654
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,430
I can't walk properly.

655
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,040
Sorry.

656
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,190
Pretty, indeed.

657
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,040
Really?

658
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,040
I mean the dress.

659
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,400
Mr. Fang's expression is too vague.

660
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,310
Never mind, I'll assist.

661
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,880
Mr. Fang.

662
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,230
Do you have anything to tell Ms. Chai?

663
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,310
I have an important meeting tonight.

664
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,560
So behave yourself. Don't cause trouble.

665
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,590
Why did you ask me to be your date

666
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,110
if you were afraid I'd cause trouble?

667
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,040
You're not

668
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,920
trying to get back
together with me, are you?

669
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
No way.

670
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,560
You'll see when the time comes.

671
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,940
(Appreciation cocktail  party)

672
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,000
Hello, Mr. Fang.

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
It's been a while.

674
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,790
Are you okay?

675
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,270
I'm fine.

676
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,560
Hello.

677
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,750
- Hello.
- See you inside.

678
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,400
Mr. Fang.

679
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,960
I've been enjoying it recently.

680
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,480
There are so many delicious cupcakes.

681
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,480
It's worthwhile to starve all day.

682
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,710
Mr. Fang.

683
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,880
Don't you have
a date again this evening?

684
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,190
That's okay.

685
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,520
There are so many
prestigious ladies here anyway.

686
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,520
Indeed.

687
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,750
So many candidates.

688
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,630
- Cheers.
- It's my turn.

689
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,630
- I...
- What took you so long

690
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,150
to get a drink?

691
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,150
Hi.

692
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,150
Are you looking for a date?

693
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,150
There seem to be quite
a few gentlemen over there.

694
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,520
Leave Mr. Fang be.

695
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,190
Thanks.

696
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,110
Bye.

697
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,880
How's that?

698
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,520
You take me out for a fancy meal

699
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,710
and I'll be your shield. Not bad, right?

700
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,080
- Hello, Mr. Zhou.
- Long time no see.

701
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,750
haven't seen you for a long time

702
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,590
- Long time no see.
- Yes.

703
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,630
Go ahead

704
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,960
and enjoy the food.

705
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,960
Okay.

706
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,110
Mr. Zhou.

707
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,960
It's not easy to meet you.

708
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,750
Mr. Fang.

709
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,000
You are so persistent.

710
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,000
What is it?

711
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,440
Is it about the research department?

712
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,440
You have been refusing to see me.

713
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
So I assume

714
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,400
you are against it, right?

715
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,080
The company already
spends a lot of money

716
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,230
on its make
up line every year.

717
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,560
Setting up a research department

718
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,400
is a burden.

719
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,080
I know you're still young

720
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,630
and want to get your footing quickly,

721
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,080
but you can't be too hasty.

722
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,560
We're usually busy.

723
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,270
So let's enjoy this party

724
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,190
and don't bring up work.

725
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,110
I'm sorry.

726
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,670
What's the matter with you?

727
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,670
Are you blind?

728
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,110
I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

729
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,920
Pay?

730
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,480
These heels were
my birthday present to Mengfei.

731
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,920
Only two pairs are available nationwide.

732
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,400
Can you afford to pay for it?

733
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,000
Enough, Nana. She didn't mean it either.

734
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,840
- I'm really sorry.
- Mengfei.

736
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,960
Why are you so kind?

737
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,190
Someone like her

738
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,440
shouldn't be here.

739
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,360
Where's your manager?

740
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
Get your manager here.

741
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,670
Enough.

742
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,000
- Don't worry. Get back to your work.
- Mengfei.

743
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,190
Some people appear to be very quiet,

744
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,310
but actually have a harsh-tongue.

745
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,110
Who are you?

746
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Mind your own business.

747
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,790
I'm not talking to you.

748
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,190
Why do you get offended?

749
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,150
You're so brazen.

750
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,710
Aren't you afraid people will know

751
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,270
you're wearing a pair of fakes?

752
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,960
What are you talking about?

753
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,750
How could Mr. Fang
give me counterfeit heels?

754
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,750
Did you say

755
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,960
Fang Leng gave these to you?

756
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,230
What's your relationship

757
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,520
with Mr. Fang?

758
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,040
I am his assist...

759
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,400
I mean a colleague

760
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,710
next to his assistant.

761
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,880
You are just a lowly employee.

762
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,590
Why don't you take a look in the mirror?

763
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,440
Don't be delusional.

764
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,670
I suppose you've

765
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,560
- Stop it.
- rented this dress, right?

766
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
Don't act so delicate.

767
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,190
I didn't even touch you.

768
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,230
Why are you hiccupping?

769
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,670
Calm down.

770
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
Maybe it's because
she spoke too harshly.

771
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,920
Thank you.

772
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,000
Have we met before?

773
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,790
You are mistaken.

774
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,560
Am I?

775
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,630
Hey.

776
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,270
- I'm talking to you.
- Nana.

777
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,360
That's a very old-fashioned way

778
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,520
to seduce a man.

779
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,150
Enough, Nana. Stop it.

780
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm sorry, miss.

781
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,920
She's just a bit impetuous.

782
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,110
She doesn't mean any harm.

783
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,230
I hope you don't take it personally.

784
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,920
Okay.

785
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,840
Ms. Chen.

786
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,880
Please get ready to go on stage.

787
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,590
Okay, let's go.

788
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,670
Come on.

789
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,590
- Just you wait!
- Let's go.

790
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,630
- Come on.
- I'll teach you a lesson!

791
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,750
Bring it on.

792
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,310
I was being nice to you

793
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,960
for the sake of interstellar peace.

794
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,710
Do you think I'm weak?

795
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Did Mr. Zhou agree?

796
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,790
Where is my earring?

797
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,230
Next, let's welcome
Mr. Zhou to the stage.

798
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,360
Thank you for sparing the time

799
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,670
(Appreciation cocktail party)
to attend this anniversary party.

800
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,040
The company

801
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,960
has recently launched
a series of quality products

802
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,750
and achieved significant returns.

803
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,960
This is due in no small part

804
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,080
to the efforts and support

805
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,040
of all of you here.

806
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,230
Every year,

807
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,840
our make-up line will introduce

808
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,080
a new spokesperson.

809
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,150
Next, I am pleased to introduce

810
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,400
my niece, Ms. Chen Mengfei,

811
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,920
to be the new spokesperson.

812
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,590
I am honoured to be
given this opportunity.

813
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,840
I'd like to thank the directors
for their confidence in me.

814
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
I will live up to your expectations.

815
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,360
What's the matter, Xiaoqi?

816
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,150
Remember that

817
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,440
you told me not to cause any trouble?

818
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,520
So?

819
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,790
I seem to have made a mess.

820
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,000
If I accidentally offend

821
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,040
Mr. Zhou's niece,

822
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,270
will he still agree to give you a grant?

823
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,190
We meet again.

824
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,590
Mr. Fang.

825
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,790
I think I need to clarify this with you.

826
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,110
Your staff has gone too far.

827
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,080
I was just asking for an apology

828
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,150
from a waitress,

829
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,150
but she threatened me in your name.

830
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,440
I... What?

831
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,150
She's just blabbering. Ignore her.

832
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,750
She's just a lowly employee

833
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,440
who doesn't know her place.

834
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,670
She also said that
this pair of knock-offs

835
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,960
was a gift from you.

836
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,520
Now you're embarrassed, aren't you?

837
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,750
Xiaoqi.

838
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,750
She said the heels
your boss bought for you

839
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
were knock-offs.

840
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,150
This statement

841
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,110
will probably tarnish
our company's reputation.

842
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,310
Shouldn't you, as an employee,

843
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,920
explain yourself?

844
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,230
Were the heels really from you?

845
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,520
Also,

846
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,630
I will deal with

847
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
our employees myself.

848
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,710
It's not a matter of outsiders.

849
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,040
Mengfei.

850
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,750
Listen.

851
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
Fang Leng really

852
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,670
gave her those heels.

853
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,310
Say something.

854
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,630
I know.

855
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,880
I'm so pissed.

856
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,670
What kind of drama is this?

857
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,710
"Take a look in the mirror.

858
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,150
You are just a lowly employee."

859
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,360
Can't she show
any respect for the employees?

860
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,920
Slow down. Don't sprain your ankle.

861
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,150
I won't sprain...

862
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,000
I warned you.

863
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,880
- Are you okay?
- Even my feet are bullying me.

864
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,880
You're usually good at talking back.

865
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,310
Why didn't you say a word earlier?

866
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,080
I am afraid of offending people.

867
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,790
If I offend Chen Mengfei

868
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,190
and make Mr. Zhou unhappy,

869
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,400
what if he doesn't agree
to set up the research department?

870
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,360
I didn't cause you
any trouble today, did I?

871
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,790
You've always been a pain for me.

872
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,590
I'm used to it.

873
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,110
Anyway, thank you for
speaking up for me.

874
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,520
No problem.

875
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,440
Before hitting a dog,
find out who's its master first.

876
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,630
What does that mean?

877
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,710
Well, they didn't hit you.

878
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,520
They just insulted you.

879
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,440
Let's go.

880
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,710
I'm fine. Let's go.

881
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,150
