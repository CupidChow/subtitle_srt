19
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:16,572
What am I doing?

20
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:22,052
He smells so nice.

21
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,292
Come to your senses.

22
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,371
Why am I attracted to
his hormones again?

23
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,211
No.

24
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,612
I can't take advantage
of him while he's drunk.

25
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,091
However, he's had a long day.

26
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,251
He must be very tired.

27
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:41,971
Me, too.

28
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,971
I'm exhausted.

29
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,452
That's my car!

30
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,371
Come here!

31
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,211
Sleep with me.

32
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:25,811
I don't want to sleep alone.

33
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,211
I can still drink.

34
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,292
I'm Fang Leng.

35
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,012
How can I be drunk?

36
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,332
How cute.

37
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,132
You're awake.

38
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,371
You...

39
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:41,251
Why did you push me?

40
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,251
You were touching me.

41
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,091
I weren't.

42
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:50,691
What? It's you.

43
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,292
Last night,

44
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,132
you put my hand on your chest

45
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,052
and said to me,

46
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,491
"Sister,

47
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,732
stay here.

48
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,172
I want to hear bedtime stories.

49
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:01,572
Sister."

50
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:02,771
Why do you drool so much

51
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,651
when you sleep?

52
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,292
I do not. Let go!

53
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,892
You're hungry. I'll make
you something to eat.

54
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,211
I'm not hungry.

55
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:15,811
Two eggs and two sausages, thank you.

56
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:52,652
Smells great.

57
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,011
It smells delicious.

58
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,131
It's really delicious.

59
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,212
I didn't know you had a strength.

60
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,612
Do you usually eat so much by yourself?

61
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,491
Usually when I am alone,

62
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,451
I'd just drink Americano.

63
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,491
When you eat alone, you'd
worry about wasting food.

64
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,931
That's why you'd make it simple.

65
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,371
However, if two people eat together,

66
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,251
you can eat a lot and
make a scrumptious meal.

67
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,131
You can consider

68
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,972
asking me to join you
for breakfast from now on.

69
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,451
We live next door anyway.

70
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:43,371
It'll only take me seconds to get here.

71
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:44,011
Of course,

72
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,972
if you think two people
are not enough,

73
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,732
I can call Ms. Chai
and Xiaobu over here,

74
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,011
so that the four of us
will eat together.

75
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,451
Fine.

76
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,571
I forgive you.

77
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:55,931
It's because I'm outstanding.

78
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,451
That's why you can't help
but be attracted to me.

79
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,491
It can't be helped.

80
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,371
Your lack of willpower is to blame.

81
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,052
It's also because I'm so perfect.

82
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,571
It always brings unnecessary trouble.

83
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,292
However, you should give up.

84
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:14,972
Nothing will happen between us.

85
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,811
When a person is being
narcissistic to a certain extent,

86
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:17,772
he becomes conceited.

87
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,011
I have no interest in you whatsoever.

88
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:20,852
I don't like you.

89
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,412
I just like your scent.

90
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:23,612
My scent?

91
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,371
(Oh no, I let it slip.)

92
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:38,172
You are a very tasteful man.

93
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,491
I admire you for that.

94
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:41,571
Tasteful?

95
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:47,931
I'm full.

96
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,251
Finish the rest on your own.

97
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:56,612
He's so wasteful.

98
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:59,732
I'll share it with Chai and Xiaobu.

99
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,412
Xiaobu and Chai.

100
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:06,972
Come and try

101
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,451
the sandwich freshly made by me.

102
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:16,371
May you have a blissful relationship
with Mr. Fang, Xiaoqi!

103
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:17,891
The love story of an arrogant boss

104
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,652
and a naive deliverywoman.

105
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,652
It's finally coming to fruition!

106
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,532
We just stayed together for a night.

107
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:25,772
Why are you so excited?

108
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,212
You stayed together last night?

109
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,251
Strange.

110
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,652
Actually, I don't know.

111
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:30,891
I just went with the flow.

112
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,292
Tell me in details

113
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,972
what happened last night.

114
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,092
The details?

115
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,172
Xiaobu,

116
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,691
hurry up

117
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,772
and bring me the melon
seeds I bought yesterday.

118
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,052
Come on, Xiaoqi.

119
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:45,371
Tell me what happened last night.

120
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,371
I want to hear every single detail.

121
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:49,931
He and I

122
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,811
were just...

123
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,652
Be honest.

124
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:02,811
What happened last night?

125
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:04,732
You must be very thankful to me.

126
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,052
In fact, I'm really observant and smart.

127
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,772
It's nothing new.

128
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,571
It's all your fault, Mr. Fang,
for being too reserved.

129
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,772
I didn't have the opportunity
to use my talent.

130
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,451
I

131
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,532
don't need a promotion nor a raise,

132
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,931
as long as you admit

133
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:24,092
I am your best and wisest

134
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,131
assistant.

135
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:33,492
Mr. Fang,

136
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,012
you're here.

137
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,492
I...

138
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,772
I've sent the work schedule
for next quarter

139
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,091
to you.

140
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,652
Any other instruction?

141
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,571
Notify the fragrance department.

142
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,731
We're having a meeting in ten minutes.

143
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,091
Mr. Fang,

144
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,731
is there nothing else?

145
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:54,532
There is.

146
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,172
Didn't you say taking me home

147
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:58,211
is part of your job?

148
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,091
I did.

149
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:00,971
Why were you absent from work yesterday,

150
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:03,731
my best and wise assistant, Mr. Han?

151
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,372
(Why is this different
from what I thought?)

152
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:12,412
Mr. Fang, if there's nothing else,

153
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,451
I'll prepare the meeting materials.

154
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,012
That's it?

155
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,691
So it ended before anything happened?

156
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,691
What about hugs and kisses?

157
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:33,292
I was tortured by him all night.

158
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,331
Is that not enough?

159
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,412
Xiaoqi,

160
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,691
I always thought that the two of you

161
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,211
didn't fall in love because
of Mr. Fang's character.

162
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,492
However, it seems

163
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:45,691
there's nothing wrong with you.

164
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:46,811
You're simple-minded.

165
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,091
Too bad,

166
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,532
I wasted a bag of melon seeds

167
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,931
for your love story with
an anticlimatic ending.

168
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,331
Forget it.

169
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,772
I'd better check out the store.

170
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,931
Only when women

171
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,652
work hard and earn money

172
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,492
that they won't be let down.

173
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,172
What does she mean?

174
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:08,211
Xiaoqi,

175
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,091
you were with Fang Leng last night.

176
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,091
You two spent hours together.

177
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:13,252
You must have collected
quite a lot of hormones.

178
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:14,412
That's true.

179
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,420
(0.8%)

180
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:23,772
How can this be?

181
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,012
No idea.

182
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,292
Hold on.

183
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:30,892
Is it broken?

184
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:31,811
Why?

185
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:34,571
Impossible. Why?

186
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:35,691
Why is this happening?

187
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,451
Yesterday,

188
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:39,451
I took care of him all night.

189
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:41,372
However, he didn't feel anything for me.

190
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:42,811
At this rate,

191
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,652
when can we go home?

192
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,571
It doesn't matter, Xiaoqi.

193
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,132
I'll try to fix my signaler.

194
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,611
We can still go back.

195
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,892
I thought collecting hormones

196
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,611
would be faster than
the signaler in your head.

197
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:00,571
Oh no.

198
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:01,451
We're in trouble.

199
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,691
I think I made another mistake.

200
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,532
What's wrong?

201
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,731
I seem to have accidentally
told Fang Leng

202
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,252
about the hormones.

203
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,012
Oh gosh.

204
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,211
It's okay.

205
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,851
Anyway, Fang Leng always thinks that

206
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:19,211
you're mentally unsound.

207
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:22,052
I'm sure he won't take it to heart.

208
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:23,451
Don't worry.

209
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,611
If we look at the current trends
in the fragrance market,

210
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:30,892
the development of each company

211
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,052
is almost the same.

212
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,091
They want to show charisma

213
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,451
and elevate their style.

214
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:36,971
During this time,

215
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:38,571
we should come up

216
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:39,811
with different ideas

217
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,012
to discover new fragrance concepts.

218
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,292
Mr. Fang,

219
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,532
right now, the perfume culture

220
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,372
has been more or less exploited.

221
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,292
There isn't really any new idea

222
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,731
which can surprise the consumers.

223
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,372
Some people use perfume

224
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,931
to be attractive.

225
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,731
However, others use them

226
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,611
simply because they like the scent.

227
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,971
It's just like
the scent of their lovers.

228
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:01,091
Here, take a look at this.

229
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:02,571
The name of this fragrance

230
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,731
is Dreamy.

231
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:05,372
(Cute selection, mysterious temptation,)
This is

232
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:07,052
(Cute selection, mysterious temptation,)
the new fragrance to be launched next.

233
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:09,012
In this fragrance,

234
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,571
there is the scent of a lover.

235
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,172
We will also use it to make fragrances

236
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,731
that give users a dreamy feeling

237
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:16,372
of being in love after using it.

238
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:18,611
This Dreamy fragance idea

239
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:19,811
- is great.
- Yes.

240
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,412
- Mr. Fang's proposal is really good.
- Yes.

241
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:22,851
Let's go. It'll be great

242
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:23,931
if it really gives people the feeling.
- Yes.

243
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:24,731
However,

244
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,012
you have to be careful.

245
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,172
Our project is still in
the early stage of development.

246
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:29,772
Development stage.

247
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,532
It must be strictly confidential.

248
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,571
- No problem.
- Okay.

249
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:33,292
Remember that.

250
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,211
Then we'll get going.

251
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,172
Bye.

252
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,211
Another day of being impressed

253
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,451
by Mr. Fang's intelligence.

254
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,372
You're always in meetings.

255
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,252
However, I don't see
any result from you.

256
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,892
You don't have to worry

257
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,772
about our fragrance planning meetings.

258
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,772
Be careful, it's hot.

259
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,292
Not perfume again.

260
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:59,132
Last time, although Rainy Rainbow

261
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,971
broke a record in
the quantity of orders,

262
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:03,571
but due to high production costs,

263
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,292
I'm sure you didn't make much profit.

264
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,451
That was before our fragrance
concept innovation.

265
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,091
It's different now.

266
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,091
It's called Dreamy.

267
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,292
Compared to the boring
ones on the market,

268
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,052
ours is very creative, okay?

269
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:20,971
Dreamy?

270
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,532
Did I say that?

271
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:26,772
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

272
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:30,931
I didn't give it away, right?

273
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,892
He's old anyway.

274
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:34,931
I'm sure he didn't hear it.

275
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,412
What?

276
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,851
Why is it perfume again?

277
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:43,172
Please enjoy.

278
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:46,892
Okay.

279
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,252
Contact a few shareholders.

280
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:50,571
We'll make preparation.

281
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:51,331
You're back.

282
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,532
Let's see if he can
be as cocky as usual.

283
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:56,931
How was it?

284
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,252
Any order from Future Group?

285
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,412
Not yet, I guess we'll
have to wait for a while.

286
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,571
We still have to wait?

287
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,211
Did you chat with Fang Lie?

288
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,012
Don't worry.

289
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,451
He's pinned on top of my WeChat list.

290
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,300
(My boyfriend on earth)

291
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,532
Have you never chatted
since you added him?

292
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,451
Will he go to Fang Leng then?

293
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:21,892
We're just dating.

294
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,172
Does it have to be so troublesome?

295
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:25,211
No idea.

296
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,252
However, I remember Chai telling me

297
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,931
that dating was like taking a class.

298
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,611
You may think he's very disciplined,

299
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,091
but he might be distracted.

300
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,931
If you don't talk to him,

301
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,172
he's going to talk to someone else.

302
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:37,132
Understood.

303
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,331
- Go now.
- Okay.

304
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:41,691
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:43,012
What's wrong with you?

306
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:45,851
I'm so sorry.

307
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,851
I'll wipe it for you.

308
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,971
Xiaoqi, we received an order
from Future Group.

309
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:50,892
Finally.

310
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:10,372
I'm so sorry.

311
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:14,492
Bill, please.

312
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,652
Where did they go?

313
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,971
What kind of service
and attitude is this?

314
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:20,532
Is this a self-service restaurant?

315
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,780
(Fang Lie)

316
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:24,931
Sir,

317
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:27,532
be careful when you move.

318
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:28,971
These are a future great artist's

319
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,971
cherished treasures.

320
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,731
- Okay, sir.
- Come on.

321
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,691
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

322
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:38,811
Okay. Thanks.

323
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:40,611
Is there anything else?

324
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,931
No. That was the last batch.

325
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:45,132
Thank you for your hard work.

326
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:45,931
- You're welcome, sir. - Good work.

327
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:46,772
Let's go.

328
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,132
Thank you.

329
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,172
Too bad no one is here
to share the joy with me.

330
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,372
Xiaobu sure has odd taste.

331
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:10,091
Did she block or delete
me from friends' list?

332
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,091
Didn't she say we're going to date?

333
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,611
Why is there no news from her?

334
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:15,811
Forget it.

335
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,772
She's playing hard-to-get.

336
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:26,971
I was forced into it anyway.

337
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,172
It's even better not
to contact each other.

338
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,172
Hello.

339
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:35,052
Hello, sir.

340
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,052
You have a parcel. Please
pick it up at the door.

341
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:39,931
Thanks.

342
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:42,412
Hello.

343
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,372
Your milk tea has arrived.

344
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,372
Okay.

345
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,012
Remember to give a five-star review.

346
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:48,172
- Okay.
- It's you again.

347
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,731
Aren't you the relentless one?

348
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,012
You come here every day.

349
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,611
Your husband is still in a meeting.

350
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,811
You might have to wait
if you want to repay him.

351
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,851
He's in a meeting?

352
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:56,731
Thank you.

353
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,571
The love story of a demanding
boss and a funny deliverywoman

354
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,091
is so interesting.

355
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:03,731
Leng-Qi couple

356
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,492
is my motivation to come to work.

357
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:06,732
Anything can be fake,

358
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,252
- but this couple must be real.
- That's right.

359
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,091
(CEO's office)
In the next financial quarter,

360
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:14,492
the fragrance department
will have more funding

361
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:15,891
and technical support

362
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,891
to increase effort for
the research of new products.

363
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:19,692
We hope that this product

364
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:20,811
will lead the market.

365
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:24,732
Mr. Fang,

366
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,851
your decision is arbitrary.

367
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,052
What do you mean by that?

368
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,411
Currently, the fragrance department

369
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:32,371
isn't the group's biggest
source of income.

370
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,371
On the contrary, it is the biggest
gap in investment at this stage.

371
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:37,131
Under such circumstances,

372
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,331
increasing the research cost
of the fragrance department

373
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,891
isn't really worth it,

374
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,252
not to mention

375
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:44,811
the fragrance market
is currently saturated.

376
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,611
As the cycle of innovation gets longer,

377
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,811
the accompanying risks
are also increasing.

378
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:50,932
So, I personally think

379
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,732
not only the funding of the fragrance
department shouldn't increase,

380
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,212
it has to be halved.

381
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:57,371
That's because you don't know

382
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,212
the fragrance department's
research programs.

383
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,331
In your eyes,

384
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,772
you only see the pressure
about the cost.

385
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:02,732
You can't even see

386
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,331
the possibility of
doubling the earnings.

387
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:10,292
Are you talking about Dreamy fragrance?

388
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,171
This product

389
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,292
only has a concept

390
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,492
and no prototype.

391
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:16,891
I personally think

392
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,492
there's no research value.

393
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:20,692
Mr. Fang,

394
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:22,891
can you make an estimation

395
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,651
before you develop a new project?

396
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,571
Although the group doesn't lack funds,

397
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,772
we shouldn't waste resources

398
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,371
on these pointless projects.

399
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,212
Am I right?

400
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,692
Yes, that's true.

401
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:36,811
Hello, I've been waiting for you.

402
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:37,972
Why haven't you arrived yet?

403
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,611
One moment. I'll be right there.

404
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,331
All right.

405
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:50,492
Hello, mother.

406
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:51,811
Hello, son.

407
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,452
Where are you?

408
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,851
I...

409
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:58,532
My friends and I are at
Empire State Building.

410
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,452
I think I see someone who looks like you

411
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,611
on Youth Road.

412
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,571
No way, mother.

413
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,811
You must have been mistaken
since you miss me too much.

414
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:12,371
Hello, mother.

415
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:13,651
Hello?

416
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,212
Hello?

417
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:27,932
Get here.

418
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:37,972
Fang Lie!

419
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,171
Fang Lie!

420
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:43,052
Fang Lie!

421
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:45,972
Fang Lie!

422
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:51,851
I think your mother has left.

423
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,932
Haven't you told your mother?

424
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:57,772
If my mother finds out,

425
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,052
I'll be in big trouble.

426
00:19:59,091 --> 00:19:59,972
Good thing I ran into you.

427
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,692
Why are you so scared
that your face is red?

428
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:16,732
No, well,

429
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,532
It's a little hot in here.

430
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:25,411
It is.

431
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:28,012
It's hot.

432
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:30,972
Why don't we

433
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,252
go to my studio?

434
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,052
Here.

435
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,651
Let me show you my studio.

436
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,052
Your studio is huge.

437
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:46,811
What do you think?

438
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,732
Do you like to paint?

439
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:51,811
Look.

440
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:52,732
The other day, you hurriedly

441
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,212
made me go out with you.

442
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,532
In fact, you don't even know me.

443
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,452
I'm not your first boyfriend, right?

444
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,811
Have you had girlfriends before?

445
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:03,732
No.

446
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,371
However, I have an artist's sensibility.

447
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,851
So I'm talented in this kind of things.

448
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,692
Couples like us who don't text

449
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:12,811
nor meet each other

450
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,452
are basically considered broken up.

451
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,651
Aren't we already a couple?

452
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,891
Why do we have to meet?

453
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,292
Oh my gosh, you're such an amateur.

454
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,171
Come on, take a seat.

455
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,492
Let me share with you some knowledge.

456
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,972
Do you know why people fall in love?

457
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,891
It's because human beings have
needs for physical pleasure

458
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,532
and reproduction.

459
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:36,732
To meet these needs,

460
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:38,331
it requires at least two people.

461
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:42,252
This...

462
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,212
Here's the thing.

463
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,212
It's because one feels lonely

464
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:52,492
when doing certain things alone.

465
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:54,371
However, when two people do it together,

466
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,611
it becomes romantic.

467
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,171
So, the purpose of dating

468
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:59,811
is to make people's life
romantic instead of lonely.

469
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,331
Not necessarily.

470
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,851
I'm happy when I'm alone.

471
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,932
Why did you want to go out with me?

472
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:10,052
That's because I didn't want
you to be with someone else.

473
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,331
It's because I'm too charming.

474
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:14,851
I understand

475
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,012
what you're saying.

476
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,452
I really do.

477
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,851
Being in love

478
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:22,851
is just two people
helping each other out.

479
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,891
You trouble me

480
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:26,171
and vice versa.

481
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,492
In this process,

482
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,171
romantic feelings will arise.

483
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,052
It's two people granting
each other's wishes.

484
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:37,932
Do you wish to be a painter?

485
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:38,732
Yes.

486
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,811
What is your wish?

487
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:43,851
It's beyond your capability.

488
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:45,252
Try me.

489
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:48,091
If we can't make it happen,

490
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:49,452
we'll destroy it together.

491
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:51,212
Then you can have another wish.

492
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:53,131
I can't change my wish.

493
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,571
I need to fix

494
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,932
a super sophisticated computer system.

495
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:01,292
How about this?

496
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:04,452
I'll help you to smash the computer

497
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:05,891
and buy you a new one.

498
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,171
I've been waiting for you.

499
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,252
You're finally here.

500
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:21,052
Who is that woman?

501
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,532
She's a deliverywoman from
a milk tea shop around here.

502
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:23,732
She comes here often to deliver food.

503
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,932
Is she very close to Mr. Fang?

504
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,692
She and Mr. Fang are a couple.

505
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:29,891
A couple?

506
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,411
We often say in private

507
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,252
that she and Mr. Fang are so compatible.

508
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,252
Get back to work then.

509
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,052
Strange.

510
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,411
He's being so serious at work.

511
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,252
That's a quick change of expression.

512
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:44,052
It's so strange.

513
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,891
Are you waiting for Mr. Fang?

514
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,252
I've told the fragrance
department many times

515
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:58,811
to keep the research and
development process

516
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:00,772
confidential.

517
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,651
How could the board possibly know

518
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,932
our new concept?

519
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:06,171
Find out

520
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,492
who leaked the plan.

521
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:14,692
This...

522
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:15,851
This carrier of yours is pretty big.

523
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,411
Okay, please.

524
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:18,772
Just ask me.

525
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,012
If you have any question, just ask me.

526
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,692
I don't understand a word you're saying.

527
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:23,772
Then I'll say it straight.

528
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:27,212
What is your relationship
with Fang Leng?

529
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:28,932
Me and Fang Leng?

530
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:35,371

of our store first.

531

00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:40,532

about my relationship with Fang Leng.

It only costs RMB1,000.

536
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:44,772
You'll have nothing to lose.

537
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:45,651
20%?

538
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,292
Yes.

539
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:47,052
That's so cheap.

540
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,171
By the way,

541
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,212
the shop is right across.

542
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,851
Actually...

543
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:52,331
Tell Chai Xiaoqi to come in.

544
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:56,811
RMB1,000.

545
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:58,212
How generous.

546
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,452
You can say it now, right?

547
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:00,292
No.

548
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,252
You're only a regular VIP now.

549
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,371
You can only enjoy
free delivery service.

550
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:05,772
You have to top up money

551
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,571
to become super VVIP

552
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,091
and find out about
my relationship with Fang Leng.

553
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:11,171
Remember to order takeout.

554
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:12,972
- No!
- Ms. Chai.

555
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:14,532
Mr. Fang wants to see you in his office.

556
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:15,411
He invites me to his office?

557
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:16,331
He wants me to go in?

558
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,811
All right, remember to order takeout.

559
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:20,091
Uncle Kang.

560
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:22,131
if you have any question, just ask me.

561
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,611
That's RMB1,000.

562
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,131
RMB1,000?

563
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,532
Yes.

564
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:35,732
This is the latest hangover
cake developed by Chai.

565
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,212
After you eat it,

566
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,651
it'll cure your hangover.

567
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:45,252
Taste it.

568
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:46,171
Come on.

569
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,331
Why are you looking at me like that?

570
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:59,292
What is the purpose of
you approaching me?

571
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:01,212
(Oh no.)

572
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:03,012
(He knows.)

573
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,611
I dirtied your pants.

574
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,012
Don't you have to change your pants?

575
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,611
I'll go.

576
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:20,611
I won't look.

577
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:33,131
You can keep pretending.

578
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:35,131
However, I don't mind
leaving your matter

579
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,532
to the police.

580
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:38,212
No, please don't.

581
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,292
I'm just doing my job.

582
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,891
It's indeed you.

583
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:44,972
They sent you

584
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,932
to destroy me.

585
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,811
Then you have completed
your mission now.

586
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:50,851
No, you're overthinking it.

587
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,131
I still have a long way to go.

588
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:53,452
You are pretty honest.

589
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:56,292
My mission won't ruin you.

590
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,532
It'll only cause a little impact

591
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,411
on your life.

592
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,571
You just want to replace the president.

593
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:04,131
Go back and tell your boss that

594
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,052
I, Fang Leng, got to this position

595
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,932
and am not afraid of being replaced!

596
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:08,611
Get out!

597
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:16,772
Come back.

598
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,292
Take this with you.

599
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:31,052
Am I right, Mr. Fang?

600
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,571
I told you it's not her.

601
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:34,331
It's her.

602
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,651
I was just testing her

603
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:37,811
and she admitted it right away.

604
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:39,411
That's impossible.

605
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:46,411
Did she give in under your pressure?

606
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,692
Immediately notify
the security department

607
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,292
to blacklist her name.

608
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:50,946
I don't want to see her again.

609
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,940
(Big Pig Head, stupid Fang Leng)

610
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:00,345
Xiaoqi.

611
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:03,625
What are you writing?

612
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:06,226
The more I think about
it, the angrier I get.

613
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,466
I just don't get it.

614
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:09,065
Collecting hormones

615
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:10,706
does no harm to Fang Leng at all.

616
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:11,385
right?

617
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:12,825
Why was he so fierce?

618
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:13,946
I couldn't even rebut.

619
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:15,666
I'm so mad.

620
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:17,426
(Big Pig Head, stupid Fang Leng)
I'm going to write down all the rebuttal.

621
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:18,785
When he scolds me again,

622
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:20,305
I'll just read it aloud to him.

623
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:21,625
We, Cape Towners,

624
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,666
can't be bullied by earthlings.

625
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,706
- That's right.
- Scold him.

626
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:25,746
Xiaoqi,

627
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,585
is Fang Leng treating you this way

628
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:29,785
because he wants to take the opportunity

629
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:31,145
to find out about our alien identity?

630
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:31,825
No.

631
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,625
According to Cape Town's rule,

632
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,666
We have to prioritise

633
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,706
the safety and interests
of our home planet.

634
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:39,625
If we come across anyone

635
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,825
who is a threat to our home planet,

636
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:41,746
we're allowed

637
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,585
to resort to extraordinary
measures such as murder

638
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:46,906
to protect the safety
of the home planet.

639
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,385
However, it's so complicated.

640
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:52,706
It will ruin our image as good citizens

641
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:54,585
back in Cape Town. Besides,

642
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:55,946
I don't know how to do it.

643
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,706
Also, if Fang Leng is not around,

644
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:00,785
how are we going to get the job done?

645
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:03,105
You're right.

646
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,426
Verified.

647
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,345
I thought he's back.

648
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:42,266
To be frank,

649
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,226
I had a bad impression of you.

650
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,625
Later, I found out that
although you acted recklessly,

651
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,785
but in overall, you're a good person.

652
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,865
However, I'm really disappointed in you.

653
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:52,625
I didn't expect you to
be this kind of person.

654
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,506
I'm just a food delivery guy.

655
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:56,585
What do you mean?

656
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:03,545
Aren't you "the adorable Ms. Chai"?

657
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:04,145
Sorry.

658
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:05,625
- I thought you'd leave a bad review.
- Is that the pizza?

659
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,666
It's over here.

660
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:07,585
Hi, here's your food delivery.

661
00:30:07,585 --> 00:30:08,906
Thanks so much.

662
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:09,625
Enjoy the food.

663
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,345
Let's eat together.

664
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:18,785
What's wrong?

665
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,026
Are you going through
an emotional roller coaster?

666
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:26,145
The atmosphere between
you two were great yesterday.

667
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,145
He's ignoring you now.

668
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,825
What does it mean?

669
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:31,506
He's

670
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:35,065
playing hard-to-get with you.

671
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:37,186
This time you guessed wrong.

672
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:39,105
He's not playing hard-to-get with me.

673
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,706
He really got me.

674
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:43,906
Chai, you wouldn't know.

675
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:45,426
Her current relationship with Fang Leng

676
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,065
is stuck.

677
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,345
Is it so serious?

678
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,865
Didn't you deliver
the cake to him today?

679
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:52,906
Was he unhappy about it?

680
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,545
I even made him mad.

681
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,266
That's great.

682
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:02,026
In the past, when emperors
travelled under disguise,

683
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:03,426
they liked

684
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:05,545
women who could slap them.

685
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,305
Xiaoqi,

686
00:31:07,305 --> 00:31:10,426
you finally got my legacy.

687
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:11,186
All right.

688
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:14,105
Tomorrow you will
continue to deliver takeout.

689
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,345
See if

690
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,305
he is really mad at you
to the point that

691
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:19,785
that he's losing sleep
and not eating well.

692
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:22,585
Then, it's a complete success.

693
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:25,986
Anger him.

694
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:26,825
Anger him.

695
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,585
Make him furious.

696
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,785
How's the progress at
the fragrance department?

697
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:31,946
Ever since the funds
were reduced by half,

698
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,305
the R&D has been suspended.

699
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:36,266
There's still overwhelming objection

700
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,266
from the shareholders.

701
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,940
(Report on the use of project fund)

702
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,625
Tell the fragrance
department to continue.

703
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,065
I'll take care of the financial matters.

704
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,305
Okay.

705
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:49,785
Anything else?

706
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:51,906
Mr. Fang,

707
00:31:52,305 --> 00:31:53,466
I don't think Ms. Chai

708
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,026
was the one who leaked the plan.

709
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,186
She may seem that way,

710
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,625
but I'm sure she's not a bad person.

711
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,145
Besides,

712
00:31:59,145 --> 00:32:00,345
Ms. Chai has never even seen

713
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,466
our proposal.

714
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,186
There's no way she'd...

715
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:03,585
From the current evidence,

716
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:04,825
who else could it be?

717
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,746
I won't give anyone who harms
the interests of the company

718
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,906
a second chance.

719
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,345
What if

720
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,026
he or she didn't mean it?

721
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:16,746
A careless mistake

722
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:18,186
made everyone's effort

723
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,305
go to waste.

724
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:21,545
Mr. Han,

725
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,585
sometimes stupid people are
more unforgivable than bad people.

726
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:29,105
Are you done?

727
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:30,986
Yes.

728
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,345
Why are you stopping me from going in?

729
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,340
(Future Group's blacklist, Chai Xiaoqi)

730
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,906
Fang Leng is ruthless. Isn't...

731
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:54,865
Sorry, Ms. Chai.

732
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,026
Please don't make
things difficult for us.

733
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,545
The way to a man's heart

734
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,585
is through his stomach.

735
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:21,986
If you want a ruthless man

736
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:22,946
to change his mind,

737
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:24,906
it is recommended to
try the following recipes.

738
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:26,946
Stewed Goose Webs with Abalone.

739
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:31,946
Crispy Golden Wings.
Beef Ribs with Garlic.

740
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:34,065
Who gave you this bad idea?

741
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:35,226
No idea.

742
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:36,825
I have never seen this number.

743
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,385
His account is called

744
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,105
An Unknown Matchmaker.

745
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,065
No wonder.

746
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:44,946
That's an idea from ​​the past century.

747
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:46,345
Nowadays,

748
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,065
to control a man's stomach,

749
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,746
not only it has to be delicious,

750
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:51,585
it should also leave
a lasting impression.

751
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,426
What's the difference between these two?

752
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:57,585
If it's delicious, it just looks
good and is full of flavour.

753
00:33:57,825 --> 00:33:59,706
There's nothing to remember about it.

754
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:00,946
However, for a lasting impression,

755
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,266
other than the aforementioned,

756
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:06,266
it also needs a name that stands out

757
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,786
to make it more special.

758
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,625
It has to taste good

759
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,426
and have a nice name.

760
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:14,826
Who would invent such a recipe?

761
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:20,346
This book is the result

762
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,386
(Secret)
of my years' research.

763
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:23,665
Learn from it.

764
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,506
You're welcome.

765
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:26,625
Thanks, Chai.

766
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:34,906
One, two, three, four.

767
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:36,665
All the ingredients are here.

768
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:39,786
I'll start with this.

769
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:41,946
Shaved Ice with Love.

770
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:50,466
It's so simple.

771
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:57,065
Next, it's Stealing Glances and a Kiss.

772
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:00,705
It smells great.

773
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:05,386
The next one is
Fly Together Into Your Heart.

774
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:06,866
It's a piece of cake.

775
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:18,866
Perfect.

776
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:30,386
This sweet pickled plum dish

777
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:32,665
is my special service for you.

778
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:34,145
Taste it.

779
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:45,866
Xiaoqi,

780
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:47,306
I had never eaten

781
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,625
anything so delicious.

782
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:50,225
Amazing.

783
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:15,225
He would even fall
in love with my cooking.

784
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:18,506
Where else can you find
someone as awesome as me?

785
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,265
Is anybody there?

786
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:03,986
Xiaoqi!

787
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:05,705
What are you doing?

788
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:22,625
Are you all right?

789
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:23,506
Are you okay?

790
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,346
Yes.

791
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:25,786
What were you doing?

792
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,026
I was cooking for you.

793
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:29,705
It's all ruined.

794
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,306
Hold on a second.

795
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:34,986
This is pretty good.

796
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,105
I'll pour some for you.

797
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:38,866
Didn't I tell you...

798
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:51,105
Why is it spraying water?

799
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:53,545
Let's go!

800
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:06,705
Thanks.

801
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:13,665
Why are you looking at me like that?

802
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:14,946
Are you going to call the police again?

803
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,386
I didn't do anything this time.

804
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:26,426
How much money did they give you?

805
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:27,105
(No.)

806
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,386
(I can't give away my organisation.)

807
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:30,745
This is

808
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,105
between you and me.

809
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,506
Listen to me.

810
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:37,585
You may not remember
certain things, but I do.

811
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:38,665
If we're talking about cheating,

812
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:40,185
you're the one who started it.

813
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:41,946
Do you think you could bully me

814
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,426
just because I didn't get mad?

815
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,906
Reflect on your actions.

816
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:49,665
Your ring.

817
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:53,065
Stupid Fang Leng.

818
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:54,585
Fang Leng.

819
00:38:57,145 --> 00:38:59,705
So you are the one
I've been looking for.

820
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,225
Just hold me tightly,

821
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:03,265
okay?

822
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:10,065
Why is he sitting on the floor?

823
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:12,426
My ring.

824
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:13,466
Get up slowly.

825
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:17,665
Are you all right?

826
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:25,585
Xiaoqi!

827
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:31,906
Xiaoqi!

828
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:32,866
Xiaoqi,

829
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:33,665
are you all right?

830
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:35,545
I just saw the kitchen...

831
00:39:41,786 --> 00:39:42,665
Got it.

832
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:43,786
Hang in there, Xiaoqi.

833
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:54,065
What happened to me just now?

834
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:56,265
You were fine. Nothing happened.

835
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:58,506
Sit down. I'm going back, bye.

836
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,585
What happened just now?

837
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:08,705
Hello, viewers.

838
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,585
Next, we have the weather forecast.

839
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:12,506
Due to Typhoon Dujuan,

840
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:14,185
(Typhoon Dujuan is coming, storm alert)
there may be temporary rain

841
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:15,306
(Typhoon Dujuan is coming, storm alert)
in many areas.

842
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:16,826
At 6 pm.

843
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:19,026
an orange storm warning may be issued.

844
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,900
(Dear Mr. Fang)

845
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:27,506
Mr. Fang.

846
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,265
Okay, sure.

847
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,386
I'll get ready right now

848
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,986
to fetch you to a city without rain.

Why is it raining now?

850
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,466
Isn't it supposed to be at night?

851
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:44,426
Mr. Fang, are you okay?

852
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,346
Drive faster, Mr. Han.

853
00:40:54,306 --> 00:40:55,745
Do you want me to call Dr. Zhang?

854
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:00,386
You look great.

855

If there is a chance for us
to cooperate in the future,

I'll surely do.

Other than me,

859
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,306
no one else wants to go out with her.

860
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:20,225
Listen carefully.

861
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:23,866
Be my girlfriend.
