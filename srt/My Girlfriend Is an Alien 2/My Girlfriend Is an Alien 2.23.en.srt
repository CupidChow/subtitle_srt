When did Fang Leng

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,950
first speak up for Xiaoqi?

I stole the hormone element.

23

When doing the gym live streaming.

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,430
When you were on live,

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
many of the comments
kept questioning you.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,200
So I just swore back at them.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
I remember.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,510
Are you the one

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,560
who sent
a lot of gifts during the live stream,

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Thank you.

35
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,640
Bravo.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,270
It was me.

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,440
Not bad.

38
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,480
Xiaoqi and Mr. Fang.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,790
You two

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,760
basically passed the test.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,230
- Yes!
- Well done!

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,600
Next couple.

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,880
- Okay.
- Your turn.

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,390
- Good luck.
- Go for it.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,510
What is Fang Lie's favourite food?

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,510
- Everything Fang Leng bought for him.
- Seafood.

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,710
He likes to eat anything

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,790
that Fang Leng buys

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,790
or that he doesn't have to pay for.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,230
She's right.

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,920
Is that so?

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,320
Don't you agree?

53
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,920
Okay, next question.

54
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,510
What will make
Fang Lie's heart flutter?

55
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,710
First place trophy.

56
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,480
Xiaobu.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,110
Xiaobu.

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,550
So sweet.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,550
Although the two of you now

60
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,440
have no mutual understanding,

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,670
but as long as you try
to know each other

62
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,320
when you get along,

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,830
you will slowly

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,480
build mutual understanding.

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,200
Go for it!

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,230
Okay!

67
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,080
Chai, what about you and Dr. Zhang?

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,320
Dr. Zhang is a psychiatrist.

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,440
It's definitely not fair to us

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,040
for him to play this with Chai.

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,550
Let's play another game.

72
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,110
Dear, it's been
3 minutes and 55 seconds.

73
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,920
Brother, aren't you tired?

74
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,160
I told you to go to the gym regularly.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,790
Fang Lie, don't worry.

76
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,710
I'm certain you'll be

77
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,360
in the top three in this game.

78
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,710
Come on!

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,160
(Alert, system temperature is too high,
turning into tortoise mode soon)

80
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,040
She's cheating.

81
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,950
This is a foul.

82
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,640
A foul!

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,030
Is that allowed?

84
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,830
- Fraud! Cheater!
- You don't get tired this way.

85
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,590
Not fair!

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,000
How about I do push-ups?

87
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,880
Are you tired?

88
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,030
Hey!

89
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,000
- That's not fair.
- One.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No cheating.

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000
- Two.
- Xiaobu, return to human form.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,560
- Three.
- This is too much!

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,320
Four.

94
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,120
Five.

95
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,240
Master.

96
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,680
I think you treat Chai Xiaoqi

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
very differently.

98
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,590
If someone else had made
the same mistake repeatedly,

99
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,150
you would have taken action.

100
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
In the case of Chai Xiaoqi...

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,030
Shut up.

102
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,800
I just don't want to see
her make mistakes again.

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,680
(Sunny Apartment)

104
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,240
Why do you want to see me?

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,510
Xiaoqi.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,510
Do you know that there is

107
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,760
a creature on Earth called chameleon?

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Chameleons change their colour

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,350
depending on the environment.

110
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,030
People often think

111
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,760
they see their true form,

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
but that is actually their disguise,

113
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,200
not their nature.

114
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,710
Why are you telling me this?

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
Earthlings are actually
the same as chameleons.

116
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,470
People often think they see

117
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,640
a genuine side of a person,

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,150
but they don't know

119
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,240
how hypocritical that person really is.

120
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,830
Didn't we learn that at home?

121
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,470
Humans are multi-faceted
and complex creatures.

122
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,760
Is it worth giving up

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
all the privileges

124
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,200
of being an advanced being

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
for an uncertain person

126
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,910
like Fang Leng?

127
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,320
Shiyi.

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,200
You want to bring me
home again, don't you?

129
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,150
I just want you to see the truth

130
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,270
and weigh up the consequences.

131
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,830
Loving someone is

132
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,030
the only thing you can do

133
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,440
without this burden.

134
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,830
I like Fang Leng.

135
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,150
So I'm willing to take a chance.

136
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,470
He likes me, too.

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,590
He doesn't care

138
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,590
whether I'm an Earthling

139
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,320
or an alien.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,030
Love?

141
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,800
Do you still remember
the rules of our planet?

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
The first rule is

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,510
to eliminate all inferior emotions.

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,830
If anyone disobeys,

145
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,390
they will be banished to space
and never returned.

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Will your so-called love

147
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,200
save you when you are

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
roaming in space?

149
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,950
I'll deal with that in the future.

150
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,150
At least I don't regret

151
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,390
the decision I've made now.

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,000
I think you've been on Earth too long.

153
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,640
Your mind has been assimilated by them.

154
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Think what you like.

155
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,270
I won't leave with you.

156
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,270
Xiaoqi.

157
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,590
Xiaoqi.

158
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,470
Sorry.

159
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,120
I've been denying your decision

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
because I didn't know
you were so determined.

161
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,080
Okay.

162
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,390
Since you've thought about it,

163
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,350
I'll definitely support you.

164
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
Consider this

165
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,270
our farewell drink.

166
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,270
Aren't we friends?

167
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,120
All right.

168
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,510
Thank you for supporting my decision.

169
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,030
I'll get going.

170
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,910
Goodbye.

171
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,760
Shiyi.

172
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,470
You...

173
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,510
You...

174
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,200
Xiaoqi.

175
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
You gave me no choice.

176
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,440
What is all this for?

177
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,520
Mr. Fang.

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
Please rest assured.

179
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
Just follow my steps.

180
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,470
Ms. Chai will definitely be touched.

181
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,870
I just asked you to book a restaurant.

182
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,400
Why did you make such a big fuss?

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,520
This is necessary.

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,630
After all, it's your first celebration.

185
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,870
It has to be romantic

186
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,280
and memorable.

187
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,830
Mr. Fang, don't worry.

188
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,110
I'll be hiding there.

189
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,200
Just enjoy your meal.

190
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,800
Halfway through, I will come out

191
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
and launch...

192
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,520
I'll launch

193
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,320
Cupid's arrow.

194
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,080
Then I will hand

195
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,870
this flower to you.

196
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
You will give it to Ms. Chai yourself

197
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,280
and tell her...

198
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,350
Mr. Fang, what do you
want to say to Ms. Chai?

199
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,800
I know.

200
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,230
You must be so nervous

201
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,830
that you don't know where to start.

202
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,920
It's okay.

203
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,750
I've prepared it for you.

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
(Xiaoqi, I love you)

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
(I was shot by Cupid)

206
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,280
Do I look like someone who
would say such a thing?

207
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,280
No.

208
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,750
Surprised or not?

209
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,110
Impressed or not?

210
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,350
What time is it?

211
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,350
Ten minutes left.

212
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,990
Ms. Chai should be here soon.

213
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,830
I will go and hide now.

214
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,950
Xiaoqi, I...

215
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,020
(All the singles, alert, Lengqi Couple's
first Valentine's Day, about to go down)

216
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,980
(Sunny Apartment)

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,920
Where am I?

218
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Thank you for supporting my decision.

219
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,590
What is this?

220
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh, my gosh.

221
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,160
Shiyi.

222
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,350
Xiaoqi, you are awake.

223
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,990
What's all this, Shiyi?

224
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,520
You don't really think

225
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,590
I'm going to let you
continue to do mistakes

226
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,160
and let you stay on Earth, do you?

227
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,200
Shiyi, I know it's
your duty as the chief

228
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,040
to oversee my return,

229
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,630
but can you just

230
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,990
make up an excuse?

231
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,110
If the planet comes down on you,

232
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,920
I'll take all the blame.

233
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,520
I promise not to get you involved, okay?

234
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,400
Didn't you say we were friends?

235
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,560
Aren't friends supposed
to help each other?

236
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,230
Please do me this favour.

237
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,080
I already told you.

238
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,110
Being with Fang Leng

239
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,560
will only bring you harm.

240
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Why do you hate Fang Leng so much?

241
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Let's not talk about this.

242
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
I really treat you as a friend.

243
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,230
Can you support my choice?

244
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,710
Shiyi.

245
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
If you insist,

246
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,470
we won't be friends anymore.

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,630
We're done.

248
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,870
I know I can't win against you,

249
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,630
but at least I can remove this barrier.

250
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,750
Xiaoqi.

251
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,520
Xiaoqi.

252
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,230
This is a barrier generated by Candy

253
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,320
using the latest technology.

254
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,950
It will constantly drain your energy.

255
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,280
You can't get out of here.

256
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,320
The number you've dialled
is currently unavailable.

257
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,800
Please try again later.

258
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,800
The number you've dialled
is currently unavailable.

259
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Please try again later.

260
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,470
Mr. Fang, don't worry.

261
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,800
Maybe Ms. Chai is stuck in traffic.

262
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,230
Well,

263
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,350
there is no traffic at this hour.

264
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,560
Mr. Fang, don't worry.

265
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,830
I'm sure Ms. Chai

266
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,280
would never stand you up.

267
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
There's something

268
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,830
I was going to tell you
back on the home planet,

269
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,230
but if you're so insistent,

270
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,230
I'll have to tell you now.

271
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,230
When I'm done,

272
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,520
it's up to you to decide

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,990
whether you want
to stay or leave.

274
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,470
Fang Lie, I'm here. Where are you?

275
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,470
Do you like it?

276
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,630
It's our first celebration together.

277
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,990
So it must be grand.

278
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,870
(Alert, system temperature is too high)

279
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,470
(Alert, system temperature is too high)
What's wrong?

280
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,870
Whenever the temperature
reaches 40 degrees,

281
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,230
I will turn into a turtle.

282
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,710
You touched my head

283
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,520
and my temperature got out of control.

284
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,230
Listen.

285
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,080
You must never touch my head again.

286
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,230
Okay.

287
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,720
(Alert, system temperature is too high)

288
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
In future, we can date freely

289
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,870
as long as you cool down in time

290
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,190
and keep your
internal system temperature

291
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,240
under 40 degrees.

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,190
No wonder you chose
the pool for our date today.

293
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,390
What do you think? Cool, right?

294
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,040
So cool.

295
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,870
Shouldn't you reward me then?

296
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,910
(Fang Leng)
Fang Leng?

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,080
My brother?

298
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,350
Are we genetic matches?

299
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,520
Yes.

300
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,800
In the planet's

301
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,760
last genetic matching
of advanced starlings,

302
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,000
you are 99% genetically compatible

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,630
with master.

304
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
Therefore, the Order has

305
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,000
made you legal genetic partners.

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,080
Once the relationship has been formed,

307
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,110
it cannot be broken

308
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,590
nor put to an end.

309
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,720
Since when is this?

310
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,800
Before you came to Earth.

311
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,480
Goodness.

312
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,430
So we've been partners for a long time.

313
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,670
No wonder you were so angry

314
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,910
when I said I'd stay on Earth.

315
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,150
So, Xiaoqi,

316
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
do you still want to stay on Earth?

317
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,280
I'm sorry, Shiyi.

318
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,630
It's okay, Xiaoqi.

319
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,390
I'm glad you understand now.

320
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,350
I mean,

321
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,280
I still want to be with Fang Leng.

322
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,320
Genetic matching

323
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
is a result of

324
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,830
computational analysis and statistics.

325
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,720
I used to think it was

326
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
a very scientific and advanced system,

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,320
but since I came to Earth, I've realised

328
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,960
that love is the only reason

329
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,480
for two people to be together.

330
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,080
The bond between two people

331
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,910
should be warm

332
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,480
and heartfelt.

333
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,040
I know this may be unfair to you,

334
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,630
but I am

335
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,720
in love with Fang Leng.

336
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,240
So,

337
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,430
please forgive me, Shiyi.

338
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,910
Didn't you let me make my own choice?

339
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,350
That's because I didn't know

340
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,520
you were so misled on Earth.

341
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,280
You...

342
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,520
Xiaoqi.

343
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,000
If you continue to be so obstinate,

344
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,390
I will have to keep you
here for the time being

345
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,080
until you change your mind.

346
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,430
Shiyi.

347
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,960
Shiyi, let's talk about it again.

348
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,720
If you need anything,

349
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,910
just inform Candy.

350
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,870
Shiyi.

351
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,520
Shiyi.

352
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,080
Shiyi!

353
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,320
Shiyi!

354
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,040
She is missing?

355
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,190
How come?

356
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,720
I thought you were spending
the Chinese Valentine's Day

357
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,560
with Xiaoqi.

358
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,870
Has Chai seen her?

359
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,390
She left for a trip with
Dr. Zhang this morning.

360
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,150
She didn't text me either.

361
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,080
Something is off.

362
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,110
I can search for Xiaoqi's life signal

363
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,390
and then geolocate it.

364
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,040
(Searching)

365
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,620
(No signal detected)

366
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
This is weird.

367
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
(Searching again)

368
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
(No signal detected)

369
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,830
There's no sign of her life,

370
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,350
could she be...

371
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,240
Don't talk nonsense.

372
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,560
Something could have blocked the signal,

373
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
but what?

374
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,910
No signal blocker on Earth

375
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,720
should work on her.

376
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,680
(Sunny Apartment)

377
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,590
Mr. Fang.

378
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,670
It's not working hours, is it?

379
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,760
I came here to see you.

380
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
If you have something to say,
just say it here.

381
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,520
I didn't invite you in.

382
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
Where did you hide Xiaoqi?

383
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,040
What happened to Xiaoqi?

384
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,000
Who could have

385
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,110
concealed Xiaoqi's life signal but you?

386
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,040
Kubri.

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,720
You're a robot from Cape Town

388
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,630
and now you're helping...

389
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,670
two Earthlings.

390
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,760
You should know about
the violation of the rules.

391
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,390
Betrayal of our home planet

392
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,830
will be disposed.

393
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,000
I...

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Over my dead body.

395
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,320
Fang Lie.

396
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,560
Release Xiaoqi.

397
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
Where is Xiaoqi?

398
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,590
Mr. Fang.

399
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,800
She stood you up

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,390
on such an important day.

401
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,190
Don't you get it?

402
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,720
Face the truth, Mr. Fang.

403
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,520
Seven approached you

404
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,800
just to finish her mission.

405
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,870
She couldn't leave you before

406
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,870
because she was kind

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,150
and didn't want to hurt you.

408
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,240
Is that so?

409
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,480
But I know Xiaoqi.

410
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,560
She's not that kind of person.

411
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,350
Xiaoqi

412
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,630
has promised to return
to our home with me.

413
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,280
The reason she's avoiding you today

414
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,390
is to break up
with you once and for all.

415
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,830
As for

416
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,190
where she is,

417
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,630
I'm really sorry,

418
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,040
I have no idea.

419
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,590
It's late now.

420
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,590
Goodbye.

421
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,430
Master.

422
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,800
I don't understand.

423
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,190
Now that you have the hormone element,

424
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,110
why don't you just summon the spaceship

425
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,110
and bring Chai Xiaoqi
back to the home planet?

426
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,960
Xiaoqi is so misled now.

427
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,720
Even if I take her away by force,

428
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,390
she will not believe in

429
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,520
the genetic matching system,

430
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,630
let alone her faith in the home planet.

431
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,040
Do you think she could survive

432
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
on the home planet in her current state?

433
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,590
Therefore,

434
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,870
I must change her perception.

435
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,830
Chai Xiaoqi.

436
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,280
Don't waste your energy.

437
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,910
This entire room is sealed off.

438
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,430
You can't get out.

439
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Fang Leng must be worried.

440
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,960
Brother.

441
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,560
Don't worry.

442
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Xiaoqi has superpowers.

443
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,590
She won't get bullied.

444
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,720
Yes, Xiaoqi is so smart.

445
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,830
She must be looking for
a way to get back to us.

446
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,390
It wasn't all doom and gloom for us.

447
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
At least we know
from Jiang Shiyi's words

448
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,390
that he must have had something to do

449
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,830
with Xiaoqi's disappearance.

450
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,720
Brother.

451
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,830
Jiang Shiyi is so hostile towards you.

452
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,760
If you keep looking
for Xiaoqi like this,

453
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,560
will he use his superpowers against you?

454
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,110
Don't worry.

455
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,870
According to interstellar peace laws,

456
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,720
we are not allowed

457
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,910
to use our powers

458
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,080
to harm Earthlings.

459
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,720
The most important thing now

460
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,630
is to find out

461
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,390
where Xiaoqi is being held.

462
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,630
As soon as Jiang Shiyi leaves tomorrow,

463
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
we'll go there again.

464
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,150
He has an intelligent robot

465
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,870
inside the house, Candy.

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,560
We need to find a way to deal with her

467
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
if we want to get in.

468
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680
(Analyzing data)

469
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,360
(Analyzing data)

470
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,100
(Analyzing data)

471
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,800
I found it.

472
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,080
Candy.

473
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,630
It's not fun to stay at home

474
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,350
all the time.

475
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,480
I know a lot of

476
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,910
interesting places on Earth.

477
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,280
Would you like me to take you on a tour?

478
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,110
Earth is nothing more

479
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,870
than a crude pile of organic matter,

480
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,080
far behind the home planet
in terms of technology

481
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,110
and not at all worthy of touring.

482
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,080
My head hurts.

483
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,870
I'm sick, Candy.

484
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm not feeling well.

485
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,430
I have to get out
and go to the hospital.

486
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,390
I just need ten minutes

487
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,320
to see a doctor.

488
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,720
Please let me out.

489
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,590
You are physically healthy.

490
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,910
You are mentally sick

491
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,430
and need to overcome it yourself.

492
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
You're the one who's mentally sick.

493
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,590
You dumb robot.

494
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,520
Why did you attack me personally?

495
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,830
You're a bad friend.

496
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,110
Friend?

497
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,800
Yes.

498
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,830
You see,

499
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,910
I'm friends with Xiaobu.

500
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,870
You and Xiaobu

501
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,800
are both smart secretaries in Cape Town.

502
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,760
So you two must be friends, too.

503
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,870
That makes us

504
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,560
friends, too.

505
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,760
Friends should help each other.

506
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,240
Now I'm stuck here.

507
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
You should help me out as a friend,

508
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,590
right?

509
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
There is no logic to your statement.

510
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,520
I am the latest version 10.0 bot,

511
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,960
whereas Kubri is an old 3.0 model.

512
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,480
She and I have nothing in common at all,

513
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,910
let alone being friends.

514
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,560
You are so boring.

515
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,720
No wonder Xiaobu doesn't
want to be friends with you.

516
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,110
How come it's so quiet?

517
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,040
Are you looking for my master?

518
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,630
It's 10am.

519
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,110
He has gone to work.

520
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,980
(Checking the Internet)

521
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,040
(Internet disconnected)

522
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,390
Will that work?

523
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,080
I have disconnected

524
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,320
the wireless network of the whole area.

525
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,870
Candy should have shut down.

526
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,870
It's 10am.

527
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,240
Jiang Shiyi should be out soon.

528
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,350
Stick to the plan.

529
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,320
I'll warm myself up
and turn into a turtle.

530
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,240
Okay.

531
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,280
Okay.

532
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,760
(Searching signal)

533
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,260
(No signal detected)

534
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,350
The network has been disconnected.

535
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,870
Candy's signal is lost.

536
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,000
Then can you find Xiaoqi's life signal?

537
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,760
(Activating program)

538
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,860
(Searching)

539
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,580
(No signal detected)

540
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,830
No.

541
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,430
Let's split up and find her.

542
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,350
Then I'll look downstairs.

543
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,190
Do you think you can shut me down
just by cutting off the network?

544
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,630
That's ridiculous.

545
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,110
Xiaoqi.

546
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,670
Candy.

547
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,390
Strengthen the barrier.

548
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,720
Don't alarm them.

549
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,390
Master.

550
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Why not just drive them away?

551
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,480
They will leave on their own

552
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,390
if they can't find Xiaoqi.

553
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,590
The smell of hormones.

554
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,320
Xiaoqi.

555
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,760
Fang Leng!

556
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Fang Leng.

557
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,670
Fang Leng.

558
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,630
Fang Leng.

559
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,430
Fang Leng.

560
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,430
I'm here, Fang Leng.

561
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,320
Fang Leng.

562
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,390
Fang Leng.

563
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,080
Please don't ignore me.

564
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,430
Fang Leng, I am here.

565
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,910
Fang Leng.

566
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,870
Brother

567
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,590
Did you two find her?

568
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,830
No.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,870
Me neither.

570
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,760
What's going on?

571
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
Could it be that Xiaoqi is not here?

572
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,960
But when I was looking in the room,

573
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,110
felt like Seven was by my side.

574
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,390
Xiaobu.

575
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,320
Can you do another search?

576
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
(Activating program)

577
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,590
(No signal detected)
Still no results.

578
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,320
Let's go back.

579
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,630
Fang Leng.

580
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,830
I'm here.

581
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,830
Don't waste your time.

582
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,760
You are trapped in my barrier.

583
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,830
Fang Leng and you

584
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,480
exist in a different
biological dimension.

585
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,240
Fang Leng.

586
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,630
She's been like this

587
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,280
since Fang Leng left this afternoon.

588
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,350
Xiaoqi.

589
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,520
I think you should accept the reality.

590
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,830
No matter how sad you are...

591
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,320
Should I have been wiser?

592
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
I wish I were.

593
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,800
What do you mean?

594
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,910
Our home planet's philosophy

595
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,190
is so advanced.

596
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,520
Why would I insist on disobeying it?

597
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,280
And why would I, as an
advanced starling of Cape Town,

598
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,760
be influenced by
the inferior civilisation

599
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,630
of Earth?

600
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,760
It's so wrong.

601
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,110
Have you

602
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,670
come to your senses?

603
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,110
Right, Shiyi.

604
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,830
I have to thank you.

605
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,760
It's a good thing you locked me in here.

606
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,240
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been

607
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,190
able to reflect on what I've done

608
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,040
and see the true nature

609
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,480
of those Earthlings.

610
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,590
You're absolutely right.

611
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,080
The so-called love

612
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,630
is just a kind of

613
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,560
self-deception and emotional exhaustion.

614
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,590
There are no meaning and value at all.

615
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,430
It's that simple.

616
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,480
Why do I only understand now?

617
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,000
It's not too late

618
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,190
now that you've figured it out

619
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,080
Okay.

620
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,720
I will

621
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,040
call the spaceship now.

622
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,000
Let's go home.

623
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,040
Wait, Shiyi.

624
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,800
Before that,

625
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,040
can I do something important first?

626
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,670
What is it?

627
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,630
You have been keeping me
here for too long.

628
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm really hungry.

629
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,870
Can you take me to a nice restaurant?

630
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,040
Tell me what you want to eat.

631
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll buy it for you.

632
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
You still don't believe me.

633
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,590
Based on your previous record,

634
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,720
what you just said

635
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,430
is only 1% credible.

636
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,190
Believe it or not, I'll kill you first
when I get back.

637
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,390
Please.

638
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,560
I hope there aren't any more mishaps

639
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,040
before we get back.

640
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,280
Okay.

641
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,390
I promise.

642
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,480
However, the one I want to eat

643
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,240
will probably have a long queue.

644
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,960
No problem.

645
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,280
Jiang Shiyi has two bases

646
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,040
on Earth.

647
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,110
One is the residence,

648
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,830
the other is The One company.

649
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,350
In that case,

650
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,520
did Jiang Shiyi lock Xiaoqi up

651
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,590
in the company?

652
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,910
No.

653
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,350
I have a strong feeling

654
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,560
that Xiaoqi is being
held in Jiang Shiyi's house.

655
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,080
We just haven't found her.

656
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,800
We'll have to figure out

657
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,110
how to find her.

658
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,520
Xiaobu.

659
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,240
Keep monitoring.

660
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,560
(Real time monitoring)

661
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,080
Xiaoqi.

662
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,910
Wait for me.

663
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,520
Here's your coffee.

664
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,280
Have a nice day.

665
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,000
Thank you.

666
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,480
Hello.

667
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,760
Any recommendations?

668
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,560
We have the latest matcha latte.

669
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,960
Then I'd like two lattes
and two slices of cake.

670
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,110
Okay.

671
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,110
Two lattes
and two slices of cake, right?

672
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,760
Hello, here's your coffee.

673
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,800
Thank you.

674
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,560
Have a nice day.

675
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,960
Hello, what can I get for you?

676
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,520
I'd like a cup of coffee.

677
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,790
Okay, a cup of coffee.

678
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,560
Here.

679
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,960
You...

680
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,440
Sir, what can I get for you?

681
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,960
I want the blue cake over there.

682
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,560
Sir, this cake needs to be pre-ordered.

683
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,880
It will take about half an hour.

684
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,270
It's fine.

685
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,750
I can wait.

686
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,750
Okay.

687
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,110
Wait.

688
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,040
Is there a fried chicken place nearby?

689
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,790
Why are the robots

690
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,960
getting worse with
each passing generation?

691
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,520
Pardon?

692
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,670
Look at Xiaobu.

693
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,710
She has daily hibernation time

694
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,040
to fix bugs

695
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,630
and update program functions.

696
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,750
You, on the other hand,

697
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,750
don't even have a resting time.

698
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,880
You stay on every day.

699
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,790
What's the difference between you

700
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,750
and these light bulbs?

701
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,230
They are so much like you.

702
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,360
Candy is the latest

703
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,790
10.0 intelligent secretary.

704
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,520
I've never received
such an insult before.

705
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,520
Just you wait.

706
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,190
I'll hibernate now.

707
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,360
Okay.

708
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,230
If you can do that,

709
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,000
I'll admit that you're
better than Xiaobu.

710
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,360
Wait.

711
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,230
You're not trying to trick me

712
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,440
and escape while I hibernate, are you?

713
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,630
You think too highly of me.

714
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,310
Could I possibly be that clever?

715
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,520
Moreover,

716
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,920
can I break through

717
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,880
your master's barrier
with my powers?

718
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,000
No way.

719
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,110
That makes sense.

720
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,840
I'll hibernate now.

721
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,840
(Real time monitoring)

722
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,270
Sir, your cake.

723
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,560
Thank you.

724
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,080
(Unusual magnetic field)

725
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
What does this mean?

726
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,150
A powerful

727
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,920
magnetic field fluctuation
is displayed nearby.

728
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,190
Does it show the fluctuation range?

729
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,560
(Sunny Apartment)

730
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,310
It takes too much energy
to break through the barrier.

731
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,110
I can't even use my teleportation.
