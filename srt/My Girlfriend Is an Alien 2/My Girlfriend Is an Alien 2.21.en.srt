Come here.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,910
Let me see.

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,350
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

Mum, wake up.

00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,240
Mum.

35
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,750
Wake up.

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,510
Get up, mum.

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,630
Don't scare me.

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,120
Mum!

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,030
Dad.

40
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,560
Where's mum?

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Leng.

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,910
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,030
Sleep well.

44
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,440
When you wake up,

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,030
your mother will be here.

46
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,190
Mr. Fang.

47
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,000
He is suffering from
selective memory loss

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,190
caused by shock.

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,150
You were too young at the time.

50
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
I was afraid that this incident

51
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,070
would leave a scar on you.

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,950
I was also afraid
that the public opinion

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,070
would affect you.

54
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,150
So I made up this whole cheating story.

55
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,190
I thought

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,310
this would

57
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,480
make your life easier,

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,360
but I never thought
you would hate me for so long.

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,680
You even hid your amnesia from me.

60
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,630
So are you saying that
mum died because of me?

61
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,190
No.

62
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,000
He told you this

63
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,000
not to make you feel guilty.

64
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,390
He...

65
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,510
He just doesn't want you

66
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,310
to get caught up in the memories.

67
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,120
Don't forget

68
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,680
those who love and care for you now.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
It's all in the past.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Xiaoqi was right.

71
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,750
If you can

72
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,920
take it easy

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
and be happier,

74
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,630
your mother will be pleased.

75
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,950
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,510
You've done so much for me,

77
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,800
yet I've said so many bad things.

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,630
Sorry.

79
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,750
I am your father.

80
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,510
If I don't look after you,

81
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
who else will?

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
It's okay.

83
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,000
It's okay.

84
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,950
Xiaoqi.

85
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,070
Thank you.

86
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,000
I wonder

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,880
if this will cure your amnesia,

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
but nonetheless,

89
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,950
I will always be there for you.

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,440
For how long?

91
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,360
Forever. How about that?

92
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,680
I love you. So I'll always be with you.

93
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,710
What's with your expression?

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm just a little surprised.

95
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,950
You hardly ever say you love me.

96
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
(I've bought many sweets. Come take when you're free.)
I said it. You just don't remember.

97
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
It's okay.

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,070
I only decided yesterday.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,680
What decision?

100
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,710
Nothing.

101
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,440
I will always love you

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,950
and be good to you. I mean it.

103
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
So don't be surprised.

104
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,150
Just get used to it.

105
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,480
I love you, too.

106
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
Look at this watch.

107
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,630
This is a luxury limited edition.

108
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
It is perfect for you.

109
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,150
Do you like it?

110
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,600
And this American Ginseng.

111
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,960
It's very nutritious.

112
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,240
Sadly, it's not
available in our country.

113
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,480
Make sure you eat it.

114
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
Fang Leng has lost weight recently.

115
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,320
He can have this.

116
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,630
Is that so?

117
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,750
What?

118
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,320
Did you meet up with Fang Leng?

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
Did he cause trouble

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
at work again?

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
That's not it.

122
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,750
We just met and chatted.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,430
You did?

124
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,240
I didn't expect you guys

125
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,720
to get on so well when I went abroad.

126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,390
It must have something
to do with Chai Xiaoqi.

127
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,320
She insisted on meeting Shida today.

128
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,910
I couldn't stop her.

129
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
No wonder

130
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,790
the two of them

131
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,550
got so close all of a sudden.

132
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,430
When I was at home before,

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,030
Shida would never mention Fang Leng.

134
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,150
However, just now when
I showed him the souvenirs,

135
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,960
Fang Leng was the first
person he thought of.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
Fang Leng's three-year assessment
period is coming to an end.

137
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,600
Their reconciliation

138
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
is clearly deliberate.

139
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,430
Don't worry.

140
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
No one will be convinced

141
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,550
that a person with amnesia

142
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,120
can be a good president.

143
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,030
Sister.

144
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,910
What do you mean?

145
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Check the weather forecast

146
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,150
to see which days will be raining.

147
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,390
Also, inform your recent female clients.

148
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,360
I will

149
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,630
catch him off guard this time.

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,840
Okay.

151
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,750
This was the smell from that night.

152
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,240
Great.

153
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,390
After so much research,

154
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,240
the first pheromone perfume
has finally been developed.

155
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,000
Mr. Fang.

156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,790
I've taken notes on Ms. Chai's formula.

157
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,240
At the current production rate,

158
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
our pheromone perfume

159
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
will be launched in a week at the most.

160
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Great.

161
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,670
Mr. Fang!

162
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Something's up.

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,750
It's already late.

164
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,630
Mr. Fang is not running away, is he?

165
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,630
Impossible.

166
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,600
Directors and important
clients are all here.

167
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,960
If he doesn't come,

168
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
it's no different from resigning.

169
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
Mr. Fang, this is Ms. Li of Huayu Group.

170
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,480
- Mr. Fang.
- Our partner in the makeup project.

171
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,880
This is Ms. Wang of Tiansheng Group.

172
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,600
One of the investors
of our research department.

173
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,030
- This is Ms. Lin of Haisheng Group.
- Enough.

174
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,630
It's going to rain soon.

175
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,750
This doesn't help.

176
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,720
Sister.

177
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,600
Let's await his downfall today.

178
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm sorry

179
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,750
for being late.

180
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,670
Mr. Fang.

181
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,030
Today's board meeting is to discuss

182
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,270
the future development plans
of Future Group.

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,600
Although it is an impromptu meeting,

184
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,030
it does not mean
that it is not important.

185
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,750
Not only are you late today,

186
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,270
you brought two outsiders with you.

187
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,600
This is kind of rude.

188
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,390
One is my assistant,

189
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,720
the other is the most important
perfumer in the Research Department.

190
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,600
They are also part of the company.

191
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,120
So I don't think it's weird

192
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,670
that they are here
for the future development

193
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,550
of Future Group.

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,670
If we're being strict about outsiders,

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
it is even odd for you to come

196
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,880
since you are not
an employee of the company.

197
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
Future Group is our family's business.

198
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,430
It's not a problem for me

199
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,080
to come and observe, right?

200
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,550
Mr. Fang.

201
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,750
Although many of our regular clients

202
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,270
are old acquaintances,

203
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,150
there are also new clients

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,600
that we are meeting for the first time.

205
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,390
Mr. Fang, please introduce them to us.

206
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,670
Mr. Fang.

207
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,270
Why are you so silent?

208
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,150
These are some of
our most important clients.

209
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,630
You haven't forgotten them, have you?

210
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,630
Sorry.

211
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,150
Mr. Fang is not feeling well today.

212
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,430
Please bear with him.

213
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,790
Mr. Fang hasn't even spoken yet.

214
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,790
Why are you interrupting?

215
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Sister.

216
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,510
Mr. Fang.

217
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,790
You have to introduce us.

218
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,430
We are all waiting.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,390
It's not the first time we've met.

220
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,670
There is no need for an introduction.

221
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,910
What a bummer.

222
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,150
It's raining.

223
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,910
Mr. Fang, I heard that
you have a kind of amnesia.

224
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,720
Whenever it rains, you suffer from it.

225
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,840
You are hesitant to speak.

226
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,320
Is it because of your amnesia?

227
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
Don't talk nonsense.

228
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,270
There is no such disease.

229
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,270
No.

230
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,630
I hope this is not true either.

231
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,200
If a person with amnesia

232
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,030
takes control of the company,

233
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,360
I don't think people will feel at ease.

234
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,120
Mr. Fang, I heard that
you have a kind of amnesia.

235
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,670
They are very important
clients of the company.

236
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,510
Leng.

237
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,480
Leng!

238
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Your mother will be pleased.

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,960
Mr. Fang.

240
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
Is it so difficult to
make an introduction?

241
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
Since you don't know us,

242
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,360
we don't have to

243
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,600
waste any more time.

244
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,030
Wait.

245
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Ms. Li.

246
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,790
Aren't you interested

247
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,720
in our hormone project?

248
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,960
If you leave now,

249
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,880
how can we go further

250
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
with the contract?

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,950
Please have a seat.

252
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,190
Ms. Li, please sit down.

253
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,600
Sister.

254
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,560
I wasn't feeling too well just now.

256
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,470
I'm sorry for the delay.

257
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,470
This is Ms. Li of Huayu Group.

258
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,390
Ms. Li has recently worked with us

259
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,560
on a makeup project.

260
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,320
We are also

261
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,040
discussing plans for
the pheromone perfume.

262
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
This is Ms. Wang of Tiansheng Group.

263
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,710
She is one of the investors
of our Research Department.

264
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,120
All instruments

265
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,040
are imported from abroad by her.

266
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,760
Thank you.

267
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,040
- And Ms. Xiao of Tianwen Group.
- What's going on?

268
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,560
She is in charge of

269
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
all our company's advertising.

270
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,120
I will need your help

271
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,990
with the new perfumes, too.

272
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,190
These are our recent clients.

273
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,040
Do you have any questions?

274
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,520
This is odd.

275
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,360
You shouldn't be
able to say their names.

276
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,630
I think you misunderstood.

277
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910
I have never had

278
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,710
the amnesia you mentioned.

279
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,670
Forget it.

280
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
Stop pretending.

281
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I've already checked

282
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,230
your medical record this time abroad.

283
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,710
Take a look.

284
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,710
It is written here

285
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,190
that the patient suffers from
heterosexual amnesia on rainy days.

286
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,360
Mr. Fang.

287
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,470
I didn't wrong you.

288
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,950
Mr. Fang.

289
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,230
Why didn't you

290
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,910
tell us all that you were ill?

291
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,990
Or do you clearly know

292
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,190
that a mentally ill person

293
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,760
is not qualified to be
the CEO of Future Group?

294
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,910
Who says he is not qualified?

295
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,950
Shida?

296
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,230
What brings you here?

297
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
As you know,

298
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,190
I gave Fang Leng three years

299
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,840
as the CEO's appraisal period.

300
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,710
Although the period is not yet up,

301
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,950
it is obvious to all

302
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,760
that Fang Leng's ability and personality

303
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,470
can definitely undertake
the position of president.

304
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
So I decided

305
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,600
to end the assessment early.

306
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,670
As of today,

307
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,120
Fang Leng will assume the position

308
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,760
of CEO of Future Group.

309
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,230
Great.

310
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:49,800
Sister.

311
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,630
Shida.

312
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,360
You don't know that

313
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,560
Fang Leng has amnesia, do you?

314
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,320
Are you sure you want to

315
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,280
entrust such a big company to him?

316
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,800
This is a company,

317
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,280
not a place for you to mess around.

318
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,190
You...

319
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,120
Fine.

320
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,990
Sister.

321
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,950
Sister.

322
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,320
Thank you, dad.

323
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,360
And thank you all for your support.

324
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,080
In fact, I think Uncle Kang's agenda

325
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,390
for today's meeting is very good.

326
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,710
You are all welcome

327
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,360
to discuss

328
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,150
the future plans for Future Group.

329
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,910
Well, just ten minutes
before this meeting,

330
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,990
Research Department has officially

331
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,430
developed the first pheromone perfume.

332
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,840
We have also confirmed
the production plan

333
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,230
and launch date.

334
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,520
From my standpoint, this is
the future of our company.

335
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,910
I will continue to innovate products

336
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,630
and lead the market.

337
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,150
At the same time, work pragmatically,

338
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,910
rather than relying on
some hidden agenda

339
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,910
and subterfuge.

340
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm so glad that you're finally healed.

341
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,120
Did your head hurt a lot just now?

342
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm fine.

343
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,080
I think I just saw something

344
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,230
that hasn't happened between us yet.

345
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,950
You're overthinking it.

346
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,840
Maybe it was just a hallucination.

347
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,430
That must be it.

348
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,560
The perfume launch is coming up.

349
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,040
Let's get ready for that.

350
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,320
- Yes?
- Yes?

351
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,430
- We broke up.
- We broke up.

352
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,800
(P1 Lounge)

353
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,670
I had to go through a lot of trouble

354
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,150
to sneak back into the country

355
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,430
without my mother's knowledge
in order to draw.

356
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,710
I thought I was going
to start my artistic career,

357
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,560
but I've been doing it for so long

358
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,080
without any results.

359
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,190
I was able to hold on until now

360
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,880
thanks to Xiaobu.

361
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,950
Then she suddenly told me
she wanted to break up.

362
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,670
Brother.

363
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,470
Shall I quit drawing?

364
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
Shall I go abroad

365
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,470
to do an MBA?

366
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,190
At least my mother will be happy.

367
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,910
Can you explain

368
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,280
what really happened today?

369
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,950
After I finished my drawing in
the studio this afternoon,

370
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,950
we...

371
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm at the door. I need to talk to you.

372
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,560
Xiaobu.

373
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,190
Let's break up.

374
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,560
Stop kidding around.

375
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
It's not April Fool's Day.

376
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,470
Look.

377
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,520
I have a present for you.

378
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,840
I've been working on it for a long time.

379
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:57,990
Sorry.

380
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm really happy

381
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,190
when I'm with you,

382
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,520
but we just don't click.

383
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,670
You're a good man,

384
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,560
but I'm not good enough for you.

385
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,230
Are you being serious?

386
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,280
Let's just be friends.

387
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,430
Xiaobu.

388
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,280
I know I'm childish,
playful and immature.

389
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,360
Although I've been painting,

390
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,840
I rely on my brother for my livelihood.

391
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,430
Don't worry, I'll change.

392
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,470
If there is anything else

393
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
you are not happy with...

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,710
Enough, stop it.

395
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,950
We're not for each other.

396
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,990
What do you mean?

397
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,360
A relationship is a two-person thing.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,040
You can't...

399
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,910
Breaking up is a one-person thing.

400
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,390
Sorry, I've made up my mind.

401
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,430
Why

402
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
am I so sad?

403
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,710
(System alert)

404
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,430
I went to the park,

405
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,600
jumped into the lake

406
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,710
and waited until
I cooled down to become human.

407
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,880
I think you're taking up

408
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,390
too much space with that heart.

409
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,040
You can't even use your superpowers.

410
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,360
I tried all sorts of things,

411
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,670
but still couldn't uninstall it.

412
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,800
Then I thought

413
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,710
it all started because of Fang Lie.

414
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,360
So the only way

415
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,630
was to break up.

416
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,320
But isn't what you said to him

417
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,280
a little too harsh?

418
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,990
It was some of the hurtful breakup lines

419
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,470
I've seen on the internet.

420
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,600
It stated

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,190
that breaking up is like getting a shot.

422
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,910
The quicker you go,
the stronger the force.

423
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
The less pain
the other person will feel.

424
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,670
So I suppose

425
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
Fang Lie won't be too sad.

426
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,670
Brother.

427
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,880
She's left.

428
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,040
She didn't even look back.

429
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,080
Brother.

430
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,880
She no longer wants me.

431
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,630
Give me Long Island iced tea.

432
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,190
- What shall I do?
- By the way,

433
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,080
without vodka, less tequila.

434
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,150
- I'll never love again.
- Okay.

435
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,910
And a glass of warm

436
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,710
honey tomato juice.

437
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,080
Brother.

438
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,990
Don't girls are just throwing tantrums

439
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,670
when they say they want to break up?

440
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,390
Why is Xiaobu

441
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,600
different from the other girls?

442
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,710
And potato chips, please.

443
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,880
One moment, sir.

444
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,280
Brother.

445
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm crying like this.

446
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,230
Why don't you comfort me?

447
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,320
I ordered the Long Island iced tea

448
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,670
for broken hearts,

449
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,230
a hangover drink

450
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,390
and your favourite potato chips.

451
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,150
Fang Lie.

452
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,390
No matter what happens to you
since you were a kid,

453
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,760
your first reaction is to give up.

454
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,840
Sometimes, I envy you.

455
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,430
Why?

456
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,950
I envy you for having

457
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,990
a brother who treats you so well.

458
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
Otherwise, who will save you?

459
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,800
Brother.

460
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,320
This time it's a breakup.

461
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,230
It's not the same as before.

462
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,950
You haven't experienced it.
You don't understand.

463
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,190
Have you ever seen a guy

464
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
pretend to lose his memory
from a car accident

465
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,520
to keep his girlfriend by his side?

466
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,040
Who would be so stupid

467
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,600
as to use such an old-fashioned trick?

468
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,320
Me.

469
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,630
I didn't know you were so bold.

470
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,280
Listen.

471
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,190
A person can be vulnerable

472
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,990
in front of someone they like.

473
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,950
However, you mustn't give up.

474
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,470
What else can I do if I don't give up?

475
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,840
I've been holding out for so long,

476
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,430
but it's still fruitless.

477
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,670
Can't you hold on any longer?

478
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,190
Can't you just try harder?

479
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,520
You've done your drawings.

480
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,840
Why don't you enter a competition?

481
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,190
Don't you like Xiaobu very much?

482
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,150
Why can't you pursue her back?

483
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,910
Do you think you are persistent enough?

484
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,710
Listen.

485
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,840
You may seem childish to me sometimes,

486
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,880
but I understand you.

487
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,600
You're not really a weak man.

488
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,950
Do you understand?

489
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,710
(System alert)

490
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,080
(System alert)
What happened?

491
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,470
(System alert)
Why is this heart

492
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,430
(System alert)
getting worse after the breakup?

493
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,760
You...

494
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,670
Do you want to ask Jiang Shiyi

495
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,390
to overhaul it?

496
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,320
No.

497
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,560
Then, Jiang Shiyi will know

498
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,990
about my relationship with Fang Lie.

499
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,910
What if he scraps me on the spot?

500
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,840
You have a point.

501
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
That won't do.

502
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,040
Did you tell Jiang Shiyi

503
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,390
about your feelings for Fang Leng?

504
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,800
I've been too busy lately.

505
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,670
I'll wait until

506
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,320
after the launch of the perfume.

507
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,200
(System alert)

508
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,080
Destiny Lover is

509
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,040
the first pheromone perfume
from Future Group.

510
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,470
It was created with the intention

511
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,840
of generating a feeling of being in love

512
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,800
when someone uses it.

513
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,760
To achieve this effect,

514
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,950
we conducted many experiments

515
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,230
and found out that

516
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,840
this pheromone perfume

517
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,390
can really attract people.

518
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,880
And it has a distinctive fragrance.

519
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,470
These real inspirations

520
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,990
led to the creation of this perfume.

521
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,360
Thanks to Mr. Fang for his sharing.

522
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,430
Next is the Q&A session.

523
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,710
This lady.

524
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,360
Mr. Fang.

525
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,950
This perfume is
the highest priced perfume

526
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,430
in Future Group.

527
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,230
Do you concern that sales
will be reduced correspondingly?

528
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,080
Thank you.

529
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,840
In fact, I think good products

530
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,670
can naturally withstand
the test of the market.

531
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,150
I also believe the taste
of customers nowadays.

532
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,520
Thus, I am

533
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,320
confident with this perfume.

534
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,950
Mr. Fang.

535
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,800
The perfumer is said

536
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
to be a newcomer.

537
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,080
So we're curious

538
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,880
as to why you would
entrust such an important task

539
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,230
to a newcomer.

540
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,040
She was the inspiration for the project.

541
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,080
It is thanks to her

542
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,430
that this perfume has come into being.

543
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,840
Actually

544
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,150
she is a very gifted person.

545
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,950
I'm sure she'll bring

546
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,320
a different kind
of surprise to all of us.

547
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,390
Let's wait for the good news.

548
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,520
Thank you.

549
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,120
Candy.

550
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,840
We can go home now.

551
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,080
Oh, right.

552
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,080
So,

553
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,080
are you happy?

554
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,190
I'm very happy.

555
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,710
Everyone loves your perfume.

556
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,390
The first day of pre-sale today

557
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,630
has broken the record for
the best-selling perfume

558
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,910
in the history of Future Group.

559
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,040
I never knew

560
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
I was so capable.

561
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,280
Close your eyes.

562
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,950
Close my eyes?

563
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,230
Why?

564
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,360
Just close your eyes.

565
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,600
What is this?

566
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,910
This is the perfume I made just for you.

567
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,880
I've got a name for it.

568
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,840
Cold Outside, Warm Inside.

569
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,320
Also known as Fang Leng.

570
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,840
Does it smell good?

571
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
I like it.

572
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,150
Apply some on you.

573
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,710
Here.

574
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,560
Thanks.

575
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,230
Do I get a small gift

576
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,040
for all the work I've done?

577
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,390
Of course.

578
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Go and sit over there.

579
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,470
Okay.

580
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,670
You can just buy some fried chicken.

581
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,360
Fried chicken?

582
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,710
How will that be enough?

583
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,080
Sit down.

584
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,470

It's so nice.

604
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,760
What is the name of this song?

605
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,360
This song is called Destiny Lover.

606
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,110
It has the same name as the perfume.

607
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,840
I wrote this song in secret

608
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,430
when I was thinking of
the name of the perfume.

609
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,680
So the name of the perfume and the song

610
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,990
are both dedicated to you.

611
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
Thank you, Xiaoqi.

612
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,990
Xiaoqi.

613
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,550
Shiyi.

614
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,200
Xiaoqi.

615
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,640
Here's the highest
concentration of the hormone.

616
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,030
The mission is finally complete.

617
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,800
Xiaoqi.

618
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,070
I will contact the home now.

619
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,320
We can leave tonight.

620
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I want to stay.

621
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,070
Pardon?

622
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,510
I know the mission
has been accomplished,

623
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,680
but I want to stay on Earth now.

624
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,070
I want to be with Fang Leng.

625
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,990
Xiaoqi.

626
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,840
You know you're here this time

627
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,590
to make amends.

628
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,240
Fang Leng lied to you.

629
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,360
Why did you fall for it again?

630
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,910
Let's go.

631
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,720
Shiyi.

632
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,590
Fang Leng didn't lie to me.

633
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,990
I know he loves me.

634
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,160
I love him, too.

635
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,880
We don't need love.

636
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,200
You'll know when you meet

637
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
someone you love very much.

638
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,950
You just want to have
an affectionate life with that person.

639
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,360
After I met Fang Leng,

640
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,590
I didn't want to go back

641
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,470
and live an emotionless life.

642
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,550
Do you know that what you are doing now

643
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,640
is against the beliefs of our planet?

644
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,840
What if the beliefs

645
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,360
are wrong?

646
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,680
Our planet will only keep stressing

647
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,360
how to develop technology,

648
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,910
but will neglect the primitive emotions

649
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,030
that we are supposed
to have as living beings.

650
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,950
So the planet may be wrong.

651
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,070
Okay.

652
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,430
Let's put aside what is right
and what is wrong.

653
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,590
All I know is that you will be punished

654
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
if you go your own way.

655
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,030
You will be exiled to the universe.

656
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,950
Even if you're hiding on Earth now,

657
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,550
that means you've given up

658
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,840
all the privileges of
being a higher creature.

659
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,030
Whatever the outcome,

660
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,240
I accept it.

661
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,430
Now, I just want to cherish the moment.

662
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,510
I want to stay here with Fang Leng.

663
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,030
I'll get going.

664
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,550
I haven't thanked you yet.

665
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
Thank you for completing
the mission with me.

666
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,070
Bye.

667
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,550
Take care.

668
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm willing.

669
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,160
I am willing to vouch for Xiaoqi

670
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,240
as a candidate for Chief.

671
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,470
This time it saved your life,

672
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,360
but hopefully next time,

673
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,360
you won't be influenced
by hormones again.

674
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,840
Xiaoqi.

675
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,030
I will prove to you

676
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,510
that this is all a lie.
