I'll help shield you with the umbrella.

Thank you.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,759
Did you fight with Mr. Fang?

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,759
It's not like that.

24
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,879
It's just a small misunderstanding.

25

Thanks.

What do you think?

28
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,000
Did it help lift your mood?

29
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,439
It's pretty good.

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Sure enough, sweets can lift your mood.

31
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,560
From where I'm from

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,199
when I was young,

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,000
sweets are foreign treats.

34
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,719
Whenever I'm feeling down,

35
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,879
I'll have one.

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
My mood will be better after that.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
I used to be able to have great moods.

38
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,520
But ever since I met Fang Leng,

39
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been worrying a lot.

40
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,599
Seems like I need to prepare
more of these sweets.

41
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,080
Where did you get them?

42
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,520
How can I ever tell you?

43
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,280
If I tell you,

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,360
wouldn't I run out of business?

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Forget it. Look.

46
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,039
It's drenched.

47
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,520
Don't continue sitting here.
You'll catch a cold.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,759
Why don't I send you home?

49
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,039
Has your mood adjusted for the better?

50
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,159
Slowly. It's slippery here.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,560
Alright.

52
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,840
I'll see you off here.

53
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,759
Thanks for sending me home.

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
It's nothing.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
Call me anytime whenever you
feel like having sweets.

56
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,319
I'll treat you.

57
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,360
Thank you.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Also,

59
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,759
when you're feeling down,

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
let me know too.

61
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm willing to be your friend.

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,959
Why does your smile

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
look so familiar?

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
It's like we've met before.

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,879
In that case,

66
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,759
we should be friends even more, right?

67
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,120
You're right.

68
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,839
Come.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,560
Okay.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Seal of approval.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Sure.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Alright, hurry and go in.

73
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,720
Bye-bye.

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,319
I understood what you meant.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,879
After having contact with him,

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,040
I think Mr. Fang is quite reliable.

77
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,800
As a senior,

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,519
you should give more room
for your juniors to grow.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
How did Mr. Fang persuade you?

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
Still, I'm not the only one
who thinks that

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
he's incapable of handling this matter.

82
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,360
I still have business to attend to. Farewell.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Sure.

84
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,759
Bye, Lihua.

85
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,319
Mr. Fang.

86
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,040
You...

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
What happened to you?

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,879
Are you alright?

89
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,600
Hello, Ms. Li.

90
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Ms. Li?

91
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,000
Say, Mr. Fang.

92
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
You only got rained on

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,439
but you've already forgotten

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,720
Ms. Chen's surname?

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,639
Mr. Fang sure is a forgetful person
of high rank.

96
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,439
Then, I'll get going.

97
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,360
Ms. Chen, have a safe trip.

98
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,000
Have a safe trip, Ms. Chen.

99
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,399
Mr. Fang. I'm here.

100
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,800
Why did it suddenly rain?

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,480
Didn't you...

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,279
It's fine.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
Your encounter with
Ms. Chen's too little.

104
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,279
Even if you knew her for a long time,

105
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,120
it'll be difficult
to form a deep memory.

106
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,839

Didn't you go shopping with her earlier?

109
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
How could you forget so quickly?

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
Anyway, no matter.

111
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll introduce her grandly once more.

That's your true love, your destined partner.

Who told you we're destined partners?

114
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,839
Go and notify Chai Xiaoqi

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
that she's fired.

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,279
You scared me for a moment there.

117
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,480
It's good that you didn't forget.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,519
Mr. Fang.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
You're laying off Ms. Chai

120
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,639
because you want to
make her your wife, right?

Hello?

125
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,839
I got fired.

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
It'll be fine.

127

Didn't you commit many things
that are out-of-line?

128
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,720
Mr. Fang always forgave you, right?

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,120
But I have a feeling that

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
he's more furious than ever this time.

131
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,160
It's different from how he usually is.

132
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,079
I saw a quote online once.

133
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,199
It said that misunderstandings between
a man and a woman are like a concoction.

134
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,240
Once everything's cleared, their
relationship will be even better.

Book a hotel for me tonight.

139
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,639
You're not going back home tonight?

140

Who knows.

141
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,600
Maybe Ms. Chai wants to explain herself.

142
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll book immediately.

143
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,959
If you dare tell her

144
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,439
the address of the hotel,

145
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,920
you don't have to come in
for work tomorrow as well.

146

Mr. Fang, please be rest assured.

Why is he staying at a hotel?

151
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,799
Could it be that he doesn't
want anything to do with me anymore?

152
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,639
I shouldn't have lied
from the beginning.

153

The thing is,

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,879
I don't mean to lie to him.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
What should I do?

156

Just apologize will do.

Let me tell you two.

159
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,320
As long as your apology

160
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
is done with a sincere heart

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,399
and some affection,

162
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,360
you'll definitely be forgiven.

What did you two lie to me about?

171
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,720
We're just joking.
We've never lied to you before.

172
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,159
So did you two lie to me or not?

173
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,200
- We didn't.
- Actually, we've lied

174
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
to you ever since our first meeting.

175
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
We were lying about us joking.

176
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,039
We can't lie to Sister Chai anymore.
We need to tell her the truth.

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,639
Actually, we're not...

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
I knew it from the beginning.

179
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,120
Are you planning to say that

180
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,240
the both of you are not
Chunjiao's daughters?

181
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
Last time, the landlady called me.

182
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,399
She mentioned before that

183
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,879
her daughter had migrated overseas.

184
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,200
Then...why are you not angry?

185
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,960
It's not like I stayed with you kids

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,799
for only a short while now.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,080
I know that you two are good children.

188
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,519
The lie at the beginning must
be because you two didn't have a choice.

189
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,240
Only those who are cornered will do so.

190
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Am I right?

191
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
Besides.

192
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
You two are terrible at lying.

193
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,600
If I did not take you two in,

194
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
what'll happen to both of you outside?

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
-Thank you.
-Sister Chai.

196
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I deliver more takeaways to repay you.

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,159
Then I'll help Sister Chai
keep more money.

198
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,559
Be careful, you two.

199
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,559
This eye mask is new.

200
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,360
Xiaoqi.

201
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,480
If you really want to repay me,

202
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,000
hurry and apologize to Mr. Fang.

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,360
In the future,

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,480
my coastal style hotel

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,120
still needs
Mr. Fang's investment support.

206
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
You're right. That's a fact.

207
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,100
(Kaiyue Hotel)

208
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
What I wanted to say is

209
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,159
our overall summary report

210
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,440
needs more summarizing.

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,360
Hello. Room service.

212
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,679
Please wait a moment.

213
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,159
Put the food on the table will do.

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,039
Mr. Wang, do you have
anything to comment on?

215
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
Regarding page six in the document,

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,639
profitability needs to be readjusted.

217
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,060
The marketing department will

218
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,300
(Sorry)
have to re-formulate the plan.

219
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,320
Mr. Fang.

220
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,440
Mr. Fang.

221
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,840
Do you still have matters
to attend to at the hotel?

222
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
I've told you all before.
During meetings,

223
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,279
don't mention personal matters.

224
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,840
Also, on page eight.

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,399
Remember well.

226
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,559
The quarterly feedback must be updated.

227
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,919
Especially since our last meeting.

228
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,279
This issue had been
brought up at that time.

229
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,799
Advertising department,
are you listening?

230
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,879
Do you still remember?

231
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,799
Mr. Fang.

232
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,679
Why don't

233
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,320
you settle your personal matter first?

234
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,519
How many times did I tell you?

235
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,639
No matter what happens,

236
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,159
our meeting can't be interrupted.

237
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,000
What are all of you trying to say?

238
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,679
♪I'm afraid that
I'll be late to tell you♪

239
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,919
♪As long as
Fang Leng forgives Xiao Qi♪

240
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,440
♪Xiao Qi can only be happy that way♪

241
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,000
♪As long as Fang Leng forgives Xiao Qi♪

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
♪Xiao Qi can only be happy that way♪

243
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,200
What are you singing?

244
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,679
I'm apologizing to you.

245
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,559
Once you eat this forgiveness cake,

246
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,679
you'll be full of energy
and not be angry.

247
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,039
Mr. Han.

248
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,440
Call security for me.

249
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,320
No. Stop. Please don't.

250
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,840
Who asked you not to go home tonight?

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,440
You didn't even give me
chance to apologize.

252
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,799
I can't say it even if I wanted to.

253
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,919
Give me 10 minutes.

254
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,039
I have no mood to listen to you.

255
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,919
Five minutes.

256
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,000
- I need to work.
- Three minutes.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,679
I have a meeting.

258
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,399
One minute.

259
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,000
Sure.

260
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,600
It's about...

261
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,559
What I want to say is...

262
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,360
What did I want to say again?

263
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,039
Why don't you ask me then?

264
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,080
Ask whatever you'd like.

265
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,440
I promise not to lie.

266
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,679
Okay then.

267
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,720
Please tell me.

268
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
Why're you pretending to be my neighbor?

269
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,000
(I definitely can't tell you this.)

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
(It's to collect hormones.)

271
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,919
This...

272
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,200
I can't tell you.

273
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Then why must you pretend

274
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
to be my ex-girlfriend?

275
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,360
(I was worried that my alien identity
will be exposed.)

276
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,720
(I didn't have a choice.)

277
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,200
I...I can't tell you this either.

278
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,440
Why did you approach me
in the beginning?

279
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,919
(Because I want to collect
your hormones of course.)

280
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,039
This...

281
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
I can't tell you.

282
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,879
Chai Xiaoqi.

283
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,440
You said you specially came here

284
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,559
to apologize to me.

285
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
But since just now,

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,759
you didn't even give
a single explanation.

287
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,879
I've really never met

288
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,519
someone as shameless as you.

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,639
That's not it. Please...

290
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,120
Don't appear in front of me again.

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,399
If not, I'll call the police.

292
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
Police? Anything but that.

293
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,279
You can't call the police.

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,159
Anyhow, I've made perfumes
for your company.

295
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm of value to the company.

296
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,320
You can't fire me.

297
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,399
The Future Group

298
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,919
doesn't need a liar for a worker.

299
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,679
That...that won't do.

300
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
I remember for the Future Group,

301
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,320
written in the contract agreement,

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
unless a serious mistake has been made,

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,559
the company can't
just fire their workers.

304
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,279
Also, those that are derelict at work.

305
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,679
I don't fit into any of those two.

306
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,519
Why am I fired? I can't accept it.

307
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,480
Above article 33 on the fourth page.

308
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,120
What kind of
contract agreement was that?

309
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Who wrote it for you?

310
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,480
An unknown old man.

311
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,799
What are you even talking about?

312
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm telling you the truth
but you don't believe me.

313
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,279
That's your problem.

314
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,399
I can allow you to continue
working for the company.

315
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,279
But whether or not you could take it,

316
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,879
that's up to you.

317
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,879
What do you mean?

318
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,240
Aren't you staying here?

319
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,639
Hurry up and leave.

320
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,480
Stay if you're good,

321
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,639
leave if you're not.

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,559
Such an old tactic.

323
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,240
Can't you upgrade it?

324
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
(Meeting room)

325
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,480
Chai Xiaoqi.

326
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
You'll handle this.

327
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,480
Mr. Fang.

328
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,000
This is The One design company.

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,159
He's really hard to get through.

330
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,879
We've discussed with him back
and forth a total of five times.

331
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,639
The contract agreement also
underwent seven revisions.

332
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,799
In the end, it's still denied.

333
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,159
Was he not satisfied

334
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
with our compensation?

335
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,600
It has nothing to do with money.

336
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
They dared to say

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,759
our contract restricts

338
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,720
their creative freedom.

339
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,399
From how I see it,

340
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,480
I think they are deliberately
looking for trouble.

341
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,879
They never wanted to sign
with us from the beginning.

342
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,159
So my advice is to

343
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,720
give up collaboration with this company.

344
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,759
Furthermore, you asked
Xiaoqi to handle this.

345
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,840
She...she's never done
contract negotiation before.

346
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,639
She's inexperienced. It's no use.

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,919
That's right. Am I right, everyone?

348
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,799
I agree.

349
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,559
Ms. Chai.

350
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
- Ms. Chai.
- Here.

351
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,200
I still stand by what I said earlier.

352
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,679
From today on,

353
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,679
the projects done by
The One design company

354
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,399
will be under the responsibility
of Chai Xiaoqi.

355
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,279
Dismissed.

356
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,879
What?

357
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,759
This...

358
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,000
How can this work?

359
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,200
This won't do. This won't do.

360
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,879
What happened?

361
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,440
Ms. Chai.

362
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,039
All the best.

363
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,200
Previously, you asked me to run errands
for that company and that's fine.

364
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
But you're asking me to negotiate
a contract with them this time.

365
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,720
I can't do it.

366
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,639
What if I mess it up?

367
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,840
What if I tarnished
the company's reputation?

368
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,679
If you can't do it, just resign.

369
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
The necessary documents
are with Mr. Han.

370
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,240
I want results by tomorrow afternoon.

371
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,720
Tomorrow afternoon?

372
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,720
Are you insane?

373
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,480
Unscrupulous businessman.

374
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,960
I had a feeling that
he'll make things hard for me.

375
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,480
But I never thought it'll be this hard.

376
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,319
Aren't the charms of
an arrogant director

377
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,440
is his unpredictability
and hard-to-approach attitude?

378
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,279
If he's always gentle and pleasant,

379
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,240
he'll just be the second male lead.

380
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,599
Ms. Chai.

381
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,480
Good luck.

382
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,000
I believe in you.

383
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,640
Bullying the wife brings momentary joy,
the climax of the story about to begin.

384
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,319
Will the female lead see
light at the end of the tunnel

385
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,559
and turns things around,

386
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,799
or will she be exhausted

387
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,920
by the abuse of the tyrant male lead.

388
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,000
What did Ms. Chen say?

389
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,440
Ms. Chen is in a dilemma.

390
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Fortunately, Fang Leng

391
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,079
addressed her name wrongly that day.

392
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Ms. Chen's mood

393
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,640
changed for the worse.

394
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,039
For someone as cautious as Fang Leng,

395
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,440
how did he make such a lowly mistake?

396
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,519
I even heard Mr. Han

397
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
asking if he'd met with another person.

398
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,440
It looked like he was worried
something bad might happen.

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,920
In that case, hurry and
investigate this matter.

400
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
What sound was that?

401
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,680
You're here.

402
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,039
I almost got caught.
I was scared to death.

403
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
Didn't you say you wanted to eat
grilled sausage last time?

404
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,279
Thanks.

405
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,440
There are still more.

406
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,240
How is it? Is the grilled sausage tasty?

407
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
It tastes the same.

408
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,480
But for grilled sausage,

409
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
it tastes better eating it

410
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
while strolling by the roadside.

411
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,319
When can I get out of the house again?

412
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,279
Lately, I've been watching
a lot of TV series.

413
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,799
If you want to get out,

414
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,279
I've got three ideas.

415
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,119
What ideas?

416
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,920
First.

417
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,640
Give up on your painter's dream

418
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,799
and listen to your mom.

419
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Then, inherit hundreds of
millions worth of property.

420
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,480
That won't do.

421
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,119
Painting is my passion.

422
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,799
If a human doesn't possess any passions,

423
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,319
even an anchovy won't look up to you.

424
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,720
Canceled.

425
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,119
Then, the second one.

426
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,359
Completely cut off from your family.

427
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,440
Become a pauper chasing your dreams.

428
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,359
In theory, it's possible.

429
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,480
But if the Fang family

430
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,559
loses a precious child like me,

431
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,759
wouldn't my dad, mom, and brother

432
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,039
be heartbroken?

433
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
For their sake, I can't do this.

434
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
It makes sense.

435
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
Then, only the third idea is left.

436
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,880
It is the one that tests
your acting skills the most.

437
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,680
Outward devotion but inner opposition.

438
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,920
What does that mean?

439
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,000
Think about it.

440
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,039
What does your mom wish
for you the most?

441
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,240
- Study finance abroad.
- Wrong.

442
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,119
She wishes you to work
with the Future Group.

443
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,880
That's why she sent you abroad
to study finance.

444
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,960
That's why,

445
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,440
it doesn't matter where you study.

446
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
That's not the most important part.

447
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,400
I get it now.

448
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,480
What you mean is also

449
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,519
for me to think of a way

450
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
to study locally,

451
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,559
so I can use that as an excuse
to continue painting?

452
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,720
That's right.

453
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,960
According to my calculation,

454
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,359
the probability of getting away
with it is very high.

455
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,599
But I get sleepy
when I read a finance book.

456
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
I won't be able to pass the exam.

457
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,079
If I can't pass the exam,
I won't have an acceptance letter.

458
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,039
I can't fool my mom
without an acceptance letter.

459
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,240
Leave this to me.

460
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,440
Really?

461
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,119
Thank you so much, Xiaobu.

462
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:10,340
(Alert, system temperature is too high,
turning into tortoise mode soon)

463
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,720
Fang Lie.

464
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
Xiao Bu, my mom's here.
Hurry up and leave.

465
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,359
Fang Lie.

466
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,279
Fang Lie.

467
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,400
I'll help you to stall.

468
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,920
Why did this child lock the door?

469
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,559
Xiao Bu. Where is she?

470
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,440
In...in the blankets.

471
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,599
Why must you lock the door
when you're sleeping?

472
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
Mom.

473
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,440
Mom. I just woke up.

474
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,200
It's a good thing I brought the keys.

475
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,720
Why does it smell like meat?

476
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,960
Did you hide snacks again?

477
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,759
Mom.

478
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,359
Didn't you confiscate them all away?

479
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,799
Enough with your excuses.

480
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,559
Hurry.

481
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,279
Hand them over.

482
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,079
Mom.

483
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,720
It's said that the most important
thing between mother and child

484
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,960
is trust between one another.

485
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,200
What you're doing now

486
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,319
is seriously affecting our relationship.

487
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,960
I can't deny that your guess is correct.

488
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,720
Take it quickly and leave.
I still want to sleep.

489
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,079
Only one pack?

490
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,799
Only one.

491
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,119
The blanket is bulging so much.

492
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,240
Who're you fooling?
-Mom. I know I'm wrong.

493
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,440
Fang Lie.

494
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,079
What interest are you having?

495
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,720
Mom. I'm sorry.

496
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,319
She's just here to chat with me,
that's all.

497
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,279
What?

498
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,920
Mom's just outside that door

499
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,440
but you'd rather talk with this?

500
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,119
You don't even want to talk
with your mom?

501
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Mom.

502
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,480
We share a common language.

503
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
You can't compare to her.

504
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,599
What are you saying?

505
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,000
You mean to say that

506
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
I can't even compare with a tortoise?

507
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,559
Mom.

508
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
We can talk this out. Why're you...

509
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,400
You lock me in the house.

510
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,119
It's the only companion
I have to talk to.

511
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,160
You can't be thinking
of taking it away, right?

512
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
As long as you perform well,

513
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
I'll consider letting
you out of your room.

514
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,720
There's no need to consider. Mom.

515
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,799
Look at me. I'm suffocated.

516
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,480
- I'm even having acne.
- Alright.

517
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't think you can fool me with that.

518
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,480
You always know how to deceive me.

519
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,880
Be good and repent.

520
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,759
All you do is eat.

521
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
You already have a double chin
but you keep snacking.

522
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,400
Take them all away.

523
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,400
Hurry and leave.

524
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,759
You just keep eating every day.

525
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,519
Go.

526
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,039
Where's the little tortoise?

527
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,640
This...

528
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
(Why am I a tortoise again?)

529
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,559
What time is it?

530
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,119
It's already 12.30 AM.

531
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,720
Get off work earlier.

532
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,440
I can't.

533
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,559
The cooperation plan of The One Design
has not been finalized yet.

534
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,799
If I don't complete it,
I'll get fired again.

535
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,039
I can do this, bye-bye.

536
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,720
(Collaboration concept)
The brand concept of Future Group is

537
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,480
advocate nature and self-confidence
to show your unique self.

538
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,279
It's similar to your company's
inspiration from nature,

539
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,000
only execute uniquely

540
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,079
creative ideas.

541
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,759
I understand the main reason
why your company

542
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,119
rejected us before.

543
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,799
It's because we requested
in the contract that

544
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,680
The One Design cannot
provide packaging design services

545
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,200
for Future Group's competitors.

546
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,920
It seems like a monopoly
on creative freedom.

547
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,039
But we've discovered a reason

548
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,119
for our highly-compatible collaboration.

549
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,000
If we collaborate,

550
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,279
it'll have a great effect because
two minds are better than one.

551
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,039
The information was very comprehensive.

552
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,640
The argument's also
professionally spoken.

553
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,759
It's clear that you've put
a lot of effort into this.

554
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
But what you just said,

555
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,400
almost every company that
speaks to us about cooperation

556
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,559
has the same set of rhetorics.

557
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
So for that matter,
it's not convincing enough.

558
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,559
I even memorized it the whole night.

559
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,880
This...

560
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,839
Xiaoqi.

561
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,519
Other than these,

562
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,400
do you have anything else to say?

563
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,920
Am I allowed to?

564
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,839
In that case...

565
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,880
Can I express

566
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,519
my own opinion about this?

567
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,559
Of course, you can.

568
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
Mr. Wang, I really don't understand

569
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,519
why do you need to be in such a dilemma.

570
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,720
It's clear that collaborating

571
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,480
with us is the best option.

572
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,720
Why is that?

573
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,200
You want creative freedom

574
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,759
but you're the other party after all.

575
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,960
There will inevitably be restrictions
from the first party.

576
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,240
Do you agree?

577
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,519
Most companies will

578
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,440
offer you creative freedom,

579
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,599
but in the process of cooperation,

580
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,599
they will try their best
to restrict you.

581
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,880
You'll have to keep trying and
making mistakes for their ideas.

582
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
As for us, we have studied your

583
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,200
style of work before choosing you.

584
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,119
It's been predetermined that our

585
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,920
preferences are the same.

586
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,119
In other words,

587
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,200
we exclusively want you.

588
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
We're also the one you need.

589
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
Isn't that enough?

590
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,960
Mr. Jiang.

591
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,839
You were right.

592
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,119
Ms. Chai here is indeed capable.

593
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,799
It's settled then.

594
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,240
I have nothing to be
indecisive about anymore.

595
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,160
We'll sign the contract.

596
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,640
Does...does this mean that you agree?

597
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,640
Definitely.

598
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,960
Exclusivity and great fit
are already mentioned.

599
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
If I'm still in a dilemma,

600
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,480
it's on me.

601
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,519
I believe in

602
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,519
Mr. Jiang's choice.

603
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,960
Thank you.

604
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,599
You didn't help me out

605
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,759
just because I'm your friend, right?

606
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,160
You need to believe in yourself.

607
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Mr. Wang just now

608
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,359
was moved by your earnest speech.

609
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,720
Besides,

610
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,240
why would I put my company's reputation

611
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,079
on the line for this?

612
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,440
Then I should thank you, Mr. Jiang.

613
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,839
You said we were friends but you
still call me Mr. Jiang.

614
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,240
Why don't

615
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,640
you call me Eleven from now on?

616
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,799
Alright, Eleven.

617
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,440
It's settled then, Xiaoqi.

618
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,119
You've worked hard today too.

619
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,000
It looks like it's getting late.

620
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,400
I'll get going then.

621
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,720
Bye-bye.

622
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,440
Are you alright?

623
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,039
I'm fine. I might be too tired.

624
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,039
I'll catch up on sleep when I get back.

625
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,880
Excuse me.

626
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,119
Wait.

627
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,599
Thank you.

628
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,640
Bye-bye.

629
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

630
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:46,759
Bye-bye.

631
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,359
Come in.

632
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,680
It's done.

633
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,839
That was quick.

634
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Ms. Chai, how did you do it?

635
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's nothing since I'm so clever.

636
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,079
I'm exhausted, I'm going to bed.

637
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,079
Hold on.

638
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,160
No need to praise me.

639
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,960
The contract has been signed.

640
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
You'll have no reason
to fire me in the future.

641
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,680
Good night.

642
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,319
Mr. Fang.

643
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,599
Is there an issue with the contract?

644
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,160
They did not revise any

645
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,680
rules in the contract.

646
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,839
At the same time,
during the contract period,

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,279
they won't be collaborating
with other competitors.

648
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,119
This shows that Ms. Chai
has a way with words.

649
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,680
Besides, she's been
working hard these few days.

650
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,079
She worked overtime until
three in the morning yesterday.

651
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,880
(This is great.)

652
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,160
(The enthusiastic and
resilient female lead)

653
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,200
(touched the male lead's cold heart.)

654
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,720
(If everything goes well,)

655
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,200
(they'll reconcile sooner than later.)

656
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,220
(Analyzing system)

657
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,000
I feel great.

658
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,960
As light as a feather.

659
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:19,839
What're you doing?

660
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,740
(Analyzing system)

661
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,160
My system has failed again recently.

662
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,519
I'm trying to find out the cause of it.

663
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,480
How strange.

664
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,640
I even succeeded
in the contract signing.

665
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,480
He shouldn't be mad
at me anymore, right?

666
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,960
You've already worked hard.

667
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,920
What other reasons
can he use to trouble you again?

668
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
If it still doesn't work out,
you can send him a small gift.

669
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,680
Sister Chai said so.

670
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,599
It's not weird giving
lots of gifts to a person.

671
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,839
Small gift?

672
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,720
I've heard

673
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
Xiaoqi succeeded in the
contract signing with The One.

674
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,519
As expected from the girlfriend
candidate for Mr. Fang.

675
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,200
A sage really
doesn't reveal their identity.

676
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
I have a friend working in The One.

677
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,759
She got a picture of Xiaoqi and
the boss being close to each other.

678
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,079
It looks like the Leng-Qi couple
will separate soon.

679
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,559
Xiaoqi sure is something.

680
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,359
Mr. Fang.

681
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:30,960
This...

682
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,799
Isn't it just a photo?

683
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,720
Moreover, it's just their backs.

684
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,319
It could just be a coincidence.

685
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
(This won't do.)

686
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,119
(I can't be affected by her anymore.)

687
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,640
Even if you say that it's just a photo.

688
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,759
Seeing what she's done recently,

689
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,400
she's not as innocent as she looks.

690
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
Drink some water first.

691
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
If you really feel

692
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
that Xiaoqi is negatively
affecting your life,

693
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,720
you can try to minimize
social contact with her first.

694
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,200
But you also said

695
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,440
that she was successful in the
contract signing with The One.

696
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,960
You have no reason to fire her.

697
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
I can let Mr. Han
hand over tasks to her.

698
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,599
What about your personal life?

699
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,359
Both of you are neighbors.

700
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,720
It's impossible not to see each other.

701
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,839
Neighbors.

702
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,000
That's right.

703
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,759
Thanks for reminding me.

704
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,599
Mr. Han.

705
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,140
(CEO Office)

706
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,079
Hello?

707
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:55,839
Sister Chai.

708
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,079
What happened?

709
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,599
I didn't catch it on the phone.

710
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,079
What's going on with Sister Chai?

711
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,440
The property owner called earlier.

712
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
This building has been
bought by Fang Leng.

713
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,599
We were told to move out by today.

714
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,720
What?

715
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,519
It's okay. Don't cry anymore.

716
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,000
You both don't know this but

717
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,359
this place was given

718
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,480
to me by Yun Hai.

719
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,359
Before he left to go abroad,

720
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,079
I even helped him sell it to Chun Jiao.

721
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,160
Because I believe that

722
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,880
one day he'll come back
to find me again.

723
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,839
That's why I'm always waiting

724
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,039
in this house for him.

725
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,559
But now.

726
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,640
He's not back.

727
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,160
This house is also gone.

728
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,920
Don't cry.

729
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,079
Take care of Sister Chai.
I'll look for Fang Leng.

730
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,400
My home!

731
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,160
Mr. Fang.

732
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,559
Mr. Fang.

733
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,400
No matter what decisions
you have to make before,

734
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,840
you were never like this.

735
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
Why don't I call the property owner

736
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,599
and ask to not notify them first?

737
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,519
This way, Ms. Chai and the others

738
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,840
- won't have to move anymore.
- Fang Leng.

739
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,719
It's too late now.

740
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,000
Fang Leng.

741
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
If it's me that you hate,
you can just fire me.

742
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,199
But you must let Sister Chai
and the others stay.

743
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,199
This is the deal between me
and the property owner.

744
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,679
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

745
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,239
You don't know that Sister Chai
has a deep affection for that house.

746
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,159
She kept waiting in that house

747
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
for her first love to come back.

748
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,880
You can hate me.

749
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,159
You can also fire me.

750
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,199
But can't you let Sister Chai

751
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,119
continue staying there?

752
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,159
There's nothing in this world
that can't be done.

753
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,840
To wait is to deceive oneself.

754
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,559
Isn't it better to realize that earlier?

755
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,440
There will be people
like this in this world

756
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,400
that'll keep waiting for another.

757
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
You don't believe in love yourself.

758
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,599
How can you deny others their love?

759
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,719
I don't believe in love?

760
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,119
The most unqualified person to

761
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,360
tell me about love right now, is you.

762
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,440
Who says I'm unqualified?

763
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,719
Do you really believe in love?

764
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,239
If you really believe it,

765
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,239
you wouldn't keep lying to me.

766
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,400
I...

767
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,300
(Here's the trailer)

768
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
(Preview)
Xiaoqi is here to complete a mission.

769
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,039
(Preview)

770
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,280
(Preview)
Not for you to bully.

771
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm telling you.

772
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,679
Xiaoqi is a good girl.

773
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,519
You have no right
to keep being angry at her.

774
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,519
What do you have to do

775
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,639
with what's happening between us?

776
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,079
Will you be my girlfriend?

777
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,719
I can be together with him
while completing my mission.

778
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,840
I should agree to it first.

779
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,239
Xiaoqi will become smart when
she arrives on Earth.

780
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,960
Being in love feels great.

781
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,119
I can openly collect hormones now.

782
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,559
The hormones in your body

783
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,119
are too much.

784
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,760
Then do you like the hormones
in my body more

785
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,679
or me as a person more?

786
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,039
Is there a difference?

787
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,280
I think you're a
walking hormone machine.
