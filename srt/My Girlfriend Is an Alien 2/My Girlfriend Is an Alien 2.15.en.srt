19
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,394
We ate so many sweets today.

20
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,513
Cheer up.

21
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,513
Are you worried that I'm upset?

22
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,474
You've been wearing an awkward smile...

23
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,194
ever since we left the art exhibition.

24
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:03,073
That's not it.

25
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,634
It's because

26
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:07,474
we took those pictures earlier.

27
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,713
Other than that,

28
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,753
I had fun today.

29
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:11,433
I mean it.

30
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,193
It's just that I've been away
from home for too long.

31
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,593
I kind of miss home.

32
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:27,153
Take me home.

33
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:32,313
Don't mind me.

34
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:33,674
You'll get used to it.

35
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:39,674
(Xiaoqi,)

36
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:41,274
(don't worry.)

37
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,633
I will definitely bring you home.

(Sunny Apartment)

39
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:52,074
Master, welcome home.

40
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:01,554
Candy.

41
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:03,234
Yes, master.

42
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:04,873
Do you miss home?

43
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,234
I'm a robot

44
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,593
without an emotion system

45
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:10,954
or spontaneous mood swings.

46
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,153
Master, you're a high-level
being from Cape Town Planet.

47
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,713
It's even less likely for you to develop
low-level feelings of homesickness.

48
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:18,794
Xiaoqi went through a lot.

49
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,794
She must be exhausted.

50
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:23,633
Master,

51
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,114
if the organisation finds out,

52
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,234
we will be...

53
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,514
Master, I'm connecting you to Chief.

54
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:31,394
Chief.

55
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,473
What is the progress
of the mission so far?

56
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,234
I'm still looking for opportunities
to approach Fang Leng.

57
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,274
At the same time,

58
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,954
I'm trying to help
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

59
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:40,873
You've been staying
on earth for a while.

60
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,234
Why haven't you secured Hormone Element?

61
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,873
If you still wish to be the next leader,

62
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:49,674
remember

63
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,274
to keep your promise.

64
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,193
Do not let me down.

65
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,433
Master,

66
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,394
are we sure we want
to abort the mission?

67
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,193
Fang Leng is dating Chen Mengfei?

68
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:14,954
Yes.

69
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,433
They're dating.

70
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:17,594
I can no longer

71
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,474
collect Fang Leng's hormones.

72
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:20,994
The mission completely fails.

73
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:21,833
It's okay.

74
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,154
In a few days, our home
planet will discover that

75
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:25,554
we've encountered problems
while traveling through space.

76
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,994
Then they will sent
someone to pick us up.

77
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,114
Anyway,

78
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:29,714
there are still hormones
left in the collector.

79
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,034
We'll hand it to our superiors.

80
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,914
I hope so.

81
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,873
Why isn't the noodles ready yet?

82
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:38,633
It's taking so long.

83
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,674
What's up with you?

84
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,873
Why are you still angry?

85
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:44,873
Think about it.

86
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,313
Once we go back to our home planet,

87
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:48,073
Fang Leng can't bully you anymore.

88
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:49,633
Shouldn't you be happy?

89
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:52,953
I am. I'm so happy.

90
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,513
I'm overjoyed.

91
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:55,833
However, seeing the two of them together

92
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,914
annoys me so much.

93
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:01,873
It's hot.

94
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:07,753
You don't have a fever.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,680
(Frustrated because a man is
being with another woman.)

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
(Probably you're jealous.)

97
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:17,674
Xiaoqi,

98
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,034
are you jealous?

99
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:23,633
Correct.

100
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,513
I am eating vinegar.
[*sounds like jealous]

101
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,474
Have some, too.

102
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,633
All right, that's enough.

103
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:52,193
I helped you with the proposal,

104
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,193
this and that.

105
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:58,313
You're bad.

106
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,114
I don't understand.

107
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:02,594
Who does he think he is?

108
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:11,873
Oh no.

109
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,273
I still don't have the USB drive.

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,080
(Collaboration proposal)

111
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:45,034
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

112
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:45,953
Good morning.

113
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:47,674
Mr. Han,

114
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:49,513
contact Xiaoqi.

115
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,873
Tell her to come back to
the company as soon as possible.

116
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,234
The proposal needs to be revised.

117
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,234
Mr. Fang,

118
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,753
I've told you many times.

119
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,513
Ms. Chai has resigned.

120
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:01,193
Go.

121
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:05,833
Okay.

122
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,794
The official account
can be updated again.

123
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:12,914
I'm not his employee.

124
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,753
Why should I help him
to change the proposal?

125
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:15,633
Ms. Chai,

126
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:17,273
I don't think you
understand what I mean.

127
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,833
In fact, changing
the proposal is an excuse.

128
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,994
Mr. Fang regrets it.

129
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,073
He wants you to go back.

130
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:24,833
He does?

131
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,073
Isn't that proposal in my USB drive?

132
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,114
How did he see it?

133
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,674
After the shooting yesterday,

134
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,433
Mr. Fang went back to find it.

135
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,474
I've been working for
Mr. Fang for so long.

136
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:37,154
It's the first time I've
seen him so anxious.

137
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:38,794
Ms. Chai,

138
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:39,674
no need to feel that you're touched.

139
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:40,953
Just come back with me.

140
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:44,154
I don't want to go back.

141
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:46,273
Does he think I'm stupid?
Should I go back and be bullied by him?

142
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,354
Wait.

143
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,354
Ms. Chai.

144
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:53,633
What else did she say?

145
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,554
She said

146
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:57,753
she wanted the flash drive back.

147
00:07:58,034 --> 00:08:00,034
It costs RMB200 and
it's quite expensive.

148
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,114
She also said

149
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,154
she's very busy.

150
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:03,474
She doesn't want you to disturb her

151
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,034
all the time.

152
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,714
How about this?

153
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,073
Ms. Chai works part-time
at the milk tea shop

154
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,393
as a food delivery person, right?

155
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,513
If you wish to see her,

156
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,753
can't you just order takeout?

157
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,193
Takeout?

158
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,794
I've forgotten that you don't
know how to order takeout.

159
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,633
Teach me.

160
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,834
You have a new order. Please check.

161
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:36,714
Xiaoqi,

162
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:38,834
seven cups of milk tea
and seven pieces of cake.

163
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,033
Fang Leng?

164
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,980
(Mr. Fang Leng)

165
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:47,954
What's wrong with him?

166
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:49,273
He asked me to change
the proposal just now

167
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,474
and he ordered so much food now.

168
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:01,153
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

169
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:05,393
Mr. Fang,

170
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:07,873
the takeaway will be delivered
directly to your office.

171
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,194
I know, I can wait.

172
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,194
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

173
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:14,793
Good morning.

174
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:16,913
What is taking her so long?

175
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:36,194
Xiao...

176
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:36,913
Hello.

177
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,354
It's you.

178
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:46,994
Seven cups of milk tea
and seven pieces of cake.

179
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,393
Doesn't Xiaoqi usually deliver the food?

180
00:09:49,393 --> 00:09:50,594
I happen to be free today.

181
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:52,114
So I'm doing the delivery today.

182
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:53,393
If it's not enough, you can order more.

183
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,873
I will be delivering it anyway.

184
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,033
The boss took the initiative.

185
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,553
The heroine actually asked
her best friend to show up instead.

186
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:12,234
The boss can't do anything.

187
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,194
This

188
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,873
seems interesting.

189
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,273
Come here!

190
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:27,954
Mr. Fang,

191
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:30,873
what a coincidence.

192
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,033
Did you also order takeout?

193
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,474
Finish all of them.

194
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:39,834
Do not waste food.

195
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:45,873
Mr. Fang, you're so kind to me.

196
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:48,633
What did I do wrong?

197
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:49,913
Fang Leng,

198
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,793
why did you transfer so much
money to my account?

199
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,434
You just ran away from home.

200
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:54,834
Take it as your living expenses.

201
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:56,913
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

202
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,153
You'll need to spend money.

203
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,673
Fang Leng, don't worry.

204
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:01,474
I've been painting in the studio.

205
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,793
I won't sit around and do nothing.

206
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,114
Who says you're sitting around?

207
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:06,954
Fang Lie, listen here.

208
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,033
You are an artist.

209
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,954
Artists need to have feelings.

210
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,354
What's the basis for feelings? Inspiration.

211
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:13,793
Only then you will be able to paint.

212
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:16,714
Do you know?

213
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,994
If you don't get a girlfriend now,

214
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,393
you will regret it later in life.

215
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,354
However...

216
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,633
I don't want to hear your explanation.

217
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,434
Go on a date. Now.

218
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,954
Somewhere unique.

219
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:25,873
The longer you take, the better.

220
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,633
Don't come back before 11 p.m.

221
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:39,474
You have a new order. Please check.

222
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,393
Not it him again.

223
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,820
(Mr. Fang Leng)

224

(Milk Tea)
Xiaobu.

225
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:45,393
Xiaobu.

226
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:46,434
Xiaoqi,

227
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,673
Fang Lie asked Xiaobu on a date
at the technology exhibition.

228
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,913
So I gave her a day off for today.

229
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:54,474
Young people these days are so romantic.

230
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,553
Even going on a date can be so creative.

231
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,954
She's not delivering the food?

232
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,513
Young people need to know the priorities.

233
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:05,153
How can you let work
get in the way of dating?

234
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:07,033
If she doesn't deliver the food, I'll have to do it.

235
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,793
I don't want to see Fang Leng.

236
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,354
Fang Leng?

237
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,033
Not him again.

238
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:17,153
What's the big deal?
I won't take his order.

239
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,194
Anyway, I've achieved
the sales target for today.

240
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:20,714
Are you serious?

241
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,033
Of course I am.

242
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,074
He upset you

243
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,114
and made you feel bad.

244
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,273
He needs to do more than
this if he wants to see you.

245
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,393
Chai, you're so kind to me.

246
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,354
When it comes to men,

247
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,954
I know them best.

248
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:41,074
Sometimes you need to give him a push.

249
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,834
If he really wants to see you,

250
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:45,194
he will come looking for you

251
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:48,074
in a while.

252
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
(Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop)

253
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,393
Welcome.

254
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,314
Has the delivery person
got off from work?

255
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:14,834
You didn't even bring flowers with you.

256
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:16,393
You're insincere.

257
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,633
Mr. Fang,

258
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:20,393
did you come to see our Xiaoqi?

259
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:23,594
Well, I stopped by after work.

260
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,434
Mr. Fang,

261
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,994
as our shop's

262
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:29,234
super VIP,

263
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:30,434
you are very welcomed

264
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,074
at our shop.

265
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:34,194
However, as Xiaoqi's friend,

266
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,753
there are some things that I must say.

267
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,714
How can you make Xiaoqi so sad?

268
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:41,314
First, you kicked her out of the company

269
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,873
and her house.

270
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:44,194
That's not all. You even told her

271
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,434
that you hated her.

272
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,633
What do you take her for?

273
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,994
Is she someone

274
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,273
you can drive away

275
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:52,354
as you wish?

276
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:53,913
She lied to me first.

277
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,314
Why is it my fault now?

278
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:56,513
She's such a kind

279
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,393
and naive girl.

280
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,234
If she lied to you,

281
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,553
I'm sure she had

282
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,114
her own reasons to do so.

283
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,954
You two have been together for so long.

284
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,153
Don't you have

285
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,153
basic trust in each other?

286
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:11,474
Chai,

287
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,793
this milk tea is for...

288
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:19,114
Xiaoqi.

289
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:20,314
Mr. Fang,

290
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,873
I'm not done yet.

291
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,673
As the boss of a huge company,

292
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,714
at least you have to learn about
emotion management, right?

293
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:27,994
Don't quarrel

294
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,834
or let your relationship turn sour

295
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,673
over trivial matters.

296
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:32,913
You're too childish.

297
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:35,594
You should learn from me.

298
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,194
Take it from Chai.

299
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,513
No matter what or anyone I come across,

300
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:43,714
my attitude remains calm and at ease.

301
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:46,234
Hello.

302
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:53,834
Why are you here?

303
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,114
I know.

304
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,234
Is it because

305
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,954
you weren't sarcastic enough last time?

306
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,994
So you're here to insult me further.

307
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:03,434
I'm here today to...

308
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,314
Do you think I'm very childish

309
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,434
to hold on to my first love?

310
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:08,273
Well, I...

311
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,913
What are you doing

312
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:10,793
as a psychiatrist?

313
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,434
Don't you know the most basic theory

314
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,474
of appropriate methods
used to treat illnesses?

315
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,434
I want to say...

316
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,594
Do you mean to say

317
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,633
that you're a straightforward person?

318
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:19,873
However, let me tell you,

319
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,793
straightforwardness and low EQ

320
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,354
are two different things.

321
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:23,954
I...

322
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,793
Forget it, I won't talk. Go ahead.

323
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,393
You came here,

324
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,834
but you haven't said a word.

325
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:31,434
Instead, I'm doing all the talking.

326
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:32,753
What are you up to?

327
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:38,273
I'm really sorry.

328
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:39,234
The other day,

329
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,913
I shouldn't have done that.

330
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:42,913
As a psychiatrist,

331
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,273
I should have considered your feelings.

332
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:48,994
I shouldn't talk on my own.

333
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:50,513
What?

334
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,314
Are you here

335
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,553
to apologise to me?

336
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:58,994
I saw on your Moments the other day

337
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:01,714
that you wanted to go
to the new Rose Restaurant.

338
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,234
I specifically booked two seats
for the day after tomorrow

339
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,793

00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,753
Thanks. Go on.

508
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:37,474
Bye.

509
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,474
It's always the same old trick.

510
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,674
The entire family are black card holders.

511
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,634
Ms. Chai and others
returned the black card.

512
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,513
Although a black card
makes a substantial gift,

513
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,474
for Ms. Chai and the others,

514
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,313
it isn't the most practical.

515
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:06,553
What do you mean?

516
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:07,833
Have you forgotten?

517
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:09,513
Ms. Chai and the rest are now

518
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,833
living in the warehouse
of the milk tea shop.

519
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:15,154
Hurry up and tell Xiaoqi

520
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:16,313
to move back.

521
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:17,513
Yes, sir.

522
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:45,353
Perfect.

523
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:56,833
Thanks.

524
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:57,553
Chai.

525
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,353
Mr. Fang,

526
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:01,914
thank you so much

527
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,194
for letting us move back in.

528
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,513
The environment here is really good.

529
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,553
Where's Xiaoqi?

530
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,154
You know her.

531
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:11,513
She's very stubborn.

532
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:12,874
She insists on staying in the shop

533
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:14,674
and won't even listen to us.

534
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,033
I wonder if Xiaoqi has taken dinner.

535
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:18,833
Of course she hasn't.

536
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:19,994
Think about it.

537
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,593
Xiaoqi can't cook.

538
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:23,994
She's probably eating
instant noodles now.

539
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,113
Where is he going?

540
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,073
Do you even need to ask?

541
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:37,914
Chai Xiaoqi, listen up.

542
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:38,714
Starting today,

543
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,353
you can only eat the fried
chicken I buy for you.

544
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:41,753
You can't eat fried chicken from others!

545
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,593
Thanks.

546
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,353
Come on, taste it. It's hot.

547
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:07,753
It's hot.

548
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:09,994
How about you?

549
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:11,353
How are you feeling these days?

550
00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:16,273
Chen Mengfei doesn't
bother you anymore, does she?

551
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:19,353
I forgot to tell you.

552
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,474
Actually, Chen Mengfei

553
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,954
isn't even Fang Leng's girlfriend.

554
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,113
Why do you seem to be happy?

555
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:28,714
I am happy.

556
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,874
Anyway, I'm a lot happier
than a few days ago.

557
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:33,593
I do not know why.

558
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,914
Do you still want to go home now?

559
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:41,954
Not really for now.

560
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:43,954
It's because I suddenly realise that

561
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,113
staying here

562
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,154
is also pretty good.

563
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:48,954
There are so much delicious food.

564
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,800
(What do I do
if my apology is not accepted?)

565
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,280
(Stop thinking.
She just doesn't love you.)

566
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,840
(Man, yours is one-sided love.)

567
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,260
(Break up with her.)

568
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,670
(What should I do if I'm still
hoping that she can forgive me?)

569
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,400
(Not one-sided love.)

570
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,980
(You must've used the wrong method!)

571
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,480
(Think about what she likes the most.)

572
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:33,994
It's bouncy.

573
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,234
Delicate, smooth and elastic.

574
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,154
Of course Xiaoqi likes my body the most,

575
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:51,593
as well as my scent.

576
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,113
What a coincidence.

577
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:11,994
You...

578
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:14,753
What are you doing here?

579
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:16,874
I'm here to exercise.

580
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:18,474
Then, I ran into you.

581
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:22,994
(It's the smell of hormones.)

582
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:34,874
Can you give me a bottle of water?

583
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:37,833
You're so troublesome.

584
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:42,273
- Thank you.
- Don't move.

585
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,273
Don't you think
the weather is nice today?

586
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,273
It's too hot.

587
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:16,994
I feel good.

588
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,954
Is the restroom over there?

589
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:26,874
What's wrong?

590
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,714
Just leave when you're
done drinking the water.

591
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:29,753
The customers will be here in a while.

592
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:30,714
Ypu're so annoying.

593
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:31,793
Is there a customer?

594
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:33,033
We'd like to place an order.

595
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,714
Welcome. Come in, please.

596
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:35,793
Welcome!

597
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:37,753
Stop.

598
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:43,434
Hi.

599
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:44,474
Black tea,

600
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,474
chocolate mousse and
strawberry mousse, please.

601
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:48,353
Okay, sure. One moment, please.

602
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:53,593
What are you doing?

603
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,394
It's so hot.

604
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:58,634
Dear.

605
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,874
That...

606
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,753
Black tea,

607
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:04,234
chocolate mousse and strawberry mousse.

608
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:04,634
Okay.

609
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:06,394
Yes, that's all.

610
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:09,874
(His hormones smell good.)

611
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:10,833
(No.)

612
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,154
(I'm a high-level being
from Cape Town Planet.)

613
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,434
- (I can't fall for it.)
- The food and drink are ready.

614
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:15,914
Okay.

615
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:16,793
I'll help you.

616
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,394
No. I am working.

617
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,234
Don't cause trouble for me.

618
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,313
I don't have time to play
games with you. It's annoying.

619
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:23,353
Sorry to keep you waiting.

620
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,154
Chocolate and strawberry mousse.

621
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:25,954
Please enjoy. Thank you.

622
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:32,353
What are you doing?

623
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:33,353
I think

624
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,553
I hurt my arm during
the morning workout.

625
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:40,513
Look, are my biceps swollen?

626
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,394
(Calm down.)

627
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:44,793
(Those aren't muscles,)

628
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:46,154
(but hyperemia.)

629
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,033
(The hormones don't smell so nice.)

630
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:52,033
(It's normal.)

631
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,753
So swollen.

632
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,154
Please help yourself.

633
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:41,073
Thanks.

634
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:44,313
Xiaoqi.

635
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:51,994
Today, the three of us

636
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:54,474
will drink to our hearts' content.

637
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:58,434
What's the occasion?

638
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:00,154
You don't need an occasion to drink.

639
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:01,553
Sometimes,

640
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:03,874
you need to relax.

641
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,194
Tonight, while we get drunk,

642
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:06,634
we'll let it all out.

643
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,474
Come on, Xiaoqi.

644
00:34:08,474 --> 00:34:09,153
Cheers.

645
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:09,834
Okay.

646
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:10,874
Cheers.

647
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:16,954
Xiaoqi,

648
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:18,713
Fang Leng

649
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,673
is a boss after all.

650
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:22,033
Besides, this time,

651
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:22,994
he genuinely

652
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,193
wants you to move back in.

653
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:27,354
What are your thoughts?

654
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,314
I don't think so.

655
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:31,954
He's always saying

656
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,553
and doing things that
I don't comprehend.

657
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:35,874
Even if he asks us to go back,

658
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,073
he didn't even say sorry to me.

659
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:39,754
The hardest words

660
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:42,033
for men to say

661
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,633
isn't "I love you",

662
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,394
but "I'm sorry."

663
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:48,954
So, you don't plan to go back

664
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:50,874
tonight as well?

665
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:57,354
Let's not talk about that.

666
00:34:57,593 --> 00:34:59,394
Let me drink to you. Cheers.

667
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:00,394
Cheers.

668
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,153
Today, we'll drink
to our hearts' content.

669
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,193
Come on. Cheers.

670
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,153
Although I haven't formally apologised,

671
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,314
I've done so much for her.

672
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,394
Isn't that enough?

673
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,153
Actually, a girl

674
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,633
may not want your effort.

675
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,754
What she wants is your attitude.

676
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:26,673
You can't always assume you're right

677
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:29,113
and apologise with your actions.

678
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:31,153
Try

679
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:33,073
to let go of your pompousness

680
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:35,274
to sincerely apologise.

681
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:43,553
Chai,

682
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:45,073
is Xiaoqi around?

683
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,033
I was about to call you.

684
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:48,434
Xiaoqi is in a bad mood.

685
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,314
She went out for a walk after drinking.

686
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,794
It isn't safe

687
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:52,834
for a girl to be outside at night.

688
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,314
You'd better check on her.

689
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,874
I'm sorry, Xiaoqi.

690
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,073
I shouldn't have made things
difficult for you at work.

691
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:21,513
I shouldn't have bought your house.

692
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,633
I went overboard.

693
00:36:27,673 --> 00:36:28,633
I'm sorry.

694
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:30,994
Xiaoqi.

695
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:35,914
I wanted to make you happy,

696
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:38,954
but I couldn't let go of my pride.

697
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,113
I'm sorry.

698
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:44,874
Please forgive me, okay?

699
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,314
I thought you hated me.

700
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,954
Why are you apologising
to the person you hate?

701
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,274
I didn't mean what I said.

702
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,394
You didn't mean it?

703
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,834
Still, you shouldn't have
given up the R&D department.

704
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:00,633
The saddest thing

705
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,314
is not just that you hate me,

706
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:03,274
but because of that,

707
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:04,474
you gave up something you obtained

708
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:05,874
after working hard for so long.

709
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,794
I blamed myself for a long time.

710
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:09,914
I thought I was despicable

711
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,233
and I made you lost everything.

712
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:14,073
You gave up so easily.

713
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:15,794
How irresponsible.

00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,033
You... I...

723
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:18,474
I kissed you last time because...

724
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:21,954
Why did you kiss me this time?

725
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:23,834
It's to celebrate.

726
00:38:25,994 --> 00:38:27,354
It's to celebrate that
our R&D department

727
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:28,954
is back on the agenda.

728
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:30,033
Really?

729
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:32,834
Yes.

730
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:35,354
Now we can officially move
on to the new fragrance.

731
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,314
However,

732
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:39,874
this project

733
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:40,593
lacks

734
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:42,474
a perfumer with
an exceptional sense of smell.

735
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,354
Besides, no one in the company

736
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:45,593
is up for the role.

737
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,754
I...

738
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,033
I can do it.

739
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:50,193
I'll come back if you want.

740
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:51,874
Aren't you angry anymore?

741
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,553
A little.

742
00:38:57,553 --> 00:39:01,274
However, since you're bringing
back the R&D department,

743
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,874
I'll go to work.

744
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,754
Come to work early tomorrow.

745
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:16,713
I have a surprise for you.

746
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,354
