latest high-end perfume

21
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,971
Forever.7 will be launched today.

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,891
Now, it's the Q&A time
for the reporters.

23
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,210
Any questions that you want to ask

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,930
Mr. Fang regarding Forever.7?

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,930
You can ask now.

26
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:57,210
Mr. Fang.

27
00:01:59,091 --> 00:01:59,971
Hello, Mr. Fang.

28
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,091
As everyone knows,

29
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,051
hormone perfume

30
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,091
is Future Group's ace product.

31
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,451
Now, you're launching Forever.7.

32
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:07,971
Are you worried that it will affect

33
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,571
the hormone perfume's customers?

34
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:11,490
Thank you for the question.

35
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,530
Actually, these two perfumes

36
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,411
are a couple series.

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,171
Hormone perfume is for men

38
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,571
and Forever.7

39
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,970
is more suitable for women.

40
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,731
I don't think we'll lose
the customers.

41
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:31,210
On the contrary, we'll be able
to attract more customers.

42
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,571
It's said that Forever.7

43
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,090
was flavored by you.

44
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,370
Can you tell us

45
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,451
about your initial intention?

46
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:40,571
Forever.7

47
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,451
is originated from my girlfriend,
Xiaoqi.

48
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,291
This perfume is flavored by

49
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,171
what I've been through with her

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,571
and all the things that
we've done together.

51
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,930
This is the origin of the perfume.

52
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,291
Mr. Fang,

53
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,291
are you not worried that
your future girlfriend

54
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,851
will get jealous with this perfume?

55
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,731
Xiaoqi is my only lover,

56
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,810
so I've decided to stay single forever

57
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,411
for her.

58
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,051
So romantic.

59
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,011
What? That's so romantic.

60
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:30,770
He's so loyal.

61
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,370
Yes.

62
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:33,250
I envy her.

63
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,411
So loyal.

64
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,451
Future Group's CEO, Fang Leng,

65
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,451
showed how much he loves his girlfriend
on the new perfume launching.

66
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,331
He said his girlfriend, Xiaoqi,
is his only lover,

67
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,011
and he'll stay single for her forever.

68
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,370
Their love relationship is admired
by the crowds.

69
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,331
Fang Leng is going to be alone forever.

70
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:52,171
If one day,

71
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,611
I have to go back to my mother planet,

72
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,690
what will you do?

73
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,970
I'll be more loyal than Fang Leng.

74
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,770
I'll kill myself for love
after you get on the spaceship.

75
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,011
No, you must live on well.

76
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,611
Mr. Fang, you're about to go up
to the stage.

77
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,490
Hold on.

78
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,930
Let's go.

79
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,171
Next, let's put our hands together
to welcome

80
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,971
our new painter, Fang Lie,

81
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,890
and his Muses Goddess, Xiaobu.

82
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,490
Please.

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,250
Dear,

86
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,250
how come you've slimmed down.

87
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,291
Are you not used to
the food in the U.K.?

88
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,171
Don't worry. I'm fine.

89
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,330
I'm just too busy with homework.

90
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,611
So, I looked a bit tired.

91
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,971
You have no idea how much I miss you.

92
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,690
I'm counting down every day.

93
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,570
There are another 333 days

94
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,211
before you come back from your studies.

95
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,890
I'm so sorry.

96
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,651
No worries. Just wait for me.

97
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,851
When I'm back,

98
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,771
I'll stay by your side 24 hours a day,

99
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,411
okay?

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,051
I have to hang up.

101
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,291
My class is about to start.

102
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,611
Take care, okay?

103
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:48,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

If women want to be strong,

106
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,890
we need to depend on ourselves.

118
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,810
What's your stage name?

119
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,890
Just call me Mengmengzi.

120
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,490
Mr. Fang,

121
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,211
the launching today is a great success.

122
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,250
Especially your love confession
to Miss Chai.

123
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,370
It went straight into my heart.

124
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,010
When I heard it below the stage,

125
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,411
I was crying like a baby.

126
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,971
Don't you have other choices of word?

127
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,531
What?

128
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,330
Anything else?

129
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,971
(Alien Girl Pounces On Me)
My series novel

130
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,930
(Alien Girl Pounces On Me)
has been published.

131
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:18,890
I think

132
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,171
I can be a great author.

133
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:24,370
This could be the calling of destiny.

134
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,010
I always think that

135
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,490
only I can save the romance literature.

136
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,130
So,

137
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,570
I'm planning to resign.

138
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,330
Don't worry.

139
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,091
I've found

140
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,570
the new assistant.

141
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,930
He's my cousin.

142
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:50,250
His name is Han Jinming.

143
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,930
He...

144
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,611
He...

145
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,010
He must be more excellent than me.

146
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,010
He must be more diligent than me.

147
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,450
He can take care of you better than me,
Mr. Fang.

148
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,890
I'm reluctant to leave you.

149
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,690
Although you always torture me,

150
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,971
I always think that

151
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,010
you're the best
and the most handsome boss.

152
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:32,330
Han.

153
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,570
If the novel is not selling well,

154
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,210
come back to me anytime.

155
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,610
They are all painted by our son?

156
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,690
I think so.

157
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,330
This is my first time
seeing his paintings.

158
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,171
Look.

159
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:56,051
Fang Lie.

160
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,051
- This looks like flower.
- Oil painting.

161
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,171
Is it flower?

162
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,011
Dear.

163
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,131
Why does Fang Lie

164
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,570
always paint about

165
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,171
moon and stars?

166
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,131
Is it nice?

167
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:12,930
It's nice.

168
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:15,491
This...

169
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,171
One thousand, ten thousands,
one hundred thousands, one million.

RMB 1,000,000)

171
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,251
It's really one million.

172
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,810
So, that's what you're looking at.

173
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,450
You wouldn't disagree for Fang Lie
to keep painting anymore?

174
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,051
Look at you.

175
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:31,690
- Why do you always act like that?
- Siqin.

176
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,171
Sorry, I'm late.

177
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,930
There was a lot of traffic.

178
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,570
Siqin,

179
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,491
I've prepared this for you,

180
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,011
Jujube goji berry tea.

181
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:44,891
Shida,

182
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,371
I've got one for you too.

183
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,051
Jujube goji berry.

184
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,690
What's with the paintings?

185
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,771
These are Lie's paintings.

186
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,210
I don't really understand.

187
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,810
Look at you.

188
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,411
I haven't gone back to
my mother planet for a while.

189
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,011
I wonder

190
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,330
how Xiaoqi and Jiang Shiyi are doing.

191
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,810
They'd stayed on the earth for so long.

192
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,730
Will they be punished?

193
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,210
Ever since the new leader,

194
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,651
Jilisibuladakaqikaqi No. 11,

195
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,411
came in office,

196
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,690
he has repealed the DNA matching

197
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,411
and advocated free love from earth.

198
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,930
This law is not only appealed to
the citizens on Cape Town Planet,

199
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,610
but also all the robots.

200
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,411
Lately,

201
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,891
all the factories are working hard
on increasing the production line

202
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,970
to provide human bodies to
all the robots.

203
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,651
Master.

204
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,131
Who are you?

205
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,371
Master, greetings.

206
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,330
I'm Candy.

207
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:19,330
So, this is the human appearance
that you chose?

208
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,450
Yes. You don't like it?

209
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,730
No.

210
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,570
I'm just a bit surprised.

211
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:30,570
Master, are you looking for this?

212
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,810
My name is Candy.

213
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,210
So, after having the human body,

214
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,330
my first mission

215
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,371
is to try all the imported candies

216
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:39,850
from the earth.

217
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,450
I think this is the best.

218
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:43,210
You've eaten the previous one
for so long.

219
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,291
Change to a new taste.

220
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,540
(Alert, system is suddenly heated.
Please fix it in time)

221
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:01,651
It's tasty.

222
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,930
Thank you.

223
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,090
Look at this child.

224
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:20,371
What's going on?

225
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,131
Fang Leng

226
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,051
has just rejected another blind date.

227
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,531
How many it has been?

228
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,810
He's the CEO of Future Group.

229
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,651
He can't stay single forever.

230
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,171
Just stay out of their matters.

231
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,411
Let things happen on its own.

232
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,771
How can I do that?

233
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,730
No way. He has to join this tomorrow.

234
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,051
I'll call him now.

235
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,891
The number you've dialed
is not available.

236
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:45,131
See?

237
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,330
Fang Leng's avoiding me.

238
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,690
It must be taught by Fang Lie.

239
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,131
Give me your phone.

240
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:02,651
Father.

241
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,491
Fang Leng,

242
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,531
did you block my phone number?

243
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,570
Aunt, I told you I don't want
to go for the blind date.

244
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,531
I'm doing this for your own good.

245
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,051
You're not young anymore

246
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,251
and you're not getting married.

247
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:16,771
Okay, that's it.

248
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,371
You have to join this tomorrow.

249
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:19,570
Otherwise,

250
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,011
I'll leave this matter alone.

251
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,131
I'll leave this matter to your father.

252
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,291
(Lately, our city's
Scientific Research Department)

253
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,210
(has frequently detected
unusual magnetic signal.)

254
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,051
(The analysis shows that
this unusual phenomenon)

255
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,011
(should be related to the UFO)

256
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,690
(that appeared not long ago.)

257
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,450
(Let's look at the next news.)

258
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,060
(Sunny Apartment)

259
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,930
Fang Leng, what have you cooked?

260
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,690
It smells so good.

261
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:10,690
Why are you here?

262
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:16,930
Have you eaten?

263
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,291
Not yet.

264
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:21,690
Thank you.

265
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:24,690
Mother asked me to come and
monitor your blind date.

266
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,371
If you're not going tomorrow,

267
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:28,051
she will not let me go home forever.

268
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:32,850
Fang Leng,

269
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,450
I know you only love Xiaoqi,

270
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,891
but mother has been

271
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:40,970
thinking about your marriage.

272
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,610
Just go for tomorrow

273
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,491
and show your face.

274
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,771
Tomorrow is the final recruitment of
the Perfume Creative Department.

275
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,570
I need to join the final review.

276
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,690
What department is that?
I've never heard of it.

277
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,491
It's a new department

278
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,090
established half a month ago.

279
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,291
Now, it's under
the pre-construction period.

280
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,330
It's just recruitment.

281
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,690
Just let the department head handle it.

282
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,931
Just read the resumes remotely.

283
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,370
Don't be too serious.

284
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,260
(Because of you,
I am willing to love the whole world.)

285
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:18,170
If you're not going tomorrow,

286
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,810
I'll just stay here and not leave.

287
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,850
I'll be super annoying.

288
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:25,850
Fang Lie!

289
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:31,130
Fang Lie!

290
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:34,931
Fang Leng,

291
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,491
I knew you'll not reject me.

292
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:41,531
Sleep in the living room.

293
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,051
- Sleep on the sofa.
- Why, Fang Leng?

294
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:51,971
(Because I love you, Xiaoqi.)

295
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,251
(I love you, too.)

296
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,451
(So,)

297
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,971
(I think it's meaningful)

298
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,691
(to do anything with you.)

299
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,650
(I'll just hug you like this
from now on.)

300
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,410
(Then you won't disappear suddenly.)

301
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,370
After three rounds of screening,

302
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,170
we've selected three perfumers.

303
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,451
These are the samples of their perfumes.

304
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,691
This is not bad.

305
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,051
It's mainly the flower scent.

306
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:28,130
(Indole is the mixture of
pyrrole and benzene)

307
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,650
It's mixed with some indole scent.

308
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,330
(Contains indole)
Sir, what do you think?

309
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,570
No.

310
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,810
The scent is not innovative at all.

311
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,650
We're Perfume Creative Department.

312
00:18:39,731 --> 00:18:41,370
We should keep innovating
on the new perfumes.

313
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:43,011
Too many favors.

314
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,410
No emphasis.

315
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,370
This should've been eliminated earlier.

316
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,691
Let's look at the second perfume.

317
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,570
I can tell that

318
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,731
this is a perfumer with style.

319
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:55,531
Others' perfume

320
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,771
will have the top note,
middle note and base note flavored

321
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,090
based on one's set ideas.

322
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,491
Hers is rather creative.

323
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:01,971
It's not based on any usual ideas.

324
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,211
She's the new intern
in our department.

325
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,650
I've met her few days back.

326
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,011
This young lady is not professional.

327
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,931
Her flavoring skill is average.

328
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,051
She's not highly educated.

329
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,090
I've never heard of the university

330
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,251
that she graduated from.

331
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,971
Education doesn't mean everything.

332
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,291
Looking at the perfume she flavored,

333
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,170
I can tell that

334
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,491
she's a potential perfumer.

335
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,610
Liu, smell it again.

336
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,691
It can combine different scents

337
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,931
together perfectly.

338
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:23,691
That's right.

339
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,890
I've long heard about that her nose

340
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,971
is very sensitive.

341
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,330
She can flavor any scent
that she's smelled before.

342
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:32,130
But I think this lady

343
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,491
is a bit crazy.

344
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,130
During the interview,

345
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,410
she said to me that

346
00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:39,011
she has a strong feeling for earth.

347
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,531
My nose is super sensitive.

348
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,051
I'll never make a mistake.

349
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,051
It's from then that

350
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,051
I've grown interest in the earth.

351
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,370
She came back this time

352
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,051
for a special person.

353
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,531
She even said that

354
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:59,130
her perfume is named "Reunion".

355
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,410
This is the perfume I made for you,

356
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,051
cold on the outside
and warm on the inside.

357
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,330
It's called "Fang Leng".

358
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:06,610
What's her name?

359
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,531
I didn't bring her resume with me.

360
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,491
Liu,

361
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,170
is her name Xiaoliu or Xiaojiu?

362
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,931
I think it's...

363
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:12,691
Where's she?

364
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,291
The interns should be
in the working area.

365
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,330
- Mr. Fang!
- Mr. Fang!

366
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,051
Mr. Fang!

367
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,931
Hello, Mr. Fang.

368
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:41,971
Who are you looking for?

369
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,890
(Don't worry.)

370
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:45,890
(I'll never leave you.)

371
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:49,491
(Chai Xiaoqi)
(If you don't remember me anymore,)

372
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,451
(I'll be doing what I'm doing now.)

373
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,971
(I'll use any possible methods)

374
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:54,570
(to remind you of me.)

375
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,410
Is the new intern's name

376
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,810
Chai Xiaoqi?

377
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,451
She has just come for a few days.

378
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,090
I don't know what her name is.

379
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:04,491
But, she's on leave today.

380
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,531
She said she's going for a blind date.

381
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,580
(Missing Calls: Aunt Zhou)

382
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:30,931
Aunt Zhou.

383
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,650
Fang Leng, where are you?

384
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,850
Why haven't you arrived?

385
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:35,731
She has been waiting two hours for you.

386
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,570
I'll be right there.

387
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,410
Xiaoqi.

388
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,771
Aunt Zhou.

389
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,011
The girl today

390
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:08,170
is introduced by your father.

391
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,370
I've never met her before.

392
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,051
You're late for two hours.

393
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,170
Maybe she got angry and left.

394
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,170
(Xiaoqi,)

395
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,090

you almost ran into me.

403

You need to be responsible.

00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,971
I've planned this for so long.

405

Luckily Uncle Fang

and Aunt Zhou were helping me.

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,170

00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,170
look.

428
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,570
What?

429
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:54,531
He has been

430
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,090
waiting for so long.

431
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:58,170
They can finally be together.

432
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,291
Look at them, a match made in heaven.

433
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:03,771
- Of course.
- Zoom in.

434
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:25,931
Fang Leng,

435
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,491
didn't you promise me to go?

436
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:29,170
Why didn't you show up?

437
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,731
My mother will call and scold me again.

438
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:31,771
Can't you just be nice

439
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,251
to your poor brother?

440
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,330
Why didn't she call me yet?

441
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:37,531
She must be waiting
for the opportunity.

442
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,370
How should I reply to her later,
Fang Leng?

443
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,810
Okay, I need to cook for Xiaoqi.

444
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,330
Fang Leng.

445
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,011
I knew this day would come,

446
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,090
but I didn't know it's coming so soon.

447
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,931
You...

448
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,130
Are you missing Xiaoqi too badly

449
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,451
that you're confused
and having illusion?

450
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,850
No worries.

451
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,211
We can get you treated as soon
as possible since we've found out.

452
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:03,610
Yes, let's get you treated.

453
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,211
Fang Leng, let's go to the hospital.

454
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,570
Even if you can't be treated,

455
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,850
I'll take care of you forever.

456
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,650
Who will you be taking care of?

457
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,731
I'll call the hospital for Fang Leng.

458
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:16,731
Fang Leng, this is bad!

459
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,251
I have illusion, too! No way!

460
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,691
Fang Lie.

461
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,570
Fang Lie, my system is down!

462
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:30,731
Xiaobu,

463
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:31,850
what's going on?

464
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,691
Did it happen because
we miss her too much?

465
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:34,931
I'm sure it did!

466
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,090
Let's take a look again.

467
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,251
What should we do?

468
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,810
I'm sure it did! What should we do?

469
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,780
(One month later)

470
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,211
(The famous entrepreneur, Fang Leng,)

471
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:52,971
(is getting married
with his fiancee, Chai Xiaoqi,)

472
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:53,931
(today.)

473
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:55,410

00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,691
(Future Group's newly launched perfume,)

475
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,130
(Forever.7 was originated)

476
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,170
(from Miss Chai Xiaoqi.)

477
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:14,491
My wife is beautiful.

478
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:16,691
The ceremony has yet to start.

479
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:17,931
You can only call me "wife"
after the ceremony.

480
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:26,251
Why are you here?

481
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:28,850
Don't be panicked.

482
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:29,890
I'm not here

483
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,291
to take Xiaoqi away.

484
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,771
Why did you come to the earth?

485
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:35,370
Congratulations

486
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,731
on your wedding.

487
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,090
Are you here for our wedding?

488
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,691
Not really.

489
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,810
Cape Town has launched
a new delicacy policy.

490
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,011
We're going to abandon

491
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,610
the nutrition potion
that replenishes energy.

492
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,731
We're about to start making nice food

493
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:50,691
like the earthlings.

494
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,330
I'm here on the earth to
purchase some stocks.

495
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,890
I happened to see your wedding.

496
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,011
I heard that earthlings
will come to the weddings

497
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:01,170
with cash gift.

498
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,810
This is a token from me.

499
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:08,410
Could it be...

500
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:15,570
Shiyi.

501
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,410
Thank you.

502
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,330
Thank you

503
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:20,491
Shiyi, did you come alone?

504
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:22,771
Let me introduce.

505
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,051
My AI assistant, Candy.

506
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,570
Candy.

507
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:35,291
Candy.

508
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,211

Candy.

514
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,370
Hold on.

515
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,890
Madam, why are you fighting
for food with the kids?

516
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,650
Did you just call me "madam"?

517
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,251
Counting from the date
that I was delivered,

518
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:15,051
I'm not even one year old.

519
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,291
Liar.

520
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,451
Kubri. Fang Lie.

521
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,771
Who is she?

522
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,771
Don't you remember me?

523
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,810
I'm Candy.

524
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,850
You used to break my firewall.

525
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,051
Our mother planet has developed so much?

526
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:55,931
You have a human figure now?

527
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,130
I suspect

528
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,090
you're scolding me.

529
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,251
No.

530
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,491
I...

531
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,531
He taught me all these bad stuff.

532
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,170
What are you doing on the earth?

533
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,330
Master and I came here together.

534
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,051
Jiang Shiyi?

535
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,610
Hurry. Let's go.

536
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:08,850
Hello.

537
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,570
Have we met before?

538
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,011
I'm sorry.

539
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,731
I'm Miss Chai's friend,

543
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,771
Here you go.

544
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,570
Thank you.

545
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:32,971
Candy.

546
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:35,890
Candy.

547
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,971
The wedding is about to start. Let's go.

548
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,291
Master, I have yet to finish my food.

549
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,931
Since you like to eat chocolate so much,

550
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:44,731
why not change your name to Chocolate?

551
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:46,771
Can I?

552
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:49,971
Let's go.

553
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,080

He's a young and talented

555
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,971
She's a cute food lover
who doesn't talk to strangers.

556
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,330
A short encounter on the wedding.

557
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,330
He chases her.

558
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,211
She runs away from him.

559
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,650
She can hardly escape.

560
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,331
My wife.

561
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,650
Hello, everyone.

562
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:32,730

564
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:38,170
Mr. Fang Leng,

565
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,891
will you be gentle and patient

566
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,610
in taking care of your wife?

567
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:45,210
Love her, help her.

568
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,610

570
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:52,130

574
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,411
I will.

575
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,971
Miss Chai Xiaoqi,

576
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:13,011
will you use your whole life

577
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,891
to accept Mr. Fang Leng's love?

578
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:18,290
Poor or rich,

579
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,130
healthy or sick,

580
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,090
in adversity or not,

581
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,090
he will not say that you're fat,

582
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,851
ugly,

583
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:27,650
or old.

584
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,851
And every day in the future,

585
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:32,290
he'll give you every penny
that he earns?

586
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,851
Will you accept that?

587
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,371
I will.

588
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:46,891

652

654
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,051
Sir, lower your head.

(Receivers, Fang Liangliang,

664
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,210
How come
it's Uncle Jiang's parcel again?

665
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,250
It must be Uncle Jiang's

666

present for us.

What's this?

669
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:36,770
It's blinking.

670
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,451
Will it explode?

671
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,290
Uncle Jiang's present
won't be dangerous.

672
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,011
Maybe it's a surprise.

673
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:56,770
Stop.

674
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,051
What's going on?

675
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,700
(Made of a special material from
Cape Town, can't be controlled)

676
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,650
This material

677
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,531
is made of a special material
from Cape Town planet.

678
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,290
Our superpowers can't control it.

679
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,931
Cape Town Planet

680
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,051
found a special material.

681
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:45,170
Why don't I feel any pain?

682
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:47,690
- We're in pain.
- We're in pain.

683
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,891
Liangliang. Wenwen.

684
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:50,891
- Thank you, Liangliang, Wenwen.
- Tangtang.

685
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:51,971
I'm back.

686
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,570
I'm back as well.

687
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:55,690
What are you doing?

688
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,290
- What happened? Get up.
- I have no more strength.

689
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,610
- Why are you lying on the floor?
- Tangtang.

690
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,331
Get up.

691
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,690
Come, get up.

692
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,770
- What happened?
- Get up.

693
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,531
What happened?

694
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:07,570
Uncle Jiang's present.

695
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:29,851
Xiaoqi.

696
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,371
Yes, what I've prepared for you

697
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:35,011
is Cape Town's latest candy.

698
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,210
Try and see if it tastes good.

699
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:38,730
I was worried that your three children
would fight for the candy with you,

700
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,371
so I set it the way only you can eat it.

701
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,690
Uncle Jiang, you're biased.

702
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,730
I'm not biased, Tangtang.

703
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:45,931
Look at what I've prepared for you.

704
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:48,411
Cape Town's custom-made princess dress.

705
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:50,051
You'll look great wearing it.

706
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:51,690
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

707
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:52,531
Liangliang,

708
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,451
don't you like managing a business?

709
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:56,371
Here's my gift for you.

710
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:58,411
It's Cape Town's
multipurpose calculator.

711
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,851
Isn't it just a high-tech product that

712
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,730
has stored all
the planets' currency data

713
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,011
which can quickly count
the galactic currency?

714
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,130
I'm not interested at all.

715
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,011
Wenwen, grow up faster.

716
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:15,570
I've gifted you many
mechanical components.

717
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,290
Later on, you can ask your mother

718
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,250
to upgrade it for you.

719
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:24,811
Fang Leng.

720
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:29,971
There's no gift for you.

721
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,650
Are you angry?

722
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:47,610
No.

723
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,891
No?

724
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:51,290
Okay then.

725
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:53,090
Then I'll eat

726
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,290
this super nice candy.

727
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:59,290
I'm not eating it.

728
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,051
It's so awful.

729
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:06,770
Right?

730
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,811
It's so awful.

731
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:10,531
How can it be so awful?

732
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:11,531
Eat it.

733
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:17,051
It's indeed awful.

734
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:18,011
Right?

735
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,531
Forget it. I'll throw it away.

736
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:23,811
He prepared it for you.

737
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:24,931
Won't you feel reluctant
to throw it away?

738
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:27,130
Then I'll keep it?

739
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,891
My favorite is still the dishes
you cook for me.

740
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:36,451
Look at you.

741
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,331
It's the best food on the earth.

742
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,331
Done?

743
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:15,931
Yes.

744
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:20,610
What do you think?

745
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,610
This is Cape Town's unlikeness-ism.

746
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,610
We pursue freedom

747
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,451
and are not limited by the model.

748
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:36,891
We can paint whatever we want.

749
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,250
What do you think?

750
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:41,451
Why did you ask me to be
your model then?

751
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:42,851
What?

752
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:44,290
Nothing.

753
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,411
I said, your painting is nice.

754
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,371
The style is really new.

755
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,130
It doesn't care about the details,
and is unique.

756
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,491
Really?

757
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,331
Why did you say it's nice
no matter what I painted?

758
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:57,650
Can't you give me some opinions?

759
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,371
To me, whatever you do is right.

760
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,170
Without Wenwen coming out here

761
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:08,690
with us,

762
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,891
it feels good.

763
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:11,090
I feel the same.

764
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,411
This is sugarcoating. Don't buy it.

765
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,210
Uncle Jiang is so handsome.
Why do you hate him?

766
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,051
You can't betray father.

767
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,411
No, you can't take it.

768
00:47:24,971 --> 00:47:26,210
You can't take it.

769
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,811
This is sugarcoating.

770
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:30,130
No.

771
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,531
You can't take it.

772
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:34,610
Calm down.

773
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,371
- Calm down.
- You can't take it.

774
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:37,570
You can't take it.

775
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:41,210
- Calm down.
- You can't take it.

776
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,971
You can't take it.

777
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:46,130
- Calm down.
- You can't take it.

778
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,491
- Calm down.
- Let go.

779
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,570
No.

780
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:51,290
Where's Wenwen?

781
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,170
Where's Wenwen?

782
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:57,250
Mother, Wenwen is gone!

783
00:47:59,051 --> 00:47:59,851
He's gone?

784
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,130
How did that happen?

785
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,971
Where did he go?

786
00:48:02,331 --> 00:48:03,090
Wenwen.

787
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:04,451
Where was he?

788
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:05,811
He was here.

789
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:08,411
I'm here.

790
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:42,051
Come here.

791
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,531
Did I change back?

792
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:45,411
You did.

793
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:46,851
Naughty boy.

794
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:49,491
Mother, is my zodiac tortoise?

795
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:51,170
Wenwen,

796
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,090
do you remember that I told you

797
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,331
you must control your emotions

798
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,730
and don't let your system get heated?

799
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,931
It's because in our gene,

800
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:03,290
there's this awesome mode
where we'd become a tortoise.

801
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,610
As soon as the temperature
reaches certain degree,

802
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,170
we'd easily become a tortoise.

803
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:08,971
What do we do
once we become a tortoise?

804
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,210
The ice cube that we saw just now.

805
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,051
Yes, use the ice cube to cool down.

806
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,650
So smart.

807
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,931
When you go to the primary school,

808
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:17,650
you can't attend
the physical education class.

809
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,371
Primary school?

810
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:21,491
Aunt Xiaobu, can I join?

811
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,451
Yes.

812
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,690
Tangtang,

813
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,730
you're at the age of going to school.

814
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,210
Of course you can go to school.

815
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,371
Great!

816
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:31,851
I want to share with more children!

817
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:35,730
My Uncle Jiang is super handsome!

818
00:49:36,531 --> 00:49:37,411
Come here.

819
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,090
Tangtang, what did you just say?

820
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:43,451
I want to share with other children

821
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:44,650
about

822
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,411
my father who is more handsome
than Uncle Jiang.

823
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,250
Childish.

824
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,331
That's right.

825
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:54,451
Look.

826
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:55,851
Fireworks.

827
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:58,411
Colorful fireworks.

828
00:49:58,531 --> 00:49:59,331
- Green color.
- Is it nice?

829
00:49:59,331 --> 00:49:59,891
Is it nice?

830
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,650
It's a new year in another five minutes.

831
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,411
- It's nice.
- Time flies.

832
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,971
It has been a decade
before we realize it.

833
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,931
It's a new year.

834
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:09,290
Do you have any wishes?

835
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,011
I hope that I get to eat

836
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,491
more nice food this year.

837
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,290
I want to wear more beautiful dresses.

838
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,250
Me, too.

839
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,051
Liangliang, what about you?

840
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,610
I hope that Cape Town Planet

841
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,051
will cancel the parcel delivery.

842
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:27,051
Then Uncle Jiang will not be
able to send any presents.

843
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,210
That's cool.

844
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:29,770
That's my son right here.

845
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,730
I hope that before
the parcel delivery is canceled,

846
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,491
Uncle Jiang will give me
a digital component that

847
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,451
can stop me from turning
into a tortoise.

848
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:41,891
You're smart.

849
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:43,690
Then I'll not turn into a tortoise.

850
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,770
A tortoise is cute, too.

851
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:48,011
I hope

852
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:50,570
we can have more time to ourselves.

853
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,290
I hope...

854
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:55,051
Wenwen, do you want a younger sister?

855
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:55,650
Yes.

856
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,690
I think we can have two more children.

857
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:02,090
Let's surpass
Fang Leng and Xiaoqi, okay?

858
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,971
Xiaoqi.

859
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,290
Let Tangtang and Liangliang
sleep earlier today.

860
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,610
Sleep earlier?

861
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,210
Yes.

862
00:51:12,011 --> 00:51:12,730
Sleep earlier.

863
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:15,851
What's your father trying to do?

864
00:51:15,971 --> 00:51:16,690
I don't know.

865
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:19,090
Five,

866
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,051
four,

867
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:21,371
three,

868
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:22,770
two,

869
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,051
one!

870
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,730
Happy New Year!

871
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,290
Happy New Year!

872
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:29,931
Happy New Year!

873
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:31,411
Happy New Year, Xiaoqi!

874
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:34,331
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, Xiaobu!

875
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:35,451
Happy New Year!

876
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:38,811
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

877
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,331
Xiaoqi.

878
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,690
What wish are you making this year?

879
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,690
Happy New Year!

880
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,331
My wish is that

881
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,331
our happy story

882
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:49,570
can continue on

883
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,610
and there will be season three.

884
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,770
I hope your wish will come true.

885
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,170
Happy New Year, mother.

886
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,130
- Happy New Year, mother.
- Come here.

887
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,331
Let me hug you.

888
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,531
- Look at the fireworks.
- Look at the fireworks.

889
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:00,531
Look at the fireworks, my precious.

890
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,331
Isn't it beautiful?

891
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:03,371
- Yes.
- Yes.

892
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,331
Do you like it?

893
00:52:06,851 --> 00:52:08,250
Don't fall down.

894
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:15,220
