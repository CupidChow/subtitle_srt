19
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,328
A surprise?

20
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,328
What counts as a surprise?

21
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,647
Fang Leng either gives a black card...

22
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:47,728
or buys fried chicken.

23
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,808
What kind of a surprise can he think of?

24
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:50,968
Fried chicken?

25
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,767
Did he buy a chicken farm

26
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,567
and the chicken could be

27
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,888
fried, prepared and eaten on the spot?

28
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:04,328
I know that plot.

29
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:07,528
I think Fang Leng wants
everyone to know that

30
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,487
the entire chicken farm is yours.

31
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,288
Well, that sounds

32
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,288
kind of creative.

33
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,168
How romantic.

34
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:03,247
Girls,

35
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,888
if I wear this outfit

36
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,367
on my date with Dr. Zhang,

37
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,807
will he be surprised?

38
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,940
Dance with me.

39
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,048
Xiaoqi, you're back.

40
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:47,767
Hi.

41
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,247
- Hello.
- Xiaoqi, you're back.

42
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:50,767
Hello.

43
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:51,807
Ms. Chai.

44
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,487
Hard work pays off.

45
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:54,848
You are finally back.

46
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,367
You know what?

47
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,448
Ever since you left,

48
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:59,687
Mr. Fang dislikes the coffee I make.

49
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,328
It's really not easy for me.

50
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,168
All right.

51
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:03,687
Here I am.

52
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,168
Ms. Chai,

53
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,807
since you're back,

54
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:09,168
I'm sure you've studied

55
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,487
that book thoroughly.

56
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,608
Can you return it to me,

57
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:16,048
just in case?

58
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,208
That book, you know?

59
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:24,848
That one.

60
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,567
By the way, Ms. Chai,

61
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,327
I'll take you to your new spot first.

62
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,048
My new spot?

63
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,007
Yes.

64
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:32,807
This way.

65
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,367
Surprise!

66
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,940
(Rose scent, plum, fruits,
leather massage chair)

67
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,247
(Fruit candy, chocolate)
Mr. Fang prepared

68
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:42,048
a luxury place just for you.

69
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:43,608
Me?

70
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:44,687
Hold on.

71
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:50,687
Add a touch of aroma to your
work with rose aromatherapy.

72
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,208
A candy platter to add sweetness

73
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,567
to your life.

74
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,648
Most importantly,

75
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:57,768
a leather massage chair

76
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:58,968
to relieve your body

77
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,007
of stress.

78
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:02,567
Are you satisfied with it?

79
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,687
It's pretty good,

80
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,327
but I still feel that the former desk

81
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:05,927
suits me better.

82
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:06,528
No.

83
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:07,447
- I don't need this.
- Ms. Chai,

84
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:08,848
you deserve these.

85
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,367
These are your rewards

86
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,728
based on the value you've
created for the company.

87
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,408
This is too much.

88
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,447
I don't think it's appropriate.

89
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,848
What's inappropriate about it?

90
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,848
You help the company's R&D
department to make perfume

91
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:23,528
and even got

92
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,447
The One's project.

93
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,408
Even an independent office is fine,

94
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,447
much less a luxury desk.

95
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:29,687
Ms. Chai,

96
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,048
come and feel it.

97
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,127
Feel it.

98
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:35,728
It's moving.

99
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,687
Xiaoqi, this place is
very close to my office.

100
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,648
If you miss me,

101
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,048
just come to my office.

102
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:54,927
Well,

103
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,648
what about the hormonal fragrances?

104
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,288
In a while, I'll ask the R&D Department

105
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,608
to bring us some samples.

106
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:01,687
Okay.

107
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,088
Work hard.

108
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,608
Hi.

109
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,367
Can I sit here?

110
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:50,127
Sure.

111
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,088
Please take a seat.

112
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:57,768
Thanks.

113
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,048
Sorry to keep you waiting.

114
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,927
No, it's because I'm early.

115
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,168
Waiter.

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:05,807
Hello.

117
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,768
Ladies first.

118
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:08,927
Thanks.

119
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,327
See what you wish to eat.

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,740
(He's more handsome from this angle.)

121
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,807
No.

122
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,968
None of this is quite right.

123
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:39,168
The technician said it was
an error in the extraction method,

124
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,447
but I can only tell the scent.

125
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,447
I don't really know

126
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,088
the methods.

127
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,487
In fact, the R&D Department
has encountered two problems.

128
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,487
Firstly, with the current technology,

129
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,007
it's difficult to extracting
hormones in large quantities.

130
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,968
Secondly, hormones' stability is too weak

131
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,687
for it to blend well with fragrance.

132
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,367
So, we must first gather

133
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,887
a large quantity of hormones
as the raw materials,

134
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,288
before converting it into

135
00:07:58,288 --> 00:07:59,968
more stable hormones

136
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,687
to achieve the desired effect.

137
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,528
There are few industry experts in China.

138
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,327
I've asked Mr. Han to
get in touch with them.

139
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:08,848
Come in.

140
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:10,807
Mr. Fang.

141
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:11,367
How is it?

142
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,408
We've found the person,

143
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,007
but I'm not sure if he will
want to cooperate with us.

144
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:16,608
This is his profile.

145
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:18,848
His name is Ke Ren.

146
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,848
He worked in a research
institute before retiring.

147
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:22,728
He's an expert in research of extract

148
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,728
and converting hormones.

149
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,408
However,

150
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,088
he's a bit eccentric.

151
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:30,168
He does research for fun

152
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,567
and has turned down all companies'
invitations for cooperation.

153
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,048
Later on,

154
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,488
in order not to be disturbed by others,

155
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,327
he moved directly
into the forest reserve

156
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,048
without another word.

157
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,447
30 years of hormones
extraction research?

158
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:46,008
He obtained three patents.

159
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:46,607
That's right.

160
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,327
I think this guy can help us.

161
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,087
I'll look for him tomorrow.

162
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:52,727
Xiaoqi,

163
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:54,087
come with me.

164
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:55,807
Okay.

165
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,807
(The romance between Leng
and Qi is about to begin.)

166
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,847
You're into someone?

167
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,168
I have to thank you for that, Dr. Zhang.

168
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,087
Thank me?

169
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,087
What do you mean?

170
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,488
It's because you reminded me

171
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,248
and made me understand
not to live in the past.

172
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:27,327
It's time to start a new relationship.

173
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,048
However, from
the psychological perspective,

174
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,207
a new relationship
cannot completely heal

175
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,687
the pain caused by first love.

176
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,087
There might even be side effects,

177
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:38,528
because you'll see him as
a substitute for your first love.

178
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:39,727
So,

179
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,408
I suggest not to be
in a hurry to fall in love.

180
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:43,807
(Look at the person
sitting opposite you.)

181
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,168
Although the two of us have
not known each other for long,

182
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,207
in my heart,

183
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:50,207
I am 100% sure

184
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,967
that he's the person I like,

185
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,327
not a substitute.

186
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,567
(What about me?)

187
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,048
You haven't known each other for long?

188
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,727
Do you really know him?

189
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:02,967
I think he is very mature.

190
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,408
External personality can
easily be a disguise.

191
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,128
He looks mature,

192
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,408
but that might not be the case at all.

193
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,008
Don't you think a man like him

194
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:13,288
is very charming?

195
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:15,488
Besides, he is very gentle

196
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:16,768
to me.

197
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,207
Someone who cares too much about others.

198
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,847
Isn't that a people-pleaser?

199
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,048
Once you're in a relationship,

200
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:23,087
he is going to be a pushover

201
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,528
and lack self-awareness.

202
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,288
However, that's what I like about him.

203
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,488
Even better if he listens
to me from now on.

204
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:31,727
Also, he's gentle to me.

205
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:32,847
He's good at coaxing me.

206
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,447
Maybe he's a playboy.

207
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:35,687
He will coax you,

208
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,408
as well as many others.

209
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:40,967
Dr. Zhang,

210
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,207
are you this kind of person?

211
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,567
Me?

212
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,447
The person whom I'm talking about,

213
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:50,927
the mature, gentle and considerate man

214
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:53,128
is you,

215
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:54,607
Dr. Zhang.

216
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:23,888
That's right.

217
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,248
Psychologically speaking,
on the other hand,

218
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:28,488
a new relationship

219
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,807
can indeed alleviate
the damage caused by first love,

220
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:31,927
especially after hearing

221
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,768
the character traits you just described.

222
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,847
This person is perfect for you.

223
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,567
He's someone worth seeing.

224
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,048
Come on.

225
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,820
(Sunny Apartment)

226
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,567
Xiaobu,

227
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,327
in this upcoming work trip,

228
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:05,648
Fang Leng will definitely
drag me around to work.

229
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,008
I might not be able to take care of you.

230
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,447
Are you sure you can
take care of yourself?

231
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,447
Don't worry.

232
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,128
I am a high-end smart secretary

233
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,687
with a strong ability to
adapt to the environment.

234
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,248
Besides,

235
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,447
this trip is also part of your mission.

236
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,727
I'll be there with you.

237
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:21,408
Girls, what are you doing?

238
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,408
We're organising clothes.

239
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,327
Gosh.

240
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,087
Where did you get so much

241
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,567
ugly clothes?

242
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,888
These became obsolete 10 years ago.

243
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,327
There's also this.

244
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:32,847
It makes you look older

245
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,567
and adds a few pounds to
your figure. Don't you think so?

246
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:35,648
Gosh.

247
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,087
Take a look at this.

248
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:39,967
The colour has faded and
you're still wearing it?

249
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,768
You have a lot of beautiful
clothes in your closet.

250
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,447
Why don't you pick some?

251
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:44,727
None of these

252
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:45,648
is good?

253
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:46,768
I think so.

254
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,008
Isn't this quite nice?

255
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,648
Camisoles are a little sexy.

256
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:57,008
Well, it'll be so cold in the forest.

257
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,847
I'll feel cold, right?

258
00:12:58,847 --> 00:12:59,847
Yes.

259
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:00,567
Wrong.

260
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,048
The purpose of girls' clothes
is to look beautiful,

261
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,008
never to keep warm.

262
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:05,888
How about this?

263
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,768
Leave this to me.

264
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,528
Do what you're supposed to do.

265
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:13,128
Is Fang Leng here?

266
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:14,488
I'll open the door for him.

267
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:15,687
I'll go with you.

268
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:18,807
Fang Leng.

269
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,687
It's you.

270
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:22,807
Why?

271
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,408
Are you disappointed to see me?

272
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,687
Xiaobu and I...

273
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:27,807
Xiaobu and I were going to have supper,

274
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,048
but you didn't answer my calls.

275
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,048
So I came over.

276
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:31,967
Sorry,

277
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,248
we were packing.

278
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,327
So I didn't look at my phone.

279
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:35,488
Are you moving again?

280
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,207
Where to?

281
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,607
No, we're going to
the forest reserve tomorrow.

282
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:40,567
You're going on an outing?

283
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,368
How come you didn't ask me along?

284
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,168
It's not an outing.

285
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,687
Fang Leng is taking me
on a business trip.

286
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:45,368
Xiaobu will keep me company.

287
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,807
My brother is bringing you on an outing?

288
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,327
Wait, if my brother is
taking you on an outing,

289
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,807
why didn't he ask me along?

290
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:52,967
(Jiang Shiyi: Xiaoqi, I have something important to tell you.)
Is he mad at me

291
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,008
(Jiang Shiyi: Xiaoqi, I have something important to tell you.)
or does he not love me anymore?

292
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,048
(Jiang Shiyi: Xiaoqi, I have something important to tell you.)
Tell me.

293
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,008
Why aren't you saying anything?

294
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:59,048
You don't even bother to explain now,

295
00:13:59,048 --> 00:13:59,648
do you?

296
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:00,888
My brother doesn't love me anymore.

297
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:01,727
Am I so replaceable

298
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,768
to you all?

299
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,807
All of you don't love me.

300
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,847
I'll leave him to you.

301
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:10,048
Bye.

302
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,248
Let's have supper.

303
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:17,967
Okay, let's go.

304
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:19,528
Then I'll change into
nother pair of shoes.

305
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,327
Master,

306
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:24,768
have you really made up your mind?

307
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,528
Xiaoqi is too naive.

308
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,727
If she stays on earth,

309
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,248
Fang Leng is just going
to deceive her further.

310
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:49,927
Going home with me

311
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,567
is her best choice.

312
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,768
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

313
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,048
Come on in.

314
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:06,727
Okay.

315
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:08,447
Sit.

316
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:16,607
Xiaoqi,

317
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:18,567
has it ever occurred to you

318
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,048
that there have been
a lot of coincidences

319
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,727
from the moment we met

320
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:24,807
to how we got to know each other?

321
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,207
We first met

322
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,967
at the cocktail party.

323
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,567
Nana pushed you

324
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,008
and I gave you a hand.

325
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,807
The second time was in our company,

326
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,488
I helped you to settle the contract.

327
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,847
There's another time. It was raining.

328
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:48,927
I suddenly showed up

329
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:49,927
with an umbrella.

330
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,048
Do you realise that

331
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,128
I'm there

332
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:00,648
every time you need help?

333
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:02,567
Yes.

334
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,927
Xiaoqi, actually,

335
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,967
- my real identity is...
- Sorry.

336
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,327
Can I answer a call first? Thanks.

337
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,768
Hello, Fang Leng.

338
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,008
I've packed my luggage, don't worry.

339
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,567
When the technical problem
is solved tomorrow,

340
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,648
the R&D Department will soon be able

341
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:20,967
to extract Hormone Element.

342
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,888
Sorry.

343
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,048
Where were we?

344
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,008
Is your business trip tomorrow

345
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,847
related to extracting Hormone Element?

346
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,207
Tomorrow, we're going to meet

347
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,488
a scientist.

348
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:34,408
His studies

349
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:36,288
is about how to extract Hormone Element.

350
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,528
You just mentioned

351
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,567
your identity or something.

352
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,488
We were talking about

353
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:45,927
my real identity, right?

354
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,207
My real identity is

355
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:52,847
your guardian angel.

356
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,447
I can keep you safe at all times.

357
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:00,567
All right. It's getting late.

358
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,408
You should go home.

359
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:05,768
Bye.

360
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,248
Master,

361
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,127
you made the right decision.

362
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,407
You shouldn't give up
the chief's position

363
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,208
for anybody.

364
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,340
(Sunny Apartment)

365
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,288
I'll do it.

366
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:36,208
This...

367
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,367
Fang Leng, I'm here!

368
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,127
Who told you to come?

369
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:41,728
Relax.

370
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,167
Look, I bought so much delicious food.

371
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,208
We can eat on the way.

372
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,167
We're going on a business trip.
Do you think we're having fun?

373
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,008
Don't worry, Fang Leng.

374
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,528
I can take care of myself.

375
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,008
I won't give you trouble.

376
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:50,968
Here.

377
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:52,607
Close the door.

378
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:53,968
Xiaobu, get into the car.

379
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:54,567

Let's go.

416
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:10,928
- It's so quiet.
- Is this the place?

417
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,127
Hello.

418
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:15,728
Hello.

419
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:17,847
We're going in.

420
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,008
Hi.

421
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:28,607
Excuse me.

422
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:29,728
Don't bother.

423
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,448
I do not lack money nor fame.

424
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,807
Nor am I going to sell
the patents of my technology.

425
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:35,167
Sir, please wait.

426
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,327
We just want you to hear

427
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,768
what our company's project is all about.

428
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,208
It'll only take
five minutes of your time.

429
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:39,928
Miss,

430
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,968
if you've looked up my information,

431
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:42,567
you should know

432
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,968
why I moved here.

433
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:46,167
Our company is different from others.

434
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,887
It'll only take
a little bit of your time.

435
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,567
Okay, I still have something to do.
See yourselves out.

436
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,847
Sir, it's only a few minutes.

437
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,087
That's all it takes. I mean it, Mr. Ke.

438
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:53,968
We won't waste your time.

439
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,807
Why is this person so peculiar?

440
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,407
He won't even listen to others.

441
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:00,528
Mr. Ke,

442
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,887
we're sorry

443
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,087
to drop by without notice.

444
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,407
I am Fang Leng, the president
of Future Group.

445
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:06,607
We're here today

446
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,928
to invite you to join our company

447
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:09,968
as our technical consultant.

448
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,607
We're not

449
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:12,807
trying to convince you

450
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,448
to sell your patent.

451
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,887
Leave. I'm taking a nap.

452
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,127
Don't disturb me, okay?

453
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:18,968
Sir.

454
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:23,528
Fang Leng,

455
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,127
maybe he's in a bad mood today.

456
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,607
Why don't we come back another day?

457
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,928
That's Mr. Ke for you.

458
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:29,647
If you can't convince him today,

459
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,087
it's even less likely another day.

460
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,248
This orchid...

461
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,167
(Orchid?)

462
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,607
I remember now.

463
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:45,488
I remember now, everyone.

464
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:46,528
Come over.

465
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,567
He had this orchid before
his wife passed away.

466
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,008
Mr. Han gave me his profile.

467
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:55,288
His wife passed away five years ago.

468
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:56,607
To commemorate his wife,

469
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,248
he's been taking care of
the orchid ever since.

470
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:00,607
Such a good husband.

471
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,688
However, this flower is dying.

472
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,127
No wonder he's so impatient.

473
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,887
His wife's flowers are dying.

474
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:09,367
No one would be pleased to see that.

475
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:11,367
Fang Leng,

476
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:13,448
why don't I give him
a painting of the orchid?

477
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,847
Maybe it will cheer him up.

478
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,448
No matter how well you paint,

479
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:17,847
I don't think it can

480
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,887
replace this orchid in his heart.

481
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,008
Look up the growth
characteristics of this orchid.

482
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:32,127
Orchid is best grown in slightly acidic,

483
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:32,968
highly-permeable

484
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:34,488
and loose soil,

485
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:35,847
preferably with pine bark

486
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,208
providing a type of
fungus for its growth,

487
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,528
so that it'll grow better.

488
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:41,327
It's also ideal to have
humid growing conditions.

489
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,928
However, this is ordinary nutrient soil.

490
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,008
It's dry. That's why it's growing poorly.

491
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:48,647
Pine bark?

492
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:52,087
Pine bark.

493
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:56,367
Xiaobu, you're so smart.

494
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:57,688
Of course.

495
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,448
Pine bark.

496
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,327
Pine bark.

497
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:13,968
Did you find a lot?

498
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:15,728
Not really.

499
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,087
I'll go further

500
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:20,968
to pick some.

501
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:21,607
I'll go.

502
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:22,448
Fang Lie and I will.

503
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,647
You two, rest for a while.

504
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:25,688
Sure.

505
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:26,288
Okay.

506
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:26,928
Fang Lie.

507
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:32,928
I don't think the pine bark

508
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,248
is enough.

509
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,688
Its leaves are withered.

510
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:36,968
I don't think it will survive,

511
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:38,327
unless...

512
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,928
Xiaobu, keep an eye out for me.

513
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:57,248
Light Wave of Love.

514
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:20,008
We've succeeded.

515
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,407
We did it!

516
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,847
It works.

517
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,327
I've even controlled the energy

518
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,647
so that it won't bloom.

519
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:33,528
When they come back,

520
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:34,807
we'll tell them

521
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,327
the pine bark did it.

522
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:38,688
Got it.

523
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:52,567
Where's my orchid?

524
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:55,928
Sir,

525
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,940
(The soil is now pine bark
and cobblestone. Remember to water.)

526
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,300
(It'll be fine with
good temperature and sunlight.)

527
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:10,127
If the pine bark isn't enough,

528
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,448
there's plenty over there.

529
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,728
Mr. Ke,

530
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,407
there is a large pine
forest at the back hill.

531
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,488
You can get more from
there if it's not enough.

532
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,448
Back hill?

533
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,008
You went all the way there?

534
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,488
We were afraid that it wouldn't survive.

535
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,367
Wasn't this your wife's flowers?

536
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,167
It must mean a lot to you.

537
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,208
Mr. Ke,

538
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,528
I'm sorry

539
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:37,248
we took away your flowers

540
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,488
without your permission.

541
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:42,327
Who would have thought pine
bark would have such a good effect?

542
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,528
You guys did me a huge favour.

543
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:45,928
However, it's the first time

544
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,327
someone actually noticed my orchid.

545
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:50,928
We came here with sincerity.

546
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:53,807
If the cooperation isn't possible,

547
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:54,928
it doesn't mean

548
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,407
we can't be friends.

549
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,567
I can see how sincere you are.

550
00:25:58,847 --> 00:25:59,647
Wait here.

551
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:02,127
I'm going to get the materials
for Hormone Element extraction.

552
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:08,407
That's great.

553
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,768
I didn't expect pine
bark to be so useful.

554
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,048
The orchid sprouted

555
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,567
in less than two hours.

556
00:26:16,248 --> 00:26:16,887
Xiaoqi,

557
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:18,688
it's all thanks to you.

558
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,008
It's because everyone's
hard work is paying off.

559
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,127
Besides, I've noticed that

560
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,567
Mr. Ke is not as strict as we thought.

561
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:29,208
However, I think you're the best.

562
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:31,688
Otherwise, we wouldn't have seen Mr. Ke.

563
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,567
The weather is nice today.

564
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:39,367
Xiaobu, come and sketch with me.

565
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,567
This is the hormone
collector I developed.

566
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:54,248
Just put it on your arm
and it'll start working.

567
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,528
However, it has to
connect to the monitor

568
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,488
to detect real-time data.

569
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,768
This machine can help you

570
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:07,847
to convert hormones into

571
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,968
the more stable Hormone Element.

572
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:11,928
The structure is too complicated.

573
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:13,887
It's likely to be the only
one in the country.

574
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,048
I'll

575
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,607
give it to you now.

576
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,327
Thanks, sir.

577
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,167
Also, this data.

578
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:24,448
This book

579
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:25,928
records the summary of
hormone purification technology

580
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:27,488
and experimental methods

581
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,728
I've written for the past 30 years.

582
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:41,728
Thank you.

583
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,688
My technology can help
you to convert hormones

584
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:46,928
into high-purity Hormone Element.

585
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:47,887
However, this process

586
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,807
requires a lot of hormones
as raw materials.

587
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,288
The experiment of collecting hormones

588
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:52,488
is very difficult,

589
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,488
not to mention extraction
in large amounts.

590
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,167
(My ring can extract hormones,)

591
00:27:58,327 --> 00:27:59,607
(but it can't convert into)

592
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,528
(the technology used by Fang Leng.)

593
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,567
Actually, the breakthrough point

594
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,768
of large amounts of hormones extraction

595
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,248
lies in selecting the best
experimental sample.

596
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:11,127
However, aren't
the fixed values the same

597
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,887
when the human body secretes hormones?

598
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,127
Hormones secretion
varies for individuals

599
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,048
in different situations.

600
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,327
Choosing the correct experimental sample

601
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,008
will greatly improve the success rate.

602
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,807
Last time I was able to successfully
extract large quantities of hormones

603
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,008
thanks to my wife.

604
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,248
However, that was 10 years ago.

605
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,288
Leaving in time

606
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:52,847
is better than sticking around,
refusing to leave.

607
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:55,647
We have to understand our positions.

608
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:57,288
You're right.

609
00:28:58,008 --> 00:28:59,928
Besides, it's good to go out for a walk

610
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:01,208
to admire such a beautiful scenery.

611
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:02,448
Am I right?

612
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,288
Someone is swimming.

613
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:13,887
How is your painting coming along?

614
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,087
I haven't finished yet.

615
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:17,688
Show it to me.

616
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:18,847
No.

617
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:19,968
I'm not done yet.

618
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:20,968
It's fine.

619
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:21,968
Let me take a look at it.

620
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,167
I can't show it to you.

621
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,327
I haven't finished yet.

622
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:26,968
Are you doing a poor job because
you haven't painted for a long time?

623
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:27,488
That's not it.

624
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:28,127
Show it to me.

625
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,008
That's not true.

626
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,528
I haven't even seen it.

627
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,087
I'll show it to you when I'm done, okay?

628
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:34,887
I'll show it to you when I'm done.

629
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:40,728
Don't move.

630
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:18,087
Xiaobu,

631
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,887
aren't we going a little too fast?

632
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:25,008
Where did it go?

633
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:25,807
What's wrong?

634
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,847
It's a bug.

635
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:27,887
A bug?

636
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,567
A bug!

637
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,807
Where is it, Xiaobu?

638
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,087
Where is it?

639
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:43,647
Xiaobu.

640
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,248
Didn't you say you were
drawing the scenery?

641
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:48,688
These are all drawings of me.

642
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,087
Well,

643
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,407
sketching

644
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,087
is all about drawing
what's before your eyes.

645
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,647
When I wanted to draw the scenery,

646
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,127
you were in front of me.

647
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:01,528
That's why I included you in the sketch.

648
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,448
What about this one?

649
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,087
Well,

650
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:13,847
that one...

651
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,127
That's...

652
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:20,327
It's like what we see in TV shows?

653
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,488
When a guy sees a girl he likes,

654
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:27,127
he would find her cute

655
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,768
and feel like touching her head.

656
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,407
The girl he likes?

657
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,220
(System temperature is increasing)

658
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:19,248
Xiaobu!

659
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:23,288
(He didn't touch my head this time.)

660
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,327
(Why am I turning into a turtle again?)

661
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:56,208
Your hair is still wet.

662
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,048
Don't catch a cold.

663
00:33:57,688 --> 00:33:58,607
Thanks, Fang Leng.

664
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,488
I feel so cold.

665
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,208
Xiaobu,

666
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,167
can you get me a bottle of water?

667
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,328
Thanks.

668
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:11,968
You're welcome.

669
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:14,848
Why are you acting this way?

670
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:18,567
Xiaoqi,

671
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,328
look into my eyes.

672
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:26,767
What's wrong?

673
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:28,767
I don't feel anything.

674
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:31,087
(Why can't I look into Fang Lie's eyes?)

675
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:31,767
What's wrong?

676
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,488
I still feel very cold.

677
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:47,848
(Let's give it another try.)

678
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:54,607
Don't worry, Xiaobu, I'm fine.

679
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,100
(Alert System temperature is increasing)

680
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,127
(I'm not.)

681
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,127
(I can't stay here.)

682
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:06,607
(This place is too dangerous.)

683
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:10,928
I'll do it.

684
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:12,008
Sit opposite me.

685
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:16,247
Thanks, Xiaobu.

686
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:28,888
Not bad.

687
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:30,048
It feels warm.

688
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:30,928
Fang Leng,

689
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,048
I don't wanna sleep in a tent.

690
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:34,528
Why? It's just a night.

691
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,368
Make do with it.

692
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:36,167
No way.

693
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,567
What if I catch a cold?

694
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,048
I'll see if there's a hotel nearby.

695
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:41,607
- Xiaobu.
- Fang Lie.

696
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:42,567
Let's go to a hotel.

697
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:43,567
Come on.

698
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,087
- Hurry.
- Fang Lie.

699
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:45,848
Bye, Fang Leng.

700
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,567
Why are you taking Xiaobu away?

701
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:49,008
Fang Lie!

702
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,087
There're so many stars in the sky.

703
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,247
The last time I saw so many stars

704
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:02,727
was on a spaceship.

705
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,448
A spaceship?

706
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,928
Well, it's...

707
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,328
Come on, I'll tell you.

708
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,727
I mean do you know

709
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:19,167
two planets

710
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,368
which always stay close

711
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,287
to each other?

712
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:26,287
Are you talking about

713
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:28,408
the earth and the moon?

714
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:31,127
You're so smart.

715
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:33,048
That's right, the earth and the moon.

716
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,687
Our teacher used to tell us that

717
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:39,368
independent stars

718
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:40,968
can only emit faint light on their own.

719
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:42,687
Only through the help of other planets

720
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:43,928
that they are able to create miracles

721
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:45,008
and civilisations.

722
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:46,687
It was from that time

723
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,848
that I became immensely
interested in earth.

724
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,488
In the future, if there is a chance,

725
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,247
I'll travel around the world with you.

726
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:58,087
Really?

727
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,048
That way, it will fully

728
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:02,488
satisfy your curiosity.

729
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:03,687
Okay.

730
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:07,008
Put it on, too.

731
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,287
Besides, I've noticed that

732
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:14,848
earthlings

733
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,767
are similar to the relationship
between the earth and the moon.

734
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:20,408
If anything happens to a person

735
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,328
and someone else is
willing to help him or her,

736
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:25,167
this matter will be resolved in no time.

737
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:27,607
Every time I encounter difficulties,

738
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:28,528
I really hope

739
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,528
Xiaobu and Chai can be by my side.

740
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,528
You, too.

741
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,528
If you encounter any difficulty,

742
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:35,848
you must tell me in time.

743
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,448
You've helped me a lot.

744
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,808
However, not this time.

745
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:46,567
How to choose a sample
for extracting hormones?

746
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,408
What kind of people can secrete

747
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:49,727
more hormones?

748
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:52,488
I have no idea at all.

749
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:58,767
In fact, hormones produce

750
00:37:58,767 --> 00:37:59,968
a feeling of being in love.

751
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:01,848
People who are in love

752
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,408
naturally have emotions.

753
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:05,767
Emotions release

754
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,008
more hormones.

755
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,727
If you think about it this way,

756
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:12,528
I think couples who are in love

757
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,287
are the best experimental samples.

758
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:18,528
Yes.

759
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,008
Then we just need to
recruit a few couples

760
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,567
to start the experiment.

761
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:24,488
You're so smart.

762
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:28,848
Yes. Find a few couples.

763
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:33,687
Actually,

764
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,848
I think I can do it now.

765
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:41,167
What do you mean?

766
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:52,928
Xiaoqi, I love you.
