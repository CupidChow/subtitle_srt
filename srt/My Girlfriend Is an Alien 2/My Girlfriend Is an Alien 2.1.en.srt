=Episode 1=

19
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:43,744
It's 10 a.m. on July 7, 2021

20
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:46,063
in Beijing time.

21
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,263
Good morning.

22
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,983
This is City News.

23
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,664
Fang Leng, president of
the renowned Future Group,

24
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,263
has successfully developed
Hormone Element.

25
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:54,144
We've learnt that

26
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:55,144
that Hormone Element
is a kind of element

27
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:57,063
extracted from human body.

28
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:58,983
It'll be used to make perfume.

29
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:01,384
It can produce a perfume
that can promote

30
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,183
dopamine secretion and
make people happy.

31
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,423
(Renown entrepreneur Fang Leng is getting married today.)
In addition, he's having his wedding

32
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,864
(Renown entrepreneur Fang Leng is getting married today.)
with his fiancee today here.

33
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,623
It's deemed double happiness.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,400
(Fang Leng & Chai Xiaoqi)

35
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:17,983
Is the wedding about to start?

36
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:18,703
Yes.

37
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:22,904
Please wait for a moment.

38
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:24,504
The wedding ceremony

39
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:25,823
will begin soon.

40
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,583
It's already time.
Why hasn't the bride arrived?

41
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,863
There she is.

42
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,983
(I'm Chai Xiaoqi, a female alien)

43
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,303
(from Cape Town Planet.)

44
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,944
(In 2019,)

45
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:33,064
(I was forced to land on Earth
due to spaceship failure.)

46
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,703
(I rescued Fang Leng
who almost got killed)

47
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,184
(in a car accident,)

48
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,464
(but accidentally)

49
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:39,224
(dropped the signaller that can
be used to contact my planet)

50
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,064
(in his heart.)

51
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,504
You're that person I'm looking for.

52
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:45,624
(However, because of that,)

53
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,104
(our paths crossed.)

54
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:49,303
Be my girlfriend.

55
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,983
(We turned from quarrelsome lovers
at odds with each other)

56
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:53,303
You're my girlfriend.

57
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,664
You can only look at me.

58
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:58,583
(to intimate lovers who
experienced life and death.)

59
00:03:58,743 --> 00:03:59,703
I don't want her anymore.

60
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,703
It's not the signaller
that can make me stay.

61
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:04,784
It's you.

62
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:06,303
There's another name for love.

63
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,104
It's support, Xiaoqi.

64
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,344
Let's love again.

65
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:11,064
My home

66
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:12,583
is wherever you are.

67
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:14,664
(Finally,)

68
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,983
(we overcome all obstacles)

69
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,303
(and are entering a marriage.)

70
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:21,584
How wonderful.

71
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,784
She can't compare

72
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:34,943
to the time I was young.

73
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,144
However, they're quite a match.

74
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,664
Stop talking.

75
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:42,623
I'm telling the truth.

76
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,704
They're a perfect match.

77
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,824
Now I have two questions
for the bride and groom.

78
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:50,784
Firstly, I want to ask
the handsome groom,

79
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:51,863
Mr. Fang Leng.

80
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,543
Do you want to marry Ms. Chai Xiaoqi

81
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:55,983
and be her lifetime

82
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,584
companion in sickness

83
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:58,904
or in health

84
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,183
and for richer, for poorer?

85
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:01,943
I do.

86
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,743
Now I want to ask
the pretty and kind bride,

87
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:09,183
Ms. Chai Xiaoqi.

88
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,983
Do you want to marry Mr. Fang Leng

89
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,503
and be his lifetime

90
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:14,943
companion in sickness

91
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,423
or in health

92
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:17,983
and for richer, for poorer?

93
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:19,423
I do.

94
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,983
The ring signifies a commitment
that will last until death.

95
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,344
It also represents the beginning
of a happy marriage

96
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,943
for both of you.

97
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:29,704
Now,

98
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,543
we shall have the groom, Mr. Fang Leng,

99
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,543
and the bride, Ms. Chai Xiaoqi,

100
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:37,063
to exchange the meaningful rings.

101
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:46,024
This ring looks very cute.

102
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:47,464
Do you still remember this sapphire?

103
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,664
You left it the first time

104
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,024
when you rescued me.

105
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:55,704
I took it

106
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,423
as a love token between us.

107
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,264
I specially made it a heart shape.

108
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,664
I want to watch over you

109
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:05,784
in silence when you're wearing it.

110
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,383
Congratulations!

111
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,824
Now the groom

112
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,543
may kiss the bride.

113
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:41,584
Kiss her.

114
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:02,344
This is bad.

115
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:03,183
Xiaobu!

116
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,104
Xiaobu!

117
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:04,863
Oh no!

118
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:10,863
Fang Leng.

119
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,863
No way.

120
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:13,264
Fang Leng!

121
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:14,024
- Xiaoqi!
- Fang Leng!

122
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:15,383

123
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:18,423
Fang Leng.

124
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,024
- Fang Leng.
- Xiaoqi!

125
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:27,743
Xiaoqi!

126
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,904
- Fang Leng!
- Xiaoqi!

127
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:33,423
Fang Leng!

128
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:35,623
Xiaoqi!

129
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:36,943
Fang Leng!

130
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,780
(Cape Town Planet, Prison)

131
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,063
Violation of the planet's ban.

132
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,743
Unauthorised marriage.

133
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,063
The charge has now been confirmed.

134
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,784
Xiaoqi.

135
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,623
Why are you still resting
with your eyes closed?

136
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,784
You're simply unconcerned.

137
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:07,423
Be quiet, Xiaobu.

138
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:08,863
I haven't known

139
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,464
what charge will
the organisation press on me.

140
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,784
I need to use this time

141
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,063
to save all my memories

142
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:14,383
with Fang Leng.

143
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:15,743
Watch out for me.

144
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:46,143
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven

145
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,824
fell in love with
an earthling arbitrarily.

146
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,224
Based on the law of Cape Town,

147
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,224
she should be sentenced
with lifetime exile.

148
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,863
I agree. You're right.

149
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,143
Only this

150
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,544
will be enough to warn
everyone in Cape Town Planet.

151
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:58,143
Let them know

152
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,824
the consequence of going against

153
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,064
the planet's belief.

154
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:02,903
Chief.

155
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,503
If we merely want to punish No. Seven,

156
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,623
there's no problem with
the execution by law.

157
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,704
However, if we want to uphold

158
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,544
Cape Town's belief fundamentally,

159
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,064
there's actually a better way.

160
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,903
No. Seven was affected by
Hormone of the Earth.

161
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,304
Hormone will enchant us in Cape Town

162
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:19,383
and disable our judgement.

163
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,023
From what I know,

164
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,663
Fang Leng, the earthling,

165
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,304
has refined Hormone

166
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,544
and developed Hormone Element
with greater power.

167
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,503
It's a huge threat to our planet.

168
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,104
I think

169
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,704
we may use No. Seven's identity
as Fang Leng's wife.

170
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,623
Send her to steal
Hormone Element from Earth

171
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:35,424
to study it.

172
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,503
Only then we can get
to the root of the problem.

173
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:42,824
I'm willing.

174
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:45,824
I'll use my qualification as
a candidate for Chief

175
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:47,944
to vouch for No. Seven.

176
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:54,863
No. Seven.

177
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:57,783
The organisation will upgrade
all your systems.

178
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:00,663
Your memories on Earth
will be deleted at the same time

179
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,663
and new memories will be implanted.

180
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,424
Memories are being deleted.

181
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:13,023
Fang Leng is a bad guy who
develops Hormone Element.

182
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:16,424
When you're carrying
out your duty on Earth,

183
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,104
you're bullied by him.

184
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:22,704
He even took you by force
and forced you to marry him.

185
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:25,023
Although Fang Leng is
your husband by law

186
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,104
on Earth,

187
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,704
he's more like
your irreconcilable enemy.

188
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:33,383
My husband in law.

189
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:36,143
Irreconcilable enemy.

190
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,104
Although I get to save you this time,

191
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:41,944
hopefully you won't be

192
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,983
affected by Hormone again.

193
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,184
Have I become a human, too?

194
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:18,584
What do you think?

195
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:25,184
By the way,

196
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:26,863
look.

197
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,160
(Searching)

198
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,630
(Searching on earth)

199
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:30,623
(Searching on earth)
This is good.

200
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,863
We can check information of Fang Leng.

201
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,544
Okay.

202
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:40,944
Not bad.

203
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,104
Xiaoqi.

204
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,944
Why do you want to choose this
out of so many sets of clothes

205
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,184
prepared by the organisation for us?

206
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,304
Don't you think this is the prettiest?

207
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,584
It's the bulkiest.

208
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,383
It has the greatest air
resistance and ground friction

209
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,743
after we arrive on Earth.

210
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:57,983
It's the most troublesome
to move around.

211
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,023
Why do you behave the same
even after you've changed?

212
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,743
Don't worry.

213
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,383
I've prepared a lot of clothes.

214
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,184
It's just that Hormone Collector

215
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:08,544
looks

216
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:10,344
so funny?

217
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,023
The organisation should've aimed

218
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,663
for the sapphire's great storage space.

219
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,304
Hence, it's made into a collector.

220
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,783
However, it's certainly quite funny.

221
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,903
It must be a seized Earth product.

222
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,663
An Earth product.

223
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:23,983
It's okay.

224
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,064
This mission has three elements.

225
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,903
Rapid, precise and ruthless.

226
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,064
Rapidly land on Earth.

227
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,503
Precisely find Hormone Element.

228
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,824
Then ruthlessly teach
Fang Leng a lesson.

229
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,623
You must be careful this time.

230
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,424
We're deceived by them once.

231
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,663
The organisation has upgraded

232
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,663
my firewall against hormone.

233
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,344
I'm also given an ultimate weapon.

234
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:47,104
What is it?

235
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,383
You'll see when the time comes.

236
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:57,824
What's happening?

237
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,224
- Check it.
- Okay.

238
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,380
(Meteorite is coming.)

239
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:04,944
Xiaobu!

240
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:05,663
Xiaoqi!

241
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:06,743
Xiaobu!

242
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:07,623
Xiaoqi!

243
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,464
Xiaobu!

244
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,224
Xiaobu!

245
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:16,023
Xiaoqi!

246
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,863
Xiaobu!

247
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,503
- Xiaoqi!
- Xiaobu!

248
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,344
Xiaobu!

249
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,064
Xiaoqi!

250
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:28,383
Xiaoqi!

251
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:29,424
Xiaobu!

252
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,224
Xiaoqi!

253
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,263
New Female Power.

254
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:46,584
2018 Future Group's new product launch

255
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:47,903
will be held today.

256
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,863
It focuses on the beauty of women
and showcase their charm.

257
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,704
The new product is endorsed
by Future Group's president,

258
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:54,944
Fang Leng.

259
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,824
Pre-orders are in full
swing since its launch.

260
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:05,464
Mr. Fang.

261
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,464
The product launch will begin soon.

262
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:08,704
To avoid the fans,

263
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:09,863
we'll enter through the back door.

264
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:24,663
Inform the security.

265
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:25,783
Reinforce and guard the back door.

266
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:26,503
Yes, Mr. Fang.

267
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,383
(Wait. Earth.)

268
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:01,743
I'll fly...

269
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:37,383
Are you okay?

270
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:38,023
I'm okay.

271
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,143
Thank you.

272
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:23,143
Miss.

273
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:28,424
Please behave yourself.

274
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,143
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,143
The scent of human hormone.

276
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,184
Gosh. Why do I feel heady again?

277
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,064
No way.

278
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:39,544
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:40,983
Let me smell it again.

280
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,584
Why are you so familiar to me?

281
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:49,863
Miss.

282
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:50,863
- Please behave yourself.
- Smell it again.

283
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,424
I'll smell you again. Wait.

284
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,263
Mr. Fang, you'll soon
be invited to the stage.

285
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,863
Let me touch you for a while.

286
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:02,184
Mr. Fang.

287
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,023
You're busy.

288
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:05,943
There's no rush.

289
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:07,863
I'll buy time for you.

290
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,104
No. Mr. Han!

291
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:11,784
No.

292
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,223
Don't go.

293
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:15,903
You're strange.

294
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:20,943
Mr. Fang?

295
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:23,824
He's Fang Leng.

296
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,663
No wonder he looked familiar.

297
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,584
Am I not his wife?

298
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:30,344
Why did he pretend
like he didn't know me?

299
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:32,863
Strange.

300
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,380
(New Female Power)

301
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:54,903
Next, we'll invite
Future Group's president,

302
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:57,264
as well as the makeup ambassador,

303
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,024
Mr. Fang Leng, to the stage.

304
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,504
You're so handsome, Fang Leng!

305
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:04,223
Fang Leng, you're so handsome!

306
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:08,223
Fang Leng! Look here, Fang Leng!

307
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,264
Fang Leng, you're so handsome!

308
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,504
Mr. Fang, look here!
Look here, Mr. Fang!

309
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,663
You're handsome!

310
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:21,344
Fang Leng, you're great!

311
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:22,943
You're so handsome!

312
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,064
- Fang Leng!
- Look here!

313
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,264
I love you!

314
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,584
Fang Leng, I love you!

315
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,304
All right, next,

316
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:34,024
we'll have an interview session.

317
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,104
First of all, let me introduce myself.

318
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,544
I'm Future Group's president,

319
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:39,824
Fang Leng.

320
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,584
Mr. Fang! Mr. Fang, you're handsome!

321
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:43,463
Thank you very much

322
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:44,143
- for attending
- Excuse me.

323
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:44,784
- the launch
- Let me have a look, too.

324
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:46,064
- of the new season's make-up.
- Let me have a look, thank you.

325
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,104
Actually,

326
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:51,143
Future Group is developing

327
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:52,423
many new products.

328
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,183
Like I say,

329
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:56,264
you may see that our theme today

330
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:57,703
is New Female Power.

331
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,544
I hope that this time,

332
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,584
our product can let all consumers

333
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:03,984
and all women

334
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,584
to showcase their own unique charm.

335
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:07,703
Good!

336
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:12,744
As Future Group's president

337
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:15,064
and makeup image ambassador,

338
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:17,504
we know you must be very busy with work.

339
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:19,984
I wonder if you're still single.

340
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:21,784
I'm still single.

341
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:22,784
You're single?

342
00:19:24,024 --> 00:19:24,744
I...

343
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:26,344
I actually think that love

344
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,703
relies on fate.

345
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:32,344
- Mr. Fang!
- I love you!

346
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:33,423
Mr. Fang!

347
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,223
All the fans are actually curious.

348
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:37,544
What type of girl
do you prefer specifically?

349
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,344
I'll ask you questions

350
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,903
and you'll choose, okay?

351
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:40,744
Sure.

352
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,383
Thank you.

353
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:48,344
Do you prefer a long-haired

354
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,024
or a short-haired girl?

355
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:51,463
A long-haired girl.

356
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,140
(Long hair)

357
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:55,064
I have long hair!

358
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,863
Do you prefer a girl with double

359
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,504
or single eyelids?

360
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,504
- Undoubtedly
- (Undoubtedly double eyelids.)

361
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:01,304
(Single eyelids)
single eyelids.

362
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,024
Single eyelids!

363
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:04,463
(Unbelievable.)

364
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:06,784
Active and cheerful or gentle and quiet?

365
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:08,024
(Gentle and quiet)
A gentle girl.

366
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:09,423
(I'll endure it.)

367
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,703
Would you consider a fan who confesses

368
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:12,984
her love to you?

369
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,700
(Yes)

370
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:14,903
(Yes)
(You've gone too far.)

371
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,744
It actually doesn't matter
what I chose just now.

372
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,623
I firmly believe

373
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,423
that every girl has her own charm.

374
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,143
So I hope every one of you

375
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:26,663
can see your own uniqueness.

376
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:28,143
I also hope you'll use

377
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,824
- Future Group's makeup products.
- Miss.

378
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:31,584
Live another kind of exciting

379
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,623
and different life.

380
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:34,024
- Thank you.
- Miss.

381
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,863
Mr. Fang, we love you!

382
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:38,304
Mr. Fang, we support you!

383
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:38,943
Give it to me.

384
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:40,784
Self-confidence?

385
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,943
What a bad guy.

386
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,264
Come down!

387
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:44,143
Quiet!

388
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,663
Quiet!

389
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:46,304
I came up

390
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:47,943
to tell you the truth.

391
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:49,744
I'm Mrs. Fang.

392
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:52,304
This guy, Fang Leng, is married, okay?

393
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:55,943
We're Mrs. Fang instead!

394
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:56,663
Yes, we are!

395
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:57,863
I'm Mrs. Fang!

396
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,223
We're Mrs. Fang!

397
00:20:59,223 --> 00:20:59,984
I am!

398
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:01,264
I'm Mrs. Fang!

399
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:03,183
We're Mrs. Fang!

400
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:03,863
I...

401
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,304
We are!

402
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,504
Fang Leng, I left not long ago.

403
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,344
What do you mean by
getting so many Mrs. Fang?

404
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,344
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,304
Hello, this fan of mine.

406
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:18,264
Stay calm, everyone.

407
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,463
Future Group has specially prepared

408
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:22,024
a gift for you today.

409
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,104
My staff will give it to you.

410
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,183
Please go down with the staff.

411
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:27,623
Mr. Han.

412
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:30,943
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:33,223
- Wait.
- Hello.

414
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:34,223
I'm Mr. Fang's assistant.

415
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:35,344
I'm Han Zhiming.

416
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:37,824
Miss.

417
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:38,824
Although Mr. Fang

418
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,223
is still single and available,

419
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,784
you should work harder
if you want to become

420
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:42,903
Mrs. Fang.

421
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,104
He isn't single.

422
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,863
- Thank you for today.
- Hurry up!

423
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:48,024
- Don't touch me.
- I'm really glad

424
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:49,584
that you can be here

425
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,504
and be with me...

426
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,744
I can handle all of you.

427
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,024
Why is this hormone

428
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,703
so strong?

429
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,423
No.

430
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,504
I shouldn't have been
stunned by human hormone

431
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,744
anymore,

432
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:28,024
unless you carry Hormone Element.

433
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:30,104
I see.

434
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:31,223
What are you doing?

435
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:37,344
(Is he immune against
Time Stopping?)

436
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:47,024
Alien.

437
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:57,223
Enjoy, Mr. and Mrs. Fang.

438
00:22:58,264 --> 00:23:00,504
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a situation

439
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:01,903
at our launch just now.

440
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:02,863
It's been resolved.

441
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:03,463
Please stay tuned.

442
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,143
Even a launch can go wrong.

443
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,344
He's useless.

444
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:08,784
Shida.

445
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:10,623
Didn't you say you wanted him
to be the acting president

446
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:11,663
for three years?

447
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,143
It's been a year.

448
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:15,183
He hasn't achieved much.

449
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,104
He's just acting foolishly.

450
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:18,784
If this goes on,

451
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,824
I'm worried he'll lose

452
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:22,264
all our old clients.

453
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:27,863
Fang Lie has been studying abroad
for almost a month.

454
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:29,423
How is he doing?

455
00:23:30,903 --> 00:23:32,024
The brat

456
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,064
doesn't even make a call home.

457
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:37,824
Mother and father.

458
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:38,663
Son.

459
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,824
Why are you at Starbucks again?

460
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,143
Do you have insufficient money?

461
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:42,903
Tell me.

462
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:43,943
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

463
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:44,824
No, mother.

464
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,383
I came with my classmates
to do a coursework.

465
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:47,304
If you don't believe it,

466
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,024
let me introduce to you

467
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,304
my classmate, Mike.

468
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:51,344
Hello.

469
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,703
Hello.

470
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:53,784
Hi.

471
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:56,623
Look at how good our son is.

472
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,903
He's just travelled abroad
for several days.

473
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,383
He speaks English so well.

474
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,064
If he joins the company next time,

475
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,663
he'll settle down quickly.

476
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,504
Mother.

477
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:05,663
I need to rush for my MBA coursework.

478
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:07,183
I have to go. Bye.

479
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:08,863
- All right. Go ahead.
- Bye.

480
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,623
Take care of yourself and eat well.

481
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,584
Thanks, brother.

482
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:18,744
Do we know each other?

483
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,304
That girl has been sleeping
there for quite a while.

484
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:36,264
It's a bit strange.

485
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:36,984
Is it?

486
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:38,423
Let's check on her.

487
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:39,064
Let's go.

488
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:43,584
Girl.

489
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:46,183
Girl.

490
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:47,423
Wake up.

491
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:51,784
Girl.

492
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,064
Why are you here?

493
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:55,024
Present your ID.

494
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,383
Girl.

495
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
(Computer performance is affected.
Superpower can't be used.)

496
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,200
(Not registered on earth will be
sent to the police station.)

497
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:18,504
Wait.

498
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,024
A girl suspected to be a stowaway!

499
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:21,663
Chase her!

500
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:29,623
We haven't seen each other for long.
Do you miss me?

501
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:30,863
(Fang Lie)
I've just come back.

502
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,064
(Fang Lie)

503
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,463
(Fang Lie)
I can give you a chance to take me in.

504
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:36,700
(Fang Lie)

505
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,980
(Fang Lie)
(Fang Leng: I don't care.)

506
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:41,903
(Fang Lie)
Are you kidding me?

507
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:42,903
(Fang Lie)
We used to share a bed

508
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:44,863
(Fang Lie)
when we're young.

509
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:46,383
(Fang Lie)
Do you have to be so mean?

510
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:52,544
Stop!

511
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:54,183
Stop right there!

512
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:55,423
There!

513
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,064
- Stop!
- Am I exposed?

514
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:03,223
Stop!

515
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:04,903
Don't run!

516
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:05,663
Stop!

517
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:11,623
- Don't run!
- Keep up!

518
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:22,264
You run fast.

519
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:24,223
Where are they?

520
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,264
- I don't know.
- I'm running away from my mother.

521
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:26,623
- Let's check over there.
- What about you?

522
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:27,863
Stop them!

523
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:30,423
Those in uniform.

524
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,264
Are they chasing you?

525
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:34,463
Who else?

526
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:37,584
They're here!

527
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,064
- Come on!
- Don't run!

528
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,663
- Stop!
- Don't run!

529
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,143
I'm going out to see
whether they're still here.

530
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,460
(Turning into tortoise mode.)

531
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:34,663
They've left. Come out.

532
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:38,383
Where is she?

533
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:49,544
A little tortoise?

534
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:53,024
Wake up.

535
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:54,663
(Stop knocking.)

536
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:56,663
(My CPU is in my brain.)

537
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,423
(The system will collapse
if you knock me again.)

538
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,104
(System alert)
Hey!

539
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,100
(System alert)

540
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:01,223
Hey!

541
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,183
(I'm so dizzy.)

542
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,840
(System alert)

543
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,680
(Sunny Apartment)

544
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:16,744
(This is more comfortable.)

545
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,744
(Hormone Element might be in his house.)

546
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:22,143
(I can't contact Xiaobu anyway.)

547
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,383
(I'll find it now.)

548
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:30,903
I left not long ago.

549
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,463
You changed the password.

550
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:35,584
Bad guy.

551
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,064
(Why is there only a pair of sandals?)

552
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:56,183
(Why is it like a house
for a single person?)

553
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:58,383
(There's not even a thing of mine.)

554
00:28:59,183 --> 00:28:59,984
I'm sorry, miss.

555
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:01,463
Although Mr. Fang is
still single and available,

556
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,104
you should work harder
if you want to become

557
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,304
Mrs. Fang.

558
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:06,784
I know.

559
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,463
He pretended like he didn't know me.

560
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:10,463
He must have cut ties with me

561
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:11,863
when I prepared to leave.

562
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,183
Bad guy.

563
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:30,903
I have a mission,

564
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:32,824
I'll come to you later.

565
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:44,504
Mr. Fang.

566
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:45,544
The launch for today

567
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:47,423
is good in overall.

568
00:29:47,423 --> 00:29:48,623
Although there's

569
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:49,984
a situation in the process,

570
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:51,623
the overall wasn't affected.

571
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:53,824
Also, your speech on the stage

572
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:55,304
was so insightful.

573
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:57,784
It's so insightful.

574
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:00,264
I was in tears below the stage.

575
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:01,064
Enough.

576
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,344
You may go off.

577
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:05,744
You hide it quite well.

578
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:08,064
You're good at hiding it.

579
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:14,623
This is bad. I can't be seen by him.

580
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,264
A scent of hormone.

581
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,663
(No way. I still have a mission.)

582
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:56,463
I'll act after he falls asleep.

583
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:46,104
It's so tiring.

584
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:53,703
I'll find it again tomorrow.

585
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:55,944
I'll take a break.

586
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:39,623
Delicate, smooth and supple.

587
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:43,183
Delicate, smooth and supple.

588
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,944
Delicate, smooth and supple.

589
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,424
- Who are you?
- I...

590
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:58,064
Hi.

591
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,544
I'm Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

592
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:03,263
I'm known as Chai Xiaoqi on Earth.

593
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,143
Why is it Chai?

594
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,504
Chai Xiaoqi.

595
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,623
How did you enter my house?

596
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,544
Is it strange for me to enter my house?

597
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,904
You, however,

598
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:16,303
threw all my things away.

599
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:19,424
You pretend that you're staying alone.

600
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:21,143
Stop pretending to be innocent, insane

601
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,223
and amnesiac.

602
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:23,623
You're cunning.

603
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:25,143
What are you trying to say?

604
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,384
Stop talking.

605
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:28,064
Where's Hormone Element?

606
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:29,143
Hand it to me.

607
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:31,223
If there's something
wrong with your brain,

608
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,984
I can call 120 for you now.

609
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:34,984
However, if you're mentally fit

610
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,303
yet acting like a fool,

611
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:37,663
I'll call 110 now.

612
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:39,424
How can you use public resources

613
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:40,544
in a fight between husband and wife?

614
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:43,703
Not even the rubbish bin
can pretend as well as you.

615
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:44,424
You think

616
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:46,544
I can't live without you, don't you?

617
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,183
I don't want to talk to you.

618
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,183
I don't want to argue with you. Bye.

619
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:05,504
Mr. Han.

620
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,384
Look into a woman

621
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,263
named Chai Xiaoqi.

622
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:12,104
Check my previous relationship with her.

623
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,544
Xiaobu.

624
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:35,143
Why are you here?

625
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,703
After detecting your signal,

626
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:39,783
I crawled one whole night to find you.

627
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:42,263
Why are you back in
your original form as a tortoise?

628
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:43,984
You're even so hot.

629
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:45,823
Don't mention it.

630
00:37:45,904 --> 00:37:48,104
My heat dissipation system
damaged when I landed.

631
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,143
Prolonged and intense movements,

632
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,104
along with the constant
knock on my head

633
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,504
by an earthling,

634
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:54,944
have messed up my whole system.

635
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,464
I can't be restored into the human form.

636
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:57,584
By the way,

637
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,104
did you get the Hormone Element?

638
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:02,864
I couldn't find it after
searching around the house.

639
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:04,984
I reckon it's still with
the company's R&D.

640
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:06,343
Let's find it straight at R&D.

641
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:07,024
Hold on.

642
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,424
Xiaoqi, turn me around.

643
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:12,504
(2018 October 10th, 8:00 a.m.)
It's 8am on August 10, 2018

644
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:15,424
(2018 October 10th, 8:00 a.m.)
on Earth.

645
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:17,143
Future Group's security team

646
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,984
begins work at 9 a.m.

647
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:20,544
If we depart to R&D now,

648
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:22,183
we still have an hour to act.

649
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,663
Xiaobu.

650
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:25,743
Why have you lost count of time

651
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,464
after your system messed up?

652
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:29,183
Based on the time

653
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,064
of our time travel,

654
00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:33,024
it's 2021 on Earth.

655
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,160
(2018)

656
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:41,904
2018?

657
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:43,424
The test is completed.

658
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,143
The time on Earth is operating normally

659
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:48,183
but the cosmic time orbit
was deviated from

660
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:49,584
its original trajectory due
to an unknown turbulence

661
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,663
and a sudden intervention
of the spaceship.

662
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,183
We finally landed in the wrong

663
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,464
time location.

664
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,424
What do you mean?

665
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,020
In short,

666
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
we travelled to the wrong time orbit

667
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,380
and came to one year before
you're stranded on Earth.

668
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:03,864
What?

669
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:08,823
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:14,944
I met Fang Leng in 2019.

671
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:17,544
It's 2018 now.

672
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:19,424
No wonder he didn't know me.

673
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,464
We haven't even met at this time.

674
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:22,984
My goodness.

675
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:26,504
Stop swinging, Xiaoqi.

676
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,104
Xiaoqi, stop swinging.

677
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:30,024
I'm so dizzy.

678
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,984
Shouldn't you find a way

679
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:34,703
to restore my human form?

680
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:46,384
-Good morning, Mr. Fang.
-Good morning, Mr. Fang.

681
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:51,504
-Good morning, Mr. Fang.
-Good morning, Mr. Fang.

682
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:52,944
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

683
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:54,864
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

684
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,464
Recognition is successful.

685
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:26,183
Mr. Fang.

686
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:28,143
Your rainy weather heterosexual amnesia

687
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:29,743
is a self-protection mechanism

688
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,783
in you after rain.

689
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:34,064
You forgot all women
you recently contacted.

690
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,263
- Also...
- Don't make it complicated.

691
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,303
I only forget the women I've contacted.

692
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,024
I remember my illness though.

693
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,864
I said it just in case.

694
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,303
After setting up your memory database,

695
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:50,584
I've entered information

696
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,864
of all women of yours.

697
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:53,504
Other than me,

698
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,984
Dr. Zhang has access to it, too.

699
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,024
Your desktop is so messy.

700
00:40:56,024 --> 00:40:57,263
Do you want to have a bonus cut?

701
00:40:57,984 --> 00:40:59,183
Time is short but the mission is heavy.

702
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,743
(Memory bank management system)
I haven't sorted them.

703
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:01,300
(Memory bank management system)
However, don't worry.

704
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,080
(Memory bank data backend, Chai Xiaoqi)

705
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,700
(No such person!)

706
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:06,703
No information of Chai Xiaoqi found.

707
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,104
Therefore, she isn't one
of your ex-girlfriends

708
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:10,464
whom you forgot

709
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:11,904
due to your rainy weather
heterosexual amnesia.

710
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:13,984
Why did she suddenly appear in my house?

711
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:17,663
She must be a fan.

712
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,783
Girls nowadays are crazy

713
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:20,944
about their idols.

714
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,464
However, she acted like
she's close to me

715
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:25,944
when she showed up in my house.

716
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:26,864
She even felt it's natural

717
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,623
to be living in my house.

718
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,864
That's more like it.

719
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,783
Fans nowadays view their
idols like their husbands.

720
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,663
When they meet you,
they fall in love with you for life.

721
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:36,183
How can you use public resources

722
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:37,183
in a fight between husband and wife?

723
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:41,623
Contact the security team.

724
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:43,303
Upgrade all the security systems

725
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:44,104
at my house and the company.

726
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:44,743
Okay.

727
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,820
(Memory bank data backend, Chai Xiaoqi)
(No such person!)

728
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,024
(Who are you actually?)

729
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:04,384
- Wait.
- Welcome.

730
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:05,944
May I know

731
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,064
what you would like to drink?

732
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:08,303
A glass of milk tea.

733
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:09,663
No milk, tea nor water.

734
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,424
More ice cubes, please.

735
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:11,263
Sure.

736
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:15,424
Here's a friendly reminder.

737
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:17,263
You still need to pay
for the original price.

738
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:17,864
Sure.

739
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:19,944
Sorry, I've served the wrong drink.

740
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:21,783
What's the problem with
the young people nowadays?

741
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,384
Wait. I'll be right back.

742
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:30,904
Your special milk tea.

743
00:42:30,904 --> 00:42:31,623
Enjoy.

744
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:32,343
Thank you.

745
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:35,384
Hurry up! Soak me in it.

746
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,584
- Gosh, why is there another person?
- Sit.

747
00:42:58,064 --> 00:42:59,464
What's wrong with my eyesight?

748
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:05,143
Hurry up. Send a distress
signal to our home planet.

749
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:12,984
What's happening?

750
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:14,904
The impact of landing

751
00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:16,384
has damaged my central nerve.

752
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:18,143
The signaller seems to be broken.

753
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,464
We have no choice but to complete

754
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:23,663
the mission no matter what.

755
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,183
However, it's 2018.

756
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:27,783
Fang Leng doesn't know me at all.

757
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,384
Hormone Element hasn't been developed.

758
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:30,504
I can't possibly obtain it.

759
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:33,183
We can't send any signal.

760
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:34,384
We have to wait until the home planet

761
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:35,823
detects our signal.

762
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,223
Before that,

763
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,183
we're left to wander.

764
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,663
Had I known how difficult and dangerous

765
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:46,783
the mission was,

766
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:49,183
I should've brought more equipment.

767
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,343
Now I only have this useless collector.

768
00:43:51,703 --> 00:43:52,984
What's the point of having you?

769
00:43:58,384 --> 00:43:59,984
Hormone of a male earthling.

770
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:01,464
Cape Town's grade ten banned substance.

771
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:02,944
What? Are you serious?

772
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:04,663
Is there hormone in it?

773
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:06,504
When did I collect it?

774
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:14,623
Fang Leng.

775
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:16,343
He's my one and only contact

776
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:17,343
after I came to Earth.

777
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:20,703
Other than using the signaller
to send a signal,

778
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,064
collecting a full bar of hormone
with the collector

779
00:44:23,104 --> 00:44:25,104
can also automatically send a signal
to contact the home planet.

780
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,263
We can collect

781
00:44:27,303 --> 00:44:28,384
hormone of male earthlings
when Hormone Element

782
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:30,343
has yet to be developed.

783
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:31,663
That'll be considered a success

784
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,343
when we travel back to the home planet.

785
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,464
We can go home.

786
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:37,384
We can go home

787
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,584
by collecting hormone.

788
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,064
Xiaobu.

789
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:43,223
Well done.

790
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,783
I think the move was okay.

791
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:46,303
- You still need to practise.
- Yes.

792
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:47,783
It's strong enough.

793
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:54,544
Okay.

794
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:57,343
(Here comes the chance.)

795
00:44:57,743 --> 00:44:59,864
(I'm going to collect their hormone.)

796
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:02,464
Look.

797
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,263
It happens to be airing
Produce 101 China.

798
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:06,303
Have you watched it before?

799
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:07,424
Of course.

800
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:10,703
Is it the one behind?

801
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:12,024
Yes.

802
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:13,544
This move isn't bad.

803
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:14,703
Not really.

804
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:15,544
It's very powerful.

805
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:17,823
It'd be great if we could

806
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:18,984
appear on the stage one day.

807
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,743
- Why is there no hormone
- By the way...

808
00:45:20,823 --> 00:45:22,303
when they're so young?

809
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:26,823
I don't feel heady.

810
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:27,783
We'll participate in it next year.

811
00:45:27,864 --> 00:45:29,303
There they are. Watch this.

812
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:33,263
They're good.

813
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:35,343
My posture was wrong.

814
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,424
- That one.
- Look at me.

815
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:39,944
Look at me.

816
00:45:46,183 --> 00:45:47,944
(You just need to laugh a bit.)

817
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:49,544
(All I want is the hormone.)

818
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,904
(Once I succeed in my mission,)

819
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:52,663
(my mission will be accomplished.)

820
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,424
(Laugh.)

821
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,143
What is she doing?

822
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:03,343
What's this supposed to mean?

823
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:04,424
I don't know.

824
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:16,864
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

825
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:20,464
Insane.

826
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:24,223
I'm sorry.

827
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,343
Is she insane?

828
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:29,303
Are you two

829
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,424
spies sent over by
the tea house opposite?

830
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:34,984
You did this to chase my customers away.

831
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:37,864
You put on a great show.

832
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:38,864
Tell me.

833
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,904
How much do they pay you a day?

834
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:42,783
I'll pay you one yuan more.

835
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,024
Work for me.

836
00:46:45,183 --> 00:46:46,263
You may have misunderstood.

837
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:47,823
We aren't spies.

838
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:49,303
I'm sorry.

839
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:50,703
Stop.

840
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,984
Did you two

841
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:55,623
forget anything?

842
00:46:56,703 --> 00:46:57,663
What did we forget?

843
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:01,263
I know.

844
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:03,223
You want a five-star rating, don't you?

845
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:05,584
I want you to pay!

846
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:08,064
I forgot to pay her.

847
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,424
I'm sorry.

848
00:47:10,823 --> 00:47:11,504
Thank you.

849
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:12,263
Wait a second.

850
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,663
Don't think you can fool
me with two pieces of glass.

851
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,823
How dare you dine and dash

852
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:19,904
in my territory.

853
00:47:20,263 --> 00:47:21,223
Go.

854
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:22,703
I...

855
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:31,743
Based on our galaxy exchange rate,

856
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:33,464
the crystal given to her

857
00:47:33,504 --> 00:47:34,623
is much more valuable

858
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:36,544
than the currency on Earth.

859
00:47:36,544 --> 00:47:37,343
That's right.

860
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:40,223
They can spend a lot with the crystal.

861
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,384
The earthling doesn't appreciate it.

862
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:48,623
Why couldn't I collect hormone just now?

863
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:49,984
What's the problem?

864
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:54,263
How did you collect hormone

865
00:47:54,263 --> 00:47:54,984
from Fang Leng last time?

866
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:55,864
Last time?

867
00:47:56,783 --> 00:47:57,663
Let me think.

868
00:47:58,064 --> 00:47:59,263
Last time.

869
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:03,504
Is it limited

870
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:05,104
to collecting his hormone only?

871
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,143
What are you doing?

872
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:09,143
Why are you working
so slowly? The cups...

873
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:22,663
He should be around.

874
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:24,143
Look around.

875
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:28,343
No way.

876
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:29,623
Too much movement.

877
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:31,183
The temperature is getting
out of control again.

878
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:32,823
I can't see clearly.

879
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:35,823
I think

880
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:37,303
he's around.

881
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:40,904
Hurry and find a place to rest.

882
00:48:40,904 --> 00:48:41,783
I'll be right back.

883
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,464
Go for it.

884
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:57,303
Fang Leng.

885
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:58,823
Wait.

886
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:30,864
Do you think you can attract me

887
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:32,104
with your dance?

888
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:43,544
Why is there no hormone collected?

889
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:46,424
How can I go home without collecting it?
