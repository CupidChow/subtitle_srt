It's really you.

20
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:00,756
I beg your pardon.

21
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,235
However, I can't hold you anymore.

22
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:14,756
So much hormone.

23
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,675
What are you doing?

24
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:24,275
Don't run.

25
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,275
You're shameless.

26
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,756
I'll call the police if you go on.

27
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:32,715
Go ahead.

28
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:37,436
Fine, since you said that.

29
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:19,555
Mr. Han.

30
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,555
Replace all security guards
in the company.

31
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:32,555
Xiaoqi. How did it go?

32
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:34,115
Come on.

33
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,916
No.

34
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,636
I can't run anymore. Take a break.

35
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,515
I'll become a tortoise
if I continue to run.

36
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,995
You said you'd become
a tortoise when you turned hot.

37
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,115
Does Fang Leng

38
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,476
need certain physiological reactions

39
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,036
to produce hormone?

40
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,596
I remember he's breathing
fast at that time.

41
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,596
His ears were slightly red.
His heartbeat was strong.

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
(Entering bracelet system.)

43
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,636
I saw Fang Leng wore
a health monitoring bracelet.

44
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,116
So I hacked into his data system.

45
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:20,756
Respiratory rate rose
to 23 times per minute.

46
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:22,316
Body temperature rose to
37.3 degrees Celsius.

47
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:24,595
Slight sweating. Both situations
are generally consistent.

48
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:28,636
So I can collect hormone

49
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:30,116
by getting him to produce these changes.

50
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,035
Find out if there's a way.

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
(Analyzing data.)

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
(Result.)

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,880
(Shocked!)

54
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,316
I've always wanted
to teach him a lesson.

55
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:46,595
I can take this opportunity.

56
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,996
Recognition fails. Non-employees
aren't allowed to enter.

57
00:04:57,355 --> 00:05:00,756
Face recognition fails.
No entry is allowed.

58
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:10,475
Bu.

59
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,636
I couldn't enter both
his house and his company.

60
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,915
I couldn't even see his face.

61
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,160
(To let)

62
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:35,475
What are you doing?

63
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,275
I'm searching for
suitable places to stay

64
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,196
near Fang Leng's house.

65
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:42,756
There're two choices at the moment.

66
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,236
The first is the house
next to Fang Leng's.

67
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,116
Its owner, Li Chunjiao,
has left the country.

68
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,236
The house has been unoccupied.

69
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,915
Stay next to his house?

70
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,756
It'll be convenient to
complete our mission.

71
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,076
Will it raise his suspicion?

72
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:56,876
The second choice.

73
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,475
The second one is
a 500sqm open-air room,

74
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,475
200m away from Fang Leng's house.

75
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,116
Ventilated in all seasons, fresh air

76
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,876
with birds and plants. Easy access.

77
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,355
It also comes with a free double bed.

78
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:09,355
This is good.

79
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:10,076
Where is it?

80
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:13,835
Here.

81
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,796
How to be his neighbour?

82
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,395
(Property management center)
Hello.

83
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:51,676
Why is there no one?

84
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:53,275
No one?

85
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:56,116
I'm dressed like this.
It's so uncomfortable.

86
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:05,876
Yes.

87
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
(House owners' information)

88
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:23,996
Who are you?

89
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,475
Hello, I'm the house owner.

90
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,116
I've just come back from France.

91
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:33,275
Hello, I'm Ms. Mary's interpreter.

92
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,915
She's a house owner.

93
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,395
She's just come back from France.

94
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:38,515
She wants to collect
her key that's left here.

95
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,915
Okay. May I know the name of the owner?

96
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,876
Li Chunjiao, her mother.

97
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,316
Li Chunjiao.

98
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:49,035
Look, they resemble each other.

99
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,275
Yes.

100
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,676
Not bad.

101
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,275
It's quite spacious.

102
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,756
It's quite beautiful.

103
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,915
Let's pick our rooms.

104
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,676
This is good.

105
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:29,035
Earthling's bed.

106
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:34,156
- A human's bed is so comfortable.
- It's comfortable.

107
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:36,235
There's also cloud.

108
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,436
Not bad.

109
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:44,076
There's an earthling staying here.

110
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,875
You...

111
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,156
It's you.

112
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:58,196
Aren't you...

113
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:00,235
Run.

114
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,316
Stop!

115
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:21,316
Are you Chunjiao's daughter?

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,700
(Sister Chai)

117
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:24,676
Your mother told me

118
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,516
you'd come and stay here this year.

119
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:27,995
Sorry, I forgot.

120
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,076
Sister Chai, Li Chunjiao asked
her to look after the house.

121
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,635
I treated you badly this morning.

122
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,316
You won't blame me, will you?

123
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,436
- I won't.
- I made this cake

124
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,115
and milk tea today.

125
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,955
Come and try them.

126
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:46,875
Come on. I developed

127
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,955
this new product today.

128
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,516
Is it delicious?

129
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,355
It looks delicious.

130
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,835
Is it delicious?

131
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:01,036
It's delicious.

132
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,875
How wonderful.

133
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,556
Look.

134
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,196
I usually stay alone
in such a big house.

135
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,676
I'm really lonely.

136
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,875
If you can

137
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,076
move in and stay with me,

138
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,916
we can look after one another.

139
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,076
What do you think?

140
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,436
It doesn't matter what you think.

141
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,475
It's been happily decided.

142
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,235
This is the temptation of an earthling.

143
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:31,595
We should remain vigilant.

144
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,916
By the way, you've just returned

145
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,396
and you haven't found a job, have you?

146
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,595
My tea house happens to be

147
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,995
recruiting staff.

148
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,995
Why don't you come and help me?

149
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,355
You can have

150
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:45,196
cake and milk tea for free.

151
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,475
You can always try our new products.

152
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:48,676
My goodness.

153
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,796
Isn't it a perfect life?

154
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,115
No, absolutely not.

155
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,235
Why?

156
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,396
We can't take advantage of you.

157
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,556
I can handle delivery.

158
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,115
She can be a cashier.

159
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:02,955
We'll help you.

160
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:05,875
You two are

161
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,076
so lovely and thoughtful.

162
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,115
It's decided then.

163
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,115
Let's drink to the three of us

164
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:13,875
living together.

165
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:16,076
Cheers!

166
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:29,796
Delicious.

167
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:40,316
Hi!

168
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:41,355
Not you again.

169
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,036
Do you want to try
this freshly baked cake?

170
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,436
We're neighbours from now on.

171
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:54,875
You must be wondering if there's

172
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,115
a special bond between us.

173
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,995
Who wants to be your neighbour?

174
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,036
Xiaobu, you may be
discovered by Sister Chai.

175
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,715
Don't worry. She's taking a shower.

176
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,755
We've become neighbours.

177
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,676
It'll come in handy in the future.

178
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,955
We should hurry and plan

179
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,796
what to do next.

180
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,475
Don't worry. I've long
gathered information.

181
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,475
We'll act after Fang Leng
finishes work tomorrow night.

182
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,556
Mr. Fang, that's all
the arrangement in the morning.

183
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,036
So, have you got anything?

184
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:02,276
Chai Xiaoqi?

185
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:04,715
Yes.

186
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,556
Chai Xiaoqi is
your neighbour's daughter.

187
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,396
It seemed she's
just returned from overseas.

188
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:11,396
What a coincidence.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,100
(How to Enter Your Boss' Heart)

190
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,235
You may call it a coincidence

191
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,916
but it may not be.

192
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:26,676
Do you think

193
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:30,036
it's a wonderful surprise

194
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:32,595
or a long-planned trap?

195
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,715
What do you think?

196
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:40,676
Me?

197
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,156
I wouldn't have been reading this book

198
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,556
if I knew.

199
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,755
It's cosplay.

200
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,635
How boring.

201
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:04,115
Ferocious ghosts summoning souls.

202
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:08,475
Impermanence ghosts claiming lives.

203
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,635
- Impermanence ghosts claiming lives.
- Hold on.

204
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,355
You need to come back.

205
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,115
I'm stuck.

206
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:15,316
- We're stuck.
- Don't go. Don't move.

207
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:15,995
Come back!

208
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,196
We're claiming lives!

209
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,316
Forget it.

210
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:30,036
Beauties, you look so cute.

211
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:30,995
Let me take some photos, okay?

212
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,235
- No.
- Just one minute, come on.

213
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:32,875
Go to that location.

214
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,755
- We're in a hurry.
- Get there.

215
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:34,755
Just a while, come on.

216
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:35,715
All right.

217
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,995
Three, two, one.

218
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,115
You're awesome.

219
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,276
A few more.

220
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:41,995
Here we go.

221
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,156
Get ready.

222
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:43,676
Turn around.

223
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,835
- Cute.
- Wait.

224
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:46,835
- Here we go.
- Let me think. Do it like this.

225
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:47,995
- Two
- Hold on.

226
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:48,755
I'll count from three to one

227
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,156
- and we'll turn around.
- Ready?

228
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,396
Three, two, one.

229
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:53,995
Awesome. It looks great.

230
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,796
You're so expressive.

231
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:56,595
Can you give us the photos?

232
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:58,556
Yes. Just add me on WeChat.

233
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,516
Sure.

234
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:00,196
Come on.

235
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,995
Did you bring your phone?

236
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:05,715
I didn't either.

237
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:07,516
Why didn't we bring our phones?

238
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,156
Ferocious ghosts summoning souls.
Impermanence ghosts...

239
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,676
Look at this car. It's blocking us.

240
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,355
- Impermanence ghosts!
- Ferocious ghosts!

241
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:26,595
- Impermanence ghostss!
- Ferocious ghosts!

242
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:27,916
- Impermanence ghosts!
- Ferocious ghosts!

243
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,755
- Impermanence ghosts!
- Ferocious ghosts!

244
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:34,196
- Impermanence ghosts!
- Ferocious ghosts!

245
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,516
Xiaoqi.

246
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:44,235
How should we scare Fang Leng next?

247
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,235
We won't scare him anymore.

248
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:49,875
It's so tiring. I don't
want to do it anymore.

249
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:56,916
How relaxing.

250
00:16:58,595 --> 00:16:59,396
What is it?

251
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:01,635
Let's go and take a look.

252
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:09,796
What's this?

253
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,875
This is my magic weapon.

254
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:13,516
Women

255
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,756
should take care of themselves
as early as possible.

256
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,956
My moxibustion chair

257
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:21,675
not only can enhance
immunity, tone the body

258
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:23,476
but also delay aging.

259
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,276
Xiaoqi, come and try it.

260
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:27,796
Okay.

261
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:29,875
Relax.

262
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:32,516
How does it feel?

263
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,435
Do you feel a kind

264
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,355
of warmth from inside?

265
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,516
Yes.

266
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:46,835
I feel my heart racing.

267
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,476
My temperature seems to be rising, too.

268
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,076
I also have

269
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:55,195
a slight sensation of sweating.

270
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,675
I feel it.

271
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:07,395
What do you want?

272
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,355
I came to deliver food and parcel.

273
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,355
Here comes the lift.

274
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:19,996
Wait for me.

275
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,195
Wait for me.

276
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,835
Wait. I'm sorry.

277
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,115
Excuse me.

278
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:26,236
Excuse me, thank you.

279
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:27,435
It can't fit.

280
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,036
Thank you.

281
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
(Fang Leng, CEO)

282
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,556
Han.

283
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,036
Help me to book

284
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,956
a hot spring resort VIP package for two.

285
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:44,996
Got it.

286
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,556
I'll arrange a car in advance
to pick up Ms. Chai.

287
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:49,756
What are you talking about?

288
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:53,155
I mean

289
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,476
I'll explain to Ms. Chai.

290
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:57,195
You're too busy with work.

291
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,675
So you can't pick her up in person.

292
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,076
Mr. Han.

293
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:01,835
How many years is
your employment contract?

294
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,516
It doesn't matter.

295
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,115
Most importantly,

296
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:07,155
I'm willing to dedicate
my life to the company.

297
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,316
Have you considered
the feelings of the company?

298
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:10,595
The company?

299
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:13,556
Forget it.

300
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:14,996
Hurry and book it.

301
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:16,316
Okay.

302
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:19,675
The feelings of the company?

303
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,155
They must be grateful.

304
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,115
Hello, Mr. Fang.

305
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,756
Do you have a good day today?

306
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:38,915
How did you come in?

307
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,076
I walked in.

308
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,675
Here comes your milk tea.

309
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,835
A moment, please.

310
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,316
Enjoy.

311
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:52,915
Chai Xiaoqi.

312
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,635
Please don't challenge my patience.

313
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,276
Don't be so fierce.

314
00:19:58,435 --> 00:19:59,835
I mainly came here

315
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,875
to share

316
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:05,076
my newly discovered moxibustion chair.

317
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,476
- It's really comfortable.
- You're sick.

318
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,316
Try it and you'll know how nice it is.

319
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:15,316
Let go.

320
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:18,675
Chai Xiaoqi.

321
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:19,595
Let go!

322
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:22,996
We aren't close.

323
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:24,716
We'll be friends

324
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,915
after a few meetings.

325
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:28,756
Relax and exhale.

326
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:29,716
Don't struggle.

327
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,716
Feel its warmth

328
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,155
from inside.

329
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:35,956
It goes through your whole body.

330
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,716
It's very comfortable.

331
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,236
Why are you so strong?

332
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:42,595
It's very comfortable.

333
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,435
Why is there nothing yet?

334
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,076
Don't you feel it?

335
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,115
Be respectful.

336
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,316
Let go!

337
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:16,796
Let go!

338
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:18,756
Get your hands off me!

339
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:19,675
Chai Xiaoqi!

340
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:20,875
Let go!

341
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:21,875
Let go!

342
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:24,476
- Let go!
- Mr. Fang, I have...

343
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,675
Sorry. I've interrupted you.

344
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:27,675
Come back!

345
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:29,595
Chase her out!

346
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,076
You don't need to chase
me out. I can walk.

347
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:48,716
Why aren't you leaving?

348
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,516
Bye.

349
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,195
Did you let her in?

350
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:02,915
I...

351
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,276
Mr. Fang, did you quarrel with her?

352
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:06,675
Nonsense.

353
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,835
- Tomorrow, I'll...
- What do you think?

354
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:18,316
I'm impressed by you two.

355
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:21,316
You flirted with a man
using my moxibustion chair.

356
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:23,675
I have never seen anyone

357
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,236
with your brains.

358
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:28,395
No. I didn't mean to
flirt with him using this.

359
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:29,956
I thought...

360
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:32,155
Racing heart, rising body
temperature and slight sweating?

361
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,115
Silly girl.

362
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:35,036
Mr. Fang

363
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:36,796
wasn't scared

364
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,236
nor heated.

365
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:41,675
From my years of experiences,

366
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,796
I suppose

367
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,595
he's into you.

368
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,076
He's into me.

369
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,675
A sign of one person liking another.

370
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:52,595
A person liking another?

371
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,395
So I need to make him fall for me.

372
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:57,595
Of course.

373
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,115
Mr. Fang is a sought-after bachelor

374
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:02,756
in our town.

375
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:05,556
Xiaoqi, you must seize the chance.

376
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:07,716
If you can marry

377
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:08,915
a young, capable,

378
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,316
handsome, motivated
and domineering president,

379
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,675
that will be great blessing.

380
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:16,756
Boss, I want to place an order!

381
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:17,996
Coming!

382
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:19,355
Xiaoqi, fighting!

383
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:20,236
Fighting!

384
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:22,115
Welcome.

385
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,556
Xiaoqi.

386
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:27,635
Why don't I understand
what she's talking about?

387
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:31,036
You're still young. It's okay.

388
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:33,796
Back then, he loved me so much

389
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,195
that he forced me to marry him.

390
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:37,635
It's very simple to make him

391
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:39,236
fall for me.

392
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,115
It makes sense.

393
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,780
(Entering the payment system)

394
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,940
(Recent expenses, milk tea, watch,
resort, golf)

395
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,070
(Recent expenses)

396
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,195
What have you found?

397
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,435
I hacked into his payment system.

398
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,476
It shows that he booked

399
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,556
a hot spring resort VIP
package for two tomorrow.

400
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:08,915
For two?

401
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:11,395
My goodness.

402
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:14,395
Does he have another woman?

403
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:16,556
No way, we need to hurry up.

404
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,155
Xiaoqi.

405
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,115
You're deceived by
his hormone last time.

406
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:23,276
You must be careful this time.

407
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:25,476
Don't worry. No problem.

408
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,640
(Haicheng Xitianli Hot Spring Resort
in high-tech district)

409
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,316
I've arrived. Where are you?

410
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,276
Okay.

411
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,236
Look for me at the private bath later.

412
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:55,756
Sir, your room card.

413
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:56,435
Thank you.

414
00:24:58,395 --> 00:24:59,835
Hi, I have a booking online.

415
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,595
Please wait.

416
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,635
What is he doing sneakily?

417
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:07,835
Dear, I like the environment.

418
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:08,915
I knew you'd like it.

419
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:10,355
- You're so annoying.
- Come on.

420
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,395
Hello.

421
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:28,355
I'm your smart attendant.

422
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,115
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:30,595
It's the VIP zone ahead.

424
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,076
You two can't enter.

425
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:39,716
I'm interfering with its system.

426
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,276
Get changed. I'll settle it.

427
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:47,796
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:50,395
I won't let you help me for nothing.

429
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,556
Shall I upgrade your system?

430
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,980
(Update successful)

431
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:07,756
(How can I attract him?)

432
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,076
(Should I do this?)

433
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:15,476
Have you arrived?

434
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,076
Get soaked for a while.

435
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:18,036
Take a rest.

436
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,516
(Have I been discovered?)

437
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:21,796
(Is Fang Leng a radar?)

438
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,956
Come and massage my arm.

439
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:29,635
(How annoying. An average
personality with many weaknesses.)

440
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:33,595
(Why do I feel like he's even sexier?)

441
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,435
(Also, it's supple.)

442
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:43,635
(Bouncy and smooth.)

443
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,155
We always took shower together.

444
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,716
You still have the habit
of molesting me.

445
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:08,635
(It sounds as if)

446
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,635
(he's been with this woman for years.)

447
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,996
(He hid it well.)

448
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:13,835
Carry on.

449
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,036
Why are you so weak?

450
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:39,115
(Fang Lie)
I've arrived, Leng.

451
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:40,155
(Fang Lie)
I'll look for you now.

452
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:53,595
I've upgraded your dancing nerve.

453
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:54,355
Isn't it awesome?

454
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:06,195
It's so cool.

455
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:17,236
Don't shout. I look forward
to dancing with you next time.

456
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:17,875
Hey!

457
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,316
You surely can't control

458
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:20,516
a system that's not upgraded by you.

459
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:24,355
You...

460
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,316
Do you still remember me?

461
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,076
We met at the airport.

462
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
(Fang Lie, 22,
Future Group's CEO, Fang Leng's brother)

463
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:37,036
(Has Fang Leng invited him?)

464
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,276
(No way. I want to buy time for Xiaoqi.)

465
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,276
Hi, I'm Xiaobu.

466
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:42,756
Don't you like robots?

467
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:43,875
I'll play with you for a while.

468
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,115
Wait.

469
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,915
Why did you suddenly
disappear last time?

470
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:57,355
Did I?

471
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:58,355
Did you not?

472
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:01,316
Didn't you run away first?

473
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:04,635
Another song. I'll get
another song for you.

474
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:06,076
Did I run away first?

475
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:07,635
Another song.

476
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,155
It's suffocating.

477
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:18,236
I can't hold my breath anymore.

478
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,115
Why is it you?

479
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:21,276
It's been me.

480
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,716
You asked me to go down.

481
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,115
You're so clingy.

482
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:27,756
Although you act like

483
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,076
you hate me very much,

484
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:31,435
you'll fall for me

485
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:32,675
very soon.

486
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:33,756
You'll be madly in love with me.

487
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:34,635
Therefore,

488
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,355
I allow you to like me now.

489
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:41,796
I think you should consult a doctor.

490
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:42,756
You mustn't go.

491
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,796
At least give yourself

492
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,316
a chance to know me.

493
00:29:52,276 --> 00:29:53,076
Go away!

494
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:57,996
Wait.

495
00:29:58,516 --> 00:29:59,115
I...

496
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,036
You...

497
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:03,996
- Let go!
- I didn't mean it.

498
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,915
- Leng, I've been looking...
- Don't fight for it.

499
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
(Chest 112, waist 77)

500
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:12,355
Hi!

501
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:15,915
Broad shoulders and
a narrow waist. Nice physique.

502
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,956
I'm sorry. I apologise.

503
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,756
I'm sorry. Carry on.

504
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:21,996
Fang Lie!

505
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,956
Listen carefully. I will never

506
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:28,595
fall for a woman like you.

507
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,556
Stay out of my sight from now on!

508
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,716
Go away.

509
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,875
Everyone is bound to fall in love.

510
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,195
It's either you stay beautiful

511
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,835
or make money to support the family.

512
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,476
Don't you regret rejecting me

513
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:39,956
when you recall

514
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:42,435
the past after falling in love with me

515
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:44,835
or feel sorry for shouting
at me in the past.

516
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:45,956
Go ahead and regret it.

517
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:48,556
You'll regret it to death.

518
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:52,996
Come back!

519
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:57,635
Towel.

520
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,036
Hello.

521
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:05,756
I failed again.

522
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,516
Fang Leng is so difficult to deal with.

523
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:10,276
Don't worry.

524
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:12,355
We still have chances.

525
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:13,395
At least we know

526
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:14,996
Fang Leng didn't invite another woman.

527
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:15,956
It's just Fang Lie.

528
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:22,395
However,

529
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,195
two men

530
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:27,516
meet up sneakily at a hot spring resort.

531
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:30,036
It seems quite complicated.

532
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,835
You're right.

533
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:49,595
Sit down, Leng.

534
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:54,236
Come on.

535
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:57,036
Leng.

536
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,276
I'm surprised that you're enjoying life.

537
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:00,796
You've found me a sister-in-law again.

538
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:01,516
Here.

539
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:04,435
You keep talking nonsense.

540
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,435
Why did you come back instead of taking

541
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:08,355
your finance course in the U.S.?

542
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,316
It seems like you don't want to go back.

543
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:19,195
I knew I couldn't hide
it from my dear brother.

544
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,395
I want to pursue my painting ambition.

545
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,236
How can I take my mother's arrangement?

546
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:25,796
Besides,

547
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:28,556
I was born with an artist's soul.

548
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:31,316
I should pursue romance and freedom.

549
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,395
So I came here looking for you.

550
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,316
Your mother will hate me if she knows

551
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,996
I'm helping you.

552
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:41,355
Wait.

553
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:42,516
Leng.

554
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,835
Only you can help me now.

555
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:46,276
Don't let me down.

556
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:50,395
Leng.

557
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,516
Got it.

558
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:53,956
I chose an art gallery
for you yesterday.

559
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:56,036
You can work

560
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:56,996
while living there.

561
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,435
It's rather remote and secluded.

562
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:01,236
No one will find you.

563
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,355
Leng, I love you so much.

564
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:05,435
Fang Lie!

565
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:06,915
Behave yourself!

566
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:08,516
Fang Lie, you're my good brother!

567
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:11,875
No wonder he dislikes me.

568
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:14,036
He hid it deeply.

569
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,716
However, I think

570
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,796
they look good together.

571
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,115
They're so close.

572
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:25,915
The mission has become more
difficult. What should we do?

573
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,635
Don't worry. I have a way.

574
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,875
Do you want to do this to Fang Lie?

575
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,476
Theoretically, this will be faster.

576
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:42,556
However, it violates
Universal Peace Act.

577
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,276
I mean I'll hold Fang Lie back

578
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:46,875
while you deal with Fang Leng.

579
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:54,796
Welcome.

580
00:33:59,115 --> 00:33:59,835
Welcome.

581
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:05,635
Leng, I will get a drink.

582
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,076
What a coincidence.

583
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:27,795
Indeed.

584
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,755
I'm going to play with the robot

585
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:32,675
and a video game later.

586
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:33,635
Do you want to join me?

587
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:35,155
I need to dine with my brother.

588
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:36,155
What?

589
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:37,076
Do you like it, too?

590
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:38,155
Let's go.

591
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:39,036
No, I...

592
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:48,195
Thank...

593
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,715
This explains your good shape.

594
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:13,556
You have a habit of exercising.

595
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:15,155
You're awesome.

596
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:17,996
I'll accompany you, okay?

597
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,076
All the best.

598
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,860
(Flower room introduction)

599
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:07,635
Hi.

600
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:10,715
Hi.

601
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,876
You don't even let me talk.

602
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,356
How can I collect hormone?

603
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,720
(KO)

604
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,195
Yes!

605
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:30,876
You're too good.

606
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:31,956
Based on our promise,

607
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,755
the loser has to tell a secret.

608
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:40,956
Actually,

609
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:43,036
I should still be studying abroad.

610
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,275
I came back in secret.

611
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,476
My mother still doesn't know.

612
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:48,715
(He went to Fang Leng
as soon as he came back.)

613
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,715
(They're simply too close.)

614
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:53,396
Come on. Let's play another round.

615
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:55,195
If I lose again,

616
00:36:55,195 --> 00:36:56,755
- I...
- Promise me one more thing.

617
00:36:58,996 --> 00:36:59,795
Deal.

618
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:00,755
- Okay.
- Come on.

619
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:06,275
I'll be right back.

620
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:10,956
How did the hormone collection go?

621
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:14,715
Fang Leng ignored me totally
when Fang Lie wasn't around.

622
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:17,076
I heard that bad guys on Earth

623
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,836
are easily seduced.

624
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:20,195
Why

625
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:22,436
is Fang Leng such
an incompetent bad guy?

626
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,795
It seems I need
to use my ultimate skill.

627
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:06,916
My goodness.

628
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:10,516
Why is he so handsome even
under this kind of light?

629
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:17,315
Bad guy.

630
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:21,275
All bad guys are ugly.
Ugly man. Ugly Fang Leng.

631
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:46,755
You're stalking me again.

632
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,036
You ignored me the whole day.

633
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:51,876
I told you many times.

634
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,356
Stop appearing before me anymore.

635
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:55,635
You disallow me to talk to you

636
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:57,076
or see you.

637
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:58,675
You disrespect me.

638
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,036
Who's disrespecting who?

639
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:00,715
You disrespect me.

640
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,755
I don't want to argue with you.

641
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:02,876
Wait.

642
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,155
- You give me no choice but...
- Out of my way.

643
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:16,916
