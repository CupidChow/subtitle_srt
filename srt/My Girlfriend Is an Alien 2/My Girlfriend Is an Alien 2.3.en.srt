You're so cute.

21
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,089
(Why can't I collect his information?)

22
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:32,569
Did you plan this?

23
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:34,488
What are you up to this time?

24
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:37,289
Listen up.

25
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:38,249
I don't care where you come from

26
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:39,328
or what your purpose is.

27
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,409
My time is precious.

28
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,849
I won't waste it on you.

29
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:54,529
I don't care about your background.

30
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,089
Stop harassing me.

31
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,448
This isn't right.

32
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,249
He should be falling
for me at this point.

33
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,048
It should be working...

34
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,529
I'm warning you one last time.

35
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,529
I have never seen anyone else like you,

36
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:12,928
challenging my limit

37
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,849
again and again.

38
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,529
I don't mind. This is

39
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,809
my ultimate trick.

40
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:26,369
Is it not working anymore?

41
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:30,009
Is it broken?

42
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,849
You're really something.

43
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:48,928
Say it.

44
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:50,648
What do you want?

45
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:54,569
Fang Lie.

46
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,208
Will you date me?

47
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,409
No, this...

48
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,888
There's a big difference

49
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,369
between requests and
unreasonable requests.

50
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,648
Is it so difficult for you?

51
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,768
I know it's not easy.

52
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:16,528
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
hesitated for so long to say it.

53
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,249
Just say yes.

54
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,408
Stop making things difficult for me.

55
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,648
Wait.

56
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:25,009
Who is making things difficult here?

57
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:26,729
Miss,

58
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,129
I know you are a really,

59
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,129
really nice person,

60
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:33,009
but I'm still young.

61
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,208
I want to focus on my career.

62
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,648
I have no time to fall in love.

63
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,249
Why don't you ask for something else?

64
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:41,328
Forget it.

65
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,369
I knew you wouldn't agree to it.

66
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,609
(It's fine to refuse me,)

67
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,689
(but you hit me on the head before this)

68
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,809
(and broke my system.)

69
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,689
(I have to make you pay.)

70
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,288
Don't hit my face!

71
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,049
Don't misunderstand me.

72
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,689
I just want to hit your head.

73
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,288
I turned you down,

74
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,729
but don't be so violent.

75
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,129
I won't hit you too hard.

76
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,049
I just want to give
you a concussion

77
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,129
by hitting your central nerve.

78
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:16,968
Look,

79
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:17,809
actually,

80
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,208
I was a little impulsive

81
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,249
to have rejected you just now.

82
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,729
We've only met twice so far.

83
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:27,848
We don't know each other at all.

84
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,408
Nor do we know each other's profession.

85
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,528
It's just perfect for dating.

86
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:32,848
What do you think?

87
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,809
I always think that in life,

88
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,569
there are four things
that matter the most.

89
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,929
Eat.

90
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:50,929
Sleep.

91
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:51,729
Ambition.

92
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:52,569
Fall in love.

93
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:54,648
However, I never imagined that

94
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,528
I'd actually accomplish
one of those today.

95
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:00,408
What's the matter?

96
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:01,968
Did you have a meal today?

97
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:02,929
Fang Leng,

98
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,328
you underestimated me.

99
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,088
Today a girl insists on dating me.

100
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,569
She still wouldn't give up
after being rejected by me.

101
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,528
In the end, I saw
that she was so pitiful.

102
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,968
So I reluctantly agreed to her.

103
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,169
Are you brainless?

104
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,328
You don't have a career nor the ability

105
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:21,328
to take care of her.

106
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,328
Besides, you're just average-looking.

107
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,448
Really?

108
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,249
That's the first time someone
has said that to me.

109
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,288
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

110
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:36,609
You can stay here for a few days.

111
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,888
I'll let you know when
the gallery is done.

112
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:39,569
Okay.

113
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,009
Why don't you go back to your room?

114
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,288
We've been sleeping
together since we were kids.

115
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:47,689
It doesn't matter.

116
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,208
You're right.

117
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,169
It's been so long.

118
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:52,448
Good night, Fang Leng.

119
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:57,208
Get out!

120
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:57,809
Fang Leng!

121
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,929
Fang Leng! Don't kick me!

122
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,088
Your foot.

123
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:06,968
Remember to wake me up tomorrow morning.

124
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:09,648
Okay.

125
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,260
(Can't open.)

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,700
(Please charge the battery.)

127
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:16,848
The battery is flat.

128
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:31,088
Is the radiation of your superpower

129
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,088
so great to the earth's environment?

130
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,689
You must be joking.

131
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,208
My Light Wave of Love

132
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,169
is an emotional element superpower.

133
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,369
It can make the person
fall in love instantly.

134
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:41,408
However, it doesn't seem
to work on Fang Leng.

135
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:54,929
How strange.

136
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,848
There's nothing wrong with
the superpower system.

137
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,609
Why didn't it work on Fang Leng?

138
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,569
Was it because I was married to him?

139
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,848
So he's immune to my superpowers?

140
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:07,489
By the way,

141
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,288
(My boyfriend on earth)
Fang Lie agreed to go out with me.

142
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,448
So his name can officially

143
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,448
be removed from the list of love rivals.

144
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,648
That's fast.

145
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:18,809
Fang Lie likes the kind
of girls who like gaming

146
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,408
and can operate robots well.

147
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,489
I fit all the criteria.

148
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:24,569
Got it.

149
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:26,689
I see.

150
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,968
As long as I figure out
Fang Leng's character

151
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,288
and become the type of woman he likes,

152
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,689
I can win his heart.

153
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,408
Then we can go home.

154
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,048
Don't you think that

155
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,288
as soon as I came to Earth,

156
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,168
I became very smart?

157
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,009
I feel like I've gotten smarter.

158
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,888
However, I think

159
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,168
I seemed to be more powerful

160
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,129
when I was a tortoise.

161
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,288
Why?

162
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,209
Good things come in small packages.

163
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,048
You're so smart.

164
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,369
I'm so sleepy.

165
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:15,048
This Rainy Rainbow fragrance

166
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,489
is our team's fruits of
labour after half a year

167
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,489
when we combine fresh and sweet styles

168
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,528
(Dating with fragrance of nature New product launch)
in a bottle.

169
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,129
Its top notes are

170
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,288
orange, jasmine, and bluebells.

171
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:26,528
The middle notes

172
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,249
are Brazilian rosewood,
rosehips and chamomile.

173
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:30,928
Its base notes are

174
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,648
lilac and amber.

175
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,729
It perfectly captures
the freshness of rainwater

176
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,168
and dreaminess of a rainbow.

177
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,648
It finally elevates into
the fragrance of nature.

178
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,129
You can try it.

179
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,129
It smells really nice.

180
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,329
The middle notes are indeed special.

181
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:47,609
I like the scent.

182
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,888
It's not bad. I like it.

183
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,648
Mr. Fang, what do you think?

184
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:58,048
It's great.

185
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,808
This totally exceeded my expectations.

be our main product

189

for the upcoming press conference.

190

No problem.

192

198
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:23,568
Okay, put it over there.

199
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:24,528
Hi, Mr. Zhou.

200
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,489
You must be
the perfumer for this project.

201
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:42,329
Mr. Zhou, I've long heard about you.

202
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,449
I heard that the decision-making
meeting went well just now.

203
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,768
I have a business proposal for you.

204
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,609
I wonder if you are interested.

205
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,129
(Domineering President Falls In Love With Me)
No wonder Fang Leng doesn't like me.

206
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,609
This domineering president

207
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:08,048
acts and speaks in his own way.

208
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,568
There're so many rules.

209
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,740
(Searching for domineering president)

210
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,688
Recently,

211
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,449
I scanned all the novels,
TV series and mobile games

212
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,129
related to the genre
of domineering bosses.

213
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,528
I've summarised the three
characteristics of such bosses.

214
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:21,168
Firstly,

215
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,849
the name of the boss is
often related to his character.

216
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,568
For example, Shen Lifeng.

217
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,489
"Li", as in being fierce.

218
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:28,969
It means that he's a boss
with violent tendencies.

219
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:29,928
Gu Shenzhi.

220
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,048
"Shen", as in being cautious.

221
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,888
It shows that he is
a capable businessman

222
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,849
with a very strict character.

223
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,209
Lu Qian.

224
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,329
"Qian", as in humble.

225
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,288
So, he is a gentle and elegant boss.

226
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:46,528
Ice-cold.

227
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:48,648
It's still cold, no matter
how you see it.

228
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:51,609
I know.

229
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,249
Starting today,

230
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:57,928
I'll write a task diary

231
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,408
to record what I do every day.

232
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,489
That way, I can check
for mistakes later.

233
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:03,849
What about the second point?

234
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:05,969
The second point is

235
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,048
every demanding boss

236
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,568
had an unpleasant childhood

237
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:11,288
and an unspeakable disease.

238
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,528
A hidden disease?

239
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:13,609
A hidden disease.

240
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:16,648
Cold and distant.

241
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:17,849
Fierce.

242
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,249
Mean.

243
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:21,849
However, he

244
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,209
has an amazing figure.

245
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,449
Xiaoqi,

246
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,449
is being in good shape a hidden disease?

247
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:34,009
You have to learn to see past
the appearance for the essence.

248
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,609
Why is he in such a good shape?

249
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,489
It means that he is exercising every day

250
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,449
and he needs dopamine.

251
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,969
Dopamine is a happiness hormone.

252
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,849
Why does he need to be happy?

253
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,568
It means he is always unhappy.

254
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:47,688
He's stressed out.

255
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:50,329
So he needs sports to
bring him happiness.

256
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,089
He needs exercise to be happy

257
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,288
and that's what keeps him fit.

258
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:57,129
It's a cycle.

259
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,089
Well-said.

260
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,408
So, behind his good figure,

261
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,369
it just shows that he is twisted

262
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,729
and really negative.

263
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,528
What's the third point?

264
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:08,969
Behind every demanding boss,

265
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,168
there is a hardworking butler

266
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,369
or rather,

267
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:15,089
a dedicated doctor friend.

268
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,568
The friend would usually

269
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,129
say to the boss,

270
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,528
"You know what?

271
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,129
I haven't seen you smiling
like this in a long time."

272
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,048
You know,

273
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,528
you're in the worst health state

274
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:26,489
I've seen you in a while.

275
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,808
Are you sure

276
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:29,969
it was hallucination?

277
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,568
What other explanation is there

278
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:33,648
except hallucinations?

279
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:36,408
The flowers in the conservatory
came from all over the world.

280
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:38,528
Most were transported
to the conservatory

281
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,888
using freezing technology.

282
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,288
When there is a uniform
and suitable temperature,

283
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,449
all the flowers will
bloom at the same time.

284
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,369
However, since you
think it's an illusion,

285
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:48,849
it seems this Chai Xiaoqi

286
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,528
really has an effect on you.

287
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:52,969
I was talking about
having hallucinations.

288
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,288
I never mentioned Chai Xiaoqi.

289
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:57,849
That's because you didn't see

290
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,849

The insight for today.

293
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,688
(The insight for today.)

294
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:07,009
When the boss is lovesick

295
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,489
and too busy to work,

296
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,089
we must be considerate of the boss

297
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,808
and finish the work on time well,

298
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,928
so as not to trouble the boss.

299
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:16,449
In brackets.

300
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,808
Does anyone know Ms. Chai Xiaoqi?

301
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,648
She caused my boss to suffer.

302
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,369
She's really something.

303
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,768
End of brackets

304
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:25,408
I have to give this a thumbs-up.

305
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:26,648
More updates, please.

306
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:27,568
She's just a fan.

307
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,009
Nothing to fuss about.

308
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:31,329
Prescribe tranquiliser for me.

309
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,609
We have new products coming up.

310
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:34,928
I have to concentrate.

311
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,129
Over-reliance on drugs

312
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,249
isn't advisable for the recovery
of your current mental state.

313
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,129
What you need now is a long-term
comprehensive treatment

314
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:47,408
to find out the real cause

315
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,129
of your hallucination.

316
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,048
Although it hasn't rained recently,

317
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,249
we can't rule out

318
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,048
the possibility of deterioration of your

- rainy weather heterosexual amnesia.

the perfume's production line.)

321
00:14:58,489 --> 00:14:59,808
We'll talk about that later.

322
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,168
I'm leaving.

323
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:02,928
Prescribe the medicine.

324
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,489
He's a workaholic.

325
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:14,528
The milk tea shop has
been so busy lately.

326
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,209
It's worsened the lines on my neck.

327
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,688
The female lead of this story

328
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,408
is kind to everyone

329
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,009
except the male lead.

330
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,568
This kind of heroine in an idol drama

331
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:26,768
is the most annoying.

332
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,168
The audience doesn't dislike me.

333
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,849
However, Fang Leng thinks I'm annoying.

334
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:33,168
It's because you didn't do
a good job on the surface.

335
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,168
It's all about your appearance.

336
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,928
Men are visual creatures.

337
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:40,928
Do you think people date

338
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,489
for inner beauty?

339
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:46,609
That's something new.

340
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:47,369
Fang Leng

341
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:49,729
may look like a gentleman
on the surface,

342
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,648
However, deep down inside,

343
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,729
there must be some
hidden male creature's

344
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,688
common aesthetic preferences.

345
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,609
You might think these female leads

346
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,729
are very pretentious.

347
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:01,729
However, why are the male leads

348
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,969
hopelessly in love with them?

349
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,849
It's because they are beautiful.

350
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:06,288
That's right.

351
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,249
Men are shallow.

352
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,808
That's not what I'm saying.

353
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,849
Everyone has a superficial side to them.

354
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,009
Falling in love is two shallow people

355
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,089
seducing each other

356
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,369
to see who is the more superficial one.

357
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:20,969
Xiaoqi,

358
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,168
don't blame me for saying this.

359
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,329
Your everyday outfits are so plain.

360
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,288
How about this?

361
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:29,528
Tomorrow, you will dress up
to meet Mr. Fang

362
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:32,408
and deliver Future Group's
takeout while you're at it.

363
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,489
Oh no, this is bad.

364
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,729
How long have I been
wearing this neck mask?

365
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,369
Has it been past the time?

366
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,209
It's indeed too plain.

367
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,969
Help me to search

368
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:46,648
for idol drama's heroine.

369
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,369
What does one usually wear?

370
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:18,649
Come in.

371
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:22,848
Mr. Fang,

372
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:24,768
here's your coffee.

373
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:25,808
Thanks.

374
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,209
Mr. Fang,

375
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,608
the factory has confirmed.

376
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:29,768
As long as our perfumer

377
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,009
can provide samples and
the formula on time,

378
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,608
they can get all the products ready

379
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:34,929
before the press conference.

380
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,568
Tell them to follow up.

381
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,848
After all, this is the main product.

382
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:40,288
Please do it right.

383
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:40,929
Got it.

384
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,249
Mr. Fang,

385
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,689
do you want to go back
and take a rest first?

386
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,568
Dr. Zhang called again to remind you

387
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,328
to get enough sleep.

388
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:50,969
You have worked hard recently.

389
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:52,848
You should go back soon.

390
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,808
It's my job.

391
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,088
Mr. Fang,

392
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:58,409
when you're done, you
should head back early.

393
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:01,568
By the way,

394
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,568
I saw your WeChat Moments.

395
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,889
(Didn't I block Mr. Fang?)

396
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,929
They're just my thoughts.

397
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,128
It's mainly to record
my work experiences.

398
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,048
Of course,

399
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,249
it's because you're a good mentor.

400
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:20,568
Delete all of them.

401
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:22,328
Don't post again.

402
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,649
Hello. How did it go?

403
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:41,249
Sister,

404
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:42,489
don't worry.

405
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:44,729
I've arranged

406
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,848
with the perfumer.

407
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,288
In a few days,

408
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:52,768
Fang Leng will be in big trouble.

409
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:57,608
Let's see if he can still smile.

410
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:01,009
Okay, good night.

411
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:02,209
Good night.

412
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:24,568
Isn't she too sexy?

413
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,689
Why is she dressed that way?

414
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:28,288
Hi.

415
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,368
What is she playing?

416
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,528
It's possible, but in the company?

417
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:36,088
Dressing up really works.

418
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:36,929
I dare not dress that way.

419
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,608
Yeah, she turns heads
everywhere she goes.

420
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,449
I know.

421
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:49,528
We ordered several flavours.

422
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,009
You don't have any tag on these.

423
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:51,929
How can you tell them apart?

424
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:53,249
How is that possible? I...

425
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:55,969
Hold on.

426
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:57,848
Hello.

427
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:58,808
Xiaoqi,

428
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,608
I was too busy this morning.

429
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,249
I forgot to label the flavours

430
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,929
for the boxes of cakes
Future Group ordered.

431
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:05,768
That's okay, I understand.

432
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:06,969
Well...

433
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,729
Your service is poor.

434
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,489
I'm giving you a bad rating.

435
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:10,449
- You're too much.
- No.

436
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:11,689
Don't leave a bad rating.

437
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,328
I can tell the flavours of
these cakes by smelling them.

438
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,128
Wait.

439
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,368
This one is vanilla.

440
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:18,969
This one is ice cream.

441
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:22,489
This is macaron ice cream.

442
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,169
- This one is...
- Mr. Fang.

443
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:28,048
These sponge fingers are a gift.

444
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,608
You can tell from the smell?

445
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:30,649
You're not just
saying it for fun, right?

446
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,449
You'll know if you open it.

447
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,128
I have a really good sense of smell.

448
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,368
There's no way it'll go wrong.

449
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,288
Remember to give a five-star review.

450
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,128
You can even tell that?

451
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,409
Mr. Fang, I think she's looking for you.

452
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,288
You're a little weird today.

453
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,969
What do you mean?

454
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:01,608
You're pretty cute.

455
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,409
You are exceptional today, too.

456
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:06,209
You're exceptionally crazy.

457
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:08,568
What are you saying?

458
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,288
Sorry, Ms. Chai.

459
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,128
Mr. Fang has work to do.

460
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:13,288
Please excuse us.

461
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,288
You know what?

462
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,568
this is just Plan A.

463
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,808
There're also Plans B,
C, D, E and so forth.

464
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:29,848
He's turning a blind
eye to a sexy woman.

465
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:55,889
Ms. Chai.

466
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:01,608
Ms. Chai.

467
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:04,409
One mocha, please.

468
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:05,128
Sure.

469
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,449
Lele, one mocha.

470
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:08,409
Okay, just a second.

471
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,088
Xiaoqi,

472
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:13,689
why aren't you doing delivery today?

473
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,128
I think Fang Leng

474
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:17,489
has vision problems.

475
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:20,689
He ignores me every time.

476
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,249
According to Sister Chai,

477
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,768
feelings of love

478
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:26,608
need to be maintained by
being persistently thick-skinned.

479
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,689
You're not thick-skinned enough.

480
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,288
I totally agree with her.

481
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,889
I'll try one last time.

482
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,889
I'll become a tortoise
if I don't succeed.

483
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:42,489
Good luck.

484
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:43,449
Go!

485
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:45,768
Go!

486
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:47,409
Mocha is ready.

487
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,048
Okay.

488
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:51,649
Here's your mocha.

489
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:52,288
Thank you.

490
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,209
Please come again.

491
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:55,808
Everything is ready.

492
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,729
Let's get started then.

493
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,929
Ouch, it's hot.

494
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,180
Come in.

495
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:09,088
Mr. Fang,

496
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,169
the perfumer suddenly
terminated the contract with us.

497
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:11,969
What?

498
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,009
It happened just now.

499
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,368
They took the formula and
all the samples with them

500
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,568
and paid the full liquidated damages.

501
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,449
They terminated
the contract without notice

502
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,649
and even prepared
the liquidated damages in advance.

503
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:23,489
They must have planned this.

504
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:26,889
Hire a new perfumer

505
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:28,209
to reinvent the formula.

506
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,489
Next, contact the factory

507
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:30,409
to resume the production.

508
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,249
Mr. Fang,

509
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,169
without the formula and samples,

510
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,449
the factory can't finish on time
even if they work overtime.

511
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,649
Besides, the press
conference is tomorrow.

512
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,689
We can't replicate the
formula of the fragrance

513
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,608
in a short amount of time.

514
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,328
Now,

515
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,328
only God can help us.

516
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,620
♪West Lake's view on March♪

517
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,620
♪Spring rain is like wine willow
and smoke♪

518
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,460
♪We'll meet each other if we're fated
no matter how far apart we are♪

519
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,220
♪We would've never met otherwise♪

520
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,780
♪We can become friends

521
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,380
♪We can become husband and wife
if we're close for 100 years♪

522
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,568
My sense of smell is superb.

523
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:21,729
It won't go wrong

524
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,328
You said you had a keen
sense of smell, didn't you?

525
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,489
This fragrance is a bit challenging

526
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:37,009
and the timeframe is very tight.

527
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,048
I won't force you

528
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:40,048
if you can't get it right.

529
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:54,209
There is Peru balsam, tulu balsam,

530
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:55,528
Benzoin resin

531
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,048
and Labdanum extract.

532
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,568
Iris Extract, Vanilla Bean,

533
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,649
and grape fermented alcohol.

534
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:04,608
There's also bergamot,

535
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,568
tangerine,

536
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:07,128
lavender lily essence,

537
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,209
and rosemary glycerin.

538
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:09,608
Done.

539
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:12,209
So fast?

540
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,128
Are you sure you're correct?

541
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:14,889
Of course.

542
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,848
If you could add
some iris

543
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,009
and musk to its base,

544
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,128
the fragrance will last longer.

545
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,929
Even though the prototype smells good,

546
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:24,489
it doesn't last.

547
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:36,328
It's the same.

548
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:49,368
Thank you.

549
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,528
Are you thanking me?

550
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:57,729
I'm taking it with me.

551
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:02,528
He said, "Thank you".

552
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,368
My goodness.

553
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,649
So, he likes me in this outfit.

554
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,288
Here's my personal opinion.

555
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:19,889
more than just a cost-effective product,

556
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:21,969
a good perfume

557
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,368
must also have its own personality.

558
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:25,608
For example,

559
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:26,489
our Rainy Rainbow.

560
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:31,568
As the name suggests, it's
rainbow after the rain.

561
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,288
In fact, this fragrance is

562
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,528
tailored to independent women.

563
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,729
It has a light top note,

564
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:39,649
a sweet middle note,

565
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,449
and an elegant base note.

566
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,528
It can enhance your temperament

567
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:45,528
However, it won't be overwhelming.

568
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,368
So I hope this fragrance

569
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,009
will make them more attractive.

570
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:51,768
I hope they will like it.

571
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,048
Thank you.

572
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,368
Next is a question and answer session.

573
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:01,169
If you have any question
about the perfume,

574
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,328
feel free to ask us Mr. Fang.

575
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:05,048
Okay.

576
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:07,608
Hi.

577
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:09,729
Mr. Fang,

578
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,848
how long did it take

579
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:13,048
for the perfumer to come
up with this fragrance?

580
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,249
Actually, I think

581
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:17,249
if it's a good perfume,

582
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:19,288
it takes time to get used

583
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,568
to achieve the final result.

584
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:23,808
However, our experiences this time

585
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,128
really inspired me.

586
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,689
Sometimes, talent and inspiration

587
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,048
really can bring you

588
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:30,209
a completely different surprise.

589
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,608
I noticed that for other products,

590
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,848
you've distributed samples
of test packs to the guests,

591
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,689
except this perfume.

592
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,808
Is it because you feel guilty?

593
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,409
Are you trying to gloss over it?

594
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:42,889
Yes.

595
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:45,128
Why is that reporter
saying those things?

596
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:50,608
What's going on?

597
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,608
It's not bad. I like it.

598
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:12,929
Yes, it's really nice.

599
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,088
I think this fragrance is pretty good.

600
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:16,729
It's truly a flagship product.

601
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,608
How can such a good product...

602
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,088
possibly be a sham?

603
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,128
Yes, there's no way it's a sham.

604
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,689
Yes, I think so, too.

605
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:25,409
In fact, ever since I
developed a makeup line,

606
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,489
I think the most important quality

607
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:28,489
is sincerity.

608
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,209
This way, you can gain the trust

609
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,409
and support

610
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:34,409
from the consumers.

611
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,409
However, sometimes, we still come across

612
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,249
short-sighted people.

613
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,568
They'll use some dirty tricks

614
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,649
to break the balance.

615
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:45,409
However, don't worry,

616
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:48,449
I'm definitely not playing
along to these people.

617
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:50,649
I will keep my promise,

618
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,088
be true to myself

619
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,489
and make the right choice.

620
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:54,649
Thank you.

621
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:10,969
Mother,

622
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:12,209
why did you suddenly remember

623
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,368
to send me a red packet?

624
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,209
Listen,

625
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,689
just study hard in the U.S.
with peace of mind.

626
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:20,528
I've arranged everything for you.

627
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:21,489
When you come back,

628
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,288
you'll take over Fang Leng's position.

629
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:24,368
Mother,

630
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,009
what did my brother do to you?

631
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,768
Why do you dislike him so much?

632
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:29,889
What are you saying?

633
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:30,808
So you think he's your brother.

634
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:32,209
Am I not your mother?

635
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,368
I'm doing this for your own good.

636
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,528
Also, stop contacting him

637
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:40,328
so that you won't be influenced by him.

638
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:43,568
Son,

639
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:46,528
why is there a Chinese
old man next to you?

640
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:49,729
No, mother.

641
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:52,249
What's the matter with you?

642
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,209
Not only you look down on Fang Leng,

643
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,009
you even look down on Chinese old men.

644
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,328
Must they sweep in China?

645
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,568
Why can't they start a business abroad?

646
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:59,449
All right, mother, I have a class later.

647
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:00,929
I'll talk to you next time. Bye.

648
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,580
(Brother)

649
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,808
Hello. How did it go?

650
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:15,249
Sister, we have a problem.

651
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:16,249
What?

652
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:18,528
Wasn't the perfume destroyed?

653
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,568
God knows how they made it.

654
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:23,729
Fang Leng

655
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,929
is lucky this time.

656
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:32,249
Come in.

657
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:33,608
Mr. Fang,

658
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,848
the new fragrance orders
broke our record again.

659
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,249
Xiaoqi really did us
a huge favour this time.

660
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:41,848
Are you close to her?

661
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:46,848
Send a gift to the milk tea shop.

662
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,048
Okay.

663
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:54,088
Won't you be more sincere

664
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,889
if you prepare it yourself?

665
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,768
It seems you're becoming more talkative.

666
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:06,249
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.

667
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:07,889
Please enjoy.

668
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:08,568
Thank you.

669
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:10,689
Can I speak to Chai Xiaoqi?

670
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:11,768
That's me.

671
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:12,768
You have a parcel. Please collect it.

672
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:13,449
Thanks.

673
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:15,889
It's a gift from Fang Leng.

674
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:16,729
What?

675
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:17,929
Let's see.

676
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:18,808
What did he give you?

677
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:22,489
Be careful.

678
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,889
This is the limited edition bag,

679
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,608
which is the hottest item this year.

680
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:32,288
Is it expensive?

681
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,169
The price is not an issue.

682
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,568
More importantly

683
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,689
if you don't spend
a certain amount of money,

684
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,209
they wouldn't even show you this bag.

685
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,848
It seems Mr. Fang

686
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,608
is used to giving others bags.

687
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:47,249
Do you mean

688
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,808
Fang Leng also gives other girls bags?

689
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:52,368
It's handmade in Italy.

690
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,449
100% pure sheepskin.

691
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,489
A luxury bag.

692
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:59,009
Sheepskin bag.

693
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:00,128
Sheep.

694
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,009
Xiaoqi,

695
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,128
Mr. Fang is hinting that

696
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:06,848
he wants to be your sugar daddy.

697
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:07,929
Sugar daddy?

698
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:08,768
No way.

699
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:10,169
I'm just here to complete my mission.

700
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,328
I don't like him.

701
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,088
Silly girl.

702
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:15,009
Mr. Fang has shown his sincerity

703
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,689
by giving you such
an expensive luxury bag.

704
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,409
How can you turn it down?

705
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:20,449
Come to think of it,

706
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:23,409
I think this bag suits me more.

707
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:26,889
I agree with her.

708
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:29,209
He gave me such an expensive bag.

709
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:30,489
I have to thank him.

710
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,088
I'll help you to locate him.

711
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,009
Ms. Chen,

712
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:46,528
I'm very thankful for
your investment this time

713
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:47,969
and ongoing support for our company.

714
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,409
I have a small gift for you.

715
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:52,328
Here.

716
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,209
Please accept it.

717
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,889
What is this?

718
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,088
This is a new fragrance
developed by the company.

719
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:00,088
Please try it.

720
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:07,128
It's not bad.

721
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,608
One can tell the intention and
innovation of the perfumer,

722
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:13,969
but in terms of concept,
compared to other fragrances,

723
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:15,568
it's similar.

724
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:18,489
If you want to dominate
the perfume market,

725
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:20,889
you need to start with the initial ideas

726
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:22,169
and target of the product.

727
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:23,689
I see.

728
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:24,969
However, you've accomplished so much

729
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,489
at such a young age.

730
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,489
You're much better than
your father when he's younger.

731
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,608
If there is a chance to
cooperate in the future,

732
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,288
I'll surely help you.

733
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,128
I'm sure there will be.

734
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,288
Here. Cheers.

735
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:35,929
Cheers.

736
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:39,128
Mr. Fang.

737
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:50,249
If I accept his gift,

738
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,288
will he think that

739
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:52,608
I agree to be his mistress?

740
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,249
No, I have to return
the bag to him tomorrow.

741
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,009
Wait.

742
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,128
If I do,

743
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:03,288
I won't finish my mission.

744
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:04,689
No, that won't do.

745
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,249
Mr. Fang, you drank too much.

746
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:08,568
- I'd better agree to it.
- Be careful.

747
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,369
Why did you push yourself so hard?

748
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,248
I can still drink.

749
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:12,889
Ms. Chai.

750
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,128
Why are you out so soon.

751
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,528
Ms. Chai.

752
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:19,329
Come on, hurry.

753
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:20,449
Lend us a hand, hurry up.

754
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:21,809
Hurry.

755
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,489
How?

756
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,688
Ms. Chai, Mr. Fang is drunk.

757
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,289
Aren't you neighbours?

758
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:28,409
You can go home together.

759
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,409
- Mr. Han!
- Ms. Chai.

760
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:30,728
- Seize the opportunity.
- Come here!

761
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:31,809
You... Mr. Han!

762
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,048
Are you okay?

763
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,489
I'm fine!

764
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,969
I'm Mr. Fang.

765
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,449
How could I be drunk?

766
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,128
Mr. Han, listen...

767
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:50,568
Who are you?

768
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,489
Why are you wearing a skirt, Mr. Han?

769
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:56,369
Why are you wearing a lipstick?

770
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,528
However, you look cute.

771
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:02,088
Come back.

772
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:16,568
This way.

773
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:24,208
Mr. Han is unbelievable.

774
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:26,769
This way.

775
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,809
I'm so smart.

776
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:30,809
Mr. Fang,

777
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,849
thank me tomorrow.

778
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,809
I've put it on the table for
you. You can take a look.

779
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,248
Don't make trouble.
There're cars around us.

780
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:38,688
Watch where you go.

781
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,208
It must be in there, buddy.

782
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,489
A blue house.

783
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:45,248
A house.

784
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:46,528
I'm going to play inside!

785
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,769
Taxi! Hello, sir.

786
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,208
Take us to Sunny Apartment.

787
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:51,929
He's drunk.

788
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:52,608
Forget it.

789
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,409
- Get someone else.
- I won't vomit.

790
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:54,809
What if he throws up in my car?

791
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,248
- He won't.
-No, forget it.

792
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,329
Sir, do I look like I will vomit?

793
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,809
You're not a child anymore.

794
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:02,648
It hurts.

795
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,929
Don't drink if you have
low alcohol tolerance.

796
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,168
Why did you drink so much?

797
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,449
So what if I'm a child?

798
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,369
- I'm...
- Freeze.

799
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:08,688
Don't speak.

800
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,048
Stay there.

801
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:10,849
Don't go anywhere.

802
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,009
I'll see if there's another taxi.

803
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:15,208
Why are we waiting for a taxi?

804
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,809
I drove here.

805
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,688
That's my car!

806
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:29,929
My car! That's my car!

807
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:31,648
My car!

808
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:37,528
Sister!

809
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:39,849
Get into the car.

810
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,248
Get into the car, sister!

811
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:46,168
Get into the car.

812
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:46,969
What?

813
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:48,128
Come on, get into the car.

814
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,369
- Get off!
- Come on!

815
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,409
Why should I?

816
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,369
- Hurry!
- I want to buy it.

817
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:52,088
What do you want to buy?

818
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,048
I want to buy this.

819
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:53,809
Get off from there!

820
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:54,769
- It's so cool.
- Get off from there!

821
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,289
This is my car!

822
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:58,849
Start the car!

823
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:00,248
Why would you be like this

824
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,648
when you get drunk?

825
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,809
Why would I meet you

826
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:13,289
of all the earthlings?

827
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,128
Home planet, help me.

828
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:21,088
Look at how beautiful the star is.

829
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,489
I really want to fly
up to see the stars.

830
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,329
You want to fly up to see the stars?

831
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,289
You're something. I admire you.

832
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,849
I really want to see the stars

833
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,248
up close.

834
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:37,449
See the stars?

835
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:40,809
Sure.

836
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,409
At least flying is faster than walking.

837
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:44,369
Okay.

838
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:49,289
Why did we stop suddenly?

839
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,849
You want to fly up to
the sky to see the stars?

840
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,728
I'll grant your wish.

841
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,809
Really?

842
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:09,009
We're really flying!

843
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:14,648
Sister!

844
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:15,528
look at the moon.

845
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,048
How beautiful.

846
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:18,769
It's so close to us.

847
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:21,929
Do you think there
are aliens on the moon?

848
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:22,849
Of course there are.

849
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,929
Every planet

850
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,449
is occupied by one-of-a-kind aliens.

851
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,128
They are creating

852
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:30,289
their own brilliant civilisation.

853
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:32,568
That's what makes our universe

854
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:34,489
mysterious and great.

855
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,088
If there are aliens,

856
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,048
I will definitely go there to

857
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,769
expand Future Group's beauty market.

858
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:42,929
You?

859
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,489
On behalf of Cape Town Planet,

860
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,648
you're not welcomed in our planet.

861
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:48,568
Cape Town?

862
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:51,088
So,

863
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:54,128
that's your real identity.

864
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,289
In fact, my real identity is

865
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:01,409
a Cape Towner.

866
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:02,969
Are you scared?

867
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,369
Then I'll be honest with you.

868
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:09,289
Actually,

869
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:18,929
I'm Superman of our planet.

870
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:20,489
Superman.

871
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:22,969
If you're so great,

872
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:24,608
you could fly on your own.

873
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:25,568
Go ahead!

874
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:32,289
I broke my wings

875
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:36,009
when I was a child.

876
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:38,688
If you don't believe me, look.

877
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:41,208
I'm sure I can't fly
if I jump from here.

878
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,128
Fine.

879
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,409
Okay.

880
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:46,849
You don't need to fly.

881
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,568
I will be your wings.

882
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,248
Look.

883
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,528
If you are my wings,

884
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:02,568
I will definitely protect you.

885
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:05,809
Okay.

886
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:07,528
I mean it.

887
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,168
I definitely will.

888
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,369
Okay.

889
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,769
Okay, sit down.

890
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:23,809
I can't fly like this.

891
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:27,048
Sit down, come on.

892
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:32,728
Wings.

893
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:34,449
Wings.

894
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:37,248
Wings.

895
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,248
My wings.

896
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:47,009
Wings.

897
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:54,849
I have wings now.

898
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:56,369
- I have wings.
- You have wings.

899
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:57,409
- Fly.
- Okay.

900
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,528
Goodness.

901
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,128
All right, sleep here.

902
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:25,969
Don't go.

903
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:28,289
What if I'm kidnapped by a bad guy?

904
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,248
- There're so many bad people.
- There's none here.

905
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:31,248
Don't think you can do what you like

906
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:33,289
just because you're drunk.

907
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:34,409
Let go of me!

908
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,608
- I...
- I'm scared.

909
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:45,528
If you don't stop,

910
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,009
I'm going to hit you.

911
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:51,088
How could you? I'm so handsome.

912
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:54,009
You're indeed quite handsome.

913
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,289
Then, Snow White met

914
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,208
seven good dwarfs.

915
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,329
Then, they...

916
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,489
What happened?

917
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,369
Then,

918
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:11,088
the dwarf insists on
listening to stories,

919
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:12,568
just like you.

920
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,849
He lied on the bed

921
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,849
and not before long,

922
00:42:17,528 --> 00:42:18,769
he fell asleep.

923
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:19,688
What?

924
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:22,489
How could he fall asleep
before the story was finished?

925
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,929
- I want to hear it.
- Let go of me!

926
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:27,688
Let go.

927
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:31,688
Then I'll tell you a story

928
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,688
about the alien girl, Xiaoqi.

929
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,889
She is a kind, lovely,
beautiful, generous

930
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,449
and lively young lady.

931
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:40,849
Her name is Xiaoqi.

932
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:43,489
She is an alien girl,

933
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:45,929
just like me.

934
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:47,688
She must be ordinary-looking.

935
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:50,048
No.

936
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:51,449
She's beautiful.

937
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:53,929
And?

938
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:56,409
She came to Earth

939
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,528
from her home planet.

940
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:00,409
She lost her signaler.

941
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:03,009
So, she has no choice but to stay
here on Earth in the meantime.

942
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:04,688
Then, she met a...

943
00:43:04,688 --> 00:43:05,409
A prince.

944
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:06,889
An ugly bad guy

945
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:08,449
called Fang.

946
00:43:08,688 --> 00:43:10,248
When Fang saw Xiaoqi,

947
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,289
he was amazed by her beauty

948
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,889
and he fell in love
with her at first sight.

949
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,769
He was madly in love with her

950
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,969
and would do anything to get her.

951
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:20,849
So, we...

952
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,289
Poor little Xiaoqi

953
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:30,889
had no choice but to give in

954
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:32,329
under his pressure.

955
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:33,648
This guy is so nasty.

956
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:34,608
Exactly.

957
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:35,929
He looks so ugly

958
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:37,009
and he also bullied Xiaoqi.

959
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:37,969
That's right.

960
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:38,728
He's too much.

961
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,528
He even has the same
surname as me, Fang.

962
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:41,208
Yes.

963
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,688
A bad guy. He's too much.

964
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:44,048
Nasty guy.

965
00:43:44,048 --> 00:43:44,809
What happened after that?

966
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:46,208
Poor Xiaoqi

967
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:49,688
was finally discovered by her
companions of the home planet.

968
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:50,969
They took Xiaoqi

969
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:52,369
back to the home planet.

970
00:43:52,568 --> 00:43:54,128
After returning to home planet,

971
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,409
Xiaoqi got a system upgrade.

972
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,208
She came back to earth

973
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:01,248
and found Fang.

974
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:02,329
Then...

975
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:05,409
She gave him such a hard time.

976
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:08,088
Poor Fang.

977
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,088
Maybe he had his reasons of doing so.

978
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,088
Do you have amnesia or something?

979
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:16,208
He's just evil. There's
no reason for it.

980
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,889
Falling in love isn't so simple.

981
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:23,528
Could it be because

982
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,168
Fang couldn't bear
the pain of Xiaoqi leaving?

983
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:28,088
Maybe that's why he became a bad guy.

984
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:31,048
Maybe it's not that Xiaoqi

985
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:34,728
doesn't like Fang.

986
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:37,769
However, for certain reasons,

987
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,409
she forgot about Fang

988
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:44,048
or maybe she does not dare
to admit that she likes Fang?

989
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,489
That makes sense.

990
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:51,088
Perhaps Fang became a bad guy

991
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:56,489
because someone who loved him dearly

992
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:00,528
left him a long time ago.

993
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:08,969
Fang loves his mother very much.

994
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:11,528
Mother?

995
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:13,889
However, Fang's mother
left him since he was a child.

996
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,740
(Grimms' Fairy Tales)

997
00:45:22,728 --> 00:45:24,048
What's this?

998
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,329
(Fang Leng's mother has passed away.)
"Deceased"

999
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,769
Since the day you left me,

1000
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:45,289
I miss you everyday.

1001
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:48,369
Why are you crying?

1002
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:53,048
Mother.

1003
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:55,489
I don't have a mother.

1004
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,528
I don't know how it feels to have one.

1005
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,528
What can I do to make you feel better?

1006
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,168
All right, stop looking.

1007
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:07,369
Just cry if you want.

1008
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,289
All right.

1009
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:20,329
I really miss her.

1010
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:24,809
Mother?

1011
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:26,728
Mother.

1012
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:33,648
He has a shrewd tongue,

1013
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:36,409
yet he's miserable deep down.

1014
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:38,769
Everything is fine now.

1015
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:40,409
Don't worry.

1016
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:01,889
It's the hormones again.

1017
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,409
Not at this time.

1018
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:06,528
Just lie down.

1019
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:08,568
