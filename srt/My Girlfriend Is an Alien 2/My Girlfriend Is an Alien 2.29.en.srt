19
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,431
I'm sorry, Xiaoqi.

20
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,510
See you.

21
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,190
Xiaoqi.

22
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,311
I don't wish for you to understand me.

23
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,991
I only hope that when you're awake,

24
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:43,230
you won't blame me, okay?

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,230
It's about time, Fang Leng.

26
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,391
You can never see Xiaoqi anymore.

27
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,391
Will you regret it?

28
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:02,910
My feelings are not important.

29
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,470
The most important thing is

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,711
that I wish to see Xiaoqi living well.

31
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:30,831
Shiyi.

32
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,871
Can you pass this letter to her?

33
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:43,350
Also,

34
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,190
if she's going to be sad
after waking up,

35
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,391
can you delete all her memories

36
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,431
about me?

37
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,831
Don't you people from the earth

38
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,271
emphasize on relationships?

39
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:05,790
Yes.

40
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,311
But for her to have the memories

41
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,670
and this relationship alone,

42
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,711
it's just too mean.

43
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,990
It seems like I can never understand

44
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,391
the feelings you have on the earth.

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,751
Don't you think

46
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,151
that kind of life is too boring?

47
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,350
I just need to get used to it.

48
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,430
No, someone is different.

49
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,831
Xiaoqi is like that.

50
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,511
She'll always share her happiness

51
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,591
with others.

52
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,550
Ever since I got to know her,

53
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,990
I've never thought that my life

54
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,310
can be so interesting.

55
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,230
Each and every day is worth
to be remembered.

56
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,151
Feelings are really complicated.

57
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,670
But if two persons are in love,

58
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,470
they don't have to be together.

59
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,631
I won't ask for her

60
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,110
to remember me.

61
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,191
But feelings can be very simple.

62
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,430
As long as you're truly
in love with someone,

63
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,031
you'd do everything for her.

64
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,310
Shiyi,

65
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,910
maybe you have yet to realize that

66
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,071
your protection over Xiaoqi

67
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,151
is not only because of

68
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,670
your feelings for her since young,

69
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,071
and it's not the responsibility
of a superior over his underling.

70
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,031
It could be originated

71
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,470
from the banned relationship

72
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,350
in Cape Town Planet.

73
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,230
Really?

74
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,870
Why do I feel like

75
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:23,071
I totally obey my mother planet's belief

76
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,990
and I'm not shaken at all.

77
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,670
Take care of Xiaoqi.

78
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,511
There's not much time left.

79
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,470
Keep her company.

80
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,071
Xiaoqi.

81
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,751
These are your favorite foods.

82
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:08,631
I've bought a lot.

83
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:11,271
Eat well when you go home,

84
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,990
okay?

85
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,110
You favorite milk tea is here.

86
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,790
Hello, sir. Your delivery...

87
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,310
Xiaoqi!

88
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,590
Why am I on the spaceship?

89
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,430
Fang Leng.

90
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,790
Fang Leng.

91
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:51,991
You're up.

92
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,391
Where is Fang Leng, Shiyi?

93
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,511
Why am I on the spaceship?

94
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,710
The second survival potion

95
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,590
was a failure.

96
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,031
Stop joking with me.

97
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,950
Fang Leng just proposed to me yesterday.

98
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,111
The proposal was his farewell to you.

99
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,830
We had a deal.

100
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,751
If he can't save you,

101
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,111
I'll bring you home.

102
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,830
Xiaoqi, where are you going?

103
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,550
I can't stay here.

104
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,910
I don't care how long the energy
can sustain me.

105
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:30,950
I just want to stay by his side, can I?

106
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:32,631
If you go back now,

107
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,751
wouldn't you let Fang Leng down?

108
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,511
Do you really think he wants to

109
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,111
see you die before his eyes?

110
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,471
We're from the Cape Town Planet.

111
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,871
Going home is the best choice for us.

112
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,830
Furthermore,

113
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,231
we've done

114
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,231
our assignment well this time.

115
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,190
You've also redeemed yourself.

116
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,871
I'll become the leader when I go back.

117
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,190
I can protect you better.

118
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,151
You're still the match for my DNA.

119
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,430
Your position will be lifted
much higher.

120
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,790
Fang Leng knew about this.

121
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,991
That's why he looked for me

122
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,031
and asked me to bring you home.

123
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,830
No way.

124
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,190
He wouldn't think that much.

125
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,310
He only thought about my safety.

126
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,910
That's why he gave up by himself.

127
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,710
Shiyi,

128
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,351
I really can't stay here.

129
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,751
I have to go back.

130
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,710
I can't let him

131
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,950
suffer alone.

132
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,751
Xiaoqi,

133
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,031
don't you think you should consider

134
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,151
about the reality?

135
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,910
To earth,

136
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,550
we're aliens.

137
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,190
Our body's physical function

138
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,910
isn't suitable for us
to live on the earth.

139
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,391
Today, it was because of
your survival energy issue.

140
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,910
What about tomorrow?

141
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,550
You might just die at any time.

142
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,670
I don't care.

143
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:50,871
I just want to stay with Fang Leng.

144
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,830
Shiyi.

145
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:01,830
Shiyi.

146
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,471
Xiaoqi.

147
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,790
I think

148
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:10,031
your current energy is not too stable.

149
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,351
Take a rest.

150
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,550
Shiyi.

151
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,271
(Alert! Invader detected!)

152
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,710
(Alert! Invader detected!)

153
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,511
This should be damaged by now.

154
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,471
There shouldn't be any CCTV here.

155
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,031
(Alert! Unusual sound detected.)

156
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,590
(Please verify as soon as possible.)

157
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,670
(Alert! Unusual sound detected.)

158
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,231
(Please verify as soon as possible.)

159
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,511
I'll be able to escape.

160
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,471
(Robot has detected an escape.)

161
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,111
(Please return immediately.)

162
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,511
(Otherwise, action will be enforced.)

163
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,871
(No Trespassing.)

164
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,871
(No Trespassing.)

165
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:32,950
(Not allowed to use without authority.)

166
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,830
(Not allowed to use without authority.)

167
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,910
(Not allowed to use without authority.)

168
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,190
Xiaoqi,

169
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,790
stop it.

170
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,910
One has to practice and
be familiar to escape.

171
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,871
I can escape once I'm familiar with it.

172
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,830
This is what Fang Leng left for you.

173
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,460
(P.S., eat a little when you're sad
Then you can go home when you're full)

174
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,231
(Xiaoqi,)

175
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,590
(I'm now at the end of the flower road,)

176
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,631
(looking at the ring in my hand.)

177
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,670
(I am waiting for you
to walk towards me.)

178
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,991
(At the same time, I write this letter.)

179
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,790
(I can't help but think,)

180
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,231
(how nice would it be)

181
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,471
(if it's just a normal proposal.)

182
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,751
Xiaoqi, I love you.

183
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,111
Will you marry me?

184
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,231
(It's not the ceremony that
I want to give you in the end.)

185
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,950
(It's not that I want to write an end)

186
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,151
(to our story either.)

187
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,471
(It's just that two people who
love each other)

188
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,310
(have decided to be together forever.)

189
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,670
(I'm sorry, Xiaoqi.)

190
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,631
(I didn't manage to extract
the survival potion.)

191
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,991
(I've let you down.)

192
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,111
(That's why I've made
the selfish decision)

193
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,430
(to ask Jiang Shiyi to bring you home.)

194
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:38,310
(I know you'll be mad at me,)

195
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,151
(but)

196
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,991
(please forgive my arrogance.)

197
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,151
(I know that)

198
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:47,950
(you'll let go of everything for love,)

199
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,631
(even if it costs you
your precious life.)

200
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,190
(But I want to tell you this.)

201
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,950
(To protect a relationship,)

202
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:56,871
(beside giving up,)

203
00:16:58,031 --> 00:16:59,070
(there's also blessing.)

204
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:01,910
(Because someone who loves you)

205
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,871
(would prioritize your safety)

206
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,031
(and wouldn't let you die
before his eyes.)

207
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,991
(After sending you to
Jiang Shiyi's place,)

208
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,790
(I was keeping your luggage alone.)

209
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,271
(I found that I could hardly let go of)

210
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,590
(anything about you.)

211
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,511
(I wish I could keep everything)

212
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,431
(as my memento.)

213
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,191
(However, I hope you'll)

214
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,790
(keep wearing this necklace)

215
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,260
♪The story goes back in time♪

216
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,620
♪I'd never forget the gentleness♪

217
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,060
♪Deep in your eyes♪

218
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
♪It takes only a moment♪

219
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,991
(Because I gave it to you)

220
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:52,431
(when I was confessing my love for you.)

221
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,590
(The polar star indicates the direction
for the lost.)

222
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,471
(Even if you don't remember me anymore,)

223
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,991
(it can protect you forever.)

224
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,911
(Also, the sapphire ring.)

225
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,870
(There's no more memory in there.)

226
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,031
(Just let me)

227
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:16,550
(remember all the stories alone.)

228
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:19,790
(Xiaoqi,)

229
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,070
(did you see that drone?)

230
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,471
(It means you're walking
over here soon.)

231
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,271
(I'm a bit nervous.)

232
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:30,830
(I can't help but look at)

233
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,350
(the signboards on the side
of the flower road.)

234
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,310
(I'm worried that the paintings)

235
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,271
(can't express my feelings completely.)

236
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,310
(I'm also worried that)

237
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,471
(I can't deliver
my confession well later.)

238
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,110
(So,)

239
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,191
(I can't help but tell you every detail)

240
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,951
(since the day we met.)

241
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,711
(Why did I fall for you every time?)

242
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,711
(What was I thinking
every time I see you?)

243
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,390
Kiss.

244
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,070
(When was the time that I was moved?)

245
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,790
(When was the time that I felt
that you're cute?)

246
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:16,070
(When was the time that
you can't see me,)

247
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,231
(but I was looking at you?)

248
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,031
(When you lifted up your head,)

249
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,911
(I turned my head to the other side.)

250
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:26,870
(If I knew this is about to happen,)

251
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,070
(every time that you looked at me,)

252
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,671
(I should've looked at you
with a smile.)

253
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,390
(Every time that we met,)

254
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,471
(I should've hugged you.)

255
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,310
(Every time that you asked me)

256
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,991
(if I love you,)

257
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,630
(I should've answered yes with a smile.)

258
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,711
(If I knew...)

259
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:46,431
(If I knew you're about to leave me,)

260
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,590
(I might not have the guts to
fall in love with you.)

261
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,751
(You should've found the petals
on the roadside by now,)

262
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,590
(but I still have a lot of
boring matters)

263
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,150
(to tell you.)

264
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:01,711
(Like "The Destiny Lover")

265
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,271
(I wrote.)

266
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,711
(I was not happy with
the few versions that I wrote.)

267
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:08,390
(I was so upset that
I snapped some strings.)

268
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,110
(Actually, when I was recovering
the sapphire ring,)

269
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,711
(I noticed that my handwriting)

270
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,070
(is so ugly.)

271
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,630
(I don't have any artistic sense.)

272
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,150
(Actually,)

273
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,870
(I still want to make
a cake with you again,)

274
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,031
(so I bought a lot of equipment.)

275
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,711
(The blanket and pillows)

276
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:32,431
(that you've slept on
are still there in the living room.)

277
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,471
(I don't want to put them away.)

278
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,310
(Actually, I didn't want to let you go.)

279
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:45,830
(I really don't know)

280
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,870
(how to face my life without you.)

281
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,991
(Actually, I'm not that tough.)

282
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,991
(I'm just a normal person.)

283
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,630
(The only thing that makes me
different is that)

284
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,310
(I'm loved by you.)

285
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,711
(Okay, I have to stop thinking.)

286
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,150
(I need to adjust myself.)

287
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,671
(I can't be noticed by you.)

288
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,511
(The sunlight today is amazing.)

289
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,031
(There's no wind at all.)

290
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,830
(So, I can't give an excuse that)

291
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,630
(the wind has blown my eyes red.)

292
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,511
(Xiaoqi,)

293
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,150
(in the vast universe,)

294
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,471
(I'm so lucky to have)

295
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:44,031
(met you twice)

296
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,911
(and fell in love with you twice.)

297
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:49,110
(Therefore,)

298
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,991
(let the memory stop at
the most beautiful moment)

299
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,191
(and become the everlasting label.)

300
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:57,911
(Our love)

301
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,271
(will not end
just because we're apart,)

302
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,550
(but it will forever
be engraved in my life)

303
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,231
(as the most beautiful source of warmth)

304
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,471
(in my future life.)

305
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,271
(Xiaoqi,)

306
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,870
(I see you coming over here to me.)

307
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,110
(That's all for now.)

308
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,191
(I wish you'll live in peace)

309
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:18,911
(and joy from now on.)

310
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,271
Fang Leng.

311
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,840
(P.S., eat a little when you're sad
Then you can go home when you're full)

312
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:05,630
I will.

313
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,711
You have a good taste.

314
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,991
Let's be friends.

315
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,110
Friends have to be honest
with one another.

316
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,350
We can't lie to one another as we wish.

317
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,991
Master, the boundary has been destroyed.

318
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,550
Do I need to consolidate it?

319
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,191
Master, the boundary has been destroyed.

320
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,751
Do I need to consolidate it?

321
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,471
Master, the boundary has been destroyed.

322
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:00,991
Do I need to consolidate it?

323
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,550
You won't be angry
after looking at this.

324
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:39,711
You must be tiring spending
so much effort on it.

325
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,550
Fang Leng, are you okay?

326
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,511
Isn't that Xiaoqi's hairclip?

327
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,911
Where did you find it?

328
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,590
This is how Xiaoqi is.

329
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,991
She doesn't know how to tidy things up

330
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,711
and she keeps thing everywhere.

331
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,830
Fang Leng, we'll wait for you outside.

332
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,991
Call us anytime if you need anything.

333
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,671
Xiaoqi has left.

334
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,310
I didn't have a chance to
say goodbye to her.

335
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,911
I'm not a qualified AI secretary.

336
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:04,870
I'm not qualified to
be her friend either.

337
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,630
I wasn't able to help her

338
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,031
even till the end.

339
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,471
Xiaoqi wouldn't blame you.

340
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,031
Let's think positively.

341
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,350
Xiaoqi will be healthy

342
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,951
when she's arrived in Cape Town.

343
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,991
She doesn't need to worry about
not having enough survival energy.

344
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,790
The advantage of friendship is,

345
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,911
even though you're far away
from each other,

346
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:31,350
as long as you still miss one another,

347
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,550
you'll always be best friends.

348
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,350
Don't cry anymore.

349
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:38,110
I miss Xiaoqi.

350
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,431
All right.

351
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,431
Fang Leng is not the same.

352
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,911
He has to live alone again.

353
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,040
(The Domineering CEO's Ultimate Love)

354
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,790
(Why is Fang Leng's smile so nice?)

355
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,830
(How nice if I can make his smile)

356
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,390
(semi-permanent.)

357
00:29:44,671 --> 00:29:46,951
(I regret lying to Fang Leng,)

358
00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:49,790
(but I was brainwashed.)

359
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,390
(I was eager to
complete my mission.)

360
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,590
Why did you pretend as my neighbor?

361
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:54,630
Well...

362
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,031
I can't tell you that.

363
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,350
Why did you pretend as my ex-girlfriend?

364
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:03,191
Well, I can't tell you that either.

365
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:06,550
Why did you approach me
in the beginning?

366
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,590
Well, I can't tell you that.

367
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,830
(I feel like the lying Xiaoqi)

368
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,110
(is no longer the cute Xiaoqi.)

369
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:21,991
(Chai said something today.)

370
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:24,070
(One-sided love is missing.)

371
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,070
(Mutual love is true love.)

372
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,310
(A love triangle is a drama.)

373
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:30,911
(One-sided love is the most common.)

374
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,310
(Mutual love is the rarest.)

375
00:30:33,711 --> 00:30:34,911
(Then it seems like)

376
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,150
(Fang Leng and I in love)

377
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,671
(is a low possibility matter.)

378
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:39,991
(I didn't expect it to come true.)

379
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,231
(I'm happy.)

380
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:42,550
(Do you love me, Xiaoqi?)

381
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,870
(I love you very much.)

382
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,271
(This necklace is called North Star.)

383
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,511
(It can indicate directions for people.)

384
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,751
(But to me,)

385
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,350
(you're my North Star.)

386
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,070
(I've been roaming for so long.)

387
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,431
(I don't want to lose you anymore,
Xiaoqi.)

388
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,870
Will you leave me?

389
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,790
No, of course not.

390
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,911
I'll never leave you.

391
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:03,350
(I promised that I'll stay by your side)

392
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,511
(and I'll keep my word.)

393
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:05,830
(I'll never leave you.)

394
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,070
(I'll never leave you,)

395
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,070
(no matter what happens.)

396
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,830
(I've decided to stay on the earth.)

397
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,751
(I'll live with Fang Leng from now on.)

398
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,991
I promise

399
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:16,671
I will not leave you.

400
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,431
I'll never leave you.

401
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,951
(However, Xiaobu has checked
the customs on the earth.)

402
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,911
(It says that when two people
are together,)

403
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:26,790
(a ring is needed to prove that.)

404
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:30,951
(Fang Leng doesn't like fancy things.)

405
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:33,150
(So, the ring has to be simple.)

406
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,150
(My name is Xiaoqi.)

407
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,511
(Let's inlay a diamond "7"
in the middle.)

408
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:40,751
(Fang Leng will only)

409
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,271
(love me alone.)

410
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:46,711
(Making a ring is tough.)

411
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:09,390
A lifeboat can send me

412
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,911
to the earth.

413
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,070
But going to the lifeboat
from this room

414
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,231
will pass by the CCTV,

415
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,870
the laser sensor

416
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:21,271
and the patrol.

417
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:26,830
Xiaoqi,

418
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,150
we're about to reach the mother planet.

419
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:31,550
So fast?

420
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,191
Get ready to land at any time.

421
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,471
Okay.

422
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,630
I must be able to do this.

423
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
(Shutting down by force)

424
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:03,751
Master,

425
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:06,390
Chai Xiaoqi is sensed to be
escaping from the monitored area.

426
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:07,630
Really?

427
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,471
Why didn't I see it?

428
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:31,710
Master,

429
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,750
Chai Xiaoqi is sensed to be
escaping into the lifeboat.

430
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,710
Candy,

431
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,710
is your system down?

432
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,550
Master, I have...

433
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,110
Yes.

434
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,110
My system is down.

435
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,031
I couldn't sense anything.

436
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,300
(Setting target)

437
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,700
(Targeted earth)

438
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,220
(Set on target)

439
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,900
(Activate)

440
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,391
Xiaoqi.

441
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,471
I'm sorry.

442
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,391
This could be our last time
seeing each other.

443
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,190
Actually, the second survival potion

444
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,630
was a success.

445
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:24,991
Because I wanted to bring
you back to the mother planet,

446
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,871
I lied to you again.

447
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:33,991
When Fang Leng was saying
goodbye to you,

448
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:36,351
I was shaken.

449
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,070
There's not much time left.

450
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,031
Keep her company.

451
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,270
But I chose to keep the truth from you.

452
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,511
Until you're trying to escape

453
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,911
from the spaceship over and over again.

454
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,630
Until you read Fang Leng's letter.

455
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,871
You cried like a baby.

456
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,311
Until then I could confirm that

457
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,550
maybe letting you go back to the earth

458
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,911
is the right decision.

459
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,351
Fang Leng told me before that...

460
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:32,070
He said

461
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,351
my feelings for you

462
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,791
are not only friends or your superior.

463
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,831
I denied it,

464
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:42,750
but when I look back at
what I've done,

465
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,750
I think the only logical explanation is

466
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,190
I love you.

467
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,110
I love you,

468
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,791
and that's why I kept stopping you

469
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:58,150
from seeing Fang Leng.

470
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,991
I love you,

471
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,911
and that's why I can't let go
of the memory of the candy.

472
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:08,110
So, feeling is not some lowly emotion.

473
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:12,031
It's not scientifically proven.

474
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,871
It's not limited by DNA matching.

475
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:19,070
It's not affected by hormone.

476
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,710
Loving someone is

477
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:25,630
the determination for a person,

478
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,911
for a long period of time.

479
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,471
Xiaoqi,

480
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,710
you made my childhood warm,

481
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,590
so I wanted to take care of you
in the rest of your life.

482
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,590
But I was late.

483
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,750
You have Fang Leng by your side.

484
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,190
So, what I can do now is

485
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,871
to let go of my obsession.

486
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:56,991
You must be happy.

487
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,831
Bye.

488
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,270
Candy.

489
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:25,311
Let's go home.

490
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,630
Okay, master.

491
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:43,070
Thank you, Shiyi.

492
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,190
I can finally go back to the earth.

493
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,391
Stupid Fang Leng,

494
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,031
how dare you dump me?

495
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,311
Just wait and see how I'll punish you.

496
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,720
(Encounter Turbulence)

497
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:17,311
No way!

498
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,680
