Look.

(Fang Lie)

Xiaobu.

60
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,360
You're marvellous.

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,160
It's nothing.

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,080
I can do even better.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
What are you trying to do?

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,480
Xiaobu.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,240
You're amazing.

66
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,680
I knew you weren't an ordinary person.

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,440
(Identity compromised
Taking him down by force?)

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
(Yes No)

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
(No)

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
You can do many things
that can't be done

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,760
by normal people.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,960
It's just like you have superpower.

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Everyone

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,480
is unique.

75
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
No one can be replaced.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Do you get what I mean?

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
I was so scared.

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,360
I thought you found out I was a robot.

79
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,800
A robot?

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,600
You...

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,360
A robot is a pile of codes.

82
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
You're different.

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,760
You're unique.

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880
(System alert
Seems like he's asking for a kiss)

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,920
You want to kiss me, don't you?

86
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
No.

87
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,440
Xiaobu, this part of your
neck seems to be on fire.

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,240
Fang Lie!

89
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
Why are you here?

90
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,520
Look.

91
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,360
She looks like my mother.

92
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,400
(Zhou Siqin)

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,400
- Look.
- Zhou Siqin.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
She carries exactly
the name of your mother.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
Really?

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,200
- What a coincidence.
- She looks like my mother.

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,040
Mother.

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
Surprise!

99
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Mother, your dearest son.

100
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,000
What's wrong with you?

101
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Fang Lie, come home with me.

102
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Wait.

103
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Fang Lie is already an adult.

104
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
You have no right to deprive
him of his personal liberty.

105
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,880
Once it involves actions
such as illegal detention,

106
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
you...

107
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
You'll be punished by law.

108
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
Who are you?

109
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,720
Madam, I'm glad to see you.

110
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,600
Weren't you the person in that video?

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm his girlfriend.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,880
You...

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
I see.

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
This explains why you came back.

115
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,040
You did it because of her.

116
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,400
You're getting really bold.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Come home.

118
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
No.

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
Fill it

120
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,240
if you want money.

121
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,960
Stay away from my son after this.

122
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
How much do I want?

123
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
How much do you have?

124
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,360
You...

125
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm not greedy, actually,

126
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,880
but can it be slightly more
than what Xiaoqi got?

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,880
Do you two take me as an ATM?

128
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
Fang Lie.

129
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,640
Come on.

130
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,880
Look who you've befriended.

131
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,200
Come home with me.

132
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,240
- No.
- Hurry up!

133
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,600
- No.
- I can't stand this anymore.

134
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
- I'm going to break.
- Fang Lie!

135
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,160
No!

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Let go!

137
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,520
Fang Lie!

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,560
Give it to me.

139
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
The cheque.

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Just wait.

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,840
I let you pick whatever you want to buy.

142
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,800
You bought a lot of snacks.

143
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,720
I like snacks.

144
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
Hold on.

145
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,920
Hello.

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
Fang Lie was taken away by Zhou Siqin.

147
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,120
Go home.

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,560
- I'll go with you.
- Never mind.

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,760
Take a rest.

150
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,720
Don't worry.

151
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,520
Father.

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm home.

153
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,840
Wait.

154
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
How dare you come home
after putting your brother

155
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
through this?

156
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,160
Tell me.

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,560
Did you lure Fang Lie
back to the country?

158
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,920
Fang Lie is already an adult.

159
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,920
He doesn't need anyone
to decide for him.

160
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
It sounds so pleasant.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
You're worried that
Fang Lie would come back

162
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
and pose a threat to you.

163
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
Shida, do you see this?

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,360
Not only he messed up the company,

165
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
he ruined his own brother.

166
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,000
Why did you keep

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
Fang Lie's return from us?

168
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
What's the point of him
coming back to the country

169
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
if he let you know about it?

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,720
You said Fang Lie

171
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,600
could choose his own life.

172
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,800
However,

173
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,440
he's still young.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,520
How can you be sure

175
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
that his choice is correct?

176
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,720
It's just like you investing a lot
of money in makeup department.

177
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,320
You even set up a R&D department.

178
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,240
What if you regret it?

179
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,400
Fang Lie is having a good time.

180
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,800
I also know

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
my purpose in the company.

182
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't think you're afraid of me
making the wrong choice.

183
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
You forget your
original intention instead.

184
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
You forget who

185
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,800
you set up the makeup
production line for.

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
Do you still remember
what day it is tomorrow?

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,280
I think you don't care anymore.

188
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,640
Hold on.

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,640
What do you want?

190
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Do you still want to see Fang Lie?

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
Listen.

192
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
From now on,

193
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
Fang Lie will stay within my sight.

194
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,320
Don't think you can
get any closer to him.

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
Look at your attitude.

196
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,880
How rude.

197
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Fang Leng.

198
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
Mr. Han, I'm Xiaoqi.

199
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,400
Do you know where
Fang Leng has gone today?

200
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,520
Did he contact you?

201
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,000
Ms. Chai, are you kidding me?

202
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,600
Do you know the date today?

203
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Mr. Fang won't contact me.

204
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,040
What do you mean?

205
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,960
Today is the death anniversary
of Mr. Fang's mother.

206
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,880
He normally stays alone

207
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,400
on this day.

208
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,720
He allows no one to disturb him.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
Do you know where he'll go?

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
(He's so down.)

211
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,480
(What should I say?)

212
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Why are you here?

213
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,120
It's unnatural.

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,480
Life and death are predestined.

215
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,560
Please accept my condolences.

216
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,160
Disadvantage is a blessing.

217
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,200
Earthlings don't seem to
comfort others like this.

218
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,440
Don't cry.

219
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,000
Get high.

220
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
What are you doing?

221
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Hi! Why are you here?

222
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,200
You cry...

223
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,640
You...

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,040
Were you looking for me?

225
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,640
Yes, I was.

226
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,680
Let's go. I'll send you home.

227
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,600
Later.

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
You've come to this theme park.

229
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
Have fun before you leave.

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,160
The place is closed.

231
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
Please leave at once.

232
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
The place

233
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,240
- is closed.
- We can't have fun anymore.

234
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,920
- Please leave at once.
- Hold on.

235
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,480
The place is closed.

236
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Please leave at once.

237
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Do you see this circle?

238
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,800
You mustn't leave.

239
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,720
Wait for me.

240
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,560
Stay still.

241
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,720
(Bumper cars)

242
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,760
How did you persuade the manager?

243
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
He's very accommodating.

244
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
I bought a bag of candies
for his grandson.

245
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,280
Come on.

246
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,280
- It's pink.
- That's right.

247
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
Sit down.

248
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You know what?

249
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,960
Bumper cars can bump off

250
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
all our bad feelings.

251
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,680
Let's begin.

252
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,640
When you feel bad,

253
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,760
you should take this kind
of stimulating ride

254
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,800
and scream along with it.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,680
No.

256
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,480
Give it a try.

257
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,480
Louder.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
You can pedal it

259
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,040
hard and draw deep breaths.

260
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
This will open up

261
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,040
your heart and mind.

262
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,680
Try it.

263
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,880
Try it.

264
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,080
Follow my pace.

265
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,680
Let me see if your heart is racing.

266
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,120
How can your heart race
when you're breathing?

267
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,080
It is racing.

268
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,120
Do you feel it?

269
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
I didn't mean it.

270
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,960
I really didn't mean it.

271
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,640
Let's make a turn.

272
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,960
You...

273
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
Are you still unhappy?

274
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
I often dream of

275
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,200
the last time my mother
took me on a carousel.

276
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,000
She sat in front of me in the dream.

277
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
I was behind her.

278
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,360
However, in the dream,

279
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,360
I felt like I could
never catch up with her.

280
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
Ever since my mother passed away,

281
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,200
I come to the theme park every year.

282
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,160
However, I don't dare
to ride the carousel,

283
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,920
because to me,

284
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,040
carousel means

285
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,360
permanent distance.

286
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,800
Xiaoqi.

287
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
This book says

288
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
that on earth,

289
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,440
children come to the world

290
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
through their mothers.

291
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,640
To them, mothers

292
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,760
are bridges that connect
them to the world.

293
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,760
If one day the bridge vanishes,

294
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,600
the child

295
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
will think the whole world has nothing
to do with him or her anymore.

296
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,480
However, they're forced

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,240
to face the world alone.

298
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,880
Fang Leng has a bad
relationship with his father.

299
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,240
That's why he misses

300
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,880
his mother very much.

301
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,920
When did you come?

302
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
I want to tell you

303
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
that you should be happy

304
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
even when you ride the carousel alone.

305
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
Don't just look at the view

306
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,120
in front of you.

307
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
There's so much wonderful view

308
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,160
around you.

309
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
The views must be what your mother

310
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,760
wanted you to see.

311
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,600
Also,

312
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,160
don't always feel you're all alone.

313
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,200
You still have me, don't you?

314
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,320
You're smiling.

315
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
You need to keep smiling then.

316
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,280
What's good

317
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
about this drink?

318
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,760
Why does it taste a little
different from other drinks

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,520
I've had on earth?

320
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,560
Earth?

321
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Did you come from Mars?

322
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,200
Come on, cheers.

323
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,240
Thank you.

324
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,760
You must thank me for sure.

325
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,640
You wouldn't have had fun

326
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
if not because of me.

327
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,640
You wouldn't have seen...

328
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,120
How wonderful.

329
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,080
A wonderful sea.

330
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,280
Look there.

331
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,640
There's a dolphin.

332
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
There's a sea lion.

333
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,480
Let's check it out.

334
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,040
Play with them.

335
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,520
Come on.

336
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,040
(Expiry date 2018 February 2)

337
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm the king of the world!

338
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,600
Fish!

339
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
It's so big!

340
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,880
You jump, I jump.

341
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
Of course.

342
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,680
WALL-E.

343
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,480
EVE.

Why is it raining?

345
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,880
EVE.

346
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,600
I don't need it.

347
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,720
You will use it.

348
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,880
No.

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,840
I don't need it.

350
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
You will use it.

351
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,800
EVE.

352
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,760
I'll assume that you're absent from work

353
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
if you apply a sick leave.

354
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
WALL-E.

355
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,200
WALL-E.

356
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,880
EVE.

Come on.

382
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,560
I wanted to kiss him just now.

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,800
(Made Fang Leng love me)

387
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,720
You...

388
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
You woke up.

389
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,680
Breakfast is served outside.

390
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,520
You can have it.

391
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,000
(Then I can collect hormone)

392
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920
I don't think he found out, did he?

393
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,280
(I think it's diary.)

394
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,480
(She's liked me for a long time.)

395
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,280
Mr. Fang, good morning.

396
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,080
Why...

397
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,000
Ms. Chai said you weren't feeling well.

398
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,520
She asked me to pick you up.

399
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Good morning, Chai.

400
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,760
Breakfast is served.

401
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,640
Xiaoqi

402
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,280
got up early

403
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,920
to make this for you.

404
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
Try it.

405
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Chai, didn't you...

406
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
How does it taste?

407
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,200
Lovely and generous.

408
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,960
Gentle and virtuous.

409
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
A kind girl like Xiaoqi

410
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,840
is

411
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,200
hard to come by.

412
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
What do you think, Mr. Fang?

413
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Xiaoqi is cheerful

414
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
and serious.

415
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,280
She thinks out of the box.

416
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
However, sometimes she
gets a little too imaginative.

417
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,160
Most of the time, she is too bold

418
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,080
and reckless.

419
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
Thank you, Mr. Fang,
for your compliment.

420
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,800
Come on.

421
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
Is it a compliment?

422
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,160
However, as her boss,

423
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,440
I have a duty to correct her.

424
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,400
You're right.

425
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,360
Xiaobu.

426
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,560
May I ask how Fang Lie is doing?

427
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440
Fang Lie is locked up by Zhou Siqin.

428
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,480
His phone is confiscated, too.

429
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
He's locked up?

430
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,440
Zhou Siqin is controlling.

431
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,560
It's likely that she'll send
Fang Lie out of the country

432
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,920
or she might make another arrangement.

433
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,320
I don't think

434
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,240
he can make his own choices anymore.

435
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,200
What about his dream of painting?

436
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,480
Don't worry.

437
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,760
I won't abandon him.

438
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,480
Mr. Fang.

439
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,400
The perfume department sent us news.

440
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Dreamy Love

441
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,280
has been developed successfully.

442
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,440
We may test it in the morning meeting.

443
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,440
Good.

444
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,040
Chai.

445
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
Thank you for your hospitality
today. I have to go.

446
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,200
Thank you.

447
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,200
Really?

448
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,080
- We haven't started eating yet.
- I'm going to the company.

449
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,240
Shall I pack the food for you?

450
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,640
- Grab my coat.
- Bye.

451
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,760
Bye.

452
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,040
Mr. Fang, our door

453
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,720
remains open to you.

454
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,640
You're welcome to come again.

455
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,480
Bye.

456
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
I never thought

457
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
I'd be so good

458
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,920
and wonderful

459
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
in Fang Leng's mind.

460
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,600
You're really quite cute

461
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,320
when you're being silly.

462
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,680
Although Mr. Fang

463
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
mentioned a lot of your flaws just now,

464
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,920
from another perspective,

465
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
it means he's been thinking about you.

466
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,680
He couldn't forget about you
and he didn't give you up.

467
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,080
It means

468
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,000
you've completely captivated him.

469
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I think

470
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
you can proceed to the next stage.

471
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,080
The next stage?

472
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,760
Yes.

473
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
Be more proactive.

474
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,320
Be wilder.

475
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,680
You can even give him

476
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,000
a kiss by force sometimes.

477
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,480
This isn't good.

478
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,080
A romance is supposed to be a transition

479
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,280
from the mind to the body.

480
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,880
Without dominance in action,

481
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,520
all the preparation is useless.

482
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,240
All right.

483
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,880
(Flavoring room)

484
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,440
What do you think?

485
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,040
I think it's good.

486
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,600
The initial creative positioning
of Love Perfume

487
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
was the scent on a lover's body.

488
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,640
It aimed to make users

489
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
feel like they're in love.

490
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,080
However, the effect at present

491
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
is relatively plain.

492
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,280
It is a nice way of saying it.

493
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,120
The quality does not meet our standards.

494
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Launching it straight in the market

495
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,800
will definitely bring down
the group's reputation.

496
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,960
Mr. Fang.

497
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
The board has greatly reduced

498
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,160
our project costs

499
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,320
at the R&D stage.

500
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,760
We had no funding for
experiments and comparisons.

501
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
We've come a long way

502
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,400
to achieve this.

503
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,920
You're right.

504
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
Although this product does not meet

505
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,800
our expectations,

506
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,720
it's as good as

507
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,240
other perfume

508
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
in the market.

509
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,520
I think a higher standard is required.

510
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,040
We can't settle for less.

511
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
You may need to work harder today.

512
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,120
Prepare all information.

513
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
We will redo our research.

514
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Okay.

515
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
Get back to work for now.

516
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,560
- Let's go.
- I think

517
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
we did pretty well this time.

518
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Don't give up.

519
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Keep it up.

520
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,360
- Keep it up.
- Okay.

521
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,800
- No problem.
- Okay.

522
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Mr. Han, are you yawning?

523
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,440
I've heard that you've
been working late lately.

524
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,960
Is it because the perfume
is not developed well?

525
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,320
Are you pretending that you care

526
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,480
or taking pleasure in our misfortune?

527
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,840
I didn't think it's a good idea

528
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,560
when you mentioned

529
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
Dreamy Love last time.

530
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Cutting costs

531
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,000
was actually to remind you
to stop loss in time.

532
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,760
See?

533
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
You suffer

534
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,160
for not listening to the elder.

535
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
You have a dark forehead

536
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,400
and dark lips.

537
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,480
It means you're getting out of luck.

538
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Don't worry about us.

539
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
Think more about yourself.

540
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
I have red lips and white teeth.

541
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,400
Son.

542
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,680
Son.

543
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,000
Get up and take your breakfast.

544
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,200
Stop sending it.

545
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
I won't eat

546
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,360
unless you let me out.

547
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Son.

548
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,120
Your uncle called again just now.

549
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,040
He said Fang Leng had another
incident at the company.

550
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,880
Hurry to the U.S.

551
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,800
and get MBA.

552
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,400
Replace him.

553
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm doing this for your sake.

554
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,440
You claim it's for my sake.

555
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,720
It's actually for yourself.

556
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm just a puppet to you.

557
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,160
I have to obey you in everything.

558
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,200
Nonsense.

559
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
Why am I not arranging for someone else?

560
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
It's because you're my son.

561
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,280
Many people don't
get a chance to inherit

562
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,640
a family business even when they want.

563
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,560
You, however,

564
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
insist on becoming a painter

565
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,880
despite the chance
dangling in front of you.

566
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,000
I'll just starve myself to death

567
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,960
unless you let me out.

568
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,120
I won't compromise for my dream.

569
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,960
Mother.

570
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,960
It's a hungry burb.

571
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,960
It means my stomach is all empty.

572
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,520
Mother.

573
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm sleeping naked.

574
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
Will you not leave me

575
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,160
the last bit of privacy?

576
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,720
Cut it out.

577
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,560
You...

578
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
I was wondering

579
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,480
why you'd have a double chin

580
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,840
even after two days of hunger strike.

581
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,640
Fine.

582
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,920
You're determined not
to go the U.S., aren't you?

583
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,560
Fine. You'll stay

584
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,640
in the house.

585
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,320
Mother.

586
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,800
Could you give me my phone and computer?

587
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Quit thinking about it.

588
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,080
Do some soul-searching.

589
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,720
Xiaobu.

590
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
- What brings you here?
- I...

591
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,000
Why are your eyes red?

592
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,360
Who bullied you?

593
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,600
Why did you cry?

594
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,480
No.

595
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,640
I got carried away.

596
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,960
Don't cry. I'm here.

597
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,120
Come on.

598
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,840
A lot of snacks.

599
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
What are you doing?

600
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,200
I'm taking you away from home.

601
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
No.

602
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,480
My mother is watching me closely.

603
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,600
I can't run away at all.

604
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
It doesn't matter.

605
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,960
I'm fine at home.

606
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,640
I just feel bored as I'm alone.

607
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,600
It's good enough when
you can talk with me.

608
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
I'll come every day then.

609
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
(Meeting room)

610
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,960
Isn't it just a forced kiss?

611
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,560
Just turn a blind eye
and get on with it.

612
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,440
I can do it.

613
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,320
Go for it.

614
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,680
Wait a second.

615
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,360
I don't seem very tempting.

616
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,280
This...

617
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,360
I have an idea.

618
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,560
(None of them smells good.)

619
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
(It's not tempting enough.)

620
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,040
I...

621
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,400
I slipped just now.

623
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,920
I didn't mean to break it.

624
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm sorry.

625
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,480
I'll clean it up for sure.

626
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,840
Don't get angry.

627
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,880
I'll clean it up.

628
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,720
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,400
Don't get angry.

630
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,440
Do you smell it?

631
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,360
Apply perfume on our pulse.

632
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,160
As the blood flows,

633
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,560
it allows the perfume
to evaporate more quickly.

634
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,440
It smells very good.

635
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,880
Which bottle of perfume is it?

636
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,360
Why didn't I smell it just now...
