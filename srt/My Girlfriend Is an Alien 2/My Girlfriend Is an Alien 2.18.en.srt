(Send signal to Cape Town Planet?)

21
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:52,014
Xiaoqi, press the button, hurry up.

22
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,294
Then, our mission is done.

23
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,374
Inside this ring are
the normal hormones.

24
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:00,735
It's not yet Hormone Element

25
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,255
for R&D department's extraction.

26
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:03,854
However, now,

27
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,294
Fang Leng hasn't even
collected the hormones,

28
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,774
let alone completing the extraction.

29
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:10,374
Anyway, just press it.

30
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,735
Then our job will be done.

31
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:13,855
Tell me.

32
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,694
If I give Fang Leng the hormones,

33
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,575
does it mean he can continue
the extraction process?

34
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,735
Xiaobu,

35
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:22,135
how do I convert

36
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:23,415
the hormones in this ring?

37
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:24,374
Do you have any idea?

38
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,415
Xiaoqi,

39
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,055
you should think this through.

40
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:28,895
After the ring is
activated with hormone,

41
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,814
there's only one chance to launch.

42
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,335
We've finally got a full charge.

43
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,534
if you empty it,

44
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:35,094
it'll become an ordinary ring

45
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,575
and lose its function.

46
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:42,015
It's fine.

47
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:43,455
I have faith in Fang Leng.

48
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:44,974
I think he will definitely succeed.

49
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:46,895
Okay.

50
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,214
Since you've already decided,

51
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,175
I will support your decision.

52
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,460
(Collected hormone from the ring)

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,540
(Ring, connecting, hormone)

54
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,534
I can connect the ring

55
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,295
to the collector in R&D department.

56
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:00,774
That way, it can convert the hormones.

57
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,455
(The surveillance is switched off.)

58
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:17,214
(It's show time.)

59
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:25,295
Where do they store the collector?

60
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,214
I found it.

61
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,055
Mr. Fang,

62
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,934
here's Hormone Element after extraction.

63
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:37,855
It works.

64
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,655
Wait. Didn't you say yesterday

65
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:41,694
the hormone collector

66
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:43,215
did not meet the extraction standard?

67
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:44,055
However, today,

68
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:45,215
we found a large quantity of hormones

69
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:46,574
in the collector you were wearing.

70
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,494
Maybe there was
a delay in the collector.

71
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,295
So the test results for yesterday

72
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,454
is only shown today.

73
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,894
Why is there no response
from other collectors?

74
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:55,535
Well...

75
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,095
Could it be that

76
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,855
the hormones were collected

77
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:01,334
while we were chatting here yesterday?

78
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,374
Keep Hormone Element in the incubator.

79
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:08,175
Then you guys can continue to study

80
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,454
ways to mass-produce Hormone Element

81
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,215
and modify the collector.

82
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:12,095
Got it, Mr. Fang.

83
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:19,454
What's the matter?

84
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,934
I have a meeting today.

85
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,295
So I can't take you to dinner.

86
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,894
We'll go on a date this weekend.

87
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:27,934
Smile for me.

88
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:30,254
Smile.

89
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,260
(Construction ahead,
pay attention to safety)

90
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,735
It finally succeeds.

91
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,295
When Xiaobu is back,

92
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:53,095
we'll go back to
our home planet together.

93
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,215
Bye, earth.

94
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:57,454
Bye.

95
00:05:58,055 --> 00:05:58,975
Be good.

98

99
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,934
(won't be able to see
Fang Leng ever again.)

100
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,655
(Why does the thought of
never seeing him again)

101
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,694
(make me a little sad?)

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,540
(Fang Leng)

103
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,175
Watch out!

104
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,775

is everything frozen?)

Are you all right?

109
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,535
Have a candy.

110
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:18,535
It'll make you feel better.

111
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:21,934
Let me introduce myself one more time.

112
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:23,055
I'm

113
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,694
Jilisiburadakaqikaqi No. 11,

114
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,934
the current inspector
of Cape Town Planet.

115
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,494
I'm also one of the candidates
for the next chief.

116
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:34,295
The organisation detected when you
travelled through time and space

117
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:35,334
that you landed on the wrong track.

118
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,694
So, I was sent to assist
you in your mission.

119
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,854
You've successfully developed
Hormone Element, right?

120
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:44,255
Next,

121
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,135
we have more important tasks for you.

122
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:05,535
At this rate,

123
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,895
how is our project going to continue?

124
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:07,974
Who did this?

125
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,694
The company has suffered heavy losses.

126
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,454
This happened not long
since it was established.

127
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,334
Could it be the competitor's doing?

128
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,454
Mr. Fang is here.

129
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:17,974
Mr. Fang,

130
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,974
Hormone Element sample
was smashed by someone.

131
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,734
Even the equipment was destroyed.

132
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:22,655
I'm going to call the police.

133
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,614
No.

134
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:24,814
Carry out an internal
investigation first.

135
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,015
No employee is allowed to disclose
any information to the public.

136
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:28,015
Mr. Fang,

137
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:29,454
all surveillance equipment was damaged.

138
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,094
However, we found this.

139
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,775
(Share favourite pizza)
Disposable gloves?

140
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,180
(Chai Xiaoqi)

141
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,214
Ms. Chai.

142
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,415
Good morning.

143
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,175
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

144
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,055
How dare she show up.

145
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,214
That's her. I heard that
evidence was found at the scene.

146
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,255
- Stop talking.
- Ms. Chai.

147
00:09:59,255 --> 00:09:59,694
She's here.

148
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:00,655
We're in trouble.

149
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,535
Don't you all have work to do?

150
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:07,415
R&D department was intruded yesterday.

151
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,375
Hormone Element was destroyed.

152
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:11,175
Even the equipment was damaged.

153
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,015
Most importantly,

154
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:16,175
we found your employee tag at the place.

155
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,535
How did my employee tag...

156
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,214
Impossible.

157
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:21,934
Ms. Chai,

158
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,175
how do you explain this?

159
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,380
(Chai Xiaoqi)

160
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:28,094
I...

161
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:29,775
What is there to explain?

162
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,295
My employee tag was always on the table.

163
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,614
How would I know where it went?

164
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:33,974
If you refuse to admit it,

165
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,775
then I can only hand you to the police.

166
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:37,854
What are you doing?

167
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,055
What are you doing?

168
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,094
What do you think you are doing?

169
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:41,775
I think she should be arrested.

170
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,655
Yes.

171
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:43,814
What are the losses?

172
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:44,694
Mr. Fang.

173
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:52,454
I just told you not to call the police.

174
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:53,574
Whose idea was this?

175
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:55,775
Mr. Fang, I was just
trying to scare her.

176
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,015
Who knows? Maybe she'd admit it.

177
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:58,454
Is she someone you can scare?

178
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,375
Xiaoqi also put effort into
the study of Hormone Element.

179
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,015
If she really wanted to steal

180
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:06,734
or destroyed it,

181
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,055
she wouldn't have waited until now.

182
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,535
Listen here, all of you.

183
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,375
I will find out the truth

184
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,495
in a short period of time.

185
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:19,334
However, in the meantime,

186
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,734
I don't want you to doubt

187
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:21,655
the employees,

188
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,934
especially your colleagues.

189
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,255
Did I make myself clear?

190
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,814
Yes.

191
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:27,934
Did you hear what I said?

192
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,655
Yes!

193
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,655
Did you hear what I said?

194
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:32,775
Yes.

195
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,495
Mr. Han.

196
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:34,775
Mr. Fang.

197
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:36,175
Send Xiaoqi home.

198
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,334
Ms. Chai,

199
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,135
let's go.

200
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,175
Okay.

201
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,694
Chai, I'm back.

202
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,375
You're back early.

203
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,214
Fang Leng said the company
was having problems.

204
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:08,974
So he told me to come back and rest.

205
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,015
I didn't expect Mr. Fang
to be so thoughtful.

206
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,255
He's worried about you as
soon as you started working

207
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
and he told you to rest.

208
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,334
How about this?

209
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,454
Keep an eye on the shop.

210
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:21,694
I'll check the inventory.

211
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:22,934
Sure, no problem.

212
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:28,574
I can finally stay on earth longer.

213
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:34,495
Hi. Why are you here?

214
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:36,295
Fang...

215
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:41,775
Fang Leng didn't make things
difficult for you, did he?

216
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,614
I heard about what happened
at R&D department.

217
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:47,895
I don't want to talk about it.

218
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:51,535
Hormone Element we have
is too low in concentration.

219
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,255
Otherwise, I would
have done it yesterday.

220
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:55,375
Who knew

221
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,375
someone else would act first?

222
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:58,854
I don't believe this.

223
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:00,974
It's okay, Xiaoqi. Don't worry.

224
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,535
We'll wait and see

225
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,574
until the truth is revealed.

226
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,614
Take a rest for now.

227
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:06,334
Understood, inspector.

228
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:07,694
Xiaoqi,

229
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,814
we are still friends.

230
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:10,934
Those formalities are unnecessary.

231
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:12,655
Understood, No. 11.

232
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:14,934
Take a seat, No. 11.

233
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,015
I'll treat you to milk tea.

234
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:16,614
Okay.

235
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:17,814
Put more sugar.

236
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:18,614
No problem.

237
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:25,694
Mr. Fang,

238
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,694
you were the one who insisted
on having a R&D department.

239
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,175
Now that the experiment
outcomes are ruined

240
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,175
and the investment
funds are also in vain,

241
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,934
you owe everyone an explanation.

242
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:38,015
About this incident,

243
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,055
I will explain to the directors

244
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,775
as soon as possible.

245
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:42,974
Explain?

246
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,055
Hasn't the suspect already been caught?

247
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:46,574
Chai Xiaoqi.

248
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:47,814
I forgot.

249
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:51,214
Chai Xiaoqi is Mr. Fang's girlfriend.

250
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,454
The security guard said

251
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,535
he was going to question Chai Xiaoqi,

252
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,454
but he was stopped by Mr. Fang.

253
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:57,694
Really?

254
00:13:57,974 --> 00:13:58,814
Mr. Fang,

255
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,495
by doing so,

256
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,214
you are mixing personal
matters with work.

257
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,655
That's not how you should act.

258
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,214
Directors,

259
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:07,574
I want to clarify with you.

260
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:09,295
All monitoring equipment on site

261
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,255
was damaged.

262
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,375
However, an employee tag was left behind

263
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,574
right at the entrance.

264
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:16,135
It's obvious

265
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,535
Chai Xiaoqi was framed.

266
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,094
However, I didn't expect
someone as smart as you

267
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:23,734
to not be able to tell.

268
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,775
The board only looks
at evidence and results.

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,934
If you can't give everyone one

270
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,535
a satisfying explanation

271
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:33,775
within three days,

272
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,135
the losses our company
has suffered this time

273
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:38,694
is enough to make you resign.

274
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,655
Jiang Shiyi is a candidate
for the chief.

275
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:47,055
His superpower level is above ours.

276
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,015
Could he have stolen it?

277
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,015
If he really stole it,

278
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,295
he wouldn't have to wait
until the truth was revealed.

279
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,655
He could summon the spaceship
and leave with us away right now.

280
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,255
You're right.

281
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:59,094
However, that's fine.

282
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:02,415
This way, we can stay
on earth for a while longer.

283
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:03,854
That's a good thing.

284
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,015
Xiaoqi,

285
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,934
you can't bear to leave
Fang Leng behind, right?

286
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,614
What are you thinking? How can it be?

287
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:14,295
I will never break
the rules of our home planet,

288
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:14,974
okay?

289
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:26,655
Come in.

290
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:30,655
Mr. Fang,

291
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,895
no sign of break-in is found.

292
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:36,015
Hormone Element' thief

293
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,814
should be an employee of our company.

294
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,055
Impossible.

295
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,214
Fang Leng.

296
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,135
Is he home?

297
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,734
He's not back yet.

298
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
(Mashed Taro: Hugs.)

299
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,660
(Han: Love you.)

300
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,454
Mr. Fang,

301
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,175
this emoji is cuter.

302
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:31,895
Xiaobu.

303
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,900
(Milk Green Tea: Love you.)

304
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,900
(Fang Lie: Xiaobu, I found a cool
science fair. Do you want to go?)

305
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:39,934
(I don't want.)

306
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,340
(Xiaobu: I don't want.)

307
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,580
(Fang Lie: I found a nice
Southeast Asia restaurant for dinner.)

308
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,214
Come on, you should meet him.

309
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,214
(I'm not hungry.)

310
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,500
(Fang Lie: I got questions for painting.
Can you come find me tomorrow?)

311
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,734
(I'm not free.)

312
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,374
Chai and I will be at the shop tomorrow.

313
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,654
You can take time off.

314
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:14,854
She ignored me when
we were in the forest.

315
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:17,295
People say travelling together

316
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:19,215
is the biggest test between couples.

317
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,094
Did I fail?

318
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,055
You know what?

319
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,495
Whenever I see Fang Lie recently,

320
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:28,295
the probability of me
becoming a turtle is 99%.

321
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,334
99%?

322
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:32,215
I can't see him anymore.

323
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,654
I will bring you to
Jiang Shiyi tomorrow.

324
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,094
We'll ask him to fix your system.

325
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:39,535
Everyone knows

326
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,975
I'm Level 3 antivirus firewall
of Cape Town Planet.

327
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,215
Why can't I resist the earth's virus?

328
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:45,094
I...

329
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:48,455
All right.

330
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:49,854
- I'm so mad.
- It's okay.

331
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:57,334
Isn't this not working anymore?

332
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:58,814
Why are you still wearing it?

333
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,374
Maybe I'm used to wearing it all
the time. So, I didn't take it off.

334
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,134
Besides, it has storage function, right?

335
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,295
Someday, it will come in handy.

336
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,975
Sapphire can store physical substances

337
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,695
from gravels

338
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:13,255
to daily necessities.

339
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:14,334
That's right.

340
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:16,535
It can also store abstract information,

341
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,935
for example, memory.

342
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:20,975
Memory?

343
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,174
Can it also store memory?

344
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:25,854
Is she someone you can scare?

345
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,134
Hormone Element is also
the fruits of Xiaoqi's labour.

346
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,455
However, during this time,

347
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:30,174
I don't want you

348
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:31,695
to doubt your own colleagues,

349
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,215
especially those whom you call comrades.

350
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,495
You know what?

351
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:41,455
Fang Leng looked so handsome today

352
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,015
while protecting me.

353
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:48,094
I wish it could be stored.

354
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,735
He's so handsome.

355
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:11,975
If you refuse to admit it,

356
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,455
it leaves me with no choice but
to hand you over to the police.

357
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,935
What are you doing?

358
00:19:15,574 --> 00:19:16,975
I told you not to call the police.

359
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:18,015
Whose idea was it?

360
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:28,735
What's the matter? Why don't we get
her to cooperate with the investigation?

361
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,055
Let's ask Chai Xiaoqi
to hand over the bag.

362
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,495
I told you not to touch her!

363
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,255
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

364
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,574
You stole the sapphire.

365
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:58,654
If you asked me,

366
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,894
the answer to this whole thing

367
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,894
is very obvious,

368
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,654
yet you insist on doing
it the difficult way.

369
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:09,614
Rest assured.

370
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,935
We hired a professional team.

371
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,374
We'll be able to find clues for sure.

372
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:15,735
Mr. Fang,

373
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:17,334
no new evidence is found.

374
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:17,975
However...

375
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:18,654
Wait...

376
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,975
The crime scene was seriously damaged.

377
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,455
How come no evidence is found?

378
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,215
I'll look for it.

379
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:25,614
Don't worry.

380
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,055
If this professional team is unreliable,

381
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:29,574
just get another one.

382
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,654
However, I have to remind you.

383
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:33,414
The company won't let you reimburse

384
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,735
this kind of fruitless expenses.

385
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:37,775
I'll get back to work first.

386
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,094
The company won't let you reimburse it.

387
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:50,495
No sign of damage to the door.

388
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,015
Surveillance was destroyed.

389
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:58,255
It happened when the security
guards were switching shifts.

390
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,015
Who did it?

391
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:11,414
Sister,

392
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,134
you didn't see

393
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:16,134
how cool I was two nights ago

394
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,255
in a punk leather jacket
with sunglasses.

395
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,134
All right.

396
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,255
Let's go.

397
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:44,654
The actions were smooth

398
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,015
and everything was done in a flash.

399
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:48,455
Too bad,

400
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,374
my subordinate

401
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,935
broke Hormone Element.

402
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,374
It's too bad.

403
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,740
(Scientific research department)

404
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,495
Keep your voice down.

405
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,975
Boss, I got it.

406
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,174
You...

407
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,455
Move.

408
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:23,334
It's my own shadow.

409
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
(Chai Xiaoqi)

410
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:33,134
This is a good time
to replace Fang Leng.

411
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,055
Don't make any mistake.

412
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:36,174
Okay.

413
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:36,894
Sister,

414
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:39,495
did you find anything from
your investigation in overseas?

415
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:41,495
Fang Leng is too cautious.

416
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:43,334
Even private detectives

417
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:45,295
can't find his medical records.

418
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:46,854
Don't worry.

419
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:48,094
This crisis alone

420
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:49,455
is more than enough for him to handle.

421
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:51,455
Take care.

422
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,094
Thanks.

423
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
(Milk Green Tea: The investigation has
no progress. Can we have dinner later?)

424
00:22:57,935 --> 00:22:58,814
No problem.

425
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,940
(Milk Green Tea: Asking for comfort.)

426
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,020
(Fang Lie: Xiaobu, can I look for you
at the milk tea shop?)

427
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:19,814
(I'm not around.)

428
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,260
(What are the signs when
my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore?)

429
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,700
(Lies, annoyed, keeping secrets)

430
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,860
(Lies, avoiding you, no truth)

431
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:43,540
(No reply, reasons, no concern)

432
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:54,215
(You can't see me.)

433
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:54,975
Xiaobu.

434
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,574
Didn't you say you weren't in the shop?

435
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:03,574
What?

436
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:05,334
You must have got it wrong.

437
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:10,140
(Number one, lied to me boldly.)

438
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:13,215
Xiaobu,

439
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,574
why are your text for me

440
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:17,535
so short recently?

441
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,174
I'm busy in the shop.

442
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,040
(Number two, didn't look at me
and felt annoyed.)

443
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,935
(Why is he still here?)

444
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,535
(He isn't asking me to
go on another date, is he?)

445
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:29,414
Xiaobu,

446
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:30,414
let's go on a date

447
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:31,535
when you get off from work later.

448
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,055
No, I have things to do.

449
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:33,894
What kind of things?

450
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,414
You wouldn't know.

451
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,460
(Number three, kept secrets
and told me nothing.)

452
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:45,935
Xiaobu,

453
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:53,174
you aren't in love with
someone else, are you?

454
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:20,094
All right, stop hiding. He's gone.

455
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:24,814
Why are you avoiding

456
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,455
your own boyfriend?

457
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,334
As soon as Fang Lie comes, you run away.

458
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,654
Chai, you wouldn't know.

459
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,935
Every time I see Fang Lie,

460
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:34,055
my cheeks get hot and
my heart beats faster.

461
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,015
It feels so uncomfortable.

462
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,495
Silly girl.

463
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,695
That's what love feels like.

464
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,894
Your cheeks get hot because of shyness.

465
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:47,055
Your heartbeats become faster
because you're in love.

466
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,455
When you're truly in love with him,

467
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,094
you can't help

468
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:53,574
but think about him all day.

469
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:55,775
I am going out.

470
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:58,614
Where are you going?

471
00:25:58,614 --> 00:25:59,935
Fang Leng is driving.
He's picking me up.

472
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,255
We're going on a date.

473
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:03,695
He's here.

474
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,295
I'm leaving.

475
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:05,374
- Bye.
- Bye.

476
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:06,455
Don't come back so soon.

477
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:07,295
I will.

478
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:08,695
That's the way.

479
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:09,695
Couples in love

480
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,015
should see each other everyday

481
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:12,295
and be unashamed about it.

482
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:14,735
Hi, dear.

483
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,894
Honey.

484
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:19,374
You're here to surprise me again.

485
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,894
You're so bad.

486
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:27,055
(Earthlings blush and have faster
heartbeats when they're in love.)

487
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,535
(Xiaoqi and Fang Leng are
dating for the sake of the mission.)

488
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,935
(I'm just a robot,)

489
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,814
(which means I have
nothing to do with love.)

490
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:41,535
(Besides, I'm going home.)

491
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:50,814
It's delicious.

492
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:01,614
Thanks.

493
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:03,854
We'll share it together.

494
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,574
You were misunderstood
by so many people,

495
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,374
yet you're still enjoying the food.

496
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,174
My happiness is simple.

497
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,574
As long as I get to eat
delicious fried chicken

498
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:20,854
and look at the stars
in the sky, I'm happy.

499
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:23,295
Everyone thinks it's you.

500
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:25,854
Aren't you worried at all?

501
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,935
What's the point of worrying?

502
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:31,015
It's their business if
they misunderstand me.

503
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:32,814
Why must I punish myself and be unhappy

504
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,334
because of other people's mistake?

505
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:35,055
Am I right?

506
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:38,414
I'm glad that you think that way.

507
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,495
I thought you would be sad.

508
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,055
Nevermind.

509
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:45,814
Others can think whatever they want,

510
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,614
as long as you believe me.

511
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:49,495
I don't care about others.

512
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,695
The board meeting is tomorrow.

513
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:56,535
So far, there's no clue.

514
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:06,735
Give me a hug.

515
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:10,455
Give me a hug.

516
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:11,975
I don't feel like hugging.

517
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:13,094
A heart.

518
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:13,775
I'm happy.

519
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,574
Give me a hug.

520
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:15,455
A hug.

521
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,134
Are you still upset?

522
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,374
A little.

523
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,174
Cheer up.

524
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,854
Give me a signature
mashed taro kissing...

525
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:47,814
Mashed taro kissing milk tea.

526
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:48,614
Here's a kiss.

527
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:50,495
Are you happy now?

528
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:52,695
Yes.

529
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,980
(Surveillance floor plan)

530
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,414
Mr. Fang, you've been
looking at it all night.

531
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,134
Why don't you take a break?

532
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,660
(Meeting room)

533
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:40,735
Mr. Fang,

534
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,614
the three-day deadline is up.

535
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:44,255
What are your findings?

536
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,334
Take a look at the person in the video.

537
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:57,735
What's going on?

538
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,215
Mr. Wang, sorry.

539
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,574
Take a seat.

540
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:03,055
Sorry.

541
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:04,894
Sorry.

542
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:06,334
Sorry. Take a seat.

543
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,334
Sorry.

544
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,094
Sorry.

545
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:15,654
Uncle Kang.

546
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:16,854
What's this all about?

547
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:22,735
Mr. Fang,

548
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,055
we all know that

549
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,455
surveillance camera in R&D
department was destroyed.

550
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:28,775
Did you make a fake video

551
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:30,614
to slander me?

552
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:31,654
Mr. Kang, I didn't expect that

553
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:34,055
after working in the
group for so long,

554
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,654
you didn't know

555
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,775
the group has more than one
surveillance cameras installed.

556
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:40,414
Of course you can always deny it,

557
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:43,295
but I'm going to hand this
evidence directly to the police,

558
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,094
for them

559
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,414
to verify it.

560
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:49,495
Mr. Kang,

561
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,374
do you have anything else to say?

562
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:53,174
Yes!

563
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,174
Mr. Fang,

564
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:03,255
didn't you say that

565
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:04,495
you wanted an internal investigation?

566
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,814
Why do you suddenly
want to involve the police?

567
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:09,735
As the group's president,

568
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:12,255
the decision should be
made in the company's favour.

569
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:15,695
If this is known by the public,

570
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:20,215
it might affect our corporate image.

571
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:23,975
That's true.

572
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,854
As you said,

573
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:28,055
we'll make the decision in
the interests of the company.

574
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:30,055
You will be solely responsible

575
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,574
for the loss incurred by this event.

576
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:32,814
In addition,

577
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:34,695
you'll be given a three-month
observation period.

578
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,535
If dereliction of duty occurs again,

579
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,935
you will be suspended from
all duties within the group.

580
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:44,735
Mr. Fang is considered very kind.

581
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:45,894
One more thing.

582
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:54,134
Ms. Chai.

583
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:01,055
I need you to apologise to my staff.

584
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,695
- He does owe her an apology.
- I...

585
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:12,055
Ms. Chai,

586
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:14,015
it's all my fault. I shouldn't
have done that.

587
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,134
Please forgive me.

588
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,334
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,574
It's okay, I should thank you.

590
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:25,775
(Otherwise, I would
have left earth already.)

591
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:28,094
Thanks to your action,

592
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,975
I'm so happy.

593
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:30,894
Thanks.

594
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:38,775
However, there's something
I don't understand.

595
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,295
Didn't you tell me yesterday
that there was no evidence?

596
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,374
How did you turn the tables suddenly?

597
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:46,695
So far,

598
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:48,055
we've had three system upgrades.

599
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:50,334
However, two out of the three
systems were not dismantled.

600
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,735
These cameras are completely untouched.

601
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,614
Uncle Kang must have thought

602
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:58,215
only the latest cameras

603
00:32:58,215 --> 00:32:59,174
were in use.

604
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:00,255
However, he forgot that

605
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:01,775
we still had the old cameras

606
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:02,814
that were still working.

607
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:04,374
You're so smart.

608
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:07,775
You're so smart.

609
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:10,374
It doesn't matter. I'm glad
that the problem is solved.

610
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:12,134
That way, you'll stop frowning.

611
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:14,174
The equipment in R&D department
has been repaired.

612
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,094
Our project can start again.

613
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,735
Also, the hormones perfume

614
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,374
is officially back on track.

615
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:23,015
Are you excited?

616
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:24,574
Yes.

617
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,700
(Sunny Apartment)

618
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,060
(Hard to tell. No evidence.
Leave it alone first.)

619
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:46,535
Thank you.

620
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:47,854
Xiaoqi,

621
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,055
are you okay?

622
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:50,015
Yes.

623
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:52,574
Something unexpected came up
halfway through the mission.

624
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,654
It's not your fault.

625
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:54,735
No need to blame yourself for it.

626
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,334
Once the project is restarted,

627
00:33:57,414 --> 00:33:59,055
Hormone Element will
be developed in no time.

628
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,775
The scanning is completed.

629
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:04,695
Master,

630
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,574
AI assistant, Kubri's system,

631
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:07,894
is perfectly fine.

632
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:09,535
Everything is working normally.

633
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:10,975
How is that possible?

634
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,094
I never suddenly turned into a turtle

635
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,815
back in home planet.

636
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,815
It may also be a new type
of virus found on earth.

637
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,015
Candy is unable to
detect it temporarily.

638
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:18,174
(Okay.)

639
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:19,574
What to do then?

640
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:20,975
If that's the case,

641
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,734
I guess she needs to
undergo a factory reset.

642
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:24,174
It's okay.

643
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:25,495
Hang in there.

644
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:26,614
We'll go home together

645
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:27,734
when the mission is completed.

646
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:31,855
Xiaoqi,

647
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,015
this is the second time to
develop Hormone Element.

648
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:35,535
It should be faster
than the first time, right?

649
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:56,574
Hello.

650
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,174
An express delivery?

651
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,100
(Soonest Express)

652
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,535
Hi, I'm here to pick up my parcel.

653
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,055
Is it Ms. Xiaobu?

654
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:25,855
Xiaobu,

655
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,815
I just want to have
a good talk with you.

656
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:29,335
I came up with this idea.

657
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,815
I have nothing to tell you.

658
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:32,535
I just don't want to see you.

659
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,654
We're a couple.

660
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:36,015
Even if you are angry
and don't want to see me,

661
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,335
you should at least give me a reason.

662
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:41,495
(Fang Lie, if I tell you that)

663
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:43,455
(I'll turn into a little
turtle when I see you,)

664
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:44,815
(would you believe me?)

665
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,055
Xiaobu,

666
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:02,094
If you say you don't like me anymore,

667
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,855
I will never look for you again.

668
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:18,094
(Fang Lie, you misunderstood.)

669
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:18,975
(I really...)

670
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,335
(You misunderstood.)

671
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,580
(Alert, system temperature is too high,
turning into tortoise mode soon)

672
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:34,734
Xiaobu.

673
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,895
(What's the program?

674
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:08,294
(I don't think I've ever downloaded it.)

675
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:10,094
Mr. Fang,

676
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,174
the equipment maintenance
is going smoothly.

677
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:13,214
Our project can start

678
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:14,254
in about three days.

679
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:15,455
Three days?

680
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:17,895
I know you're anxious.

681
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:19,055
Don't worry.

682
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:21,774
Why don't you send a few people
from the technical department

683
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:22,734
to come over and help out?

684
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:24,375
Make it within two days.

685
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:25,975
No, it's fine.

686
00:37:26,214 --> 00:37:28,134
It's okay, just take your time.

687
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,015
It's better to ensure
the quality of work.

688
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:32,935
The PR department can start planning

689
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,895
the theme of hormone perfume
press conference.

690
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:35,614
Okay.

691
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:36,895
It's tentatively scheduled in two weeks.

692
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:37,495
Okay.

693
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:38,654
Sales department,

694
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:40,335
I hope you can have a meeting soon

695
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:41,694
and report to me.

696
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:42,694
Okay, Mr. Fang.

697
00:37:58,895 --> 00:37:59,774
What's wrong?

698
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,614
Last time, we ate fried chicken
and looked at the stars.

699
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:05,895
You said you were very happy.

700
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:08,294
Why are you in low spirits today?

701
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:10,855
I'm not.

702
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:12,734
You're mistaken.

703
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:14,734
It's because of the spiciness.

704
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,134
It's too spicy.

705
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:19,015
Too spicy?

706
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,254
There's water in the trunk.

707
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,094
You can take it.

708
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:23,094
Do you want some?

709
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:24,015
Sure.

710
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,174
Then I'll take it.

711
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:26,895
Wait for me.

712
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,540
(Trailer is here)

713
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,980
(Trailer)

714
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,614
When this project is over,

715
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,134
I'll take you around the world

716
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,174
to eat fried chicken
from all over the world.

717
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:31,734
Okay.

718
00:39:33,535 --> 00:39:34,294
Xiaoqi,

719
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,375
let me ask you.

720
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,855
You are now considered
the first occupant

721
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,975
of our planet to fall in
love with an earthling

722
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:42,254
and you've violated legal prohibition.

723
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:43,855
Aren't you scared?

724
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,375
Actually, I'm a little scared.

725
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,174
However, when I think about

726
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,335
Fang Leng being by my side,

727
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:58,455
in fact,

728
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,055
all the fear is gone.

729
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,895
What does liking someone feel like?

730
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:08,895
Do you love me, Xiaoqi?

731
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:10,614
I love you so much.

732
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:16,055
When you love someone,

733
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:18,654
your heartbeat will accelerate.

734
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:20,855
Your face will feel hot

735
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,654
and you'll blush.

736
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,134
Your scalp will tingle.

737
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:27,415
Love

738
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:29,734
is the only reason for
two people to be together.
