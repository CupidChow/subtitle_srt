=My Girlfriend is an Alien S2=

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,721
(Previously)
When this project is over,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
I'll take you on a trip
around the world.

20
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,801
I'm about to leave,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,721
yet Fang Leng is
planning a future with me.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,721
Will they forget us

23
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,241
if we leave like this?

24
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,681
Of course.

25
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,280
The important person

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,681
comes first in every situation.

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,840
I really can't bear

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,521
to lose the most important
person in my life again.

29
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,441
You've carried so much
on your shoulders alone.

30
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,961
I am your father.

31
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,441
If I don't look after you,

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,081
who else will?

33
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,360
A mentally ill person

34
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,480
is not qualified to be
the CEO of Future Group.

35
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,041
Who says he is not qualified?

36
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,121
Xiaoqi.

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,561
You are the first among us

38
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,520
to fall in love with an Earthling.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
Are you not afraid?

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
When I think of Fang Leng by my side,

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
all my fears are gone.

42
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:25,080
You're giving up all the privileges
of being an advanced being

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,881
for an uncertain person like Fang Leng.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,161
Love is

45
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,480
the only condition
for two people to be together.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,881
You probably haven't loved before.

47
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,240
So you don't know
what it's like to be with

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,760
the person you love.

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,800
=Episode 25=

50
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,080
Master, what's the matter?

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,920
Xiaoqi has been gone for so long.

52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,041
Why isn't she back yet?

53
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,881
Sorry for the long wait.

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,800
Your candy is so hard to get.

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,520
I had to go to several stores

56
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,121
to find it.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
Try it. Is it the same?

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,680
Thank you.

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,441
No problem.

60
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:52,041
I still don't like the sweet taste.

61
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,161
However,

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,760
it doesn't taste so bad
once I get used to it.

63
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,161
Xiaoqi, you know what?

64
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,121
These present scenes

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
are almost exactly like

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,041
the life I used to fantasise about.

67
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,520
After I found out

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,961
you were my genetic match,

69
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,721
I often imagined

70
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,120
what it would be like

71
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,440
to live with you.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,560
We would chat,

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,920
take a walk together

74
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,920
or I would give you

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
my favourite candy.

76
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
You wouldn't have to do anything

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,880
but be there for me.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Unfortunately,

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,961
we are on Earth

80
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,201
and not in Cape Town.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,480
Is it starting to hurt again?

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,201
Don't worry.

83
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,560
We can go home soon.

84
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,880
Your condition should be

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
much better when we get home.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
You're cold.

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,601
I'll get you a blanket.

88
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,081
What brings you here?

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,161
How come it's you?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,721
Where is Xiaoqi?

91
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:28,920
Who's there?

92
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,000
Nothing. It's just a rubbish collector.

93
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:34,880
It's me, Xiaoqi.

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,081
I'm here to deliver your luggage.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,401
It's windy here.

96
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,841
Don't stand here.

97
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,041
Come on in.

98
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,201
Thank you for the luggage.

99
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:52,440
Xiaoqi.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
I know you no longer
have feelings for me,

101
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,000
but I'll try my best

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,841
to make you fall in love with me again.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,641
Don't be ridiculous.

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,041
Jiang Shiyi and I are a genetic match.

105
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,401
There is no chance for us.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,041
Wait.

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,360
- This is your favourite lavender.
- Sorry.

108
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:12,161
Xiaoqi.

109
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:13,961
Xiaoqi.

110
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
Xiaoqi, this is your favourite...

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
lavender.

112
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:20,841
I won't give up easily.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Genetic match?

114
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,401
Although relationships are
forbidden on Cape Town,

115
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,601
the inhabitants of Cape Town

116
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,841
are genetically matched in pairs

117
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,680
in order to produce
the best possible offspring.

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,800
The two inhabitants
with the best results

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,401
are genetically matched

120
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,641
to produce the best children

121
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,240
by high-tech means.

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,480
Isn't this what is called
asexual reproduction?

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,000
By eliminating
the unnecessary emotional part,

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,081
the technological level

125
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,880
can be significantly improved.

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,761
In this case...

127
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:56,761
Brother, aren't you the third wheel?

128
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't be ridiculous.

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Brother, I mean

130
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,360
you can't just give up like that.

131
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
There's a meeting with
Marketing Department in the morning

132
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
and a meeting with
the investor in the afternoon.

133
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,281
- And...
- You don't have to work so hard.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,601
Okay.

135
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:17,880
Xiaoqi.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,401
I asked you to be my assistant

137
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,041
because I want to protect you closely.

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
I don't want Fang Leng
to bother you again.

139
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,560

You... What is all this?

154
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:34,800
Do you remember this outfit?

155
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,440
You used to come to me wearing it.

156
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Are you cosplaying?

157
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,320
You remember.

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,680
Are you mentally unwell

because you've had
an accident in the past?

161
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,960
You remember everything, Xiaoqi.

162
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,481
- I...
- I did have a car accident.

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,361
Fang Leng.

164
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:15,281
If you continue to harass Xiaoqi,

165
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll make you regret it.

166
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:22,121
Let's go.

167
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:25,481
Xiaoqi.

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,041
Do you really not remember?

169
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,161
We can't use superpowers on Earthlings.

170
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
Candy mentioned

171
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,320
that you haven't recovered yet.

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,001
Using your powers

173
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,960
will drain your energy.

174
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:47,600
Okay.

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,840
I'll listen to you.

176
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,121
I will win you back, Xiaoqi.

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,920
Both failed.

178
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,481
It seems that after the brainwashing,

179
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,121
it's impossible to recall Xiaoqi

180
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:17,161
with memories.

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,401
Brother.

182
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,800
Think about it.

183
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,080
Is there anything about you

184
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,200
that Xiaoqi can't resist?

185
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:29,830
(Sunny Apartment)

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,641
Shiyi.

187
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,761
Don't you drive to work today?

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,560
I parked in a ground-level space.

189
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
That way we won't meet Fang Leng.

190
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,041
I'll get the car.

191
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:37,920
Wait for me here.

192
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,521
Okay.

193
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,481
What a coincidence.

194
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,481
Do you smell hormones?

195
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,680
Take a good whiff.

196
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,121
Do you smell it?

197
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,440
No.

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
Stay away from me, please.

199
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,641
What are you doing?

200
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,960
What about this?

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,560
Feel it.

202
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,080
Do you feel anything?

203
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,680
I made it clear to you

204
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,080
last time at the company.

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
Please don't bother me anymore.

206
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,481
Do you think I'll fall in love with you

207
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,960
and grow attached to you

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,001
if you show up every day?

209
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,641
Don't waste any more of our time.

210
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:29,440
What are you laughing at?

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
I've said the same thing before.

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,720
I used to be just like you are now.

213
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,440
No matter how hard I tried
to draw a clear line between us

214
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
and tell you that

215
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,001
we were not going to work out,

216
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,560
you still persisted in trying

217
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,761
to take advantage of me

218
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,080
and bothering me in every way possible.

219
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,600
At first, I thought

220
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,041
you wouldn't make it,

221
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,840
but it turns out

222
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,041
you did it.

223
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,041
So if you think I'm annoying now,

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm just following your example.

225
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,481
I'll give you another chance.

226
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,481
Do you smell it?

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
You smell

228
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,041
like hormones.

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,121
And so does Shiyi.

230
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,680
His smell is stronger than yours.

231
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Fang Leng.

232
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,161
You should already know

233
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,560
that I can't simply use my powers

234
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,440
on Earthlings now,

235
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,121
but if you insist,

236
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:34,960
I...

237
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,361
Get in the car.

238
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
What? Jiang Shiyi used
the hormone element?

239
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,161
That's why

240
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,281
he couldn't take Xiaoqi away.

241
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,161
He needs a new hormone element

242
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:15,881
or he won't be able
to complete the mission.

243
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,800
The unauthorised use
of banned substances

244
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,001
is a major offence.

245
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,521
Jiang Shiyi must wait until

246
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,080
the hormones in his body
have completely broken down

247
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
before he can go back.

248
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:25,161
We now have more time

249
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,281
to delay his mission.

250
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:33,440
Han.

251
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,521
Help me with one thing.

252
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,560
Thanks.

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,001
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

254
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes.

255
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,200
I was referring to

256
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,521
the star.

257
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,720
Take it easy, Xiaoqi.

258
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:16,080
Okay.

259
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:19,200
Xiaoqi.

260
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:21,840
Do you know

261
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,920
that every newborn child

262
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,161
on the Cape Town

263
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,641
is given a corresponding number?

264
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,401
The mother planet will name these stars

265
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,361
according to that number.

266
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
This one is you.

267
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,960
How about yours?

268
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:42,641
It should be nearby.

269
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
Two genetically matched planets

270
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,440
can't be too far apart.

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Let me see.

272
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,200
Didn't you say they
are next to each other?

273
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,361
I found it.

274
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,560
Look.

275
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
One light year?

276
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
They're too far away.

277
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,320
It doesn't really matter.

278
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,161
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl
are 16 light years apart,

279
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:32,720
but they can still be together forever.

280
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,800
You have a point.

281
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,920
The rules of the home planet
are not wrong either.

282
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,720
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Fang of
Future's Group has arrived.

283
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,121
Why is he here?

284
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,881
Mr. Fang said

285
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,881
he wanted to liaise
directly with Ms. Chai.

286
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,281
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

287
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,200
Go about your work.

288
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,041
What brings you here in person?

289
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,600
In terms of work,

290
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,881
you can ask your assistants
to coordinate it.

291
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,401
Mr. Fang.

292
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:25,481
I personally drew up a contract

293
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:26,800
for the termination of cooperation.

294
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,840
It is definitely
in line with interstellar law.

295
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,401
We don't need to see each other again.

296
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:31,960
If you cancel your contract with me,

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,361
don't you fear you'll never get

298
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:34,401
the hormone element?

299
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,080
The other day, I was
alerted that a hacker

300
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,481
had penetrated our
research department's security system.

301
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,600
You asked Candy to do that, didn't you?

302
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:45,800
You can tell Candy

303
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,121
not to waste any more time.

304
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,920
I've already transferred
all the hormones.

305
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,241
Mr. Fang.

306
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,680
I think you are overthinking it.

307
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
I'm not interested

308
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,001
in your hormones at all.

309
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,001
Really?

310
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,080
Then why did I hear Xiaoqi say

311
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
you smell like me?

312
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
You didn't use

313
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,400
the only hormone you had

314
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,481
to enchant Xiaoqi, did you?

315
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,840
Xiaobu explained to me.

316
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,001
Hormones are banned

317
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,120
because your planet forbids emotions

318
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,201
and they can be

319
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,360
harmful to your body.

320
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,800
That's why you get so angry

321
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,880
every time I approach Xiaoqi.

322
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
You can't use your powers.

323
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
You can only restrain yourself.

324
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,521
Mr. Fang.

325
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,241
You are so imaginative.

326
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,681
You should write a novel

327
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,041
instead of being a nuisance.

328
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,921
Calm down.

329
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
I can tell you where the hormones are.

330
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,400
Mr. Fang.

331
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
Do you still need the hormones?

332
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,921
If yes,

333
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,721
let Xiaoqi return to Future group

334
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,721
to develop it again.

335
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:42,721
No way.

336
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,080
Think it over.

337
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,761
See you.

338
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:04,640
Mr. Fang, so Mr. Jiang is the reason why

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,001
Ms. Chai hasn't come to work these days.

340
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,041
What is their relationship?

341
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,961
What's been going on?

342
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,961
What do you think?

343
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Well,

344
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,521
I am concerned about Ms. Chai

345
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,281
on behalf of our colleagues.

346
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,041
Go back and tidy up Xiaoqi's desk.

347
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,560
She should be back soon.

348
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
Yes, sir.

349
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:31,823
(The female lead is coming back.
How will Leng-qi Couple's story go?)

350
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,600
Are you coming?

351
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes, Mr. Fang.

352
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,800
Candy.

353
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
Yes, master.

354
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:46,880
What will happen

355
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,360
if I abandon the mission

356
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
and take Xiaoqi back

357
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:53,481
to the home planet?

358
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,560
Master.

359
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
If you complete this mission,

360
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,961
the chief will appoint you
as his successor

361
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,681
and Xiaoqi will be able

362
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,880
to redeem herself.

363
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,160
So

364
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,001
why should you

365
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,761
choose to give up?

366
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
In Xiaoqi's current state,

367
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,721
she can't possibly be compelled again.

368
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,080
Okay.

369
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Call Xiaoqi in.

370
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,160
Are you telling me to
go to Fang Leng tomorrow?

371
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,281
The chief takes this mission
very seriously.

372
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,761
We can't waste any more time.

373
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,481
Okay, I get it.

374
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:36,840
I will keep you informed

375
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,241
if anything comes up.

376
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,880
Xiaoqi.

377
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,921
If you were in any danger,

378
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,961
I'd be there in a heartbeat.

379
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:48,400
Okay.

380
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:50,921
If there's nothing else,

381
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll excuse myself.

382
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:59,281
Master, don't worry.

383
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,921
You made the right choice.

384
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,761
I hope so.

385
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,055
(Xiaoqi)

386
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,600
Hello.

387
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,281
I will go to your company tomorrow.

388
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:20,840
Okay.

389
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,241
Brother, we made it!

390
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:32,681
Xiaoqi is finally coming back.

391
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,201
Don't worry, Fang Leng.

392
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,681
With such thorough planning,

393
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,880
everything will be fine.

394
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:46,212
(Second phase of chasing my wife
Deep affection)

395
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:53,721
Xiaoqi.

396
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,001
Your mission in Future group this time

397
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,360
is to cooperate with
Fang Leng's experiment

398
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,640
and get the hormone as soon as possible.

399
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,320
When you are there,

400
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,001
Fang Leng will take this
opportunity to confuse you.

401
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,120
So you must be alert.

402
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:12,241
Don't fall for his tricks.

403
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,721
Also, Earthlings

404
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,880
are fickle and sceptical creatures.

405
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,160
You have left

406
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,041
a while ago

407
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,080
and now you're suddenly

408
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,201
back from The One.

409
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:23,640
They must be suspicious of you.

410
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,721
They appear to be your friends,

411
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
but in reality, they are your enemies.

412
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,681
So you have to be mentally prepared.

413
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:32,640
Be prepared for their distrust

414
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,120
and suspicion.

415
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,281
Okay, no problem.

416
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,160
I bought one randomly.

417
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,761
Are you going out?

418
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:48,521
I think there's something
wrong with the picture.

419
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:49,241
What are you having?

420
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:50,600
Okay, I'm on it.

421
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,721
It is questionable.

422
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:52,721
Drink some.

423
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,080
(Shiyi is right.)

424
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,041
(Earthlings are fickle indeed.)

425
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,880
(Welcome back.)

426
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,080
Welcome back, Ms. Chai.

427
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,160
Welcome back.

428
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,120
Ms. Chai.

429
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,001
(Welcome back, our female lead)
You are finally back.

430
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,481
We're used to you

431
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,241
turning up at work every day
full of energy,

432
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,041
cheering us on at work.

433
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,681
Yes, we're glad that you're back.

434
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,521
Although you were only gone for a week,

435
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,761
it was like years for us.

436
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,880
It was too torturous.

437
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,600
Yes, we miss you.

438
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,320
Yes.

439
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,721
Aren't you even curious

440
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,120
as to why I went to The One?

441
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,281
It goes without saying.

442
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,560
It must be because Jiang Shiyi
was jealous of Mr. Fang

443
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,880
and snatched you away.

444
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,041
Ms. Chai.

445
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,880
It must have been tough for you.

446
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,521
Now that you're back, just stay with us.

447
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:02,201
Yes, stay with us.

448
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,080
Please don't leave.

449
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,961
(It seems that Earthlings
are not that smart)

450
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,201
(and not very intelligent either.)

451
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,041
Where is Fang Leng?

452
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:13,360
Mr. Fang is now in
the Research Department.

453
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:16,539
(Scientific Research Department)

454
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,481
Proceed with that.

455
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:19,320
Okay, Mr. Fang. I'll work on it.

456
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,360
Give me the full report

457
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,160
of your experiment.

458
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:23,800
Fang Leng.

459
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,560
Hold on.

460
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,360
When can I start collecting hormones?

461
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,281
Pass it to me later.

462
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,041
Give me all the data reports

463
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,120
after the modulation.

464
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,481
Okay, Mr. Fang.

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
How is the running trend?

466
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,721
I think it runs fine.

467
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,400
I think we should slow it down a bit

468
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,640
to improve the whole.

469
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,640
These can be modified a little.

470
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:51,721
Then put this...

471
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:52,921
When will you be available?

472
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,840
I've done my research.

473
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,120
With enough hormones,

474
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,041
it only takes five hours to purify it.

475
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,721
So we'd better finish

476
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:03,880
the experiment in 24 hours.

477
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,241
Mr. Fang, here is
the information you requested.

478
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,840
Thanks.

479
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,961
I'm talking to you.

480
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,640
Sort these out

481
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,201
and submit it to my office.

482
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,120
Are you making me work?

483
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,041
Now that you're back,

484
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
you should do your part.

485
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,041
If you do well,

486
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,241
I'll think about

487
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,600
taking you to collect hormones.

488
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,001
Take a look at this.

489
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,120
Hello Kitty?

490
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,320
(Do Earthlings love
all these cute things?)

491
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Hello, Mr. Fang.

492
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,560
Fang Leng.

493
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,360
I have the information ready.

494
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,481
We can start the experiment.

495
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,281
Go and print me three copies of

496
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,281
the lab data report for the week.

497
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,080
Just in time.

498
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,921
I've made copies.

499
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,320
When will we start the experiment?

500
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,241
Thanks for your hard work.

501
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,160
Rework this month's

502
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
meeting report for me.

503
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,360
This is for you.

504
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,080
When will we start the experiment?

505
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,160
Remember to drink it.

506
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,560
When will you do the experiment?

507
00:27:58,441 --> 00:27:59,600
They already off work.

508
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,041
I'll take you home.

509
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,640
Home?

510
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:08,840
I haven't done anything

511
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,281
or collected any hormones today.

512
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,360
Do I go straight home like this?

513
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,921
The company has been too busy lately.

514
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,320
We'll discuss the experiment
when we are not so occupied.

515
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:20,441
I'm here to complete my mission,

516
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:21,961
not to work for you.

517
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,560
If you don't start
the experiment tomorrow,

518
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
I don't think we need to meet again.

519
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:46,419
(Sunny Apartment)

520
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:48,041
Brother.

521
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,560
Are you really going
to start experimenting?

522
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,120
It only takes two days to collect

523
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
and purify the hormones.

524
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:54,481
After two days,

525
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:55,600
Xiaoqi will get the hormones

526
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,921
and return straight to Cape Town.

527
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,600
Since there is no way to postpone it,

528
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,880
we have to think of another way.

529
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,721
In order to monitor the progress
of the experiment,

530
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,160
we have modified the machine.

531
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,640
You can view
the collector window at any time.

532
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,800
When the blue light is on,

533
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,080
it indicates the absence of hormones.

534
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,961
When the pink light is on,

535
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:22,921
the hormone level has reached

536
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,120
the standard for collection.

537
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,681
Just stay in the mood

538
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,241
and wait until the collector

539
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,041
shows 100%.

540
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:29,001
Let's begin.

541
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,761
Whether you're a human

542
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,761
or an alien,

543
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,481
I still love you.

544
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,281
Wait.

545
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,600
Let's stop for a while.

546
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,400
What's wrong?

547
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,001
I'll be right back.

548
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,160
Okay.

549
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,160
What happened?

550
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,120
Didn't the pink light just come on?

551
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,041
It might have malfunctioned.

552
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,360
Why doesn't it work?

553
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:36,882
(Fang Lie: So happy)

554
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,921
A high-tech machine is simply the best.

555
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,921
We have no way to
stop it from being secreted.

556
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,560
So we have to find a way
to stop it from emanating.

557
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:53,400
I remember that the laboratory

558
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:54,521
had imported a special product

559
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,521
to stop the perfume from evaporating.

560
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,721
Brother, do you mean...

561
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,160
This suit is making me suffocate

562
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,160
and uncomfortable.

563
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,600
Come in.

564
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:22,921
The reason for our unsuccessful

565
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,441
hormone collection this morning

566
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,201
must be the breakdown
and ageing of the machine.

567
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,761
Here.

568
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,921
I have made a plan

569
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,201
to improve the experimental procedures

570
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
and the performance of the machine

571
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,961
in the Research Department.

572
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,160
It should maximise

573
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,360
its value.

574
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,120
The technicians have already checked.

575
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:42,400
The equipment
in the Research Department

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,840
is now up to date

577
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,320
and has zero latent faults.

578
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,041
So why was it not working?

579
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,201
What is this?

580
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,360
Wait.

582
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll take you to
a nice place after work.

583
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:31,640
This place

584
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,281
is full of our memories.

585
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:40,320
I made a museum

586
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,320
specifically for us

587
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,360
with the diary you wrote.

588
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,079
(Our memory)

589
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,041
All the little bits and pieces in here

590
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,201
are from our love journey.

591
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,400
I write a diary

592
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,761
just to keep track of the mission.

593
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,281
Don't get me wrong.

594
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:33,107
(Fang Leng: Chai Xiaoqi, super crazy fan
Chai Xiaoqi: Fang Leng, cold-blooded)

595
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:34,908
(Chai Xiaoqi: How can I get
Fang Leng to love me?)

596
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,160
We had

597
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:39,881
a very bad first
impression of each other.

598
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,720
In the beginning,

599
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,120
I wouldn't have thought

600
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:45,401
that I would love you so much.

601
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,801
I just wanted to
finish the mission quickly.

602
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,280
I didn't think

603
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,240
I'd be stuck with you for so long.

604
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,140
(Fang Leng: Although Xiaoqi's
a trouble maker, she has many qualities)

605
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
(Chai Xiaoqi: Fang Leng's domineering,
but he seems lonely and fragile)

606
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:05,356
(Chai Xiaoqi: I can finally work
together with Fang Leng)

607
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:10,240
I realised how sincere, kind

608
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:13,600
and committed you are

609
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,841
when you were

610
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:16,921
doing the live stream at a gym.

611
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:36,285
(Fang Leng: Xiaoqi has agreed to be
my girlfriend in the jungle)

612
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:40,286
(Chai Xiaoqi: Taro milk is tasty)

613
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:57,005
(Chai Xiaoqi: I want to forget
about many things)

614
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,321
I don't think I wrote this.

615
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,521
This is our present.

616
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,640
You've wasted

617
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:17,240
too much energy and time on me

618
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,160
in the past.

619
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:20,600
From now on,

620
00:36:21,401 --> 00:36:22,441
I will do my best

621
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:24,600
and utmost

622
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,921
to prove that I am worthy of your love.

623
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:30,240
Is this your solution?

624
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,321
You said

625
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,881
I could collect hormones

626
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:42,361
if I allowed you to get close,

627
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,200
but what happened?

628
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:45,720
I can cooperate with the experiment,

629
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,521
but I don't want to waste time with you.

630
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,863
(Fang Leng: No matter what Xiaoqi has
been through, I'll get her back)

631
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:14,640
Seriously?

632
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,881
She should at least shed a few tears

633
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:18,680
given the atmosphere.

634
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:20,720
It's okay.

635
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,760
She'll remember.

636
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,160
Were you really not affected

637
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:33,361
when Fang Leng showed you the past?

638
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,921
Actually,

639
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,001
I...

640
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:47,041
Not only was I not impressed.

641
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,401
I even wanted to hit him.

642
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,801
If this is

643
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,760
our approach to hormones,

644
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,961
it's a little too slow.

645
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,120
Okay.

646
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:57,041
Thank you for today.

647
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,120
Rest early.

648
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,760
Okay.

649
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,801
Master.

650
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,041
Earthlings are so cunning.

651
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
If Fang Leng continues
to play such tricks,

652
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,640
when will we finish the mission?

653
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,640
As long as Xiaoqi
keeps up this attitude,

654
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,640
Fang Leng will soon give up.

655
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:25,945
(Fang Leng: Can we meet tomorrow?)

656
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,120
(Can we meet tomorrow?)

657
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
(We can meet if you want
to collect hormones,)

658
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,120
(but not if you want to waste time.)

659
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,436
(Sunny Apartment)

660
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,921
I made a museum

661
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,720
specifically for us

662
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,760
with the diary you wrote.

663
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,200
All the little bits and pieces in here

664
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,160
are from our love journey.

665
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:14,881
We'll take a photo every day

666
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:16,521
and put it here

667
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,680
so that everyone who comes to eat

668
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,120
can be our witnesses.

669
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,280
I am not just retrieving our memories,

670
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,801
I want to create more memories.

671
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,841
Strange.

672
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,680
How could I have such a dream?

673
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,760
Why are you still in such bad shape

674
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,041
after so many days of rest?

675
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,160
Xiaoqi, I'm fine.

676
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,160
In this state,

677
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
I'll be fine after a few
more days of rest.

678
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,521
Xiaoqi, I'm sorry.

679
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,240
I'm afraid I can't take you out

680
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,200
in my present state of health.

681
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,801
Take me out for what?

682
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,200
Don't you remember

683
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,481
what day it is?

684
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,560
Today is Xiaoqi's birthday?

685
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Xiaoqi's parents

686
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
were genetically matched

687
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,801
in Cape Town

688
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:28,921
and thus our most beautiful

689
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:30,961
and adorable Xiaoqi was born.

690
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,680
I used to

691
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
spend all her birthdays with her,

692
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,361
but I can't be with her today.

693
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,361
It's okay. I'm here.

694
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,321
Xiaobu.

695
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,801
How did Xiaoqi celebrate
her birthday in the past?

696
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,200
Xiaoqi likes starry sky.

697
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,321
So I used to watch the stars with her.

698
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,640
Watch the stars?

699
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:00,720
Bar?

700
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,080
What are you trying to pull?

701
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,521
Sorry, I've got a date tonight.

702
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,881
Bye.

703
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,881
Xiaoqi.

704
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,160
We are out of candy.

705
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,441
Go and buy some for me.

706
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,881
No problem. I'll go now.

707
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:24,881
Take care.

708
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:25,921
Okay.

709
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,080
Master.

710
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:33,961
Didn't you buy up

711
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,080
all the candies in the city?

712
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,321
Shiyi, sorry.

713
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm back...
