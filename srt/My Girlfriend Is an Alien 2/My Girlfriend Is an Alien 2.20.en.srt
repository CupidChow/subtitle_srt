20
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,092
(Sunny Apartment)
You hate me, sister.

21
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,692
(Sunny Apartment)
No, I don't.

22
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:43,491
All right.

23
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,892
Sweetie, I don't hate you.

24
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,972
I like you. I don't hate you, okay?

25
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,812
Does that mean you like me?

26
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:52,851
Like you?

27
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,131
According to my mother,
you like the person

28
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,172
if you don't hate him or her.

29
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:58,812
Do you like me?

30
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,612
I don't know how that feels like.

31
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,972
I like to eat fried chicken,

32
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:07,812
but I also like to have hot pot

33
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,691
if there's no fried chicken.

34
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,732
I like summer,

35
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:15,292
but I also like winter

36
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,612
if the view is beautiful.

37
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,251
I've never thought

38
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,371
of this about you.

39
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,332
I've never thought about

40
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,771
what makes me happy except you.

41
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,371
I've never thought of having
anything to replace you.

42
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,132
I've also never thought of

43
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,892
what would happen

44
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,251
if I lived my life without you.

45
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,892
Do I like you then?

46
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,771
I don't understand your words.

47
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,052
I don't understand your words.

48
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,091
I'm tired.

49
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:49,572
Tell me a story, sister.

50
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,251
I want a story.

51
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:52,332
I want a story!

52
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,491
- What kind of story do you want?
- I want a story.

53
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,691
Fang has amnesia

54
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,491
and forgot Little Qiqi.

55
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,052
So, Little Qiqi packed her things

56
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,892
and went back to her hometown.

57
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,732
Then

58
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:14,771
you fall asleep.

59
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,852
It's bedtime.

60
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:19,572
Don't all bedtime stories
have a happy ending?

61
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:21,931
Why is it an unhappy ending?

62
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,251
Sister!

63
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,211
The ending is good enough.

64
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:29,691
At least I came up with an ending.

65
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,371
Can you change the ending?

66
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,612
Little Qiqi isn't leaving.

67
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,052
She will be with Fang forever.

68
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,531
However, Fang

69
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,612
forgot Little Qiqi.

70
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,531
Little Qiqi isn't important anymore.

71
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:47,412
It's pointless for
Little Qiqi to stay here,

72
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,371
right?

73
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:49,892
No, there's a point of staying.

74
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,211
An important person

75
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,612
will always be important.

76
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,412
Like you've said,

77
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,292
Qi and Fang have gone through

78
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,012
a lot together.

79
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:02,371
How can they be separated easily?

80
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,612
If Little Qiqi left Fang,

81
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:09,572
he will miss her a lot.

82
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:10,971
All right, sweetie.

83
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,691
- They must be together.
- All right, sweetie.

84
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,691
They must be together.

85
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:15,811
Then

86
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,251
Fang,

87
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,412
you must recover soon

88
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,251
if you don't want Little Qiqi to leave.

89
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,931
You must remember Little Qiqi

90
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,972
and get back your memory soon.

91
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:39,131
I think Fang can do it

92
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,732
if Little Qiqi isn't leaving.

93
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:43,931
Okay.

94
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,772
That's all.

95
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,811
Just like what you've said...

96
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:23,052
You aren't allowed to leave

97
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:25,852
since you said it.

98
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,011
I’m sorry.

99
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,612
I really can't accept
the most important person

100
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,811
in my life leaving me again.

101
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,691
I'm willing to

102
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:45,691
have amnesia forever

103
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,292
if I can make you stay by doing this.

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,820
(Sunny Apartment)

105
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,532
(What did you say to me last night?)

106
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,451
(Why can't I recall anything?)

107
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,980
(Jiang Shiyi: Xiaoqi, come to my place.
I need to talk to you.)

108
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:35,811
Sister,

109
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,891
what have you found over there?

110
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,891
I hired a private
investigator in the U.S.

111
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:43,212
He said Fang Leng had
only one medical record

112
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,612
at this psychological clinic in the U.S.

113
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:48,652
A psychological clinic?

114
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:52,371
Fang Leng was secretive about it.

115
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,532
He never lets me down.

116
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:57,011
Let's see what he can say

117
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,451
after I get his medical record.

118
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:01,092
The president of Future Group

119
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,931
can't be a mentally ill person.

120
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:05,451
Sister,

121
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,212
come back soon after
you find what we need.

122
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:10,732
Let's catch him off guard.

123
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:19,891
Is there any update?

124
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,491
I got him drunk last night,

125
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,691
but I didn't manage to get anything.

126
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,371
However, I think he is

127
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,451
a bit weird.

128
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:34,372
Sometimes, I feel

129
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,292
he really has amnesia,

130
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,052
but sometimes I feel

131
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,971
he remembers some of my habits.

132
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,611
Do you think

133
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,731
Fang Leng pretends to have amnesia?

134
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:50,931
What happened?

135
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,372
Didn't you sleep well last night?

136
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,012
I cosplay as the White Snake

137
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,532
and do sit-ups to help him

138
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,091
to recover his memory.

139
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,132
I need to tell him bedtime stories, too.

140
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:00,892
I'm so tired.

141
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:02,132
I'm so tired.

142
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:04,611
Xiaoqi,

143
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,451
I can use my superpower...

144
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,052
No.

145
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,372
No.

146
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,292
You can't use it.

147
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,412
It will leave permanent damage

148
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,851
to his central nervous system.

149
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,052
No.

150
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,451
I'll figure out another way.

151
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,571
Don't you want to complete
your mission soon?

152
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:19,731
I think

153
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,851
at least you won't be so tired.

154
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:23,052
It's okay.

155
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:24,971
It's okay to be tired.

156
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:26,851
I'll figure out another way.

157
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,611
I have to go.

158
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,052
Goodbye Shiyi. Bye.

159
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,571
You are immune to Xiaoqi's superpower,

160
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,372
but not mine.

161
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,331
Whether you have amnesia or not,

162
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:58,851
I don't want you to recover your memory.

163
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,012
You will only make Xiaoqi sad

164
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,571
if your memory recovers.

165
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,611
However, I'm willing to help
you to recover your memory

166
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:08,731
to let Xiaoqi complete her mission.

167
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,571
I'm back.

168
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,451
Shiyi?

169
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,811
Shiyi, what are you doing?

170
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:36,811
Shiyi,

171
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,492
have you forgotten Universal Peace Act?

172
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:40,412
Do you know you will
get a punishment for it?

173
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,772
I am not trying to hurt him.

174
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:43,492
I just want to recover his memory.

175
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,412
Shiyi.

176
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,652
Can you give me one more chance?

177
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,652
Just one more chance.

178
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,931
I'll succeed.

179
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,292
Shiyi, please.

180
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,611
Just give me one more chance.

181
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:00,851
One last chance.

182
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,652
I'll do it my way next time.

183
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:12,971
I'm back.

184
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,571
Where did you go early in the morning?
I was looking for you everywhere.

185
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:19,811
I...

186
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,331
You didn't clean up the house.
Clean up in a hurry.

187
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:22,971
Okay.

188
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:26,971
You...

189
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,052
What's wrong?

190
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,571
Have a seat first.

191
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,492
What happened?

192
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:35,772
Suddenly...

193
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:44,132
I'll take you to a place
after you rest for a while

194
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,652
and the headache is gone.

195
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,660
(Fitness center)

196
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,652
Why did you take me to the pool?

197
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,052
You'd been at home for a long time.

198
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,292
You need to get some fresh air.

199
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:03,851
Here you go.

200
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,252
Get changed.

201
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,691
Hurry up.

202
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:07,731
- I...
- I'll wait for you.

203
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,091
Hurry up.

204
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:36,532
Are you all set?

205
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,172
Okay, I'll jump into it.

206
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:43,652
The water level is too deep.

207
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:45,132
It's dangerous as you
don't know how to swim.

208
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,731
I can't swim? Says who?

209
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,012
Have you forgotten that
I'm a good swimmer?

210
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,172
You still need to warm up.

211
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,252
Why should I?

212
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,931
A good swimmer doesn't
need to warm up, okay?

213
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:58,772
Are you questioning my ability

214
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,892
or have you recalled
anything all of a sudden?

215
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:02,931
Are you worried about me?

216
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,731
What's wrong? Are you worried about me?

217
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,892
It's normal to warm up before you swim.

218
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:12,971
It's general knowledge.

219
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,652
There isn't any lifeguard here.

220
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,211
If accident happens...

221
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,052
You don't need to rescue me

222
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,052
even if there's an accident

223
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,252
or danger, okay?

224
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:20,451
Okay, don't be worried.

Xiaoqi.

Are we back home?

249
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:05,492
You're okay, Xiaoqi.

250
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,571
It'd be nice if you didn't
lose your memory.

251
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,731
I wish you remembered
that I was your girlfriend.

252
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:20,412
I didn't lose my memory, Xiaoqi.

253
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:22,451
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:24,691
I shouldn't have pretended
that I had amnesia.

255
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,571
You pretended to have amnesia?

256
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,091
I did this to make you stay.

257
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,571
I don't know it'd end up like this.

258
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,851
Are you telling the truth?

259
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,571
Yes.

260
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:39,012
Why would I lie to
you in this situation?

261
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,331
I knew it!

262
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,931
I knew you were pretending.

263
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:45,971
Couldn't you

264
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,811
be more mature?

265
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,172
Did you consider my feelings?

266
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,492
I'd been taking care of you.

267
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,851
I tried so many ways

268
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,211
to recover your memory.

269
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,172
In the end,

270
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,172
you'd been fooling me the whole time.

271
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,052
You're too much, Xiaoqi.

272
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,892
How could you joke with your life?

273
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,132
You're so harsh to me.

274
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,132
You did something wrong,

275
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,851
yet you didn't explain it to me.
Besides, you're harsh to me.

276
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,691
You're

277
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:06,691
so annoying.

278
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:44,412
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:51,412
I thought you were
leaving me at that time.

280
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,532
That's why I pretended to have amnesia

281
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:55,971
after the car accident.

282
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,372
You...

283
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,412
Couldn't you use another way?

284
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,052
You're using a stupid way to...

285
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:03,892
I thought you'd completely
forgotten about me.

286
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:05,811
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:08,851
Why did you prepare farewell gifts?

288
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,091
I...

289
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,492
I found a way to play a trick

290
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,131
on people on the Internet.

291
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,411
It's about

292
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,692
preparing a farewell gift

293
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:25,052
and see the person's reaction.

294
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,131
It...

295
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,371
Don't worry.

296
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,492
I won't leave you.

297
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,052
Are you happy now?

298
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:15,571
I bought two sets of fried chicken

299
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,811
and milk tea for you.

300
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,292
You're performing well.

301
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:21,732
Are you done writing?

302
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,571
The ground rules of the relationship.

303
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:26,411
First,

304
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,811
Fang Leng can't lie to
Xiaoqi in the future.

305
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:29,972
Second,

306
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,371
Fang Leng can't make
Xiaoqi angry in the future.

307
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:34,932
You made ground rules for me

308
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,692
when I went to your company.

309
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,651
I made the ground rules
of the relationship for you.

310
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,532
Let's add one more.

311
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,331
Don't use the black card to blow me off

312
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,891
if Fang Leng makes Xiaoqi
angry in the future.

313
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:50,452
Okay.

314
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:58,651
Don't use the black card
to blow Xiaoqi off.

315
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:00,091
Okay.

316
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:00,972
Okay.

317
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,492
You can write

318
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,452
your requirements, too,

319
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:09,571
if you have any.

320
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:13,252
I don't have any requirement.

321
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:14,972
You're being yourself.

322
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,091
It's enough to just have you here.

323
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,411
Don't you have any requirement?

324
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:20,932
I think there is one.

325
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:22,651
Let's add one more.

326
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,420
(Number four, Xiaoqi can't leave
Fang Leng suddenly.)

327
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,340
(Han)

328
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:48,972
What is it, Mr. Han?

329
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:49,772
Mr. Fang,

330
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:50,851
this is bad!

331
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:52,772
Anderson Psychological Clinic

332
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:53,772
in the U.S. e-mailed me.

333
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:56,452
They said Zhou Siqin obtained
your medical records.

334
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,052
She also focused on understanding
the treatment process

335
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:00,252
of your rainy weather
heterosexual amnesia.

336
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,131
This...

337
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:03,371
Didn't you pretend

338
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,932
you had amnesia?

339
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:05,692
This...

340
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:06,811
You didn't know that

341
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:07,651
Mr. Fang had

342
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:09,611
rainy weather heterosexual amnesia
since he was five years old.

343
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:11,891
Wait.

344
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,932
Is Ms. Chai with you?

345
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:16,012
Yes.

346
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:16,891
All right.

347
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:18,012
Listen to me.

348
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,932
Upgrade all security systems

349
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:20,932
of the company's memory bank.

350
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,611
Then tell Dr. Zhang

351
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,492
to keep all my medical records well.

352
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,532
Also,

353
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,212
upgrade

354
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,611
the hacking system.

355
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,411
Okay, Mr. Fang.

356
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:36,052
What is rainy weather
heterosexual amnesia?

357
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:36,972
What happened?

358
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:41,651
Mr. Fang's amnesia is that

359
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,571
he will forget the women
he has met recently.

360
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,811
Whenever it rains,

361
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:46,651
you have to help him to recall the women

362
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,212
he has met in a short period,

363
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,292
especially the important clients.

364
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:51,692
By the way,

365
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:53,532
keep this secret

366
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,851
and never let the fourth person know.

367
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:57,012
Don't worry.

368
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,411
Mr. Fang trusts me so much.

369
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,972
I'll never let him down.

370
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,012
Xiaoqi,

371
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,131
can you make me a promise?

372
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,411
Can you not leave me

373
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,772
if I forget you in the future?

374
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:19,452
In the future?

375
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,052
(I'm going back to my planet soon.)

376
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,851
(How can I guarantee the future?)

377
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:30,851
If you're sick,

378
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:33,171
will you be okay

379
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,411
after being cured?

380
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,052
I forgot everyone when

381
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:40,651
it rained the last few times.

382
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,252
You're the only one I didn't forget.

383
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,692
I'm unsure if my condition

384
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:49,492
will get worse or not.

385
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:53,772
I'm unsure if I will ever forget you.

386
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:59,292
(That's why Fang Leng was so angry)

387
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,091
(when he knew I lied to him.)

388
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:03,411
(It's because)

389
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:06,452
(I'm the only one he won't forget.)

390
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,212
I know this is a difficult
question for you.

391
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,171
I also know

392
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,772
how cold and inhumane

393
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,411
I will be

394
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,772
if I become the way I used to be.

395
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,012
However, I really don't want to return

396
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,492
to the way I used to live.

397
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,811
If even you are leaving me...

398
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:35,252
Don't worry.

399
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:37,371
I would never leave you.

400
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:40,932
I'll try my best

401
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:42,851
like what I'm doing now to help you

402
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,212
to recall me

403
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,772
if you don't remember me at that time.

404
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:48,972
Wait for a while.

405
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:51,811
Give me the notebook.

406
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:01,292
Chai Xiaoqi.

407
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,820
(Number four, Xiaoqi can't leave
Fang Leng suddenly.)

408
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,300
(Number four, Xiaoqi can't leave
Fang Leng suddenly. Chai Xiaoqi)

409
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,891
I promise you.

410
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,780
(Sunny Apartment)

411
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,851
No, you'll hang up first.

412
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:40,611
No, I want to see you more.

413
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:41,692
You will hang up first.

414
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:42,692
No.

415
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,091
You work hard during the day.

416
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,532
You will hang up first.

417
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:48,932
Okay.

418
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,532
He really hung up.

419
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:56,532
How could a boy hang up a girl's call?

420
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,452
No, I must call him back.

421
00:23:58,811 --> 00:23:59,571
Chai,

422
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,012
I'm back.

423
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:05,052
Your smile is sweet and the corners
of your mouth curve up.

424
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,851
Your eyes light up and
your face looks happy.

425
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:08,972
You are different today.

426
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:12,292
I made a very important decision today.

427
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:15,292
Has your relationship with Fang Leng

428
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:16,292
progressed again?

429
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,331
How do you know?

430
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:21,252
Chai, I want to know

431
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:23,891
what love is.

432
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:29,371
This question is too broad.

433
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,492
Please let me explain it to you slowly.

434
00:24:34,452 --> 00:24:36,772
Love can be vigorous.

435
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:39,371
It can be serene, too.

436
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,651
It's love when your
heartbeat becomes faster

437
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,492
when you meet him.

438
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,371
It's also love when your mind
is as calm as water

439
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:47,692
when you're leaning on his shoulder.

440
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:50,851
It's love when you
bravely express your love.

441
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,131
It's also love when you sit aside

442
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:55,811
and wait silently.

443
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:57,891
Xiaoqi,

444
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:00,012
everyone has different understanding

445
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:00,772
and needs for love.

446
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:02,851
So, love is also different

447
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,371
for everyone.

448
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:08,732
Don't worry. I won't leave you.

449
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,492
I would never leave you.

450
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,100
(Chai Xiaoqi)

451
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:15,891
So

452
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,411
I'd really fallen in love with him

453
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,651
when I decided to stay.

454
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:22,171
Xiaoqi,

455
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:23,371
congratulations

456
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,091
on your progress

457
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,292
in love.

458
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,131
By the way,

459
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:31,811
I saw a two-person tour in Bali

460
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:34,212
in this magazine.

461
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:35,651
It's suitable for you two.

462
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:38,052
Why don't you travel
there with Fang Leng?

463
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,331
There's also this.

464
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,171
It is a limited edition bag.

465
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:42,611
Doesn't it look nice?

466
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:44,492
No.

467
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,732
I have to

468
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,692
do a more important thing before that.

469
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,700
(Office)

470
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:51,052
Fang Leng's disease is mainly because

471
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,371
he is unwilling to
reconcile with the past.

472
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:56,651
So, he will have the symptoms of
constantly forgetting the women

473
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,171
he met in a short period

474
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,012
due to the self-protection mechanism.

475
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:03,692
In fact, the rainy weather
heterosexual amnesia

476
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,651
is essentially to dilute

477
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,292
the pain of memory by escaping.

478
00:26:09,212 --> 00:26:11,611
I suggest you

479
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,252
to talk to Mr. Fang's father

480
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,932
if you want to cure Fang Leng.

481
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:20,292
Didn't you ask Fang Leng
to reconcile with the past?

482
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,252
What does this have
to do with Fang Shida?

483
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,891
Fang Leng's mother witnessed

484
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:26,811
Fang Shida cheating on her that time.

485
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:30,171
She ran away with Fang Leng
as she was very sad.

486
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:32,811
That's why the car accident happened.

487
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,772
Fang Leng didn't forgive Fang Shida

488
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,732
after so many years.

489
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,651
He always avoids the topic

490
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:42,252
whenever I mention Fang Shida to him.

491
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,772
Understood.

492
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:46,651
All right.

493
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,772
- Thank you, Dr. Zhang.
- Wait.

494
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,532
Where are you going?

495
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,811
Didn't you say Uncle Fang

496
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,611
was the key for Fang Leng to recover?

497
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,932
I'll talk to him now.

498
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:54,212
Thanks for your hard work. Bye.

499
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,292
You need to make
an appointment to meet Fang Shida.

500
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:57,091
Also, don't say anything

501
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,212
about your relationship with Fang Leng.

502
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:58,972
If not...

503
00:26:59,331 --> 00:26:59,972
If not...

504
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:16,371
Brother-in-law,

505
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:18,532
this is the nutritious soup that

506
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,932
my sister specially asked
the chef to cook for you.

507
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:22,052
Taste it while it's hot.

508
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:31,371
Fang Leng is still young.

509
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,411
It's normal that he can't
tell who is good or bad.

510
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:38,932
The point is that Chai Xiaoqi

511
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:41,052
keeps in contact with Fang Leng

512
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,692
by delivering food every day.

513
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:44,331
After a while,

514
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,692
Chai Xiaoqi worked in the company.

515
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:49,091
Is she an employee of our group?

516
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:53,651
Didn't Fang Leng tell you?

517
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,811
I let it slip.

518
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,411
It was Chai Xiaoqi's idea

519
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:02,932
to establish a R&D department.

520
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,091
The board of directors

521
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:05,972
had a few meetings for such a big thing

522
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,292
yet she succeeded.

523
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,692
I don't know what Chai Xiaoqi

524
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,891
had done to attract Fang Leng.

525
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,651
We promised to have

526
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,972
a three-year president assessment.

527
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,091
He didn't take it seriously

528
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:21,571
and now he does whatever

529
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:22,891
he wants every day.

530
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,292
Brother-in-law, don't worry.

531
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:29,091
Fang Leng is still young.

532
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,371
I think they will

533
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:31,571
break up soon.

534
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,692
Chai Xiaoqi will be ignorant

535
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:34,891
if she comes to you

536
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:37,371
and thinks she can marry

537
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:38,972
into a wealthy family.

538
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:41,492
Don't be angry.

539
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:46,611
I'll open the door.

540
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:07,212
Chai Xiaoqi really thinks

541
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:10,012
she can marry into a wealthy family.

542
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:13,452
Excuse me...

543
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,212
Mr. Fang isn't here.

544
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,171
Come back another time.

545
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:16,932
I haven't said nor

546
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:17,891
asked anything yet.

547
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:19,571
What's going on now?

548
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:25,732
That was...

549
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:31,131
That was Uncle Kang's voice, right?

550
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:36,171
I was careless.

551
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,492
I should have let Chai Xiaoqi
in to make trouble just now.

552
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:42,091
This would definitely

553
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:44,371
make Mr. Fang angry.

554
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:51,052
Is she still here?

555
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,772
You'll surely come out.

556
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:17,851
Why are you still here?

557
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,091
Hello, Mr. Fang.

558
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,772
I'm an employee of Future Group.

559
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:21,811
My name is Chai Xiaoqi.

560
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,012
- I have to talk to you.
- Get out of the way!

561
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:23,611
I...

562
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:24,932
Just give me five minutes.

563
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:26,091
You can't fool Mr. Fang

564
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:26,851
with these tricks.

565
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:28,371
I'm not a liar.

566
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,611
Just give me five minutes.

567
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,411
I have to talk to him
about something important.

568
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:33,972
I'll give you five minutes. Tell me.

569
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:35,252
No, I have to talk to him.

570
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,811
Tell me. I'll convey it.

571
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,171
Can you convey it?

572
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:41,212
That's okay, too.

573
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,212
I'm looking for him mainly because

574
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:43,532
I want to tell him...

575
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:45,452
Brother-in-law!

576
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,331
Stop the car!

577
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,292
- Five minutes, right?
- Wait for me!

578
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:49,692
Brother-in-law, wait for me!

579
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:52,371
Brother-in-law, I haven't
gotten into the car!

580
00:30:58,371 --> 00:30:59,452
It's easy

581
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:00,571
to deal with him.

582
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:03,611
Mr. Fang,

583
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:05,331
the purity of the hormone is

584
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,571
three times higher than last time.

585
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:08,692
I appreciate your hard work.

586
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:12,212
Xiaoqi can officially
start to mix perfume.

587
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:13,891
Oh, Mr. Fang.

588
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:15,692
Ms. Chai hasn't come to work today.

589
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:17,532
Did she apply leave in advance?

590
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,580
(Xiaoqi)

591
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:27,891
Hello,

592
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:30,891
the number you're dialling
cannot be reached at the moment.

593
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:38,411
Mr. Fang,

594
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,131
ignore that kind of person.

595
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,331
Don't you still have Fang Lie?

596
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,091
Fang Lie is more sensible

597
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:46,972
and obedient than Fang Leng, right?

598
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:55,131
Hello, Mr. Fang.

599
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,171
I'm here again.

600
00:31:58,012 --> 00:31:59,252
Give up now.

601
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:01,651
I've seen many girls like you.

602
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:03,611
Mr. Fang, I still insist on

603
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:05,212
asking you to give me ten minutes.

604
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,692
Do you have a problem

605
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,252
in understanding or are
you simply shameless?

606
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:09,972
Get out of here.

607
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,452
Otherwise, I'll call
the security guards, okay?

608
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:12,532
Hold on.

609
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:13,492
Mr. Fang,

610
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:14,571
you haven't talked

611
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,212
to Fang Leng for a long time, right?

612
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:18,692
I'm sure you don't know

613
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:20,252
how his life has been.

614
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,212
You also don't know

615
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:23,811
what makes him happy

616
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:25,371
or unhappy, right?

617
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,091
You really don't know.

618
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:33,772
I promise to let you know
more about Fang Leng

619
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:35,891
if you give me ten minutes.

620
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:36,651
Of course.

621
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,811
I understand

622
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:39,851
why you want to kick me out,

623
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:40,811
because my action today

624
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,411
has really offended you.

625
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,052
I'm sorry.

626
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:44,371
Is it up to you, an outsider,

627
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:46,212
to interfere in the matters
between the father and the son?

628
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:48,411
Aren't you taking yourself
too seriously?

629
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:50,252
You'd better get out.

630
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:51,811
Uncle Kang.

631
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:52,851
- You'd better...
- Tell me.

632
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:55,851
I'll give you ten minutes.

633
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:02,492
You'd better sit down

634
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:04,452
and make things clear.

635
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,492
Don't waste Mr. Fang's time.

636
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,012
I'll get you a cup.

637
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,571
Take your time.

638
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:11,371
Thank you.

639
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,700
(Fang Leng)

640
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,131
(Look for me at the cinema
after getting off from work.)

641
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,140
(Time Place)

642
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,052
Xiaoqi,

643
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,171
where did you go today?

644
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:44,811
You'll know where I went soon.

645
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:46,532
Let's get in.

646
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:47,452
Let's go.

647
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:51,331
Let's get in.

648
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:52,452
You'll know soon.

649
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:53,732
I'm going to buy some popcorn.

650
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:54,692
Get in first.

651
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:55,212
No, I...

652
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:56,091
Take a seat.

653
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:58,131
I'll buy it.

654
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:22,651
Look here.

655
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:36,211
Look at the camera.

656
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:54,452
Look at the camera.

657
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,571
Hi.

658
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,291
Hi.

659
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,412
Hello.

660
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,771
Sweetie.

661
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:09,611
- Sweetie.
- We are meeting soon.

662
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:10,691
- We are meeting soon.
- We

663
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:11,892
are waiting for you.

664
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:13,131
Hi.

665
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:17,052
Are you happy?

666
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,571
We are very happy.

667
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,412
I've thought of your name.

668
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,091
Your name will be Fang Leng

669
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:26,332
if you're a boy.

670
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:29,771
Your name will be Fang Leng, too

671
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:31,932
if you're a girl.

672
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:33,731
Fang Leng.

673
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:35,731
I like this name so much.

674
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:38,251
Did you hear it?

675
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,452
Your father has named you Fang Leng.

676
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:41,972
Fang Leng.

677
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:44,972
- He said he heard it.
- He heard it.

678
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:46,651
Is it good?

679
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,412
Does it sound good?

680
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:49,812
It sounds good.

681
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:51,012
Come on.

682
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:53,131
I'll take you to another
place for a walk,

683
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:53,892
okay?

684
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,052
Let's go over there.

685
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,972
Look, there's a swimming
pool in front of us.

686
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:00,932
It's for swimming.

687
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,412
It's for swimming.

688
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:04,091
Do you see that swimming pool?

689
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:05,651
Ask your father to take you there

690
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:07,771
for a swim after you're born.

691
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:08,412
How about you?

692
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:09,452
I'll pick the pomelo.

693
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:18,972
Look at him.

694
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:20,771
He looks smart.

695
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:24,731
He can do business with me.

696
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,291
Don't listen to your father.

697
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,532
Just do what you like to do

698
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,571
and be happy.

699
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:31,812
Look.

700
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,131
We won't do business with your father.

701
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,291
Cook with mother.

702
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,012
Cook with mother.

703
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:39,492
Good boy.

704
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:41,932
Let father hold you, okay?

705
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,651
Father is very good at holding kids.

706
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,291
Come on.

707
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,412
What you're doing now is

708
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:45,932
what you like the most, right?

709
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:48,332
I think

710
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:50,492
your mother

711
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,012
would want you

712
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,131
to be a little happier

713
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,532
and blissful.

714
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:07,771
Thank you so much.

715
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:16,012
Actually, you should thank your father.

716
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:21,731
Why?

717
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,972
Your father gave me these videos.

718
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:33,932
My father?

719
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:10,291
(Why aren't they talking?)

720
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:12,932
(The atmosphere is so touching now.)

721
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,571
(Everything will be fine)

722
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:16,492
(if they just say "I love
you" to each other.)

723
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:18,972
Why didn't you tell me

724
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:20,731
about your amnesia?

725
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,771
What's the point of telling you?

726
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:28,892
You are not a doctor.

727
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,452
I'm unneeded in this family.

728
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,452
Zhou Siqin will get me

729
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:36,972
to leave the company immediately

730
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:38,731
if I tell you the truth.

731
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:40,251
You're unneeded? Says who?

732
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:42,532
You hid such a big thing from me.

733
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:44,171
Are you still my son?

734
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:45,251
I'm your son.

735
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:49,012
Mother might be alive

736
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,452
if you hadn't

737
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:52,091
treated her like that.

738
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:55,932
You don't know anything.

739
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:01,332
Fang Leng.

740
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:02,932
