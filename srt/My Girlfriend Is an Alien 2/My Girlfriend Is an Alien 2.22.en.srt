19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,590
(Sunny Apartment)

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,030
Are you really sure?

21
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,000
Although the mission is complete,

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,880
I want to stay on Earth with Fang Leng.

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,190
Xiaobu.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,390
If

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,830
you want to go back to our home
to repair your system,

26
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,750
you'll have to ask
Shiyi to take you back.

27
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,230
So will I

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,280
never get to see you again?

29
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,000
Then I'll stay, too.

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,400
It doesn't matter if
I can't use my powers.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,590
I am your intelligent secretary.

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,470
If you stay, then I'll stay.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,400
- We'll stay.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,630
- I'm not leaving.
- Xiaobu.

35
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,440
Xiaoqi, let me ask you.

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,910
You are the first among us

37
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,030
to fall in love with an Earthling.

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
You've broken the rules.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,510
Are you not afraid?

40
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,160
I am a little scared,

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,750
but when I think of

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,880
Fang Leng by my side,

43
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,910
then

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,510
all my fears are gone.

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,840
Silly girl.

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
You know when
you're in love with someone.

47
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,120
What is it like to love someone?

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,190
Let me explain.

49
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,190
When you like someone,

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,790
your heart beats faster,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,960
your face blushes and flushes

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,910
and your scalp tingles.

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,310
Just like

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
when

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,910
your CPU breaks down.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,030
Did this program start

57
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,790
because of Fang Lie?

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,500
(Fang Leng: Sleep early.
Treat you to a big meal tomorrow.)

59
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,510
(Jiang Shiyi: See you tomorrow,
I need to talk to you.)

60
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,470
Let's meet tomorrow.
I have something to tell you.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,510
Master.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,590
Shouldn't you be

63
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,630
trying to persuade
Chai Xiaoqi at this time,

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
instead of contacting Fang Leng?

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,600
After tomorrow, Xiaoqi will realise

66
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
that her so-called love

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
is just a deception

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,950
set up by an Earthling

69
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,630
to take advantage of her.

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,270
Mr. Jiang, I don't think this meeting

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
is about business, is it?

72
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,950
Mr. Fang, you're indeed smart.

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,070
This saves us a lot of time

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,560
beating around the bush.

75
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,510
Break up with Xiaoqi.

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,680
I expected you to have

77
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,750
your own tricks as my love rival,

78
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
but I didn't expect you to be so blunt.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,510
Then I'll give you a straight answer.

80
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,040
That's impossible.

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
You know what?

82
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,480
If you found out
the truth about everything,

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,150
you'd find your persistence

84
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
really ridiculous.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you mean?

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Let me reintroduce myself.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
My real name is

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,830
Jilisiburadakaqikaqi No. 11.

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm from Cape Town Planet.

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,150
In the terms of you Earthlings,

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,150
I'm an alien.

92
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,390
Even if what you say is true,

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,630
what does it have to do with Xiaoqi?

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,070
Don't you get it?

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,710
Xiaoqi, the woman you think you love,

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,680
her real name is

97
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,070
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
She's also an alien.

99
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,510
Her mission on Earth

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,800
is to get close to you,

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,360
to use you to collect hormone element.

102
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,190
From the beginning

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,240
until now, she's sticking with you

104
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,750
for the mission.

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,560
So I advise you to give up,

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
because Xiaoqi

107
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,360
doesn't love you at all.

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
You may leave.

109
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,190
I wonder if he'll like me

110
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,710
in this dress.

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
It's so pretty. I'm sure he'll like it.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,680
You're here.

113
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,800
What do you think?

114
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,120
Do I look good in this?

115
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,120
Any comments?

116
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,600
Xiaoqi, do you love me?

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,950
Why all of a sudden? Gosh.

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,750
Do you need to be so serious
about my new dress?

119
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,120
Goodness.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,390
How...

121
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,880
How could you ask that

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,920
in a public place?

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,270
I love you so much.

124
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Do you truly love me?

125
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,070
Yes, I do.

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,270
What's wrong?

127
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,360
What about your mission?

128
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,920
What mission?

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,120
I've waited so long for you.

130
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,830
I'm starving.

131
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's go and eat.

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,950
Jiang Shiyi told me everything.

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,600
As an alien,

135
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,720
it is my mission to rule the Earth.

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,240
What's wrong, darling?

137
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
My right eye

138
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
has been throbbing today.

139
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,200
I feel like

140
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,880
something is going to happen.

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,880
What did

142
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,630
he tell you?

143
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,750
Actually,

144
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
I've been wanting to tell you all along.

145
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,430
I just haven't figured out how.

146
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,120
I didn't expect him to tell you first.

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,750
So what he said was true.

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,270
I came to Earth,

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,430
approached you

150
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,030
and joined the company

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,000
initially on a mission,

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,270
but not anymore.

153
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,270
I mean it

154
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,320
when I say I like you

155
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,550
and will always be there for you.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Don't you believe me?

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,000
Or are you some kind of

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
planetist who prejudices

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
against aliens?

160
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,150
Aliens are actually quite nice.

161
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,360
If I say I'm bothered about it,

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,390
will you leave me?

163
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,480
No, of course not.

164
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,840
I made up my mind from the start

165
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
that I would always be with you

166
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,200
and that I would never leave you

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
no matter what happened.

168
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,550
If you want to break up with me,

169
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll pursue you back.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,790
I promise.

171
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,960
I...

172
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,550
I know it's hard to accept

173
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,270
and I know you must be

174
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,120
having mixed feelings right now.

175
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,120
Then I'll leave you alone for now.

176
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,000
See you.

177
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,750
Whether you're a human

178
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,840
or an alien,

179
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,000
I still love you.

180
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,000
However...

181
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,600
I don't think

182
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,270
we should do this in public.

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,390
Tell me.

184
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,750
How are you going to
prove everything you just said?

185
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,880
Are you still not trusting me?

186
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,360
Are you ready?

187
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,270
Isn't it awesome?

188
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
This is called teleportation.

189
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I can travel

190
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,480
anywhere I want to go in an instant.

191
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,430
No wonder you always

192
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,910
flash up in front of me.

193
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,910
Actually, I don't think

194
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,000
it's that impressive.

195
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,600
Let me show you something even cooler.

196
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,840
This...

197
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,360
I got it.

198
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,430
You were the one behind
the phone in the car park

199
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,120
and the flowerbed at the hotel.

200
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,670
- Xiaoqi.
- Here.

201
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,600
- Come with me.
- You...

202
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,360
I...

203
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
Cool, isn't it?

204
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,390
Behold.

205
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,960
Here I go.

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,390
Love Beam.

207
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,200
Do you like it?

208
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,360
It's beautiful.

209
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,600
I used a lot of power this time.

210
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,750
The flowers are too colourful.

211
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
This psychic power

212
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,390
is specially designed for the Earth.

213
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,390
Those who are affected by it

214
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,960
will be touched

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
and fall in love.

216
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,480
You know what?

217
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,320
I was behind the orchids at Ke Ren's,

218
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,910
the flowerbed,

219
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,030
as well as Mrs. Zhou.

220
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,840
No wonder.

221
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
However, why didn't this trick

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,480
work for you then?

223
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,750
Well, that's better.

224
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,320
If it worked for you,

225
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,790
I'd have finished my mission

226
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,080
and returned home.

227
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,150
You wouldn't have
fallen in love with me.

228
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,600
This indicates

229
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
that you are destined to stay on Earth

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,430
and that I am destined to love you.

231
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,880
Kiss.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
Why does this happen every time?

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I don't know either.

234
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
Let's go for dinner.

235
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,390
I used too much power. So I got hungry.

236
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,120
How long is this traffic going to last?

237
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,270
If this goes on,
the restaurant will be closed

238
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,240
and we won't be able to eat.

239
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,790
I guess there was
a car accident up ahead.

240
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,750
Otherwise, the traffic
would not be so bad.

241
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,550
This should take a long time, then.

242
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,320
Are you hungry?

243
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
My belly shrank.

244
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,390
Look at the long line.

245
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,080
Hang in there.

246
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,720
What now?

247
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,670
Where's the car in front?

248
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,670
This...

249
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,880
This is so...

250
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,240
Xiaoqi.

251
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,670
There are no traffic jams up here.

252
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,630
Xiaoqi, this is so cool.

253
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,190
Look below.

254
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,710
No, I just took a peek.

255
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,910
Take another look.

256
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,710
Go ahead.

257
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,670
This is too high.

258
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,630
Xiaoqi, you are amazing.

259
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,520
You hit the stars.

260
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,470
What a beautiful view.

261
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,360
Pretty, right?

262
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,560
Master.

263
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,520
I detected Chai Xiaoqi's
extensive use of powers.

264
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,150
Looks like they haven't broken up.

265
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,280
Candy.

266
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
If I keep splitting them apart,

267
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,760
Xiaoqi will hate me, right?

268
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,600
Master.

269
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,520
Are you giving up?

270
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,080
If I give up now,

271
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,910
Xiaoqi will definitely be punished.

272
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,990
That's the worst possible outcome.

273
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,230
I'd rather be hated by her.

274
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,670
I have to save her no matter what.

275
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,630
Why isn't Xiaoqi back yet?

276
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,520
I miss you.

277
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,710
Get some rest.

278
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,560
Bye.

279
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay.

280
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
You should go back.

281
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,520
What are you doing

282
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,910
standing here?

283
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,560
(System down)

284
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,630
What's wrong?

285
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,040
Xiaoqi.

286
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,760
I can't help but think of Fang Lie

287
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,230
when I see you with
Fang Leng these days.

288
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,320
What is wrong with me?

289
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Are you in love with Fang Lie?

290
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
I don't know.

291
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,990
Xiaoqi.

292
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,560
How did you know for sure
that you love Fang Leng?

293
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,040
My feelings for him

294
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,040
should have built up over time.

295
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,910
I didn't realise

296
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,560
when I started to like him

297
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,600
until he lost his memory.

298
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,710
At that time,

299
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
I was so worried about him

300
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,880
and I was afraid
that he would forget me.

301
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,430
It was then

302
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,280
that I was sure

303
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
I had always liked him.

304
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,910
But Fang Lie doesn't have amnesia.

305
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,840
I may never be able to determine

306
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,470
whether I like Fang Lie or not.

307
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,600
Let me think.

308
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
Let's play a game

309
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,800
to find the answer.

310
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,150
Now, relax and clear your mind.

311
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,470
Relax

312
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,990
and breathe.

313
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,910
I will say a word

314
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,710
and you tell me

315
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,190
the first word

316
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,390
that pops into your head.

317
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,600
Breathe out.

318
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,840
Relax.

319
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,360
Sun.

320
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,120
Energy.

321
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,630
Cloudy.

322
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,230
Mouldy.

323
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,800
Cake.

324
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,360
Pudding.

325
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,950
Turtle.

326
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,520
Ice cubes.

327
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Xiaoqi.

328
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,560
Friend.

329
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,040
Fang Lie.

330
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,760
Boyfriend.

331
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,150
You like him.

332
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,760
Xiaoqi, but I'm a robot.

333
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,320
Can robots fall in love?

334
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,520
Why not?

335
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
You absolutely can.

336
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,340
(Fang Lie)

337
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,080
Fang Lie.

338
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,600
Yes, brother?

339
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,710
Are you okay?

340
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,190
I'm fine.

341
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I just got up.

342
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,430
I'm going to order some breakfast.

343
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,470
Breakfast?

344
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,150
It's 11pm, Fang Lie.

345
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,080
Then I'll go back to sleep.

346
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,560
Talk to you tomorrow.

347
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,280
Wait.

348
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,430
When was the last time you went out?

349
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,950
After submitting
my competition entry, I guess.

350
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,230
I have been staying in the studio.

351
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,430
I wanted to go out,

352
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,280
but I had no company.

353
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,390
Go to bed.

354
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,910
I'll hang out with you sometime.

355
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,600
Okay, sure.

356
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,700
(Fang Lie)

357
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,040
Xiaoqi.

358
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,150
Should we just tell Fang Lie

359
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,990
that Xiaobu is actually a robot?

360
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,520
Xiaobu isn't actually ready

361
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,670
to tell him.

362
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,990
Let's respect her choice

363
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,390
and keep it a secret for now.

364
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,520
Well, I told Fang Lie

365
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,710
to be strong.

366
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,080
However, I know very well
that there are many things

367
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,230
that can't be overcome
by just being strong.

368
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,880
I didn't expect him

369
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
to be so down this time.

370
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,760
Brother.

371
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm so excited!

372
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm so excited!

373
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,320
He...

374
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,600
He doesn't look sad at all.

375
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,390
What is this?

376
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,360
Open it up.

377
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,700
(Invitation of Rising Star Cup Art
Competition awards ceremony)

378
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,390
Can you do me a favour?

379
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,230
What is this place?

380
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm at the Rising Star Art Competition

381
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,760
awards ceremony.

382
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,520
(Rising Star Cup Art Competition)

383
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,485
(Rising Star Cup Art Competition)
Isn't this the competition

384
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:11,600
(Rising Star Cup Art Competition)
that Fang Lie participated in?

385
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,670
Did he win?

386
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,600
He didn't mention that,

387
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
but the exhibition hall is full
of award-winning artworks.

388
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,230
We can take a look.

389
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,840
What's wrong?

390
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,950
This drawing...

391
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,990
Could it be that Fang Lie

392
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,760
is suffering from depression?

393
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,630
It looks depressing.

394
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,560
This is not Fang Lie's artwork.

395
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,910
Then what are you worried about?

396
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,230
I've walked around twice,

397
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,040
but I can't find Fang Lie's name.

398
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,430
He probably didn't win.

399
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,230
Now,

400
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,390
the third place in
the Rising Star Art Competition is

401
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,430
Qilin.

402
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,360
He's clearly worked so hard.

403
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,630
The runner-up,

404
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,800
Permanence of China

405
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,670
by Tang Zhuanzhuan.

406
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,150
If I hadn't been

407
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,600
so bothered about my own system,

408
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,910
I could have helped him more

409
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,630
and things would have been different.

410
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,080
There, there.

411
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Don't worry. It's all right.

412
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,600
The first place,

413
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,230
My Inspiration

414
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,280
by Fang Lie.

415
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,080
Go ahead.

416
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Please present the award.

417
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,390
Fang Lie is the winner.

418
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,560
So the top three winners' artworks

419
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,280
- are displayed separately.
- Thank you.

420
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,360
I wonder what he drew.

421
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,600
Hello, Fang Lie.

422
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,910
Can you tell us a little bit

423
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,360
about your journey
in creating this artwork?

424
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
When I was at my most confused

425
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,950
and in need of help,

426
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,320
a girl suddenly came to me

427
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,120
and brought me

428
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,390
many unexpected experiences.

429
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,390
And because of her,

430
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,190
I was able to win this award today.

431
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,430
It's you.

432
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,120
She is Xiaobu,

433
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,280
my muse.

434
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,470
She's also a cool, sweet girl.

435
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
Is she your girlfriend,

436
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,630
if I may ask?

437
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,390
I thought we'd be together forever,

438
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,910
but I think

439
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,390
I made a mistake

440
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,800
and made her upset.

441
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,320
If you can

442
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,710
I hope

443
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,360
she'll give me another chance.

444
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,230
I won't screw it up this time.

445
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,880
You did nothing wrong.

446
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,230
I lied to you.

447
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,040
Bush

448
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,430
If you could be braver,

449
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,120
Fang Lie wouldn't be so sad.

450
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,230
Go for it.

451
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,230
Where is this lady now?

452
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,150
She's down there.

453
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,150
Ms. Xiaobu.

454
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,040
Did you hear Fang Lie's confession?

455
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,470
If you'd like to forgive him,

456
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,760
could you come up to the stage

457
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,630
and tell him in person?

458
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,800
Tell him.

459
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,560
Yes.

460
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,040
- Go ahead.
- Tell him.

461
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,190
- Tell him.
- Come on.

462
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,880
Go ahead.

463
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,470
Tell him.

464
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,600
Be brave.

465
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:43,390
Tell him.

466
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,150
Xiaobu!

467
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Why did she leave?

468
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,120
That's her, right?

469
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,840
What's the matter?

470
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,630
Xiaoqi.

471
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,670
Do you think I'm a coward?

472
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,670
I didn't have the courage
to tell Fang Lie the truth

473
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,800
even though he had misunderstood me.

474
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,470
Do you still feel
you don't have the courage?

475
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,470
Isn't our planet full of

476
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,470
super-intelligent robots?

477
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,600
Among all the intelligent robots,

478
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,600
only you, Xiaobu,

479
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,880
are willing to be my friend

480
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,150
and keep me company.

481
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,040
Only you

482
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
took the initiative to come with me

483
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,040
to complete my mission.

484
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,320
Whatever happens next,

485
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,320
just know that you're
already brave enough.

486
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,840
And let me remind you.

487
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,880
It's hard

488
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,320
to meet someone you like on Earth,

489
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,320
but it's even rare

490
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,670
if you can find someone

491
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,320
who likes you back.

492
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,760
Still, I'm afraid,

493
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,910
What if he doesn't like me

494
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,760
if I tell him the truth?

495
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,280
That's your own assumption.

496
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,150
You haven't asked him.

497
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,280
How do you know what he'll say,

498
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,990
right?

499
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,190
I thought Xiaobu

500
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,600
would be happy with the award.

501
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,190
Fang Lie, did it ever occur to you

502
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,560
that Xiaobu might be a robot?

503
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,190
Brother.

504
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,430
Do you think you're funny?

505
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,470
Fang Lie, I have something to tell you.

506
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,670
That's the truth.

507
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,800
So we're not even the same species?

508
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,710
You're really just
a pile of machine parts

509
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,840
and programming code?

510
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,840
So you've been lying to me all along.

511
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,390
I'm sorry.

512
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,880
Thank you for lying.

513
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,040
If you hadn't lied to me for so long,

514
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,320
I wouldn't be as happy as I am now.

515
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,320
This is more rewarding than my victory.

516
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,800
So you're an alien robot.

517
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,280
No wonder you're so cool.

518
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,760
Do you really don't mind

519
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,430
that I'm a robot?

520
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,150
I don't have a heart.

521
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,320
Do you believe in programmed love?

522
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,630
Xiaobu.

523
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,800
Fang Lie, I'm here.

524
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,880
Xiaobu, aren't you an alien robot?

525
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,150
How did you become a tortoise?

526
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,840
My system is unstable.

527
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,990
If the temperature suddenly rises,

528
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,670
I'll turn into a tortoise.

529
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,950
Fang Lie, I love you.

530
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,950
So when I'm in close contact with you,

531
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,040
my temperature control

532
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,840
goes out of control.

533
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
So you fell in love with me

534
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,600
at first sight

535
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
when you first saw me at the airport.

536
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,910
That's your imagination.

537
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,390
It was simply due to
excessive physical activity.

538
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,040
I guess it first happened

539
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,670
I couldn't help it.

540
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,430
It's all your fault
for making me flutter.

541
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,320
Looks like I'll turn
into a tortoise every day.

542
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Don't worry, I'll help you find a way.

543
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,510
Cheers.

544
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,680
After going through

545
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,320
all the trials

546
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,550
and tribulations of love,

547
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,360
Xiaoqi and Fang Leng
finally get together happily.

548
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,320
After a breakup and reconciliation,

549
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,910
Xiaobu and Fang Lie,

550
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,760
two young lovebirds,

551
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,800
finally learn that love
is not easy to come by.

552
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,390
Dr. Zhang and I

553
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,360
were already in
a mature love relationship.

554
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,470
so we are definitely
more stable than you guys.

555
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,760
So I'd like to

556
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,550
propose a toast

557
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,430
to all of us here.

558
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,510
May we be successful in
our careers and love.

559
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,470
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

560
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,070
Dig in.

561
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,720
Let's eat.

562
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,070
Fang Lie, pour me some juice.

563
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,030
It's salty.

564
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,030
Your mouth.

565
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,590
Wipe it.

566
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,280
This...

567
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,990
This...

568
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,390
Don't you need to explain?

569
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,760
Yes.

570
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,430
Magic.

571
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,070
Chai.

572
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,430
This is actually a magic show

573
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,360
that Xiaoqi and Xiaobu have prepared

574
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,390
especially for you.

575
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,880
It's okay.

576
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,880
I think

577
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,950
it's time to come clean with her.

578
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,360
Chai, do you remember

579
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,030
the last time we said

580
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,470
we shouldn't have lied to you
about being the landlord's daughter?

581
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,200
Actually,

582
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,110
we lied to you more than once.

583
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,880
What do you mean?

584
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,200
The truth is, Xiaoqi and I

585
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,640
are aliens.

586
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,160
We just used our superpowers.

587
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,550
Darling, pinch me.

588
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,760
Darling, pinch me, too.

589
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,030
You are so cute.

590
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,110
You are cute, too.

591
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,990
It's you.

592
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,760
No, it's you.

593
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
You are the cutest.

594
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,200
You are the cutest.

595
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,720
You are the cutest.

596
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,160
Chai.

597
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,990
We didn't mean to lie to you.

598
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,840
But according to
Cape Town's planetary security laws,

599
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
we are required

600
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,880
to hide it from Earthlings.

601
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,240
A lady as beautiful, lovely, generous,

602
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,760
kind and elegant as you

603
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,430
certainly won't blame us.

604
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,390
Says who?

605
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,590
If you two are really aliens,

606
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,800
why didn't you use

607
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,430
your superpowers earlier?

608
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,720
Then I would have

609
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,390
made a lot of money

610
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,990
from my Chai Chai Milk Tea Shop

611
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,590
and I would now have

612
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,800
a few more designer bags.

613
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,430
Still,

614
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,470
how could I possibly be mad

615
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,880
at you two young ones.

616
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,280
For in my heart,

617
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,880
I have already considered you both

618
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,680
as my family.

619
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,110
Chai.

620
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,390
You two are real brothers.

621
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,510
You even have the same type of partner.

622
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,760
My brother likes an alien

623
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,800
but I like an alien robot.

624
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,990
It's different.

625
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,880
Here.

626
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,720
This is your first love.

627
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,880
Xiaoqi and Xiaobu are both aliens.

628
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,070
Aren't there any

629
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,510
communication barriers between you?

630
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,910
What?

631
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,950
Xiaoqi and Xiaobu are also
in love for the first time.

632
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,680
These four young people
are all first-timers.

633
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,720
They won't understand

634
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,880
real love relationships.

635
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,640
Why don't I take you all to a game?

636
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,880
The name of this game is called

637
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,840
"Speak in Unison".

638
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,200
which tests
the understanding of two people.

639
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,510
I will ask a question

640
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,720
and you both have to

641
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
answer it simultaneously.

642
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,910
Are you ready?

643
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,800
Yes.

644
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,990
I'm ready.

645
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,280
What does Xiaoqi like to eat?

646
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,070
- Fried chicken.
- Fried chicken.

647
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,640
What is Xiaoqi's second favourite food?

648
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,590
- Hotpot.
- Hotpot.

649
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,110
Then what is

650
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,590
Xiaoqi's least favourite food?

651
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,760
- No such thing.
- No such thing.

652
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,360
She loves to eat everything.

653
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,950
I'm going to increase the difficulty.

654
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,430
How many times has Xiaoqi
touched Mr. Fang's pecs?

655
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,030
- Seven times.
- 77 times.

656
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,320
78 times.

657
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,550
Xiaoqi.

658
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,320
When was it?

659
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,200
While you were asleep.

660
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,110
As expected of Xiaoqi.

661
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,070
Next question.

662
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,320
What is Fang Leng's favourite perfume

663
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,160
that Xiaoqi made for him?

664
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,280
Destiny Lover.

665
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,550
Cold Outside, Warm Inside.

666
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,360
Don't you like pheromone perfumes?

667
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,550
All those pheromone perfumes

668
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,840
are available to everyone else,

669
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,070
but this one

670
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,390
was made for me exclusively by you.

671
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,470
Only I have it.

672
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,030
Gosh.

673
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,470
When did Fang Leng

674
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,590
first speak up for Xiaoqi?

675
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,430
When my colleagues thought
I stole the hormone element.

676
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,200
When doing the gym live streaming.

677
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,910
When you were on live,

678
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,360
many of the comments
kept questioning you.

679
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,880
So I just swore back at them.

680
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,760
I remember.

681
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,030
Are you the one who sent

682
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,840
a lot of gifts during the live stream,

683
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,590
the Cold Icy Rain?

684
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:03,801
♪Whenever you're approaching me♪

685
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:12,481
♪Why is it familiar and strange
at the same time?♪

686
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:19,231
♪The hidden memories
are triggered suddenly♪
