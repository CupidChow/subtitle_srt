(Previously)

19
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,036
By the way, how are things going
on between you and Fang Leng?

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,519
He'll never have a
girlfriend with his temper.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,920
You don't have to
worry about love rivals.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
You know what?

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,560
Xiaoqi is a good woman.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,400
I won't allow you to do this to her.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,359
This is between me and her.

26
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,519
What does it have to do with you?

27
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,439
Ms. Chai,

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,879
are things really impossible

29
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,239
between you and Mr. Fang?

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,960
Xiaoqi.

31
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,280
Xiaoqi, listen to me.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,159
Keep your distance.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,999
You have a girlfriend now.

34
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,400
We're just work partners.

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,960
She's not my girlfriend.

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Xiaoqi is too naive.

37
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,200
If she continues to stay on earth,

38
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,560
she will only continue to
be deceived by Fang Leng.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,680
Will you be my girlfriend?

40
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,039
(I can complete the mission
if I'm with him.)

41
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,199
(Maybe I should agree to it.)

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,319
(It feels great to be in love.)

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,560
(Now I can absorb hormones openly.)

44
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
(When I leave earth,)

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,240
(I might never come back again.)

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,400
(Maybe)

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,520
(I'll never get to see
Fang Leng ever again.)

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,319
(Why does the thought of not seeing him)

49
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,479
(upset me a little?)

51
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,479
What do you think?

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
It's pretty.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,360
You've worked hard lately.

54
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,879
When this project is over,

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll take you on a trip

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
to eat fried chicken
from all over the world.

57
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,919
Okay.

58
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,240
(I'm leaving this planet,)

59
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,759
(yet Fang Leng is still
planning the future with me.)

(Sunny Apartment)
Xiaobu.

61
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,080
(Sunny Apartment)
Xiaobu?

62
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm here.

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,120
Xiaoqi.

64
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,759
What's wrong?

65
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,400
Look.

66
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,640
Look.

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
Don't let Chai see it.

68
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,879
What's going on? Why is this happening?

69
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,360
It seems to be installed
automatically by the system.

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,640
It can't be uninstalled.

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,960
In the past, when I turned into a
turtle, I just needed to cool down.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,200
With this heart shape,

73
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,280
it takes longer to get
back to human form.

74
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,239
Xiaoqi,

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,239
do you think I have
some kind of data cancer?

76
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,719
Data cancer?

77
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,919
Maybe it's just

78
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,320
an automatic system upgrade.

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
I can't even use the search engine.

80
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,159
Look.

81
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,063
(90% of the system is occupied by love.
No function is working.)

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,359
No way.

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,159
All right.

84
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,039
Stop.

85
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,039
All right.

86
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll take you to Candy

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,159
to run a check on your system, okay?

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,239
Babe,

89
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,200
that's how falling in love feels like.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
You blush because you're shy

91
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,119
and your heartbeat quickens
because you like him.

92
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,200
Once you truly fall in
love with each other,

93
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,760
you can't help but

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
think about him all the time.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,799
It's fine, Xiaoqi.

96
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,440
Maybe I'll recover in a few days.

97
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,200
Xiaoqi,

98
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,640
I can't even use
the search engine anymore.

99
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,159
Does it mean I can't be of
any help to you anymore?

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,880
It's okay, just take
care of yourself first.

101
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,479
However,

102
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,960
do you know

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,679
how to extend the time?

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,320
Extend the time?

105
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,960
I just feel that

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
Hormone Element we have

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,760
isn't refined enough.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,119
I'm thinking if we have more time,

109
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,000
the extraction process
can be more refined.

110
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,880
Got it.

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,520
Slow work yields fine products, right?

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,039
Yes.

113
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,080
You're right.

114
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,719
Slow work yields fine
products. That's great.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,599
Yes.

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,840
Slow...

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
Is it done?

118
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,559
It's almost done.

119
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,640
There is a comparison on the instrument.

120
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,280
If there is a mistake,
just continue to adjust.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,919
Okay.

122
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,200
Here.

123
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:20,640
Mr. Fang.

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,239
Mr. Fang,

125
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,080
the gear is working fine.

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,960
We need some time

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
to do some comparisons.

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Look at the data.

129
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,119
After running for a while,

130
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:31,960
if nothing goes wrong,

131
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,760
then it's fixed.

132
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,719
What about this part?

133
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,719
This part

134
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,440
needs to be adjusted slightly.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,359
That's right. Okay.

136
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,159
Look, there's also this data.

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
If nothing goes wrong by tomorrow,

138
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,119
our work can fully resume.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,719
What's going on?

140
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,599
What happened?

141
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
What's going on here?

142
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,880
Why did it stop working?

143
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,679
Wasn't it fixed not long ago?

144
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,039
Has it broken down again?

145
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,000
How long will it take to repair it?

146
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,320
It seems

147
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,960
it will take probably a week.

148
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,840
A week?

149
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,280
It's okay.

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,599
We can collect the hormones first.

151
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
Fix it as soon as possible

152
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,760
and schedule an experiment.

153
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,479
Got it, Mr. Fang.

154
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,599
Let's go.

155
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:38,239
(This hormones collector
is so insensitive.)

156
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,960
(I'm sure it will take a while)

157
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,239
(to collect enough hormones
that meet extraction standard.)

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,239
What are you doing?

159
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,960
Wait, this...

160
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,840
How did it become this
way all of a sudden?

161
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,000
I forgot to tell you.

162
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,479
The research department
has improved the collector.

163
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,319
Its sensitivity and speed

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,839
are tripled.

165
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:35,679
Just now...

166
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
Where did the thing go?

167
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,640
It was right here.

168
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,400
Sorry, give me a minute.

169
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,559
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

170
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,240
The computer suddenly crashed.

171
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,959
The proposal I prepared earlier
on for the press conference

172
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,039
is also gone.

173
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,839
It...

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,199
It was right here.

175
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,280
- What's going on?
- (I'm sorry.)

176
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,880
(I just temporarily hid it)

177
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,319
(in a corner of the computer.)

178
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,240
Fortunately,

179
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
I made a backup on the USB.

180
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
Sorry, wait a minute.

181
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,000
Done.

182
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,559
You can reserve the press
conference venue anytime.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
Go ahead and follow up.

184
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Okay.

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,439
(It seems)

186
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,839
(no matter how I try to buy time,)

187
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,919
(it won't change the outcome.)

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't worry.

189
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
I've prepared farewell
gifts for everyone.

190
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,760
Let's give them tomorrow.

191
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,360
We're leaving already.

192
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,919
I don't want to say goodbye.

193
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,400
Me, too.

194
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,360
Do you think

195
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,240
they will forget us

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,839
if we leave just like that?

197
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,079
Will we never see them again?

198
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sure they will.

199
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,839
Saying goodbye and forgetting

200
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
is a part of life.

201
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,199
They are still young.

202
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,600
In the future, they will meet people

203
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,120
who matter a lot more than us in life.

204
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
Besides, when we go back,

205
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,600
we will eventually lose contact.

206
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,919
It's faster to forget someone.

207
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,799
I hate to lose contact with them.

208
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't they sell that thing
on Cape Town Planet?

209
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,799
An interstellar phone.

210
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,319
We can buy that and
use it to contact them.

211
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,000
How much does it cost?

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,799
It costs 9,999 Cape Town
Planet kyanite to buy one.

213
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,880
How much do we have?

214
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,720
We...

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
We only have nine.

216
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,199
I know what we can do.

217
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,919
I still have the salary card
that Fang Leng gave me.

218
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm getting paid tomorrow.

219
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,079
Then, I'll calculate

220
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,159
how many we can exchange.

221
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,679
I'm mistaken.

222
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,039
One, two, three, four.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
So few.

224
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,240
One, two, three, four, five.

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,079
We can only exchange six kyanites.

226
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,000
Even if I buy a mobile phone,

227
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,439
(Roaming card)
I have to purchase a roaming card

228
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,760
(Monthly package)
and a monthly package.

229
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,720
I also need to pay the roaming fees

230
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,079
(Roaming fee)
between Cape Town Planet and earth.

231
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,319
It's too expensive.

232
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:51,959
A cake?

233
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,240
You're not surprised at all.

234
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,600
What happened just now?

235
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,919
Nothing.

236
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,280
Are you busy with work?

237
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,039
Will you forget me

238
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,720
if we part ways in the future?

239
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,880
What do you mean?

240
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,439
I don't mean anything.

241
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,559
I'm thirsty.

242
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,480
I want some water.

243
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait here.

244
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,643
(Sunny Apartment)

245
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,600
Thanks.

246
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:18,403
(Chai's Favourite)

247
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,003
(Foreign language tutor, 8-12K,
handing out flyers, 90/day)

248
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:29,123
(Property agent/8-10K)

249
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:29,863
(Fire house monitoring, 6-8K)

250
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:30,919
Take a look at this.

251
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,839
What do you think about
handing out flyers?

252
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:33,919
(Handing out flyers, 80/day)
What do you think?

253
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,159
It pays RMB80 a day.

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,959
Then we need 20,520 days

255
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,159
to save enough kyanites
to buy a mobile phone,

256
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
provided we don't eat and drink

257
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,679
and have zero expenses.

258
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
A foreign language tutor?

259
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,079
My system can be changed

260
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,280
to languages of different countries.

261
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,240
I think that is good.

262
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,159
However, we don't have
a teacher's license.

263
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,919
We'll get one.

264
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,839
It takes time to sit for the exam.

265
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,319
Most importantly,

266
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,880
we may not even pass
the physical examination.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,240
Physical...

268
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,520
You're right.

269
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,240
Girls, come here, hurry up.

270
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,159
- Coming.
- Coming.

271
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,919
It's so heavy. What's this?

272
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,439
Facial masks.

273
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,159
I'm sure you don't know.

274
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,959
The discounts at duty free shops abroad

275
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,120
make these very cheap.

276
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,079
I asked the agent to
stock up some for me.

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,039
It costs less than RMB3 a piece.

278
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,319
RMB3?

279
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,079
So cheap?

280
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,280
That's not the cheapest.

281
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,799
It's even cheaper in stores.

282
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,839
I guess the agent

283
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,000
at least made 50% profit from it.

284
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,520
Come on, these two
are suitable for your skin.

285
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,959
Try it. If it works,

286
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,760
just let me know.

287
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,600
Thanks, Chai.

288
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
You're welcome.

289
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,199
What kind of mask is this?

290
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:44,959
Let's see.

291
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,439
Facial masks.

292
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,360
Agent?

293
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
Silly me.

294
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,199
We are on earth now.

295
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,839
When we go back to home planet,

296
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,000
we can bring the things on earth

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
back to our home planet.

298
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,760
We'll be interstellar purchasing agents.

299
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
Then we can make a lot of money.

300
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,559
You're right.

301
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,319
There are so many delicious
and fun things on earth.

302
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,839
I'm sure the friends
of our planet will like it.

303
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,280
Then, we can...

304
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,039
We can

305
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,199
make lots of money.

306
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,439
- I'm so smart.
- You're so smart.

307
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,360
I think I'm very smart, too.

308
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Candy.

309
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,880
One, two, three, four.

310
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,760
Four bags.

311
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,559
Why does it feel like
there isn't enough?

312
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,959
We have many friends.

313
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,799
I guess I'll have to buy more.

314
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,880
Here's your express delivery.

315
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,280
Thanks.

316
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,640
Ms. Chai,

317
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:47,640
you bought so many local specialties.

318
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,760
Are you going home for Chinese New Year?

319
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,079
No. It's because Xiaobu and I

321
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,600
want to sell this stuff

322
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,880
as a part-time job to earn extra income.

323
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,079
Mr. Han,

324
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,039
wait a second.

325
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Let me tell you, this book is amazing.

326
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
I found this in a used bookstore

327
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,880
and bought it for you.

328
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,679
(108 Tricks To Dominate the Workplace)
It's a very good book.

329
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
(108 Tricks To Dominate the Workplace)
I think it really suits you.

330
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:17,720
The original price of this book

331
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,720
was RMB1,998.

332
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
As a friend, I'll sell it
to you at a discount.

333
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
108 Tricks

334
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,319
To Dominate the Workplace?

335
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,559
How much is it?

336
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,760
RMB998.

337
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,679
I don't think I need it.

338
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,480
You do.

Just RMB998

340

can get you a promotion and a raise

on your career path

342
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,400
and a bright future.

343
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
Don't you think it suits you?

344
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,280
Ms. Chai, can you issue an invoice?

A purchasing agent?

347
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,640
Is Xiaoqi short of money?

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
For a book with the original
price of RMB98,

349
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,199
Ms. Chai sold it at RMB998.

350
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:00,559
If she wasn't short of money,

351
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,039
then she's trying to fool others.

352
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,720
Of course,

353
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,879
I bought this book

354
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,559
purely out of love for learning.

355
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,319
Where's Xiaoqi?

356
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,200
Ms. Chai went out to meet client.

357
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:21,003
(Fang Leng, where are you?)

When we go our separate
ways in the future,

364
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,240
will you forget me?

365
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:13,403
(Xiaoqi, are you going to leave me?)

366
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,039
It's rare that you're jealous.

367
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm so happy.

368
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,039
I can keep you here.

369
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,839
What do I do

370
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,160
if you leave just like that?

371
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,440
What do I do, Xiaoqi?

372
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
You left without saying goodbye.

373
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,720
Can I get her back?

374
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,039
Please.

375
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,520
Doctor,

376
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,599
how is he?

377
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:23,680
He's fine.

378
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
He just needs to take a good rest

379
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,079
and recuperate while the injury heals.

380
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
Thanks, doctor.

381
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,240
This way, please.

382
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,119
Mr. Fang,

383
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,039
you should be more careful.

384
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,319
I was worried sick.

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,079
I've already informed Ms. Chai.

386
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,839
She'll be here in a minute.

387
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,720
Fang Leng!

388
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,240
Fang Leng!

389
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,399
What happened?

390
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
How's your injury?

391
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,359
Is it serious?

392
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:44,599
Let me take a look.

393
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,480
You...

394
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,879
What? Don't speak.

395
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,039
Your arms will get cold. Put them in.

396
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,039
- Here.
- Wait.

397
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,280
What is it?

398
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
Are you going to talk about work?

399
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,079
Just let Mr. Han help you.

400
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,359
Don't worry.

401
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,000
- However...
- Enough.

402
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,839
Your job now

403
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,280
is to take a good rest

404
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,119
and recuperate.

405
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,399
Don't think about anything else.

406
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,440
Stop worrying. Wait a minute.

407
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,839
I have a question.

408
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,200
Who are you?

409
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
What do you mean?

410
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,879
Is he really ill?

411
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,119
It must have hurt a lot.

412
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,119
Ms. Chai.

413
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,639
The doctor said not to take
the medicine on an empty stomach.

414
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,079
Cook a bowl of noodles for Mr. Fang.

415
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,039
Hurry. Cook a bowl of noodles.

416
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,160
- I'll cook noodles for you.
- That's right.

417
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,079
Be good and stay here.

418
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,000
Braised beef noodles.

419
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,160
- Mr. Fang's favourite.
- Okay.

420
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,079
I'll cook for you.

421
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,000
- Wait here.
- Okay.

422
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,359
What's going on?

423
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,280
Why did he ask who I was?

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Is she our client?

425
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,839
It was raining just now.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Is it a relapse

427
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,879
of your amnesia?

428
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Ms. Chai

429
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,359
is your girlfriend.

430
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,879
At first, you didn't see eye to eye.

431
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,000
You ended up falling in love anyway.

432
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,000
The process was difficult.

433
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,399
Do you remember now?

434
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,280
It doesn't matter.

435
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,440
I forget a lot of people
every time it rains.

436
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,799
Tell her to leave.

437
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,799
Well, you can't,

438
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,559
because...

439
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,079
It's because you need Ms. Chai's help

440
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,399
for the hormone fragrance.

441
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,680
Without Ms. Chai,

442
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
the project can't continue.

443
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,879
Besides, you need someone

444
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,799
to look after you right now.

445
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,879
Let Ms. Chai stay.

446
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,879
Amnesia?

447
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,039
The doctor said

448
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,240
it's temporary amnesia
caused by the car accident.

449
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm not sure when he will recover.

450
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,119
It might be half a year

451
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,039
or two weeks.

452
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,960
It's possible.

453
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,839
What can I do

454
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,879
to make him recover

455
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,440
sooner?

456
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,160
Just take care of Mr. Fang
in the meantime.

457
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,799
Maybe he will remember everything

458
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,119
when certain memory is triggered.

459
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,440
By the way, Ms. Chai,

460
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
I have something to do
in the office. I'll go first.

461
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,039
I'll leave Mr. Fang to your care.

462
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,039
Amnesia?

463
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,559
(Fortunately, I responded quickly.)

464
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,280
(Ms. Chai mustn't know about)

465
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,160
(the rainy weather
heterosexual amnesia.)

466
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,799
(They finally started
dating a few days ago.)

467
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,200
(Why is he having amnesia now?)

468
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,280
(The reality is cruel.)

469
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,639
What should we do?

470
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,839
Come on.

471
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,639
How is it?

472
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,240
Has the R&D department
theft been solved?

473
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,079
It is,

474
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,200
but he has amnesia again.

475
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Fang Leng got into a car accident.

476
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,799
He was diagnosed with temporary amnesia

477
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,079
and he doesn't even remember me.

478
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,079
It's a good thing.

479
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,119
However...

480
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Why amnesia?

481
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,200
This will significantly hamper

482
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,440
our mission progress.

483
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,920
It seems we will stay
on earth for a while.

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,680
Really?

485
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,920
We're out of luck.

486
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,440
We have no choice but
to stay on earth longer.

487
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,280
No way.

488
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,280
Don't worry.

489
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,559
I will definitely cure his amnesia.

490
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,403
(Hormone Element data)

491
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,319
Fang Leng.

492
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:28,799
Take a look at this.

493
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:29,960
What's this?

494
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,359
I only drink Americano, thank you.

495
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,920
Wrong.

496
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,680
I am mashed taro, while
you are milk green tea.

497
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,399
Mashed taro kissing milk green tea.

498
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,399
Kissing?

499
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,760
A kiss.

500
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,240
A kiss.

501
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,559
Do you remember?

502
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,720
No, I mean it. I'm your girlfriend.

503
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,319
You will regret it if
you kick me out now.

504
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,480
Although Mr. Han did remind me,

505
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
we still don't know each other.

506
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
So, we must keep our distance.

507
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,480
No, I'm really your girlfriend.

508
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,920
Your company will go out of business

509
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,879
without experimental sample.

510
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,559
Don't joke with me about my work!

511
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,879
You...

512
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:18,643
(Mr. Fang, great news, the equipment
in the research department is fixed.)

513
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:20,443
(When your memory is recovered,)

514
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:21,763
(you'll be able to collect
Hormone Element from Chai.)

515
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,520
Do you remember?

516
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,319
I only said that for work.

517
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
Do you remember

518
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,160
I used to deliver food to you

519
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,440
in this outfit?

520
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,399
They let you into the company
when you're wearing this outfit.

521
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,559
That means our company's security system

522
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,799
really needs an upgrade.

523
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,799
Let me tell you.

524
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,559
One needs to be responsible.

525
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,720
If you didn't like to eat
chicken drumsticks

526
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,160
in the beginning,

527
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,440
you shouldn't have said you liked it

528
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,280
or made a request halfway.

529
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,280
However, you can't suddenly
keep your distance

530
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,240
from chicken drumstick
without saying a word.

531
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,440
I care.

532
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm talking about the chicken drumstick.

533
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,480
Get up.

534
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,639
Come on.

535
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,960
Get up.

536
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,319
I'm telling you.

537
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,960
Starting today, you can only eat
the chicken drumsticks I buy.

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,799
Do you hear me?

539
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,359
Starting today, you can only eat

540
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,359
the chicken drumsticks I buy.

541
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
Don't eat fried chicken given by others.

542
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
Do you remember now?

543
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,119
I wouldn't have done

544
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
nor said such a strange thing.

545
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,520
Moreover,

546
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,200
I would never eat
this type of junk food.

547
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,960
You're acting like yourself now.

548
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,240
That

549
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,639
should make you remember.

550
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,839
Easy.

551
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't use so much force.

552
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,680
(This should work.)

553
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,559
This is the time.

554
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,520
No.

555
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,720
You should be hugging
my neck at this time

556
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,119
and the two of us will
fall on our backs.

557
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,000
Come on, one more time.

558
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,480
One more time. One...

559
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,280
Forget it.

560
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,839
I'm sure it's nothing important

561
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,039
if I can't remember.

562
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:42,520
Go to sleep.

563
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,280
Just once more.

564
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:45,639
Once.

565
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:52,359
Why?

566
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,440
What's the purpose of doing this?

567
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,963
(Implanting virus)

568
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:13,839
What are you doing?

569
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,960
Implant computer virus

570
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,119
to break the heart-shaped
firewall directly.

571
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,000
(Implanting virus)
What

572
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,000
if it crashes?

573
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,119
Well, I couldn't uninstall it.

574
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,839
I'm resorting to a drastic measure.

575
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:37,363
(Virus invading)

576
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:39,603
(Failed)

577
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,079
Computer viruses on earth are too weak.

578
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,359
None of them is challenging.

579
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm so mad.

580
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,559
Why did you come back?

581
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,799
Aren't you supposed to be
taking care of Fang Leng?

582
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,359
I'm upset.

583
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,000
Why?

584
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,160
He remembers everyone,

585
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,720
except me.

586
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,599
I'm his girlfriend!

587
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,000
Why are you upset?

588
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,960
You became his girlfriend

589
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,440
for the sake of the mission.

590
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,280
It's not as if you like him.

591
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,119
You're right.

592
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,000
That makes a lot of sense.

593
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Why am I upset?

594
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,799
I remember

595
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,280
taste can stimulate

596
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,720
a person's nervous system
that stores memory.

597
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
Didn't you cook for Fang Leng before?

598
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,559
Yes.

599
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,599
The recipe.

600
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,119
Chai's recipe.

601
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,200
Very reliable.

602
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,843
(Sunny Apartment)

603
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,200
Steal a glance and a kiss.

604
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:51,480
Checked.

605
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,879
Fly To Your Heart.

606
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,599
Checked.

607
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,440
Steamed Marinated Pork
with Dried Plum Vegetables.

608
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,280
Checked.

609
00:29:59,079 --> 00:29:59,680
Marinated...

610
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,440
Where's the marinated pork?

611
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:03,559
It doesn't matter.

612
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:04,920
Not bad at all.

613
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,039
You did very well today.

614
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,920
Although we messed it up last time,

615
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,240
we'll reverse the situation this time

616
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,720
and Fang Leng will
recall those memories.

617
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,359
Okay.

618
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,000
I think that's how you do it.

619
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Great.

620
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
Is it done?

621
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,680
Don't force yourself if you
don't know how to cook.

622
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,200
The experience of burning
the kitchen once is enough.

623
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,440
I'll tidy up this place.

624
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,039
Did you remember something?

625
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,359
How do you know I can't cook?

626
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,480
Isn't that obvious?

627
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,520
It's all burnt.

628
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,599
Right.

629
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,520
How do you know I burnt the kitchen?

630
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,639
Mr. Han told me

631
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,200
to keep you away from
kitchen at all costs.

632
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,520
Stop cooking. Tidy up

633
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,839
and ask Mr. Han to order food instead.

634
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,920
Mr. Han.

635
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,160
I have something to ask you.

636
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,319
Did you ever tell Fang Leng

637
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,280
to keep me away from
the kitchen no matter what

638
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,440
and that I burnt the kitchen once?

639
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:09,893
(Han)

640
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,920
He remembers now?

641
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
I've scanned the QR code.

642
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:17,879
Okay, thank you.

643
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,960
Welcome.

644
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,879
Milk tea, please.

645
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,879
(Why is he here again?)

646
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,000
Xiaobu,

647
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,319
can I have a word with you?

648
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,399
Do you remember

649
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,039
the hot spring hotel we went to?

650
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,160
This is the flyer for that hotel.

651
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,359
I picked it up specially.

652
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,280
I also saw

653
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,039
the small robot we saw

654
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,639
at the entrance.

655
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:19,720
Do you remember?

656
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,319
You told me

657
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,480
you upgraded its system.

658
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,000
You didn't upgrade its system.

659
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Of course you can't control it.

660
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,839
We even played computer
games together in the hotel.

661
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,760
That's great.

662
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,119
You're amazing.

663
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,680
After playing computer games,

664
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,079
you asked me to date you.

665
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,039
Fang Lie,

666
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,639
go out with me.

667
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,399
Just say yes. Don't make
life miserable for me.

668
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
There're also these glasses.

669
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,359
These are the incredible
sunglasses you gave me.

670
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,280
We stargazed in the universe together.

671
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,520
You said to me,

672
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,560
(You just need to be brave
enough to go home.)

673
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,919
(On the other hand, I have
to fix my computer system.)

674
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,999
You even remember that?

675
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Of course I remember.

676
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,359
Those were such good memories.

677
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:27,120
There's also this.

678
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,919
Today

679
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,200
(World Football Day)
is our 56th day together.

680
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,879
(56th day together with Xiaobu)
I write one every day.

681
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:39,879
To be precise,

682
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,760
It's 55 days, eight hours
and three minutes.

683
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,519
The first 30 days in a relationship
is the honeymoon period.

684
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,720
The next 30 days is the burnout period.

685
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,640
As long as we get through
the next 30 days together,

686
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,200
we can enter a stable period.

687
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,799
So it's normal

688
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:09,999
for us to have a little conflict.

689
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,359
The key is that we have
to be understanding

690
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,479
and overcome this together.

691
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:39,919
By the way,

692
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,319
I also got you a present.

693
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,359
Fang Lie,

694
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,359
why did you come back?

695
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,959
Why didn't you stay with
Xiaobu for a while longer?

696
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,399
I don't know what got into her.

697
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,200
She's been ignoring me for days.

698
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,200
It's normal

699
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,280
for a girl to throw a tantrum

700
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,640
sometimes.

701
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Think carefully.

702
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,760
Did you upset her?

703
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:21,919
I don't think so.

704
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,999
I look for her almost every day

705
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,839
after we came back from the forest.

706
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,439
However, she...

707
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,799
I know.

708
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,240
Is it because I've been
pestering her recently,

709
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,439
that I haven't been painting properly?

710
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,640
That's right.

711
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Let me tell you.

712
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,680
Girls

713
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,519
like the kind of guys

714
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,760
who focus on their careers the most.

715
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,999
So I believe that when
you finish painting,

716
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,280
Xiaobu will talk to you again.

717
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:48,200
Thanks, Chai.

718
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,439
Time for breakfast!

719
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,640
Come and eat your breakfast.

720
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,120
Come on.

721
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,720
This is your favourite dough fritters.

722
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,359
I don't like fried food.

723
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,519
You don't need to test me.

724
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,040
I lost my memory, not became stupid.

725
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,600
Just take a bite.

726
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,959
Then you

727
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:22,240
can only drink this.

728
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,160
(Century egg pork porridge,
snow fungus porridge)

729
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,839
Drink it.

730
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,280
It's strange.

731
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,560
How did you know I liked sweet stuff?

732
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,959
I didn't.

733
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,439
It's because I like savoury food.

734
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,879
That's even weirder.

735
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,999
You just said you lost your
memory, not became stupid.

736
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,160
You said

737
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,160
you remembered you disliked fried food.

738
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,640
How come you don't remember
this snow fungus porridge

739
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,399
is your favourite?

740
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,439
I'm tired of eating it.

741
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,040
I want to have a change of taste.

742
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:04,839
I'm going back to my room to work.

743
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:13,600
How convenient to have
a change of taste right now.

744
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,760
He didn't lose his memory.

745
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,640
He did.

746
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,359
He didn't lose his memory.

747
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,040
He did.

748
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
He didn't lose his memory.

749
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,959
He...

750
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,640
Did he lose his memory or not?

751
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,120
All right.

752
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:01,799
You're my only hope.

753
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:05,040
Come on.

754
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,120
Let's eat.

755
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,120
There're a lot of dishes.

756
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,120
Yes.

757
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,080
You need nourishment
since you're injured,

758
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,319
right? Eat.

759
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,399
Everything is your favourite.

760
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,319
It's quite spicy, isn't it?

761
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,080
Drink some water.

762
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,959
Let's drink. Cheers.

763
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Cheers.

764
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,319
Cheers.

765
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,160
This is spicy.

766
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
It's burning.

767
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,280
Come on. Let's drink.

768
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:49,640
Drink to your heart's content.

769
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,999
We have more than enough red wine.

770
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,359
Let me pour you some.

771
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,640
Here. Come on.

772
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,280
Cheers.

773
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Cheers.

774
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:12,080
Cheers.

775
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,399
There's none left.

776
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,319
I want more.

777
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,080
Are you feeling sleepy?

778
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,919
I'm not.

779
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,160
Follow me.

780
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,040
No.

781
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,799
Come on.

782
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:39,879
I'll give you a drink.

783
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:40,519
A drink.

784
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,359
Yes, a drink.

785
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:42,879
I want to drink a lot.

786
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,040
Let's go.

787
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,319
Let's go.

788
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,439
Come on. Let's go.

789
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,080
I want to drink more.

790
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,879
There's no liquor.

791
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:51,040
I want to drink liquor.

792
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,919
Okay, I'll bring you some.

793
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,240
I want to drink more.

794
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,399
All right, sit down
and rest for a while.

795
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,359
Here.

796
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,919
Good boy.

797
00:40:58,919 --> 00:40:59,760
Good boy.

798
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:00,919
Stay still.

799
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,040
Do you want to answer my question first?

800
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,319
What do you mean?

801
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,439
Do you really have amnesia?

802
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,479
I...

803
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:14,120
I want to visit the amusement park.

804
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,519
Visit the amusement park

805
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,120
and get on the carousel.

806
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,040
I miss my mother.

807
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
- The amusement park is closed.
- I'm going to the arcade

808
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,640
to play games.

809
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,839
The arcade is also closed.

810
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,240
- We won't go there.
- I want to play games.

811
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,080
No, I want to go.

812
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,240
We won't go there.

813
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,200
Come back here.

814
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,359
Sit.

815
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,040
Don't yell.

816
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,799
Be good.

817
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:33,999
Don't yell.

818
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,439
I thought it'd be easier

819
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,399
to get Fang Leng to talk.

820
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,839
Who knew he'd be like this?

821
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,560
You hate me. Sister, you hate me.

822
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,280
I don't hate you.

823
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,959
You yelled at me because you hated me.

824
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,919
Be a good boy.

825
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:54,280
All right, I don't hate you.

826
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,999
I don't dislike you.

827
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,799
I like you.

828
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:57,680
I don't hate you.

829
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,640
You don't hate me? Then you like me.

830
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,919
I like you?

831
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,839
According to my mother,

832
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,399
if one does not hate another,

833
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,519
that's love.

834
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
Do you love me?
