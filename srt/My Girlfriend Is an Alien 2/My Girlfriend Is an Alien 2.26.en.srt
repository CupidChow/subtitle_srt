Shiyi, sorry.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,320
I came back late.

21
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,001
Xiaoqi.

22
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:04,800
Happy birthday.

23
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,120
Did you prepare all this for me?

24
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,840
Xiaoqi, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,840
I can only make you

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
such a size of starry space
with my powers now.

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
When we get back,

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll make it up to you.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,881
It's okay. It's good enough.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Well then.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Wish you happiness forever.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,921
There's even a cake.

33
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,240
Thanks.

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,361
I'm sure someone must have given you

35
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:16,400
your own starry sky for your birthday.

36
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,801
It takes a lot of power
to gather the stars.

37
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,121
My friends

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,801
are not capable of this yet.

39
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,840
However, every time I have a birthday,

40
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,241
there are always

41
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,920
a lot more stars in the sky than usual.

42
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,121
I consider it

43
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,881
a gift from the galaxy.

44
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,881
Will I be able to see the stars today?

45
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:19,241
Stars.

46
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280
Why are you laughing?

47
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,040
Nothing.

48
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,641
I'll share some stories with you later.

49
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:56,720
Okay.

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,641
Now, don't just stand there.

51
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,480
Cut the cake.

52
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:00,561
- Okay.
- Come on.

53
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,081
Thank you.

54
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,660
(Matcha latte, see you at 8 p.m.)

55
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,241
It's late. He should be back by now.

56
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,001
I knew I couldn't trust Earthlings.

57
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,801
Xiaoqi.

58
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,321
Wait a moment.

59
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,480
Xiaoqi, I knew...

60
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,321
I knew you'd come.

61
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,801
It was raining so hard.

62
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,480
Why didn't you take shelter first?

63
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,920
Yes.

64
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,801
I didn't expect it to rain.

65
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
When it wasn't raining just now,

66
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,161
the sky was full of stars.

67
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
The stars weren't visible in the rain.

68
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
So I set up these lights

69
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,240
to make it look like a starry sky.

70
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,240
What's wrong?

71
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,120
You know

72
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,201
I'm only working with you

73
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,640
for the hormones.

74
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,561
It has nothing to do
with you personally, right?

75
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,561
I know.

76
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:57,561
Then you know

77
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,041
that every time I turn you down,

78
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,401
I mean it, right?

79
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,401
I'm well aware.

80
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,120
I rejected you straight away

81
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360
when I first met you

82
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,681
at The One.

83
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,521
Then you keep showing up

84
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,720
in different guises.

85
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
No matter what I say,

86
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,840
you won't give up.

87
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,081
Is it because you're too idle

88
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:19,760
or because I haven't made it clear?

89
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,201
It's because I like you.

90
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
That's just ridiculous.

91
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,880
When you love someone,

92
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,441
you're willing to do
anything foolish for them.

93
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:34,640
This is just the first

94
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,441
silly thing I've done for you today.

95
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,801
In the future,

96
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,561
I'd do the same
for the rest of my life.

97
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:44,201
You...

98
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,561
I've turned you down so many times.

99
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,640
Don't you feel disappointed?

100
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,281
I've actually thought about it.

101
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,801
Every time you reject me,

102
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,480
I hope you feel a little sad.

103
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,281
That way I will think that

104
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,840
you still have a slight feeling for me.

Happy birthday.

132
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,041
This is the starry sky I have
decorated especially for you.

133
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:18,441
Do you like it?

134
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:35,401
This is for you.

135
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,401
It's okay.

136
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,760
Would you like to dance with me?

137
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,681
The starry sky is beautiful.

138
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,681
Thank you.

139
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,360
I appreciate it.

140
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:10,441
You're welcome.

141
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,640
Still, I won't

142
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,441
fall for you so soon.

143
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:23,600
Getting you to fall in love with me

144
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,960
is something I have to work on myself.

145
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,281
I won't force you.

146
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,640
Don't do this.

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,081
Fang Leng.

148
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,240
What's wrong?

149
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,321
Fang Leng.

150
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
You're awake.

151
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,441
Slowly.

152
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,441
The doctor said

153
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,720
you caught a cold from the rain.

154
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,561
Take your medication
regularly and rest well.

155
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,480
Then you'll be fine.

156
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,240
Thanks.

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,360
It's late.

158
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
Why don't you go back first?

159
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,561
Fang Lie will take care of me.

160
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,401
Let me help you.

161
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Get some rest.

162
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,000
Here.

163
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,281
Thanks.

164
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,840
Don't worry.

165
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,720
I'll take care of you

166
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,880
until you recover.

167
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,321
Really?

168
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:44,681
On our planet,

169
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,561
we always commit to accountability.

170
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
You caught a cold in
the rain waiting for me.

171
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,720
Of course, if you don't want to,

172
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,360
I respect your choice.

173
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,880
- I'll call Fang Lie.
- No need.

174
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
I like that commitment.

175
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,521
I'll take this call.

176
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
Hello, Xiaoqi.

177
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,401
It's late.

178
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,321
Why aren't you back yet?

179
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,720
I need to report something to you.

180
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,360
Fang Leng is sick.

181
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Can I look after him here overnight?

182
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:49,041
I'll be back soon tomorrow.

183
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,960
All right.

184
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,060
(Sunny Apartment)

185
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,400
Does he like pink?

186
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,081
It's quite comfortable.

187
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Fang Leng.

188
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,200
What's wrong? Fang Leng.

189
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:04,721
What are you doing?

190
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:05,880
Go.

191
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:07,761
Xiaoqi.

192
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:08,321
Stop right there!

193
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,281
Are you all right, Fang Leng?

194
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,640
Fang Leng.

195
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,120
Fang Leng.

196
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,081
Such a dream again.

197
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,241
Why are you still up?

198
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,160
I can't sleep. So I work for a while.

199
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:39,721
What about you?

200
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,761
Did you have a nightmare?

201
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,680
Not really.

202
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,321
Well...

203
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,561
I have a question.

204
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,721
Has something

205
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,440
happened to us before?

206
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,801
Are you remembering everything?

207
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,001
Remember?

208
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,120
I had a dream about you in a hospital.

209
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,880
You were badly injured

210
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,081
and you were lying on my shoulder.

211
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,880
Hospital?

212
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Some people were taking pictures of us.

213
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,160
And something about

214
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,761
taking a picture every day.

215
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,961
What were we like

216
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:20,120
in the dream?

217
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:22,840
We looked so intimate,

218
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:24,440
like we were in love.

219
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:27,400
But those things never happen

220
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,801
in real life.

221
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,961
Could it be us

222
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,721
in another parallel dimension?

223
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
Maybe you've rejected
me too many times,

224
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,081
you and I, who are in love
in another parallel time,

225
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,200
would like to remind you in a dream

226
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,321
that you should give me a chance.

227
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,561
That's impossible.

228
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,241
Our home planet has long denied

229
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,721
the existence of
parallel space and time.

230
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,561
The universe is constantly evolving.

231
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,281
It is impossible to waste time and space

232
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,241
to create a similar world.

233
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,321
Besides,

234
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
even if I were in
a different time and place,

235
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,481
I would follow the beliefs
of our home planet

236
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:04,721
and eliminate all emotions.

237
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,360
However, once an ideal becomes a belief,

238
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,561
it creates more blind followers.

239
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,761
Xiaoqi.

240
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:12,321
Are you really sure

241
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,640
that the faith of your planet

242
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,600
is perfect?

243
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,561
Certainly.

244
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,440
Our planet's technology has always been

245
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,281
at the forefront of the universe,

246
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
much more advanced

247
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,721
than Earth.

248
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,440
Then are you happy

249
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,120
in the light of this faith?

250
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:30,400
Happy?

251
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,160
On Earth,

252
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:36,721
we are all free

253
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,440
to do what we like,

254
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,321
to pursue who we like

255
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,880
and to live the life we like.

256
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,680
Everyone being is born with

257
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,840
the right to pursue love and freedom.

258
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:49,440
Which faith do you prefer,

259
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,721
your planet

260
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:52,920
or Earth?

261
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,761
If you haven't experienced

262
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,440
such happiness in Cape Town,

263
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:02,801
can you try to accept the Earth

264
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,521
and try to accept me?

265
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm from Cape Town Planet.

266
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,400
I will respect and follow

267
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,801
the beliefs of my home planet.

268
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,160
Moreover,

269
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,481
Jiang Shiyi and I are a genetic match.

270
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
I will not betray him,

271
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,321
let alone my home planet.

272
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,801
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

273
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,561
Why do I feel sad?

274
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,360
Every time you reject me,

275
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,281
I hope you feel a little sad.

276
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,001
That way I will think that

277
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,160
you still have a slight feeling for me.

278
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:58,920
That's a risky thought.

279
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,481
No, forget about it.

280
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:18,920

Didn't the doctor say
to take medicine on time?

284
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,561
Did you forget?

285
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,001
Thanks.

286
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,321
It is bitter.

287

Eat this for relief.

288
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:55,561
So you care about me.

289
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,440
I just don't want to waste it.

290
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,801
How could my heart be racing?

291
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,321
What am I thinking?

292
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,120
I'm here to complete my mission.

293
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,321
Yes, focus on it.

294
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,961
Come in.

295
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:45,801
It's time to get off work.

296
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,521
You are in a much better condition.

297

So I'll go back to Jiang Shiyi.

298
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,041
Bye.

299
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,041
What's the matter?
Are you not feeling well?

300
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,481
I feel a bit dizzy.

301

You may go. I'm fine.

Slowly.

306
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,041
Are you very unwell?

You're right.

Okay.

00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:32,041
No.

345
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,041
Dr. Zhang has been busy

346
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,200
with his overseas training.

347
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,281
I have no time to see him.

348
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,481
Don't bother me. Go on.

349
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,001
Hello, Xiaoqi.

350
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,840
Xiaobu, Fang Leng is missing.

351
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Missing?

352
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,920
Two hours ago,

353
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,640
he said he had to go out,

354
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,481
but he hasn't come back yet.

355
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,481
I haven't been able to reach him.

356
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,600
So I'm a little worried that
something might have happened to him.

357
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,640
If you had given up on Xiaoqi earlier,

358
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,761
none of this would have happened.

359
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,880
I've already told you

360
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,561
that you and Xiaoqi are impossible.

361
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,081
Why don't you just give up?

362
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:16,961
You weren't even mad

363
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,321
when Xiaoqi was at my house yesterday.

364
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,360
So why are you so worked up today?

365
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,241
Or is it obvious to you

366
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,640
that Xiaoqi is likely to let you down?

367
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,001
Why do you keep deceiving her?

368
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,600
Deceive?

369
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,521
You should be the one
who is deceiving her, Jiang Shiyi.

370
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm protecting her.

371
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,801
Are brainwashing and captivity

372
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:48,440
the protection of your planet?

373
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,961
You just turned her into a puppet.

374
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:00,640
Fang Leng.

375
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,400
Do you really think

376
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,920
the Interstellar Peace Law

377
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,041
can really restrain me?

378
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,321
I'll give you one last chance.

379
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:09,920
So you better think it through.

380
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,920
I won't give up on Xiaoqi,

381
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:20,600
ever.

382
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,281
Xiaoqi!

383
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,120
Xiaoqi.

384
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,400
Xiaoqi.

385
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:48,961
Xiaoqi.

386
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
Starting today,

387
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,321
I forbid you to look at him,

388
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:08,160
to smile at him

389
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,360
or to fall in love with him.

390
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,761
You are my girlfriend.

391
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:12,120
You can only look at me alone.

392
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,200
Why are you laughing?

393
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,680
You look like an old man.

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,880
I will grow old with you.

395
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,640
Xiaoqi.

396
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Welcome home.

397
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:28,600
My home

398
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,801
is where you are.

399
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:37,721
Xiaoqi.

400
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,440
Xiaoqi.

401
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,481
Are you okay, Xiaoqi?

402
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:42,880
Xiaoqi!

403
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:45,600
Are you okay?

404
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,360
Come on. Let's go home with me.

405
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll have Candy examine you.

406
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:55,400
Shiyi.

407
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,360
I remember everything.

408
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,081
If you want to hurt him,

409
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400
you'll have to go through me first.

410
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,081
You know I won't hurt you..

411
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,160
Step aside.

412
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,360
Since I was a child,

413
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,081
the only thing I want to do

414
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,321
is to protect you,

415
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,801
but you only have
Fang Leng in your heart.

416
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,241
Why not me?

417
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,640
What spell has he put on you

418
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,081
to make you defend him like this?

419
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,600
It is because I will
always respect her choice,

420
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:42,561
unlike you,

421
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,521
who only imposes

422
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,961
your will on her.

423
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,880
No. Xiaoqi.

424
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,880
I didn't mean to brainwash you.

425
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,321
I didn't mean to control you.

426
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,041
I just wanted to take you home.

427
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,360
Home?

428
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
You could have taken her
home a long time ago.

429
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:01,640
You've been using Xiaoqi

430
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,880
to get her to help you find the hormones

431
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,440
so you can become the chief.

432
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:06,680
No.

433
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,640
Xiaoqi.

434
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,440
I want to be chief because of you.

435
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:13,680
Are you doing this for her

436
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,721
or for yourself?

437
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,200
Earthling, shut your mouth!

438
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,880
Shiyi.

439
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,081
Shiyi.

440
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:22,400
Shiyi.

441
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:24,721
Love is a choice.

442
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,481
You don't have to
weigh the consequences.

443
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,360
I love Fang Leng.

444
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,961
So I'll be there to protect him

445
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:32,961
when he's in danger.

446
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,840
If you really want to protect me,

447
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:40,321
please

448
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,200
let us go.

449
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,361
Shiyi.

450
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,961
If I had to do it all over again,

451
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,561
I wouldn't regret giving you that candy

452
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:26,481
or being friends with you.

453
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,361
Me, too.

454
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,600
Master, why are you so badly injured?

455
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,120
I'm fine.

456
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:07,361
I'll be fine after a few days.

457
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,720
Chai Xiaoqi has repeatedly
broken the law

458
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,521
and this time she even hurts you.

459
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,921
I must report this to the chief.

460
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:14,680
Candy.

461
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,401
Don't do it

462
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,120
without my orders.

463
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,081
Do not act on your own.

464
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,720
Sorry, master.

465
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:22,800
I know you've been

466
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,521
trying to protect Chai Xiaoqi,

467
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:27,320
but I'm just so pissed.

468
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,280
You've been using Xiaoqi

469
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,961
to get her to help you find the hormones

470
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,160
so you can become the chief.

471
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,401
Are you doing this for her

472
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,640
or for yourself?

473
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,720
Nonsense.

474
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,841
Nonsense!

475
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,120
Here, slowly.

476
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:51,200
Are you okay?

477
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,881
I'll get you a glass of water.

478
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:54,841
Wait a minute.

479
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,521
It's all right.

480
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:06,921
It's already over.

481
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:09,001
However, you need to

482
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,600
keep an eye on me from now on.

483
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,160
I am very easily brainwashed.

484
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,561
Maybe I will...

485
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,280
Then I'll hold you like this forever

486
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,881
and you won't suddenly disappear.

487
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,640
You know what?

488
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:24,841
We've actually

489
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,481
been together since

490
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:27,760
a long, long time ago.

491
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:30,041
What do you mean?

492
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,481
If my division

493
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,881
hadn't taken me back by force

494
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:36,401
and formatted my mind,

495
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:38,481
we would both be married now.

496
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:40,760
No, we would have had children.

497
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:44,401
Do you remember

498
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,200
this sapphire wedding ring you gave me?

499
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:48,200
Luckily I was smart enough

500
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,120
to store all my memories

501
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,441
in this sapphire.

502
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:53,041
Otherwise, the memories

503
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,640
would have been erased.

504
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:57,921
So

505
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,561
the images I see on rainy days

506
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:03,481
and the images I have in my dreams

507
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,521
are all real.

508
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,561
Check this out.

509
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,361
Don't look.

510
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,800
Let me see.

511
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
This...

512
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,081
Let's stop here.

513
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:37,881
I want to continue.

514
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:39,961
This is not the right channel.

515
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:41,921
We'll look at the rest next time.

516
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,001
Xiaoqi.

517
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,561
Even if we've lost our time

518
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,481
or our memories,

519
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,081
as long as you're yourself,

520
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,160
I'm sure we can start over

521
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,401
no matter what happens

522
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,481
and we can make things right again.

523
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,441
What's wrong?

524
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,680
I'm a little dizzy.

525
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,361
Take a rest.

526
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:15,561
I'll rest for a while.

527
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,521
Have a good rest.

528
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:26,760
Master, you have overdrawn your energy.

529
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,401
Now you must recuperate

530
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:31,120
or your body will be
permanently damaged.

531
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,081
Okay.

532
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,561
During my recovery period,

533
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,401
help me run the company.

534
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,961
Don't allow anyone to disturb me.

535
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,881
Also,

536
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,760
keep the matter of Xiaoqi

537
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,680
a secret.

538
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:47,760
Yes, master.

539
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:50,640
Master, the brain is in
an unconscious state

540
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
when the body is healing itself.

541
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:53,961
The nerve centre

542
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:56,081
may trigger some memory sequences.

543
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,320
You do not need to panic.

544
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,001
This is normal.

545
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,361
The first place in the overall test

546
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:01,800
will become

547
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,041
Jilisiburadakaqikaqi No. 11.

548
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,600
You will be

549
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,160
guaranteed a place in

550
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,041
the chief candidate course

551
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,680
if you come first in every term.

552
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,561
Thank you, miss.

553
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll do my best.

554
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:29,481
One of you

555
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,401
will be the next chief.

556
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,361
Before that,

557
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,081
I have a question.

558
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,521
What is the purpose of
your efforts to become a chief?

559
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,800
Only by making yourself stronger

560
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,600
can you protect
those you want to protect.

561
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,260
(DNA matching)

562
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,940
(Begin)
(Matching)

563
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,580
(DNA is 99% matched)

564
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:59,041
Bad news!

565
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,001
I've just heard that

566
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,841
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven

567
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,240
has lost in space

568
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,361
on an interstellar mission.

569
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,800
Xiaoqi!

570
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:32,481
I am willing to vouch for Xiaoqi

571
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,561
as a candidate for Chief.

572
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,441
I saved your life this time,

573
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,240
but hopefully next time,

574
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,401
you won't be affected
by hormones again.
