00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,803
We could recruit some couples

20
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:42,283
for the experiment.

21
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:43,803
How smart.

22
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:48,243
Yes, recruit some couples.

23
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,003
Actually,

24
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:58,204
I can do it now.

25
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:00,564
What do you mean?

26
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:08,523
I have feelings for you, Xiaoqi.

27
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:32,563
Why?

28
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:36,204
What?

29
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:38,724
Yes. Why?

30
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:41,284
Didn't you dislike me
right from the start?

31
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:43,243
You wouldn't have hired me

32
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,123
if I didn't pester you.

33
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,803
You were even mad at me

34
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:48,164
and asked me to leave you alone.

35
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,044
Although you apologised to me,

36
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,924
that was it.

37
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,683
What has it got to do with feelings?

38
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,604
Are you mistaken?

39
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,764
In fact, I used to believe

40
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:03,563
everyone in the world

41
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:04,924
was independent

42
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,164
and we could live without each other.

43
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:11,444
To me,

44
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,444
the so-called soulmates

45
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:13,924
or a match made in heaven

46
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,044
are something

47
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,563
made up by screenwriters
who don't believe in these,

48
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,363
yet they want the audience
to believe otherwise.

49
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,563
Then I found out

50
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:25,924
it wasn't that I didn't believe in love.

51
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,284
I just never realised

52
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:31,284
I would be so lucky.

53
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,164
Although I live

54
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,484
an ordinary life,

55
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:41,324
I'm able to meet
a special girl like you.

56
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,044
Do you think you're lucky

57
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,044
to have met me?

58
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:56,963
Does it look nice?

59
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,444
Yes.

60
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:03,444
It's called Wandering North Pole Star.

61
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,764
I'd wanted to give you this.

62
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:07,724
North Pole Star

63
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,403
can show us directions.

64
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,243
To me, you're my North Pole Star.

65
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,563
I've finally met you

66
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:18,604
after wandering for so long.

67
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,484
I don't want to lose you again, Xiaoqi.

68
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,323
Will you be my girlfriend?

69
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:32,844
(It's strange.)

70
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,563
(How come my heart is beating so fast?)

71
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,484
(I could accomplish my mission
by being with him.)

72
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:40,683
(I might as well agree.)

73
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,563
Okay, so be it.

74
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,443
Let me put it on you.

75
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:58,763

85
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:56,644
We want two rooms.

86
00:05:56,844 --> 00:05:57,484
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,683
We have many guests today.

88
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,883
Only one empty room is left.

89
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:05,243
It's okay.

90
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,924
Xiaoqi, Chai and I

91
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,044
had stayed in the same room.

92
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,604
I'm sure two people can fit in.

93
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,883
(It's fine so long as we
don't look at each other.)

94
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:14,604
Hang on, Xiaobu.

95
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,203
That isn't the issue.

96
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:19,164
Since it's getting dark,

97
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:20,363
let's settle for this.

98
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,203
Why is there only a bed?

99
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,524
I have an idea.

100
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,363
You will take the bed
and I'll sleep on the floor.

101
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,044
We'll leave each other alone.

102
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,724
Deal.

103
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,604
I'm taking a shower.

104
00:06:58,683 --> 00:06:59,323
Okay.

105
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,044
What's the matter, Xiaobu?

106
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,084
Where's the fridge? I'm thirsty.

107
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:23,323
Over there.

108
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:43,883
(I didn't look into his eyes.)

109
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,883
(Why am I turning
into a tortoise again?)

110
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,924
What are you looking for, Xiaobu?

111
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,404
I...

112
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:54,763
You...

113
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,964
Put on your clothes now.

114
00:07:58,964 --> 00:07:59,724
Go!

115
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,284
(What's the matter with me?)

116
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,883
(Am I turning into a tortoise?)

117
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:17,044
Master.

118
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,084
The mission is going well.

119
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,964
Why do you still look unhappy?

120
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,284
Why haven't you posted anything?

121
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,044
(Xiaoqi)
Do you expect me to announce it alone?

122
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,203
I want to announce it officially.

123
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:36,884
You aren't announcing it.

124
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,603
You're not even liking my post.

125
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,524
Fine.

126
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,404
(Han, Dr. Zhang
and Fang Leng liked your post.)

127
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:46,524
At last.

128
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,620
(Note: Cold Demon King)

129
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:55,083
What are you doing?

130
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,004
Let me take a look.

131
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,124
There's nothing to see.

132
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,524
The Demon King?

133
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:09,524
It's changed.

134
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:11,644
What?

135
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:13,364
Milk Green Tea?

136
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,764
What does that mean?

137
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,843
Mashed taro?

138
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,563
Isn't that your milk tea
shop's signature item?

139
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,124
Our signature item is
mashed taro kissing milk...

140
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:24,644
Mashed taro kissing milk...

141
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:26,364
Mashed...

142
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:29,603
Forget about the kissing.

143
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,924
Why do you think you're
the milk green tea?

144
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:36,083
Sometimes, I'll just
take the initiative.

145
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:47,524
Time to sleep.

146
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:48,524
Good night.

147
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:49,524
Good night.

148
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,244
(It feels good to fall in love.)

149
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,603
(I can absorb his hormones openly.)

150
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:15,683
What are you doing?

151
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:23,843
Go to sleep.

152
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,443
Do not look at me!

153
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:34,764
Aren't you sharing

154
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,044
the food with me?

155
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,164
It's done.

156
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,404
Let's eat together.

157
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,244
It smells nice!

158
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,044
Mr. Ke.

159
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:47,803
Good morning.

160
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:48,683
Good morning.

161
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:49,483
Good morning,

162
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,803
Have some bacon.

163
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:53,884
Sure, thanks.

164
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:54,483
Here you go.

165
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,203
I'm grateful for your help.

166
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,284
We'll do the experiment immediately.

167
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:01,483
No hurry.

168
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:02,603
Enjoy your breakfast before leaving.

169
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,044
Sure.

170
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,924
Are you two...

171
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,124
I felt that you two were
like a couple yesterday.

172
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:21,164
It's better this way.

173
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,603
I'm sure two lovers will have

174
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,683
a higher success rate in using

175
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,603
the hormone purifying technique.

176
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:29,963
The bacon is delicious.

177
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,284
I'm going inside.

178
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,963
I'll leave you guys to it.

179
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:34,963
Have more if you want, sir.

180
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:35,563
It's okay.

181
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,244
Do you want this?

182
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:39,524
Here you go.

183
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,044
What are you two doing?

184
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:43,524
We're having breakfast.

185
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:44,284
We are.

186
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,164
Can't you see?

187
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,124
We're now

188
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:49,164
together.

189
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:58,843
Have an apple, Xiaobu.

190
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:02,524
Feed me, too.

191
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:13,364
Brother.

192
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,524
I wish to stay for my painting.

193
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,644
Why don't you guys stay
a little longer, too?

194
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:20,323
No.

195
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,443
The research can't
be delayed any longer.

196
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:27,963
(Xiaoqi.)

197
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,124
(I need your help.)

198
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:31,963
(Got it.)

199
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,603
(Do you wish to stay and
accompany Fang Lie?)

200
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,323
(However, you're too shy to say it.)

201
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:37,884
(I'll help you.)

202
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,124
(Just leave it to me.)

203
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:41,524
Lie.

204
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,443
Let Xiaobu keep you company.

205
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,004
Don't worry.

206
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,723
I'll send Chai your leave application.

207
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,004
Just stay back.

208
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:50,843
Keep him company.

209
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:51,843
It's okay.

210
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,524
Enjoy yourselves.

211
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:07,644
You gave me a scare.

212
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,083
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Fang.

213
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,644
You two are finally together.

214
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,563
I wish you two

215
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,683
will be forever

216
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,443
in love!

217
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:16,963
Thank you.

218
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:22,683
Get into the car.

219
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:23,924
I'm driving.

220
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,284
Watch your head.

221
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:35,443
Thank you.

222
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:54,884
(They're now deeply in love.)

223
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:56,843
(The cold and bossy man)

224
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:00,164
(has finally fallen in love.)

225
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:03,563
Are you coming?

226
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,124
Sure.

227
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,320
(Closed)

228
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:20,683
Try this, honey.

229
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:23,924
How is it?

230
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:26,404
Have some, too.

231
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:28,924
Is it sweet?

232
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:30,443
Anything from you is sweet.

233
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:51,083
We're back, Chai! Sorry.

234
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,364
What brings you here?

235
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,164
I can explain.

236
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:57,124
You're actually...

237
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,284
It's okay.

238
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,723
It's official.

239
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:01,884
Dr. Zhang and I

240
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:03,884
are together now.

241
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,683
You're awesome, Chai.

242
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:08,124
You've finally won his heart.

243
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,483
Of course not.

244
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:10,723
I'm a lady.

245
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:12,203
Dr. Zhang

246
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,644
won my heart instead.

247
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,404
We're family from now on.

248
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:20,164
Family?

249
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:21,764
Brother-in-law?

250
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,244
Am I right?

251
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:25,764
Brother-in-law.

252
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,443
- Good morning, Mr. Fang.
- Good morning.

253
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,884
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

254
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:39,884
Good morning.

255
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:40,723
Well,

256
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:41,884
let's walk separately

257
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,083
when we enter the office.

258
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:44,524
You don't want our colleagues
to see us together?

259
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,764
We haven't gone public
with our relationship.

260
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,323
Let's keep this a secret first.

261
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,404
Just go.

262
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,083
Good morning.

263
00:16:58,723 --> 00:16:59,203
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

264
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:00,244
- Good morning.
- Mr. Fang.

265
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,243
How come Mr. Fang is
here with her today?

266
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,003
It's none of your business.

267
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:07,884
Keep your voice down.

268
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,003
Keep your voice down.

269
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:13,084
Mind your words.

270
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,084
They look like a sweet couple.

271
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,364
Keep your voice down.

272
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,043
It's probable.

273
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:27,003
Just look at them.

274
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:28,283
Do you

275
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:28,884
see that?

276
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:48,723
Just look at you.

277
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:01,124
Just go.

278
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,164
Fireflies in the forest.

279
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,124
So romantic.

280
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,523
I heard Mr. Fang and
Xiaoqi are returning today.

281
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:12,723
- Good morning.
-  They're returning today?

282
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,324
We'll get to see a sweet couple.

283
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:14,963
Hello!

284
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,043
Mr. Fang is here.

285
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:17,283
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

286
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:18,523
Mr. Fang.

287
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:20,203
Mr. Fang.

288
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,283
Hello.

289
00:18:58,443 --> 00:18:59,124
Xiaoqi.

290
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:02,963
Come to my office.

291
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:04,963
You have work for me?

292
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,084
Got it.

293
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:08,043
Right away.

294
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,003
I've just got into the office

295
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:17,644
and there's work for me.

296
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:23,364
Come in.

297
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,523
What do you have for me

298
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:27,683
early in the morning?

299
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,780
(They must be asking for a hug.
I think so, too.)

300
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,124
(Yes. Yes.)

301
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,443
Are they together?

302
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,124
What are you doing?

303
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:40,963
I'm recharging.

304
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:42,523
Knock it off.

305
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,283
Stop it lest

306
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,683
they'll see us.

307
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:46,564
They won't.

308
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,243
They will.

309
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,124
Didn't you get handsy with me

310
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,683
in the office last time?

311
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:53,683
You're a bad girl now.

312
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,443
This is a double standard.

313
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,043
No, it isn't.

314
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,084
- Yes
- No.

315
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:00,203
No.

316
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:01,683
Let me see.

317
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,124
(Meeting room)

318
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,483
On the technical level,

319
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,844
just carry it out
according to Keren's data.

320
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:25,523
We need to get four couples

321
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:26,644
for specimens.

322
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,924
Aren't we supposed to have five couples?

323
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,324
We're the fifth couple.

324
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:34,683
Hey...

325
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,003
It's time.

326
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,723
Let's announce

327
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,084
our relationship.

328
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:47,243
This is too sudden.

329
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:48,604
They aren't ready yet.

330
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,164
Neither am I.

331
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:51,763
Mr. Fang.

332
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,404
We already knew.

333
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,364
Yes.

334
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,804
The way you looked at each other

335
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,404
was too obvious

336
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:58,364
Exactly.

337
00:20:58,404 --> 00:20:59,564
Don't be embarrassed.

338
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,564
Office romance is perfectly normal.

339
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:02,963
Just admit it, Mr. Fang.

340
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:04,483
We saw it on Moments.

341
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,763
Exactly, Mr. Fang.

342
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:10,003
Let's continue our meeting.

343
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:11,564
Is there any problem?

344
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:13,963
Mr. Fang.

345
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:16,564
In order to get the optimal result,

346
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,443
couples mustn't meet

347
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:19,924
before the experiment starts.

348
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:24,243
You two just got together.

349
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,164
Isn't it a little too cruel?

350
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:27,404
Ms. Chai.

351
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,723
Just forget it.

352
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:29,963
Of course not.

353
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,404
We won't meet for just a day, right?

354
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:32,203
Not a problem.

355
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:34,243
Go on.

356
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
(Fang Leng CEO)

357
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:10,483
She isn't coming?

358
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
(What are you doing?)

359
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,324
Have you done the statistics?

360
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:06,763
Mr. Fang.

361
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:11,324
Mr. Fang.

362
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:12,924
Since we already have five couples,

363
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:14,324
we can exclude you and Ms. Chai.

364
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,324
Look for her.

365
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:17,043
No, I can't.

366
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,324
This is an important project to us.

367
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:20,844
I must set a good example

368
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,084
as the boss.

369
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:25,324
The rules only say you can't meet her

370
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,324
but you can still text and call her.

371
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,763
Do you think I'll break the rules?

372
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:33,164
No.

373
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,105
(Milk Green Tea)

374
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,404
(Delete contact, confirm, cancel)
Three, two, one.

375
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:47,644
(Delete contact, confirm, cancel)
Delete.

376
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,844
Why did you remove Mr. Fang from WeChat?

377
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,243
Not exactly.

378
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:54,963
We can neither see nor
contact each other

379
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:55,844
before the experiment.

380
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,243
He might break the rules.

381
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,924
You've changed for the better, Xiaoqi.

382
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:02,404
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

383
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,963
Everything is under your control.

384
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:07,683
Bill, please.

385
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:08,844
Just a moment!

386
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:11,243
I can do it.

387
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,003
What brings you here?

388
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
(Missed me?)

389
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
(Send friend request)

390
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:41,283
Give me your phone.

391
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,360
(Chai Xiaoqi)

392
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,564
Mr. Fang.

393
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,761
(Request to add friends)

394
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:09,324
Mr. Fang.

395
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,043
I'm sure Ms. Chai

396
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,723
has pressed the wrong button.

397
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,644
Hello, Ms. Chai.

398
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:23,644
Why did you remove Mr. Fang?

399
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:26,564
Who's that?

400
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:27,924
Nobody.

401
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:39,723
So,

402
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,203
how was your business trip?

403
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,364
We're getting ready for the experiment.

404
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:44,804
Tomorrow we can start extracting

405
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:45,804
the hormones.

406
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,564
That's good.

407
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:50,005
(Han)

408
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,084
Hello, Mr. Han.

409
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:52,243
Ms. Chai.

410
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:53,644
Why haven't you added Mr. Fang back?

411
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:54,124
Well...

412
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:54,804
Xiaoqi.

413
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:57,804
Does Mr. Fang treat you well?

414
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,723
Who's that?

415
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:05,604
Fang Leng and I have officially

416
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:07,003
got together since

417
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:07,804
the outing.

418
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:13,443
Xiaoqi.

419
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,003
Had you ever been in love before?

420
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:16,844
No.

421
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:19,283
As your friend,

422
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:20,844
I wish you're always happy.

423
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:23,763
Not everyone deserves your trust.

424
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:25,283
You should be careful.

425
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:26,963
Be careful?

426
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:28,124
Of who?

427
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:31,844
You can't trust everyone,

428
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,164
especially those who
have hurt you before.

429
00:26:34,804 --> 00:26:36,084
You should protect yourself.

430
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:39,644
Don't worry.

431
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,924
Fang Leng isn't a bad person.

432
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:41,924
He's trustworthy.

433
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:54,443
Welcome home, master.

434
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:55,483
Candy.

435
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,043
Connect to Future Group's database.

436
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:01,084
Track the research and development
progress on Hormone Element.

437
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:02,404
Yes.

438
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:03,483
Master.

439
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:06,404
Chai Xiaoqi fell in love with
Fang Leng without authorisation.

440
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,844
Should I report this?

441
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,523
This is part of her mission.

442
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,763
It's no big deal.

443
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:15,084
Master.

444
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:17,763
Chai Xiaoqi is your genetic match.

445
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,003
Hasn't her behaviour

446
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:20,003
violated

447
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:22,164
the Law of Cape Town Genetic Matching?

448
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:24,483
Just do your job.

449
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,203
It's none of your business.

450
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:28,963
Master, are you sure...

451
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:41,324
She should be back by now.

452
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:44,324
What's taking her so long?

453
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:52,324
Mr. Fang.

454
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:53,523
Are you still not going home?

455
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:56,203
Hasn't Xiaoqi come back with you?

456
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,763
She told me

457
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:01,644
she'd put up at the milk tea shop

458
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,124
for the sake of the experiment.

459
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,763
She's adamant about it.

460
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:06,644
Thanks.

461
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,443
This is how a man behaves

462
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:21,963
when he's deeply in love.

463
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
(Drink it and be happy)

464
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:00,844
Open the door, Xiaoqi.

465
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:03,404
Come on.

466
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,700
(Drink it and be happy)

467
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,580
(I missed you.)

468
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
(The experiment states that
we can't meet each other.)

469
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,480
(Are you used to the life without me?)

470
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
(Hang in there. We can meet tomorrow.)

471
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,740
(You won't say you miss me already.)

472
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,443
Xiaoqi.

473
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,084
Xiaoqi.

474
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
(You won't say you miss me already.)

475
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,164
Xiaoqi.

476
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:55,243
How are you two getting on?

477
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:58,683
There's nothing special except that

478
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:00,164
he tends to kiss

479
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:02,203
and hug me all the time.

480
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,404
Is there a reaction

481
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:04,963
of rejection when he hugs you?

482
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:06,804
No.

483
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,043
I actually feel really good.

484
00:31:09,924 --> 00:31:12,283
Physical contact is something

485
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,443
crucial in the earthlings'

486
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:15,924
emotional system,

487
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:17,844
especially for those
who just fall in love.

488
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,283
They like to establish a feeling

489
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:20,604
of familiarity physically.

490
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:23,763
Xiaoqi.

491
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:24,884
Just remember.

492
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,003
Cape Town Planet forbids
emotional attachment.

493
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:28,683
You're just carrying out a mission.

494
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:29,723
It isn't real love.

495
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,243
Don't worry.

496
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,924
The experiment will start tomorrow.

497
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:38,003
Hormone Element will
be developed soon enough.

498
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,124
Fang Lie.

499
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:40,884
I used to think

500
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:42,124
that falling in love

501
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:44,723
would disrupt my daily life.

502
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,404
I just realise

503
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:47,963
a stable relationship

504
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:49,164
enables me to focus

505
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,723
on my work and life.

506
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:51,483
Brother.

507
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,763
Will you just stop bragging

508
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:54,604
to me?

509
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:57,003
Sorry. I almost forgot

510
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,844
Xiaobu has been avoiding
eye contact with you.

511
00:31:59,124 --> 00:31:59,804
Brother.

512
00:32:00,364 --> 00:32:02,644
Do you think the people
have a change of taste?

513
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:03,963
Do they fancy

514
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,203
men like you instead
of those with big eyes

515
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:08,884
like me?

516
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:11,283
That's why

517
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:13,203
I always tell you

518
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,124
to go to the gym.

519
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:17,644
This is how you stimulate your androgen.

520
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:18,364
I remember

521
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:19,523
the first time Xiaoqi met me

522
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,283
She lusted

523
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,443
after my chest and abs.

524
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,763
I thought she was shallow.

525
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:24,683
Now I realise

526
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,124
she actually has good taste.

527
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:28,124
The first time she touched me...

528
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,084
Fang Lie?

529
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:33,283
By the way,

530
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:36,124
does your body temperature increase

531
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:38,043
when you're with Fang Lie?

532
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,443
Do you turn into a tortoise?

533
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:41,924
Don't bring that up.

534
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,243
I need ice water to cool

535
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:44,804
myself off when I'm with him.

536
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:45,963
The scary thing is

537
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,043
he wants me to be his model

538
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,404
for his sketch.

539
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,763
Really?

540
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,243
Help me.

541
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:09,683
What about this pose?

542
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:15,404
It's fine

543
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:16,364
but

544
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:19,203
can you face me?

545
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:23,884
All right.

546
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:45,043
Forget it.

547
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,443
You can just close your eyes.

548
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:02,483
Your hair, Xiaobu.

549
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:56,364
Are you all right?

550
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,740
(Alert, system temperature is too high,
turning into tortoise mode soon)

551
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,684
Are you all right?

552
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:14,684
I'm just fine.

553
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,460
(Temperature is going down)

554
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:22,483
Xiaobu.

555
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:23,483
Are you having a fever?

556
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:24,724
No.

557
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:25,684
Just go ahead.

558
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,284
I'm fine.

559
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,764
(Earth is simply hazardous.)

560
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,924
(It isn't compatible with my system.)

561
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:52,924
(I miss my home planet.)

562
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:56,724
Confirm the data again.

563
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:57,324
Sure.

564
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,924
It's just a normal test.

565
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:05,324
I don't feel anything.

566
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:07,523
I'll take you to a restaurant
when it's over.

567
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,163
Let's focus on the experiment first.

568
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:15,523
Mr. Fang.

569
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:16,603
We'll begin now.

570
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:17,364
Let's begin.

571
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,483
Let's begin.

572
00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:54,643
(How come?)

573
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:59,324
(My ring has intercepted the hormones.)

574
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,364
The readings seem to be abnormal.

575
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:07,324
Yes.

576
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:36,764
You gave me a scare.

577
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:38,764
Thanks.

578
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:45,804
Only 0.5% hormones were extracted?

579
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,924
The R&D will do some adjustments.

580
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:57,163
Just calm down.

581
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:00,083
The experiments are
full of uncertainties.

582
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,083
Failing the first time is normal.

583
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:05,804
I want to recharge.

584
00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:29,284
When will you break your bad habit?

585
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:31,804
This isn't a bad habit.

586
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,163
Your hormones really

587
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:35,684
have a strong smell.

588
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:37,204
It's simply unchangeable.

589
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:48,043
Do you really like my hormones

590
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,884
or me?

591
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:51,643
Is there a difference?

592
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:55,684
I think you're a walking hormone.

593
00:38:58,123 --> 00:38:58,603
Wait a second.

594
00:38:58,643 --> 00:38:59,443
What about me?

595
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,404
What do you like about me?

596
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:03,684
My intelligence,

597
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:04,603
cuteness

598
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:05,523
or good looks?

599
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:07,083
Well,

600
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:10,483
let me think.

601
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:14,443
I like

602
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:15,404
your stupidity.

603
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,163
Hey...

604
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:17,603
What are you doing?

605
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:19,724
I want to hit you.

606
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:25,244
Frankly,

607
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:26,924
it was kind of weird

608
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:29,284
when you first entered my life.

609
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:32,924
You made a mess of my previous life.

610
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:34,844
Then you joined my company.

611
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,404
You knew nothing

612
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,483
yet you kept going passionately.

613
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:41,523
Initially,

614
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:43,163
I thought you were wasting your time.

615
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:44,884
It wasn't until you did

616
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,163
the live stream in the gym,

617
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:51,884
that I started to see

618
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,324
the rare quality you had.

619
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,483
People tend to give up

620
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:58,724
when facing difficulties,

621
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:01,163
but not you.

622
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:03,844
I don't think

623
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:06,083
nothing can deter you at all.

624
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:07,443
You just do your best

625
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:08,924
and achieve your goals,

626
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:10,764
no matter what.

627
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,963
Are you feeling grateful

628
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,603
for being foolish back then?

629
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:25,404
You wouldn't have been awesome today

630
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,204
if you had been smarter.
