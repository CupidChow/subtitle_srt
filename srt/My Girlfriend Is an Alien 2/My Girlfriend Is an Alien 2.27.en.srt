I'm thirsty.

Are you?

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,079
Here.

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,559
I see there are biscuits.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,919
Biscuits.

26
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,760
Have some biscuits first.

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Fang Lie is preparing a hotpot.

28
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,240
If I had known I would
be so happy being injured,

29
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,439
I might as well let
Jiang Shiyi hit me harder.

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,439
Don't be ridiculous.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Okay.

32
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,960
This time,

33
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,080
Jiang Shiyi has consumed a lot of energy.

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,599
When he wakes up,

35
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,400
I don't know how to
complete the mission.

36
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,319
Don't worry.

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,400
I kept a lot of hormones
in the Research Department.

38
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll send it to him some day.

39
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,800
Didn't you say all the hormones

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,279
were destroyed?

41
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,680
If I didn't say that,

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,439
how would I get you to
return to my company

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
and pursue you again?

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,559
You're so cunning.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,559
Brother, the hotpot is ready.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,439
I'm starving.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,719

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,279
Here it is!

50
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,439
Stop.

51
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,599
Xiaoqi.

52
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,520
No more pig brains for you.

53
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,400
It's not auspicious.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,279
Think about it.

55
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,520
What does it mean?

56
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
It means to brainwash you.

57
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,920
Have some lobster instead.

58
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,640
It means letting you stay.

59
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,999
Let me boil it for you.

60
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,680
Look. It's so big.

61
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,520
Come on. Let's clink our glasses.

62
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,200
Cheers!

63
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,920
I am

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
really happy and blessed now.

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,039
Our lives

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
are finally back on track

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,480
and you two lovebirds
are finally back together.

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
That filthy Jiang Shiyi.

69
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,879
I've long despised him.

70
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,120
You see,

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,759
not only is he handsome,

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
he's also overly solicitous.

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,120
This kind of person

74
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,839
is either a playboy

75
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,319
or has bad intentions.

76
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,279
I don't think

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,039
he would have been so obsessed

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,439
if it wasn't for the genetic match.

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
By the way, Xiaoqi,

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,279
what is the percentage of your match?

81
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,439
We are

82
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,520
99% compatible.

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,240
It seems to be
the highest score ever recorded

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
on Cape Town Planet.

85
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,920
- Well...
- That's high.

86
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,999
Where's the pig brain?

87
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,519
Xiaoqi, I think

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
you should eat some pig brains.

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,519
It's good for your brain.

90
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,199
Xiaobu.

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,160
You, too.

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,079
Have some pig brains.

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,680
Okay.

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
Pig brain.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,959
Are you upset?

96
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,360
No.

97
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Why should I?

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Your genetic matches

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
are only data extrapolations,

100
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
not based on your feelings.

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,959
I don't think it makes any sense.

102
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,680
Exactly. I'm glad you're not upset.

103
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,360
You are the best.

104
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
Have some more.

105
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,519
Mr. Fang, the Research Department

106
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,959
is working on the mass
production of hormones.

107
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,160
The results will be available soon.

108
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,519
During this period,

109
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,519
Ms. Chai will also be following up
on the progress of the experiment

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,319
to ensure that
the quality of the hormone

111
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,120
is the same as that of
the direct purification.

112
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,199
This is the upcoming work schedule.

113
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,879
Do you have any other instructions?

114
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,959
Are you sure you and Jiang Shiyi

115
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,600
can't break the genetic match?

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,639
Genetic match? What is that?

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,040
Are you still bothered about it?

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
Your Cape Town Planet
is so backward thinking.

119
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,639
You don't even have
the freedom to marry.

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,319
Cape Town? Where is that?

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,160
Are you looking down on aliens?

122
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,879
Who are you to speak ill
of my home planet?

123
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,319
Aliens? Who?

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,079
I just don't want my girlfriend

125
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,199
to be 99% compatible with someone else.

126
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,160
Can anyone

127
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
answer my questions?

128
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,360
Xiaobu is a robot.

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,519
She is in a cross-species relationship

130
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,199
with Fang Lie.

131
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
They can't even calculate

132
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
their genetic match,

133
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
but they both don't care.

134
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,920
What's with the robot?

135
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Then I'll have the tech department

136
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
come up with a program

137
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,879
to check the compatibility value of

138
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,920
couples of different species.

139
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
What's going on here?

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
I feel like my worldview is collapsing.

141
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,759
Stop thinking about it

142
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,079
and be more open-minded, will you?

143
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,439
Do I know too much?

144
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,759
I'm not going to be extorted, am I?

145
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,759
No, my curiosity is not important.

146
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,040
The problem now
is that they are arguing.

147
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,399
As a good assistant,

148
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,199
I have to help them
resolve the conflict.

149
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,079
Mr. Fang, although I don't understand

150
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,079
the meaning of genetic
matching in Cape Town,

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,240
I do know that there is only one way

152
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,360
to test the compatibility of two people

153
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,879
on Earth.

154
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,639
Meeting the parents.

155
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,240
Students,

156
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
the topic I am sharing with you today is

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
the Code of Conduct for Meeting Parents.

158
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,160
In fact, it is the same

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,319
as meeting leaders.

160
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
You know that

161
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,319
everything they say is just courtesy,

162
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,720
but you have to pretend
that you are convinced

163
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,160
in order to get closer to them

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,040
and win their favour.

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,360
Note it down.

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,720
One more thing, Xiaoqi.

167
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,319
Tomorrow, Zhou Siqin
is likely to target you.

168
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,720
So be prepared.

169
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:54,879
Why?

170
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,280
You can imagine

171
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,519
with your toes.

172
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,680
Fang Leng is her step-son

173
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,439
and Fang Lie is her biological son.

174
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,319
So when it comes to
her own daughter-in-law,

175
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,199
she will definitely treat
her real daughter-in-law better

176
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,879
than her step-daughter-in-law.

177
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,759
You have a point.

178
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,199
Oh, no. I've ripped her off before.

179
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,959
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,240
This is making me panic.

181
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
It's okay.

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
It's normal to be nervous

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,439
when meeting the parents
for the first time.

184
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,360
I still remember my first time.

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,920
I really envy Fang Leng and Fang Lie.

186
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,480
Going home is a routine for them.

187
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
They don't have to get prepared

188
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,519
as much as we do.

189
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,439
Exactly.

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Do we have to memorise all this?

191
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
Yes, we do.

192
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,240
- This is too hard.
- Why are you guys here?

193
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,840
Chai.

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,600
Just in time. I'm giving them a lecture.

195
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,920
Why don't you join them?

196
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,840
Lecture?

197
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,879
Yes.

198
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,680
The Code of Conduct for Meeting Parents.

199
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,759
Xiaoqi.

200
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,879
This is my father's favourite tonic.

201
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,600
Give it to him
when you visit tomorrow.

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,280
That's a lot.

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,559
This is my mother's

204
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,040
favourite brand of bag recently.

205
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,160
Tomorrow, tell her

206
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,040
that you queued up

207
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,199
to buy it for her.

208
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,639
What's this?

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
There is a cake that my father likes,

210
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,759
but it was too late to order.

211
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,079
It's okay. We'll make it ourselves.

212
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,240
- Seriously?
- And this.

213
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,160
- Yes.
- All of these.

214
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,280
By the way, I've prepared a few outfits.

215
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,759
Pick out one for me to wear tomorrow.

216
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,399
Okay.

217
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,519
Where are you going?

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
I haven't finished the lesson yet.

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
It's just getting started.

Son, welcome home.

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Mum, I'm back.

234
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Hello, Mr. Fang, Mrs. Fang.

235
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
- I miss you so much.
- I'm back.

236
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,519
Hello, Mr. Fang.

237
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,679
I miss you, too.

238
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,879
Dad, give me a hug.

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,159
You're just going home.

240
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,840
Why do you bring home so many gifts?

241
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
These are from Xiaobu and Xiaoqi.

242
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,159
Here, Mr. Fang.

243
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,840
We made this cake for you.

244
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,440
I hope you like it.

245
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,960
I've also bought a lot of ingredients.

246
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,240
I'll cook a meal for us.

247
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,720
Xiaoqi, welcome.

248
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,639
Thank you.

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,360
Mrs. Fang, and this.

250
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,999
Don't just stand here.

251
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,840
Come on in.

252
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,240
- Come on.
- Here, my son.

253
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,840
Okay.

254
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,679
Dad, I'll cook for you later.

255
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,279
Okay.

256
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,600
This doesn't seem to be

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
the same as what Chai said.

258
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,039
Women on Earth are complicated.

259
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,639
Cheer up.

260
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,480
Don't worry. I'm here.

261
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,440
Let's go.

262
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,399
Cheer up.

263
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,320
All right.

264
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,799
Thanks.

265
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,960
Take the ingredients.

266
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Did you and your father quarrel again?

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Quarrel?

268
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,919
What do you mean?

269
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,679
I don't see you two

270
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
getting along really well.

271
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,960
This is

272
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
a norm for us.

273
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,799
Do you think this is normal?

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,919
You only talk a few words

275
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,560
and treat each other with courtesy

276
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,440
as if you are strangers.

277
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,360
Isn't that how fathers and sons are?

278
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,679
There are some things

279
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
that we just keep in our heart.

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
What's your name?

281
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,999
Kubri.

282
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,120
How old are you?

283
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,799
20.

284
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,679
What do you do for a living?

285
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,919
She's a cashier in a milk tea shop.

286
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,159
I'm not asking you.

287
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,360
Why are you interrupting?

288
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Take it easy.

289
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,560
Hello, Mrs. Fang.

290
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,960
You can call me Xiaobu.

291
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,360
You are not bad looking

292
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,519
and you have

293
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,440
a decent body.

294
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
But you have a bad posture

295
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,080
and bad taste.

296
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,440
I bet you're from a small family.

297
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,840
You don't deserve

298
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,679
of our Fang Lie.

299
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,480
Mum, what are you talking about?

300
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,600
The first step in conquering the parents

301
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,120
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
is to read their minds.

302
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,440
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
Find out exactly what they like.

303
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,639
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
Use it as a topic

304
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,200
to draw them closer

305
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,919
and gain their trust.

306
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,159
Mrs. Fang, this bracelet
is an antique, isn't it?

307
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,200
Of course.

308
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,120
My best friend

309
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,159
sold it to me cheap for my birthday.

310
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,560
I'm told it's an antique
from the Yongzheng period.

311
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,759
It's thick and natural.

312
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,080
Such a fine piece of jade.

313
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,679
However, the year is wrong.

314
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,120
It is not from the Yongzheng period,

315
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,799
but from the Republican period.

316
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,480
Are you serious?

317
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
If you don't believe me,

318
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,080
you can have it appraised.

319
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,639
This...

320
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,120
I knew it.

321
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Zhang Cuihua could not be so generous.

322
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,879
She sold it to me cheaply

323
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,999
and turned out she took advantage of me.

324
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,919
I'll give her a good lesson.

325
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,600
Do you know how to identify gemstones?

326
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I know a little.

327
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,159
Help me identify all these.

328
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,159
You must keep this necklace.

329
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
According to the current market,

330
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,720
its price will double
within three years.

331
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,799
Really?

332
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,320
The next time I see that Zhang Cuihua,

333
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,919
I'll show her

334
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,679
what the real luxury goods are.

335
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,240
Mum, isn't this necklace

336
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,560
a bit too old-fashioned?

337
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,039
What do you know?

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
Don't speak nonsense.

339
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
The second trick to conquer parents

340
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,360
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
is to cater to their tastes.

341
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
You have to agree

342
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,399
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
with their tastes.

343
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,159
Don't show your personality

344
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,639
and express different opinions.

345
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,480
It will only make you look bad.

346
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
This necklace

347
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,679
is the baroque style
of the European royal family.

348
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,120
If worn by an ordinary person,

349
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
it does look awkward.

350
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,679
But on your neck,

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,159
it makes you look

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
more elegant.

353
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,519
Really?

354
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,080
I think so, too.

355
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,919
However, this necklace

356
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,720
doesn't really match your make-up today.

357
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
Let me fix it for you.

358
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
Do you also know makeup?

359
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,639
I know a little.

360
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
So

361
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,960
what style do you think is better?

362
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
(Analyzing style)

363
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,399
Got it.

364
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,200
Sprinkle a generous amount of salt,

365
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,120
then stir

366
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,240
and let it marinate
for about ten minutes.

367
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,039
How much is a generous amount?

368
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Well, it is not written here.

369
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,879
Just put it according
to your experience.

370
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,560
I usually cook western-style meals.

371
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,999
I'm not really good at home cooking.

372
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,840
How can such a grown man

373
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,519
not even know how to cook?

374
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,799
A teaspoon of salt.

375
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,799
A teaspoon of salt.

376
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,200
Two tablespoons of soy sauce.

377
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
Soy sauce.

378
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,679
Add some chicken powder.

379
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,999
The temperature is too high.
You're going to burn the eggplant.

380
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
This is fine.

381
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,879
Too low.

382
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,999
You need to make sure
the sauce is absorbed.

383
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,919
Dad, here you go.

384
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,600
You are such a good cook.

385
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,480
I used to help
your mother with the cooking.

386
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
I learnt a lot from her.

387
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,999
This fish-fragrant eggplant

388
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,679
was your mum's favourite dish.

389
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,759
She liked to

390
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,919
crisp up

391
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,799
the eggplant skin

392
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
when she cooked it.

393
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,120
Dad.

394
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,080
I remember mum enjoyed this dish

395
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,919
when I was a kid, too.

396
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
She made it almost every day.

397
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
When I first met your mother,

398
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,320
she loved to eat fish.

399
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,199
However,

400
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,280
after she got sick once,

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
she was allergic to fish.

402
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,239
Your mother always
had a craving for it.

403
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,560
She just couldn't hold it in.

404
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,439
So

405
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
I learnt to make this
fish-fragrant eggplant.

406
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,239
This is also
the first dish I made for her.

407
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,159
Okay.

408
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,439
I remember when I was a kid,

409
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,719
mum loved to make egg custard, too.

410
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,159
When I was sick,

411
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
mum would feed me a bowl of it.

412
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,800
Egg custard?

413
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,040
You know what,

414
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,320
I made that for you, too.

415
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,199
You?

416
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,479
Your mother couldn't control the heat.

417
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,639
So the steamed egg custard

418
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
would either too mushy

419
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,840
or taste a little bitter.

420
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,239
You were sick

421
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
and you didn't have a good appetite.

422
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,800
I was worried
you wouldn't be able to eat.

423
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,639
So I would

424
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,360
make a new bowl for you every time.

425
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,600
I actually learnt to cook

426
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,560
from your mother,

427
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,600
but I learnt this fish-fragrant
eggplant and egg custard

428
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,879
all by myself.

429
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,719
Why didn't you tell me then?

430
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,760
It's not a big deal,

431
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
as long as you like it.

432
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,159
Xiaoqi.

433
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:38,479
Come over.

434
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,520
Try it.

435
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,239
It's delicious.

436
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,120
A man who can cook is attractive.

437
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,159
You're such a bad cook.

438
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,159
I'm sure only Xiaoqi

439
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,800
would love you.

440
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,120
Dad.

441
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:01,800
Here.

442
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Xiaoqi.

443
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,239
I'll leave him in your hands.

444
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,520
Rest assured.

445
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,959
This hairstyle is so pretty.

446
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,199
Xiaobu.

447
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,879
I wish I had known you earlier.

448
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,639
Actually, hair and clothes

449
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,520
are just a help.

450
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,439
The point is that
you look young and pretty.

451
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,800
So look good in anything.

452
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,560
Xiaobu.

453
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,959
You're such an honest lady.

454
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Indeed.

455
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,760
Fang Lie.

456
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,840
Look at you.

457
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,560
Can't you see Xiaobu is tired?

458
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,080
Why don't you pour a cup of coffee?

459
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
I thought you didn't need me anymore.

460
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:12,919
Xiaobu, come with me.

461
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:13,520
Here.

462
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,040
Look.

463
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,879
What would look good

464
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,159
with this ruby necklace?

465
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,000
The colour is brighter.

466
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,120
Coffee.

467
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,280
- It's hot.
- I think...

468
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
My clothes!

469
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,239
Oh, no.

470
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,159
No.

471
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,679
Don't use your hands.

472
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,719
Oh, gosh.

473
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,639
It's stained.

474
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,879
It won't wash off.

475
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,439
You're good for nothing.

476
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,919
Mum, I didn't mean to.

477
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,800
The third trick to conquer parents

478
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,959
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
is to be attentive.

479
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,040
Elders like witty
and smart young people.

480
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,199
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
If you can help her

481
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,520
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
solve some small problems properly,

482
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
her impression of you
will be doubled instantly.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
Don't worry.

484
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:07,959
I have a way.

485
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,639
Leave it to me.

486
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:11,800
Xiaobu.

487
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,199
This must not get wet.

488
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,679
Mum, just trust her.

489
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,639
Just give me a few minutes.

490
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,680
(Activating high frequency vibration)

491
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,120
Fang Lie.

492
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:00,159
Mum, why are you staring at me?

493
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:01,840
Fang Lie.

494
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,479
I don't think you're
good enough for my dear Xiaobu.

495
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,679
What?

496
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,120
Your dear Xiaobu?

497
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,679
I am your son.

498
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,600
I think

499
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,560
the eldest son of
the Zhang Group is not bad.

500
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,320
I'll introduce her to him

501
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,479
when she doesn't want you anymore.

502
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,639
Hold on.

503
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I was worried that
you wouldn't like Xiaobu.

504
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,679
Now I'm wondering

505
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
if your fondness for her
is a little too much.

506
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,439
No.

507
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,800
Look at Xiaobu.

508
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,840
She's not only pretty,

509
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,320
but also smart and capable.

510
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,760
She is an expert in jewellery,

511
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,479
makeup and style.

512
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,800
You, on the other hand...

513
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
What else do you have
besides long legs?

514
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,320
I can draw.

515
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,959
I even won a competition.

516
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,239
What's the big deal?

517
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:53,919
What?

518
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,679
Fang Lie, didn't you promise me

519
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,199
that you would never draw again
and that you would study hard?

520
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,560
Mum, calm down.

521
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,719
I can explain.

522
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,679
It's not what you think.

523
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,239
I didn't miss any classes

524
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,760
when I was competing.

525
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,679
- Don't worry.
- You...

526
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,159
Mum, don't hit me. I'm sorry.

527
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,159
I will never lie to you again.

528
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,280
I was just afraid you'd be angry.

529
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I was wrong. I'll never draw again.

530
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,080
You are an incorrigible liar.

531
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,840
Do you think you can study seriously

532
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,080
if you spend

533
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,719
most of your time drawing?

534
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,199
Mum.

535
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,760
Don't call me that. I'm not your mum.

536
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,280
I don't have a son like you.

537
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,600
Nowadays, the children
of many big bosses

538
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,679
want to inherit their family business

539
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,719
so they can enjoy a good life

540
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,000
and avoid hardships.

541
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,159
What about you?

542
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,399
You keep fooling around.

543
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,520
This is my dream.

544
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,399
Dream?

545
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,439
Dream.

546
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,479
It's just a dream.

547
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:46,360
In reality, you have to be practical.

548
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,760
You can live your dream now,

549
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,080
but you'll regret it

550
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,959
when you can't sell your artwork

551
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,800
or feed yourself.

552
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm begging you.

553
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,560
Please study hard.

554
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,399
If you have time,

555
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,560
go to the company to adapt.

556
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,199
It's better than drawing.

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,199
My contest piece

558
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,159
is now valued at

559
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,239
nearly RMB1,000,000.

560
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
I can survive with
this amount of money.

561
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,320
A million is nothing.

562
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:15,560
Son.

563
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,760
Are you saying that

564
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,719
someone is offering
RMB1,000,000 for your painting?

565
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,239
But I rejected the offer.

566
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,840
I drew that especially for Xiaobu.

567
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,879
Wait.

568
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,840
Can you really sell
a piece of art for RMB1,000,000?

569
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,320
Fang Lie.

570
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,040
You can take it

571
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,479
as your side job.

572
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,840
Look, when you get home from work,

573
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,280
you can draw one every day.

574
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,600
It would be better

575
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,919
if each one sold for a million.

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,560
Then you'll make a fortune.

577
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,520
Son.

578
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,719
When did you learn to draw?

579
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,239
Xiaobu taught me.

580
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have participated

581
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,479
and won first place.

582
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,560
What?

583
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:58,959
Did Xiaobu also teach you to draw?

584
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,159
Mrs. Fang, I've cleaned it.

585
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,080
Already?

586
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,360
It's perfectly clean.

587
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,000
Xiaobu, you must be tired.

588
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,840
Here.

589
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,159
- I'm fine.
- Sit down.

590
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,239
Xiaobu.

591
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,760
It's really a shame

592
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
that such a good girl like you

593
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,399
likes my son.

594
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,600
Not at all.

595
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,199
Sit down.

596
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,320
Xiaobu.

597
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,239
You see, Fang Lie

598
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
seems to be a bit naughty

599
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,719
and childish at times.

600
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,959
I hope you don't despise him.

601
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,000
Actually, he is

602
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,199
very kind

603
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,439
and responsible.

604
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,520
You can rest assured.

605
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,439
You know what?

606
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,639
Adult children living at home

607
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,479
can be difficult for parents.

608
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,800
When the time is right, seize it.

609
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:51,439
Xiaobu.

610
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
Look at Fang Lie.

611
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,800
He's not young anymore.

612
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,199
If he doesn't get married now,

613
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:58,479
he won't leave this house.

614
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,919
I think

615
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,239
you two should settle down.

616
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,199
Mrs. Fang, are you
approving of our relationship?

617
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,719
From now on, you must treat him well.

618
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,399
Rest assured.

619
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,040
I will take good care of him.

620
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean,

621
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,000
you must teach him to draw well.

622
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,679
Each piece of art

623
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,439
should be valued at RMB1,000,000.

624
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,320
If they're all sold,

625
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,479
you two will be rich.

626
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,760
Mum, why do you always talk about money?

627
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
You know nothing.

628
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,479
You silly boy.

629
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,760
Xiaobu, try this grape.

630
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,280
It's sweet.

631
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,560
Isn't it?

632
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,959
You eat some, too.

633
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,159
Here.

634
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,719
Mum.

635
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,000
Since you are in good mood,

636
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,199
I have a confession to make.

637
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,360
Actually, I didn't go
to campus a while ago.

638
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,639
I lied to you about

639
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,560
Cape Town University.

640
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
I've been drawing
at a studio all this time.

641
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,679
What?

642
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,719
How dare you!

643
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,320
- You...
- Mum.

644
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,080
- Mum.
- I'll teach you a good lesson.

645
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm sorry. Please stop.

646
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:57,760
Brother.

647
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,479
What's going on?

648
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,679
I'll check it out.

649
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,239
Make a vegetable dish for Xiaoqi.

650
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,479
Look in the fridge.

651
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,199
Okay.

652
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,040
Sure.

653
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
Fang Lie is really something.

654
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,399
I guess superpowers are more convenient.

655
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,719
Silly.

656
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,439
Didn't you say superpowers are great?

657
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,719
It's because I'm hungry.

658
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,439
I'll be quick.

659
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,760
Here you go.

660
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,360
What a feast.

661
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,159
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

662
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,439
Mr. Fang made all of these.

663
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,239
Bravo.

664
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,120
You flatter me.

665
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
He is a great man indeed.

666
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,199
Dig in.

667
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,320
Eat up.

668
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,520
Dad hasn't started eating yet.

669
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,479
Drop the courtesy. Eat up.

670
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,439
Xiaoqi.

671
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
Here's a big hairy crab for you.

672
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,199
Fang Lie.

673
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,719
I'll serve you a bowl of soup, Xiaobu.

674
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,399
The 83rd trick to conquer parents

675
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,959
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
is to give priority to elders.

676
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,719
This trick is mainly used
in table manners.

677
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,800
(Miss Chai, Little Classroom)
Remember.

678
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,919
When you eat with his parents,

679
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,600
always give the best food
to his parents.

680
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Proritise them over you.

681
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,360
Mr. Fang.

682
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,239
Have this hairy crab.

683
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:46,919
Thanks.

684
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,320
Mrs. Fang, after you.

685
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,320
Don't be shy.

686
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,360
The food is getting cold. Eat up.

687
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,520
Thank you.

688
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,199
Fang Lie served it to you.
You can have it.

689
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,000
Go ahead, Xiaobu.

690
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
Mum, I'll serve you, too.

691
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,840
Such a silly son.

692
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:03,399
It looks yummy.

693
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:04,760
Xiaobu, don't be shy.

694
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,080
Here.

695
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,360
Mrs. Fang, eat up.

696
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:13,479
Here you go.

697
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,840
Try this.

698
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,919
Okay. Eat this.

699
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,520
Okay.

700
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,199
Here.

701
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,479
Cheers!

702
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,239
Xiaoqi.

703
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:28,040
Fang Leng hasn't
come to pick you up yet?

704
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,199
He should be here soon.

705
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,439
The office is nearby.

706
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,800
I can go on my own,

707
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:34,959
but he insists to pick me up.

708
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,399
You don't understand.

709
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,320
Love is really simple,

710
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,159
but we often make it complicated.

711
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,719
He's actually doing this to
show that he cares about you.

712
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,439
Silly.

713
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,840
Why couldn't you even
hold a cake properly?

714
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,399
Seriously?

715
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,080
I can't believe you're complaining.

716
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,520
I made this cake for you.

717
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Gosh, it's ruined now.

718
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,600
No choice then.

719
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,560
You're so cheeky. Stop fooling around.

720
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:22,439
I don't like it.

721
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,199
Okay, I'll stop.

722
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,439
Give me a hug.

723
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,679
Okay.

724
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
Enough.

725
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,600
Stop it.

726
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,159
Han.

727
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,040
Mr. Fang, we have news
from the Research Department.

728
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,879
The mass production is a success!

729
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,840
This batch

730
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,360
has the same smell

731
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,600
as the one I made.

732
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,239
We can proceed with the production.

733
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:31,840
Mr. Fang.

734
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,919
The last trial release
of pheromone perfume

735
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,040
was already sold out.

736
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,280
The Marketing Department said

737
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,800
we've doubled the number of orders

738
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,199
this time around.

739
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,000
People are anticipating it.

740
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,199
Let's restock it soon.

741
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,560
No problem.

742
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,439
I will proceed with the blending.

743
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,760
No, Xiaoqi. You can
do it some other time.

744
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,000
You've just returned. No rush.

745
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,320
It's okay.

746
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,520
Why don't you help me?

747
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay.

748
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:58,760
Let's start.

749
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,760
This must be it.

750
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,159
Mr. Fang.

751
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,199
Our partner has arranged
a meeting with us this morning.

752
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,399
They are already here now.

753
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,919
Let them wait a while.

754
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,560
No. Don't keep people waiting.

755
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:32,360
Go ahead.

756
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,719
I can do this alone.

757
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,919
Go ahead.

758
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,959
All right.

759
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,199
Give me a hug.

760
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,000
Give her a kiss.

761
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,239
A kiss?

762
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,520
Two kisses.

763
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,719
Go ahead.

764
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,560
Don't get too tired.

765
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,399
Go now.

766
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,239
(What's wrong with me?)

767
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,920
Master.

768
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,279
After the hormone is
completely broken down,

769
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:24,000
your powers seem to
be stronger than ever.

770
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:25,839
I didn't expect it either.

771
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,520
This hormone

772
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
probably has some kind
of special element in it.

773
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,279
Not only can it
enhance my survival ability,

774
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,759
I even become more powerful.

775
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,440
However, the breakdown process

776
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,679
was so difficult

777
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,319
that if I hadn't held out,

778
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,600
I would have died.

779
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,159
What is this?

780
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,679
Fang Leng sent this hormone element

781
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,839
while you were in a coma.

782
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,600
He probably wants me to leave sooner.

783
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,000
If we transmit the return signal now,

784
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
how soon can
the spaceship arrive?

785
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Given the speed of the ship
and the distance of the planet,

786
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,880
it should take at least half a month.

787
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,679
Master, are you sure
you want to leave this time?

788
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
How is Xiaoqi?

789
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,960
Xiaoqi has been with Fang Leng.

790
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,120
She also visited
Zhou Siqin and Fang Shida.

791
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,159
She's been at the milk tea shop today.

792
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,639
However, I detected

793
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,960
a loss of control in her powers.

794
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,000
If my calculations are correct,

795
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,040
this must be the 76th day

796
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:23,520
that Xiaoqi has been on Earth.

797
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
Why did my superpowers

798
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,120
suddenly become like this?

799
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,440
(Xiaobu.)

800
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,359
(There seems to be
something wrong with my body.)

801
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,319
Ms. Chai.

802
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,600
Yes?

803
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,040
I've recently hit
a bottleneck in my writing.

804
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,279
I don't know how to continue the novel.

805
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,159
A lot of readers want to see

806
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,600
a more sadistic storyline.

807
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,040
So

808
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,120
I want to give the heroine
a sudden terminal illness.

809
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
Can't they just stay sweet?

810
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,520
Why all of a sudden?

811
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,080
The sea is calm before the storm.

812
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,799
They have been
happy together for so long

813
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,600
that people are already
tired of the storyline.

814
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,960
I need to spice it up.

815
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,560
For example, a sudden incident.

816
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:05,759
Writing is not easy.

817
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,400
It focuses on rhythm.

818
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,359
Are you having too much free time?

819
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,719
Mr. Fang.

820
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,239
Xiaoqi.

821
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The sample of the perfume

822
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,359
have been sent to the production plant.

823
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:26,560
It will be officially
launched in a few days.

824
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:27,960
Really?

825
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,639
I'll take you to dinner after work,

826
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,279
okay?

827
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:32,839
Tonight?

828
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,279
Sorry,

829
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,000
Xiaobu just told me
she wants to see me.

830
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,520
I need to go back to her.

831
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,400
So I may not be able to eat with you.

832
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,600
I'll get going.

833
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,679
But I...

834
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
Maybe next time.

835
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,440
Bye.

836
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,080
What's wrong?

837
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,839
Are you okay?

838
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,880
My stomach hurts.
I need to go to the toilet.

839
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:57,080
Xiaoqi!

840
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,319
Stomach ache?

841
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,320
(Analyzing data)

842
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,660
(Body function is normal)

843
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:16,120
According to my diagnosis,

844
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,400
your body is normal

845
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,520
and there is nothing wrong with it.

846
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,159
Nothing is wrong?

847
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,920
Then why can't I use my powers?

848
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,600
Coming.

849
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,279
What brings you here?

850
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
- Xiaoqi.
- Xiaoqi.

851
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,639
Shiyi, why are you here?

852
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,880
How is your body recovering?

853
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,799
- I was so focused on saving...
- I'm fine.

854
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,759
I've recovered.

855
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:51,920
Here, Xiaoqi.

856
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,080
You should be worried
about your physical condition.

857
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,040
What do you mean?

858
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,199
We, Cape Townians,

859
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,199
must maintain our survival energy

860
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,639
if we are to stay on Earth.

861
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,520
You've been on Earth too long

862
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,359
and your energy is almost depleted.

863
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,679
Last time you defended
Fang Leng from another attack.

864
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,719
So your energy is draining fast.

865
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,440
I don't care if my energy is draining

866
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,239
or I can't use my powers,

867
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,000
but why have I been dizzy today?

868
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,080
This is the warning signal

869
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
your body is sending you.

870
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,960
Xiaoqi, follow me back
to the home planet.

871
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,880
No.

872
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,679
If I go back, I have to
separate from Fang Leng.

873
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,719
Xiaobu, can you help me check

874
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,520
how long I can survive on Earth

875
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,000
if I don't use my powers?

876
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,640
(Survival time
Exporting)

877
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,040
(Survival time
Around 28.6 days)

878
00:38:57,279 --> 00:38:59,880
No more than a month at most.

879
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,199
Your body will get weaker

880
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:05,199
and you will eventually
feel tired even walking.

881
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,799
Don't tell

882
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:10,000
Fang Leng about this.

883
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,000
Fang Leng, why are you here?

884
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,759
Is Xiaoqi here?

885
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,839
She's inside.

886
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,000
Xiaoqi.

887
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,440
Why are you so absorbed in thought?

888
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,080
The latest flavour of fried chicken.

889
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,839
Fried chicken?

890
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:49,799
It's for your midnight snack.

891
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,560
Have you had enough
fried chicken lately?

892
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,239
You're looking lethargic all day long.

893
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,359
That's not it.

894
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,560
Don't you want to eat?

895
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:05,480
I'm on a diet.

896
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
I'll eat it tomorrow.

897
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,679
I was just thinking.

898
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,719
It seems like since we've been dating,

899
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,319
you've always known what I like

900
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,199
and done things for me,

901
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,799
but I never seem to

902
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,719
do anything for you.

903
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,440
Do you have something in particular

904
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,480
that you would like to do?

905
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,759
I love you.

906
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,319
So everything I do with you

907
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,480
is what I like.

908
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,159
All right.

909
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:38,679
How about this?

910
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,279
Is there anything you'd like to do most?

911
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:42,279
You can

912
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,199
make a wish list

913
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,480
and I'll fulfil it for you

914
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,040
from tomorrow onwards.

915
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,319
Okay.

916
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,359
Go and think about it.

917
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,679
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Go now.

918
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,199
Come on.

919
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,440
- Write more.
- Xiaoqi.

920
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,639
Go now.

921
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,600
Come on.

922
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Let's hug.

923
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:00,759
Okay.

924
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,719
Go now, okay?

925
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,440
Okay.

926
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,679
Goodnight.

927
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,080
- Xiaoqi.
- Goodnight.
