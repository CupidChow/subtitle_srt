19
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,351
I'm so mad.

20
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,192
What was that? Some kind of drama?

21
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,392
"Know your place."

22
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:43,711
"You are just an employee".

23
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:46,752
What's wrong with
respecting the working people?

24
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,231
Slow down or you'll sprain your ankle.

25
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:50,752
How could I possibly sprain...

26
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,192
I just said that...

27
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:56,951
Are you okay?

28
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,711
Even my foot is bullying me.

29
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,392
You usually have a lot of things to say.

30
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:01,711
Why were you so quiet today?

31
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,472
I was afraid that I would offend people.

32
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:05,392
If I offended Chen Mengfei,

33
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,672
Mr. Zhou would get upset

34
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,952
and refuse to set up
the R&D department for us.

35
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,992
I didn't cause you trouble today, did I?

36
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,272
You've always been my trouble.

37
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,232
I'm used to it.

38
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,711
Anyway, thank you for helping me today.

39
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,191
This isn't appropriate.

40
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,311
They're so sweet.

41
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,352
Hello, sir, where are you?

42
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,911
You have one minute to be here

43
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:05,952
or...

44
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,031
Help!

45
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:13,711
Someone fell into the water!

46
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,072
Good morning, Xiaoqi.

47
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:24,631
Good morning.

48
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:30,552
Come on.

49
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,191
Try Chai's new recipe,

50
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,352
Cola Sea Salt with Pudding.

51
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,471
Mr. Fang is in a bad mood today.

52
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,232
Don't ever mention the R&D department.

53
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,151
I said

54
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,512
Cola Sea Salt with Pudding.

55
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,031
R&D department.

56
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,711
Mr. Zhou didn't agree to it yesterday.

57
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,392
Anyway, be careful.

58
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,072
Don't rub him the wrong way.

59
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,151
Thanks.

60
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,152
What's wrong?

61
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,071
You are in a bad mood today.

62
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,631
Is it because of what
happened last night?

63
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,951
Did Mr. Han tell you?

64
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,792
Mr. Zhou hasn't agreed yet.

65
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:35,712
It's not because of me, right?

66
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,472
Being rejected at work

67
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:38,912
is normal.

68
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,352
The most important thing now

69
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,232
is to figure out how
to solve the problem.

70
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,391
Even if you are in a bad mood

71
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,391
or regret your actions,

72
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:46,992
it doesn't solve anything.

73
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,352
You don't have to be stressed.

74
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:52,112
It wasn't your fault.

75
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,271
I'm the boss.

76
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,792
I should be responsible

77
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,472
for what happened in the company.

78
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,712
He's so cool.

79
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:03,112
I did not know

80
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,472
Fang Leng was such a responsible man.

81
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,191
I thought he was going to fire you.

82
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,831
Although he doesn't mind,

83
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,992
I feel bad.

84
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:14,831
Chen Mengfei

85
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,112
is Mr. Zhou's niece.

86
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:20,352
I offended his niece's good friend.

87
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:23,232
That will still affect Fang Leng.

88
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:27,792
Earthlings and their interpersonal
relationships are really complicated.

89
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,152
He said that it's not your fault

90
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:31,032
to make you feel better.

91
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,191
Who knew it'd make you feel more guilty?

92
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,191
Yes.

93
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,232
How did this happen?

94
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:37,992
So, what are you going to do?

95
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,751
Will you make it clear to Mr. Zhou?

96
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,831
I want to do that,

97
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,191
but I looked for him twice

98
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,792
and he wasn't in the office.

99
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:48,391
Don't tell me

100
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,912
I have to go to his house again.

101
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,472
Maybe I should.

102
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:53,631
Help me to look up something.

103
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,060
(Searching for Mr. Zhou's information.)

104
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,032
Sorry.

105
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,951
The number you are dialling
cannot be reached at the moment.

106
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,352
Please call again later.

107
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,871
Mr. Zhou is obstinate.

108
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:24,712
Can't you try a bit harder

109
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:25,792
to be worthy of me?

110
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,472
You won't apply hair tonic
nor wear a wig.

111
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,871
What's wrong with having hair?

112
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,391
I was bald when we got married.

113
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,672
Why didn't you say so at that time?

114
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,232
When we got married, you said

115
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,831
you would come home every day
to cook and look after the kids.

116
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:35,992
Now, you don't come home

117
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:36,871
nor look after the kids.

118
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:37,552
Let me tell you,

119
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:39,391
if you really don't
care about the family,

120
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,712
don't blame me for
leaving everything behind.

121
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:41,871
Stop wearing these.

122
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,191
Wear them outside.

123
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:44,311
Get out!

124
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,391
What are you doing?

125
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,112
- Mr. Zhou.
- Ask her for your cleaning fee.

126
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,271
Cleaning fee?

127
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,552
Ignore him. Come in.

128
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:52,751
Okay.

129
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,672
Mr. Zhou

130
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:55,871
Well...

131
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,352
I am the cleaner today.

132
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:02,672
My code name is 777.

133
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,951
Okay, you can start work now.

134
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:05,271
The vacuum cleaner is here.

135
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,712
Thank you.

136
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,112
She's so considerate.

137
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,992
She gave me a walking
cane in case I get tired.

138
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,352
Mrs. Zhou, I think you have a guest.

139
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:36,871
Who is it?

140
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,032
Mr. Fang, what brings you here?

141
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:41,951
Hello, Mrs. Zhou.

142
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,191
Is Mr. Zhou around?

143
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,152
What a coincidence. If you
came five minutes earlier,

144
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:47,032
he'd still be alive.

145
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,792
I mean he'd be still here.

146
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,712
When will he be back?

147
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:52,712
Why don't you come in and take a seat?

148
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,992
I'll give him a call.

149
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:55,232
- Okay.
- Please come in.

150
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:57,831
Sit down and I'll make
you a cup of coffee.

151
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,391
Okay.

152
00:07:58,391 --> 00:07:59,511
Make yourself at home.

153
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,831
What are you doing here?

154
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:14,831
I...

155
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,712
By the way, how sweet do
you want your coffee to be?

156
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:18,472
Just slightly, thank you.

157
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:19,071
Okay.

158
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:23,831
What are you up to?

159
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,191
I

160
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:27,472
am here to clean.

161
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,071
- You...
- Do you know how to use this?

162
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,832
You're here to clean yet you can't
even use a vacuum cleaner.

163
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:34,352
Do you know how to use it then?

164
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,151
Of course I do. How could I not know?

165
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:40,551
You don't know either.

166
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:41,352
Of course I do.

167
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,511
I...

168
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,352
Do it just like that. Look.

169
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,631
Vacuum that area.

170
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,992
- Right here?
- Yes.

171
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,232
Amazing.

172
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:56,592
Over there.

173
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,031
There.

174
00:08:59,192 --> 00:08:59,911
Over there.

175
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,271
Why am I helping you instead?

176
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,511
You're better at it.

177
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:03,791
- Over there.
- Take it.

178
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,671
Do you two know each other?

179
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,671
What a coincidence. She happens to

180
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,551
work at my house as a cleaner.

181
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,312
So, she's quite professional.

182
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:11,832
Yes.

183
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,112
- What a coincidence.
- I know.

184
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,031
Then I'll give Zhou a call.

185
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,112
Okay.

186
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:19,312
Hello.

187
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,192
Where are you?

188
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,871
Excuse me.

189
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:25,511
Okay.

190
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:42,192
Stop it.

191
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,712
I think the two of
them are at it again...

192
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:09,952
Didn't you say we'd keep our distance?

193
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:12,352
You're asking me what you did wrong?

194
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:13,791
What's the point of me telling you?

195
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,751
It's not like you would listen.

196
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,352
Even if you did, you wouldn't
admit your mistake.

197
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,712
Even if you did change,
I'd still be unhappy,

198
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,671
because you would definitely
say that I made you do it.

199
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,112
The two of them

200
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,551
must have a serious misunderstanding.

201
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,391
When I came,

202
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,192
I saw that they were fighting.

203
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:28,592
I don't think it's can be solved

204
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:29,751
with an apology.

205
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,432
You didn't even put
in effort to select a gift.

206
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,631
Did you forget our wedding anniversary?

207
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:40,511
Is she holding

208
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,352
a token of love?

209
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,271
That seems to be Future Group's

210
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:49,391
first generation perfume.

211
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:53,911
If we help them

212
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,712
to resolve their conflict,

213
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,072
we will be doing Mr. Zhou a huge favour.

214
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,271
What are you trying to say?

215
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,232
Some people

216
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:02,112
have certain opinions and attitude

217
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,192
on certain things.

218
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,151
However, that

219
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:05,511
greatly depends

220
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,112
on the mood at the time.

221
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:08,751
If we help them

222
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,432
to resolve their conflict

223
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,192
and improve their relationship,

224
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,151
then Mr. Zhou will be in a good mood

225
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,992
and might even help you to
set up the R&D department.

226
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,551
It makes sense.

227
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,192
However, that perfume is our
first generation perfume.

228
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,391
It's been long discontinued.

229
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,192
Besides, we don't keep the formula.

230
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,592
Have you forgotten that I have
a keen sense of smell?

231
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,312
I'll bring it here.

232
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:34,832
Don't go anywhere.

233
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:37,031
Stay here.

234
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:42,151
Come in.

235
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:44,871
It's me, Mrs. Zhou.

236
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,631
Did the coffee turn cold?

237
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,151
Should I bring you
a fresh cup of coffee?

238
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:49,511
No, I just...

239
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,391
This fragrance

240
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,952
is the first generation fragrance
of our group, right?

241
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,712
This fragrance

242
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:00,911
has always been a classic

243
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,352
among our consumers.

244
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:05,432
However, because the formula
was lost a few years ago,

245
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:06,871
we have since discontinued the product.

246
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,432
However, recently, our company
has a new project.

247
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,192
We're going to bring back

248
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:14,832
the first generation of fragrances.

249
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:16,391
Seriously?

250
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,112
So I wonder if you could

251
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,151
lend me your bottle of perfume.

252
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:23,271
I'll get our perfumer

253
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,631
to restore the original scent.

254
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:26,992
Of course.

255
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:28,511
it'd be wonderful

256
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,151
if that could be done.

257
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:34,871
I'm sure there won't be any problem.

258
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,592
The top note is jasmine.

259
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,151
The middle note is lemon

260
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,352
and the base note is Orioles.

261
00:12:58,352 --> 00:12:59,791
Our company takes the classical approach

262
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,352
in making perfume.

263
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:13,712
Here, have some water.

264
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,432
Thanks.

265
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,432
The water is here.

266
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:43,072
Is this the one?

267
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:05,592
Thanks.

268
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:35,871
It smells really nice.

269
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
(Retrieve successfully.)

270
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:05,751
Yes.

271
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,820
(Searching for signal.)

272
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,460
(Sending failed.)

273
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,980
(Resending.)

274
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,100
(Sending failed.)

275
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,352
What's going on?

276
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,380
(Sunny Apartment)

277
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,192
Xiaobu, I'm back...

278
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:35,151
Don't move!

279
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:36,712
What happened?

280
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:37,871
Why are you taking so many pills?

281
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:39,072
What's wrong? Are you ill?

282
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,271
Do you feel unwell? Show me.

283
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,232
Don't humans take medicine
when they are sick?

284
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:47,871
I suspect that I have a computer virus.

285
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:49,232
So I'm thinking I'll give it a try.

286
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:50,911
What? No.

287
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,511
Tablets for digestion?

288
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,472
How can you use these
to cure a sickness?

289
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:00,551
Wait, what virus do you have?

290
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:03,151
My signaler is fixed

291
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,872
and the system check
shows everything is fine.

292
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:07,751
However, I'm unable to get a signal
connection with our home planet.

293
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:10,912
Xiaoqi,

294
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,551
I'm so depressed.

295
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,632
At this rate, when can we go back?

296
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,232
Don't be.

297
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:17,152
It's okay.

298
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,952
Although your signaler
can't issue transmission,

299
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,791
I still have
a hormone-collecting device.

300
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:23,831
We can send signal

301
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,632
when my collector is full.

302
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:26,432
Besides, now Fang Leng

303
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:27,992
is establishing the R&D department.

304
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,271
Our mission will be accomplished

305
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,351
when we've collected
enough Hormone Element,

306
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,591
and we can go home.

307
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,111
So, don't worry.

308
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:35,712
All right.

309
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,192
I'm confiscating this.

310
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,952
How long do we have to wait?

311
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,351
I suspect that

312
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,031
someone has blocked my signal.

313
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,540
(Searching for signal.)

314
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,980
(Sending signal.)

315
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,300
(Sending failed.)

316
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,060
(Sunny Apartment)

317
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,271
Just now, Xiaobu tried
to send a signal again.

318
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,472
However, I've intercepted it.

319
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,271
Thanks, Candy.

320
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:28,712
Candy.

321
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:40,392
Xiaoqi,

322
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,031
I'm here.

323
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,152
Neutron Star's explosion affected

324
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,232
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven's

325
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,511
route through time.

326
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,551
If we want to get Hormone Elements now,

327
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,831
we can only

328
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,031
let her remain on earth.

329
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:54,952
However, so far,

330
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:56,511
Hormone Elements have
not been developed.

331
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,872
The difficulty of mission has increased.

332
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,111
It's hard for her to accomplish
this with her own ability.

333
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:01,751
Why don't we bring her back

334
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:04,031
to avoid more serious consequences?

335
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:05,271
Leader.

336
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:10,392
Leader,

337
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:12,712
the existence of Hormone Elements

338
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,031
has completely threatened

339
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,392
Cape Towners' belief.

340
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,992
I don't think we should
abort the mission.

341
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,271
We should send someone capable,

342
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,351
who is able to handle the task well,

343
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:23,071
to keep an eye

344
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,111
on Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

345
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,351
We'll protect her

346
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,031
and provide assistance  in secret

347
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,031
so that she can finish the mission.

348
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:31,192
In the past,

349
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,271
we used to have a space hub on earth.

350
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:34,511
It was camouflaged

351
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:36,432
under a design company named The One.

352
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,351
I think

353
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,192
this can give the ones
that carry out the mission

354
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:40,791
a very good cover.

355
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:42,591
Which of you

356
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,912
is willing to go to earth
to perform a mission?

357
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:48,791
I'll do it.

358
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:50,992
If you successfully complete the task,

359
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:54,351
I'll reserve the position
of the next leader to you.

360
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:01,351
Master,

361
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,192
welcome to earth.

362
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:05,152
Candy,

363
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:06,192
search for me

364
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,872
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven's

365
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:08,632
coordinates.

366
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:12,152
Her code name on earth is Chai Xiaoqi.

367
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,551
She's currently attending
a cocktail party with Fang Leng.

368
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,860
(Time: 18:00, location: Kaibin Restaurant,
dress code: suit)

369
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,111
Did you rent the dress?

370
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,820
(Searching for signal.)

371
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,791
Candy, intercept the signal.

372
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:47,311
(Found signal, trying to intercept.)
Yes, master.

373
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,340
(Sending failed.)

374
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:54,992
What's going on?

375
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:56,392
Right now,

376
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:58,791
they don't need to
contact the home planet.

377
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:03,111
Master, what are you going to do next?

378
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,071
We'll assist Xiaoqi for now.

379
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:32,031
You can even forge others' handwritings?

380
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:36,192
There's nothing that I,
Niuhuru Seven, can't do.

381
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,551
Mr. Fang and Ms. Chai.

382
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,271
This is the R&D report you want.

383
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,271
Send these two cards

384
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,472
to Mr. and Mrs. Zhou respectively.

385
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:01,551
Then book seats for them

386
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:02,751
at 6.30pm

387
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,432
at Rose Restaurant tonight.

388
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:07,791
Yes, sir.

389
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,351
Imitate Mr. and Mrs. Zhou's handwriting

390
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,672
and invite them to dinner
in each other's name

391
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,632
so that they will reconcile.

392
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:17,351
Mr. Fang,

393
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:19,791
it turns out you not only know
the rules of the commerce world,

394
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:22,632
this kind of shady business
is also a piece of cake to you.

395
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:23,831
I'm impressed.

396
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,071
It's true.

397
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,152
That shady business you're saying

398
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:29,152
was Chai Xiaoqi's idea.

399
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,712
No wonder.

400
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:35,152
Famous teachers produce good students.

401
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,511
It's all about talent, you know?

402
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:40,791
I wish you

403
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,831
success in advance.

404
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,632
Get back to work.

405
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,872
Didn't Mr. Han say

406
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:18,992
they would make up as soon as
they came to the restaurant?

407
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,192
Why is the atmosphere so strange?

408
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:24,591
They haven't spoken for 10 minutes.

409
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,791
Are they competing?

410
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:30,831
Apologise.

411
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:32,271
Okay.

412
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:34,831
What do you mean?

413
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,152
Do you expect me to apologise?

414
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:37,952
Didn't you say that you're sorry

415
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,031
and want to talk to me about it?

416
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:41,192
I'm sorry?

417
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:42,672
I accept your apology.

418
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:45,152
I don't need you to accept my apology.

419
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,271
If you didn't act pitiful

420
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:47,232
using the card,

421
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,232
I wouldn't even have come.

422
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:49,152
They're talking.

423
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:50,672
The conversation seems pleasant.

424
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,872
Pleasant? When have you
seen a pleasant conversation

425
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:53,751
in which people are rolling their eyes?

426
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,311
All right, no matter who invited us,

427
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:56,392
tell me.

428
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:57,912
Why did you return

429
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:58,712
all my gifts?

430
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:00,031
I've told you before.

431
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:01,632
I'd like any gift

432
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:02,511
as long as you chose it carefully.

433
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,152
Ask yourself, did you put in effort?

434
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,472
It's up to you whether
I put in effort or not.

435
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,712
What else can I say?

436
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,071
Electronic aromatherapy toilet seat

437
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:09,472
and intelligent housekeeping robot.

438
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:10,511
These are very practical.

439
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:11,872
What do you mean I didn't put in effort?

440
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:13,432
You only know how to choose

441
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,392
- a good gift
- They are having another fight.

442
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:15,071
for me.

443
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:15,751
- Did you even ask - Xiaoqi.

444
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:16,992
what I really liked?

445
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:18,831
Don't you think you're so selfish?

446
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:20,071
I'm selfish?

447
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:20,952
I'm so busy with work every day

448
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,111
and I have to think of what to get you.

449
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,751
As a result, I am called selfish.

450
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,992
Do you think you can ignore your family

451
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:27,031
just because you're busy with work?

452
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:29,311
What were you thinking?

453
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,751
You're too much.

454
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,351
(Xiaobu, I'll go home late today.)

455
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:39,511
(I'm going to use my superpower
to save a couple from a quarrel.)

456
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:48,511
Wave of Love!

457
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:52,551
I've sat here and chatted
with you all night,

458
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:54,511
yet you think my attitude is bad.

459
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,432
You are too demanding.

460
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:56,351
All I want

461
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:57,311
is a gift that I really like.

462
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:58,031
Is that so difficult?

463
00:24:58,031 --> 00:24:59,432
You should tell me what you like.

464
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:00,952
- Waves of Love.
- instead of keeping me guessing.

465
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:02,712
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

466
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:03,432
wait.

467
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:05,432
- Fang Leng? Why are you here?
- Waves of Love.

468
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:06,511
I happen to

469
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,071
- be talking to customers in there.
- Lightwave of Love.

470
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:09,872
Wave of Love.
- A man dedicated to his career

471
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:10,511
rarely buys gifts

472
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,311
- for his wife.
- What else?

473
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:12,591
Is your girlfriend also
this unreasonable

474
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,712
when she receives a gift?

475
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,551
Say that again. I'm unreasonable?

476
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,712
You're shouting in public.

477
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:18,632
Have you got no shame?

478
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:19,992
If you leave now, we might
as well get a divorce.

479
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:21,672
Mrs. Zhou,

480
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:23,031
calm down.

481
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:26,551
I remember now.

482
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:33,271
Lightwave

483
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:37,311
of

484
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:40,432
Love!

485
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,392
I did it.

486
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,432
Give me a hug.

487
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,232
It's useful.

488
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,511
Xiaoqi must have succeeded.

489
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:08,351
However, I did nothing to help her.

490
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:11,831
By the way, Xiaobu,

491
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:14,392
why did you ask me out today?

492
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:16,632
It's just that

493
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,472
I was in a bad mood.

494
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:23,712
That's because you thought too much.

495
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:25,632
You have too much worries in your mind.

496
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:26,591
Look at me.

497
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,071
There's nothing on my mind.

498
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:29,672
So, there isn't so much trouble.

499
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,900
(Mother)

500
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,551
Oh no.

501
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:38,712
What to do?

502
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:46,472
What should I do?

503
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,672
I can't possibly tell her I'm
in Chinatown every time.

504
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,152
What should I do?

505
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:12,311
Can't you handle it?

506
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,632
Yes.

507
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,232
I have an idea.

508
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,031
Come on.

509
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,192
Where are we going?

510
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:32,392
Mother.

511
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:33,232
Fang Lie,

512
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,111
why did it take you so long
to answer the call?

513
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,232
I'm studying in the U.S.,

514
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,551
not discovering a new continent.

515
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,311
Do you have to call me every few days?

516
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:41,952
Of course. Without my supervision,

517
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:43,432
are you able to study well?

518
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,831
Where are you now?

519
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,392
I...

520
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:50,071
We have to finish this project

521
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:51,872
before the deadline tonight.

522
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,831
We have to finish this project

523
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,071
before the deadline tonight.

524
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,232
Please hurry.

525
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,632
Hurry up.

526
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:02,992
Got it, just give me one minute.

527
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:05,192
Mother, I'm outside right now.

528
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:06,071
I'll talk to you next time.

529
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:07,071
All right.

530
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,111
We'll talk next time. Eat properly.

531
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:10,232
Don't order takeout so often.

532
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,551
Okay, mother, I got it. Bye.

533
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:14,511
Yes.

534
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:23,351
You've already hung up the phone.

535
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,351
Why are you still upset?

536
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:27,831
I've been hiding
the fact that I'm in China.

537
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,912
When can I tell the truth?

538
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,392
However, after telling the truth,

539
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:34,351
my mother will brainwash me

540
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,632
and force me to go abroad.

541
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,232
It turns out you have your own trouble.

542
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,591
Let's talk about it later.

543
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:50,591
Thanks for your help.

544
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:52,071
Anyway,

545
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:54,632
you just told me you were in a bad mood.

546
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:55,872
What happened?

547
00:29:57,751 --> 00:30:00,351
I was in a bad mood,

548
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:01,791
but seeing you

549
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,071
makes me feel much better.

550
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,232
Really?

551
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,672
Am I that great?

552
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,192
It's because the difficulties
I encounter

553
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,831
are too complicated.

554
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:14,952
To me,

555
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:15,831
you're the simplest thing

556
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,872
on earth.

557
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,751
Helping you to solve the problem

558
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:24,111
makes me feel worthy.

559
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:24,952
That's good enough.

560
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:06,952
Xiaobu, what's wrong?

561
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:09,551
I am a little thirsty.

562
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,872
Buy me a drink.

563
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,031
You should have said so earlier.

564
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:12,831
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

565
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:15,632
By the way,

566
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:16,392
well,

567
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:20,551
Xiaobu?

568
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,472
Xiaobu!

569
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:28,031
Is she that thirsty?

570
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,192
(Why did I turn into a tortoise again?)

571
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,192
That tortoise seems familiar.

572
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:42,472
Xiaoqi,

573
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:43,831
did you see the flowers

574
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:44,751
blooming suddenly?

575
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:45,712
The flowers are blooming?

576
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,192
Amazing.

577
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:50,152
It's what they say on the Internet,

578
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:51,672
the gimmicks of
Instagrammable restaurants.

579
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,591
First, put in frozen buds

580
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,111
and lower the temperature.

581
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,992
When you want them to bloom,

582
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:58,111
turn up the temperature,

583
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,831
and they'll bloom.

584
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:02,152
Is that so?

585
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:04,872
Nevermind.

586
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,111
Look, they've reconciled.

587
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,271
Do you remember how long it's been

588
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:08,992
since you last held me in your arms?

589
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:10,511
It's my fault,

590
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,152
always thinking about making money.

591
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,712
I ended up neglecting
the people closest to me.

592
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,511
Baby,

593
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,872
I will never make you sad again.

594
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:29,432
Dear,

595
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,511
do you remember?

596
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,152
This is our token of love.

597
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:37,271
I didn't want anything else
for our wedding anniversary.

598
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,192
I just wanted another
bottle of this perfume.

599
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:40,432
However,

600
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,192
you bought me a bunch of stuff.

601
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:43,672
Of course I was angry.

602
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,511
I see. So you wanted the perfume.

603
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:47,192
Mr. Zhou,

604
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:48,912
this is the bottle of perfume

605
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:50,591
that you asked me to restore.

606
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:52,511
Due to technical problems,

607
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,632
it was delayed until now.

608
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:55,751
Mr. Fang,..

609
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,311
didn't you say this was your group's

610
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,392
new project?

611
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,672
Actually, it's a surprise

612
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,111
planned by Mr. Zhou.

613
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:03,232
That's why I didn't tell you.

614
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,351
The fireworks and restaurant today

615
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,831
were also prepared for you by him.

616
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,432
Really?

617
00:33:10,152 --> 00:33:10,992
Of course.

618
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:13,432
How could I forget our token of love?

619
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:21,591
Mrs. Zhou,

620
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:23,031
I'm glad that you like it.

621
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:25,551
Actually, I don't think
technology has no warmth.

622
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,031
In fact, it's quite the contrary.

623
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:28,672
In the future, Future Group

624
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,472
will make a fragrance
that can capture emotions,

625
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,591
to create a product

626
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:34,831
that stores users' good memories.

627
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:36,591
That's wonderful.

628
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,952
Technology does bring us surprise.

629
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:40,551
However...

630
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,392
You should support

631
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,392
the young and talented Mr. Fang.

632
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:57,152
Mr. Fang,

633
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,192
if you can confirm that
the R&D department

634
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,271
will bring more value to the company,

635
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,071
just go ahead and do it.

636
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:07,071
How unexpected.

637
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,071
You're nothing like what
others say about you.

638
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,151
I'm impressed.

639
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:12,031
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

640
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,671
Dear, let's go home.

641
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:16,591
Goodbye, Mr. Fang.

642
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:18,191
Good luck.

643
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:25,992
Are the fireworks your idea?

644
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,312
Yes, I bought and released it.

645
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:31,792
So, did Mr. Zhou agree to it?

646
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:32,711
Of course.

647
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,432
The official board meeting
will be held tomorrow

648
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:35,952
to formally establish
the R&D department.

649
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:39,191
We did it.

650
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:44,912
Are you hungry?

651
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:52,631
Mr. Han,

652
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,711
organise a board meeting tomorrow.

653
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,392
I want to speak to the directors

654
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:58,432
about the preparation of
setting up a R&D department.

655
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,060
(Han: Mr. Zhou has agreed?)

656
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
(Han: Congratulations!)

657
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,260
(Yes.)

658
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,671
Don't talk about work
at this hour, okay?

659
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:17,832
Do you want some?

660
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,352
I really don't understand why you people

661
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,952
like to eat this kind of junk food.

662
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,952
You can't judge a book
by its cover, you know?

663
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:25,432
It

664
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:26,472
looks

665
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:28,671
delicious.

666
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:30,071
Also, it tastes

667
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:31,952
even better.

668
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,352
Thanks.

669
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,231
It feels much warmer this way.

670
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,151
Why did you help me?

671
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,551
Well, I just did it.

672
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,792
Don't ask so many questions.

673
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,031
I guess

674
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,671
it's because you like me.

675
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:10,792
It's fine

676
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:11,952
if you think that way.

677
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:13,551
I'm fine with it.

678
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,551
You know what?

679
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,312
It takes two persons to be in love.

680
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:22,151
It's useless

681
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,352
if the feelings aren't mutual.

682
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:26,912
You overthink it.

683
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,872
I don't have feelings
for someone like you...

684
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:30,151
What are you saying?

685
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:33,752
I'm saying...

686
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:35,591
I'm saying that I...

687
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,191
I...

688
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:40,952
It's useless to drown one's sorrows.

689
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:42,992
I advise you to give up.

690
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:45,432
Find someone who is right for you

691
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:47,272
and lead a happy life.

692
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:48,952
No...

693
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:51,352
No.

694
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:53,752
Can you let me eat
fried chicken in peace?

695
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,191
You're so noisy.

696
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:56,272
I repeat. I don't want to eat it.

697
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:57,312
Eat some.

698
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,191
I don't want to.

699
00:36:58,191 --> 00:36:59,671
Eat one.

700
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,140
Eat it.

701
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,151

This water isn't as good as ice cubes.

716
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:56,191
It took so long to cool down.

717
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:00,711
My system is already fixed.

718
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:02,992
Why is the temperature so unstable?

719
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,260
(Fang Lie)
(Xiaobu, where are you going?)

720
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,872
I felt unwell and left first.

721
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:16,671
See you.

722
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,660
(Sunny Apartment)

723
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:26,832
Chai,

724
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:28,551
Xiaoqi is drunk.

725
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,671
How much did she drink

726
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:31,792
to be this drunk?

727
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:32,992
Three cans of fruit beer.

728
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:34,912
Here.

729
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,551
Thanks, Mr. Fang.

730
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:42,591
Dear.

731
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,031
Oh no.

732
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,832
I should have just
pretended not to be home.

733
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:51,392
Such a good opportunity wasted.

734
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:55,952
All right, Xiaoqi.

735
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:57,671
Hang in there.

736
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:29,992
It's just an accident.

737
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:31,832
It doesn't mean anything.

738
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,071
Did she do it on purpose?

739
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,231
What am I thinking?

740
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,631
Don't let this kind of thing

741
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,992
waste my time when I should be sleeping.

742
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,260
(A girl kissed me on purpose,
what should I do?)

743
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,380
(If she only likes your body,
she's not respecting your soul.)

744
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,500
(What are you waiting for?
Don't miss this chance.)

745
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,300
(Just do it.)

746
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,432
How is that possible?

747
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:04,031
My soul is much more attractive

748
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,472
than my body, okay?

749
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,100
(What would the girl think
after kissing?)

750
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,660
(She's anxious, excited, and she
wants to be responsible to the guy.)

751
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:25,111
I bet she'll be so surprised

752
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:26,912
when she wakes up tomorrow morning.

753
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,312
Xiaoqi,

754
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,631
it's hard to collect hormones.

755
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:37,392
Why aren't you excited at all?

756
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,312
I'm actually a little excited.

757
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,631
However, how did I collect it?

758
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:44,191
I really don't remember.

759
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,551
It doesn't matter.

760
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,832
Anyway, a R&D department will be set up.

761
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:48,952
while they are developing

762
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:50,111
Hormone Elements,

763
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,272
we'll collect Hormone Elements

764
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:52,151
simultaneously.

765
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,792
Soon, we can go home.

766
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:55,832
Girls,

767
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:57,312
breakfast is ready.

768
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:00,671
What were you two talking about?

769
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,111
It's nothing serious.

770
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,231
We were talking about how Fang Leng

771
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:05,031
seemed to have a little
crush on me yesterday.

772
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:06,392
What?

773
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:08,352
Quick, I want to hear the story.

774
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:11,511
Did anything unspeakable happen

775
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,272
between the two of you.

776
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,231
Chai, stop asking.

777
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,752
Xiaoqi forgot everything.

778
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:19,551
When Fang Leng brought
her back last night,

779
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,312
she was drunk and unconscious.

780
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:23,872
It doesn't matter.

781
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:26,472
Falling in love is like
waiting for a bus.

782
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,551
When you wait for a bus,
it doesn't come.

783
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:29,792
However, when you don't,

784
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,671
one by one, the buses arrived.

785
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,392
So, Xiaoqi,

786
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:35,111
you must seize the opportunity.

787
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,511
How?

788
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:43,191
Play hard to get.

789
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,832
Play hard to get?

790
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:50,832
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

791
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:51,472
Good morning.

792
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:00,792
Good morning.

793
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:01,671
Good morning...

794
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:14,551
Come in.

795
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:21,392
Thanks.

796
00:42:39,352 --> 00:42:40,071
Xiaoqi.

797
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:42,832
