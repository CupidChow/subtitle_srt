I was just trying to
collect hormone element.

Does he have to go this far?

What are you doing?

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
Okay.

23
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,780
You won't kick the blanket anymore.

24
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,820
Perfect.

25
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,260
You tried to tie me up with a belt.

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,260
Looks like you don't
take my superpower seriously.

It was not easy for me
to get you into my hands.

Good job.

38
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,850
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Fang.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,850
My doorknob

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,130
is specially designed
to deal with those brats.

41

Mr. Fang.

42

Why haven't you slept yet?

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,850
Please take care of your body.

Mr. Fang, are you having insomnia?

Run into Mr. Fang's embrace.

50
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,570
Turn off the alarm clock if you dare.

51
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,100
Get up if you dare.

52
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,220
Don't hide under the blanket
without making a sound.

53
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,930
I know you hear me.

54
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,100
I know you hear me.

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,980
I know you hear me.

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
Get up.

57
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,730
Get up.

Fang Leng?

62
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,170
I'm off to work.
Make sure you get home early.

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,020
He's gone to work?

64
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,490
Rotate in the direction of the arrow.

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,250
What are you doing?

66
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,340
Chai told me

67
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
to set this off when you return.

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,930
Xiaoqi.

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,700
How was your pretence yesterday?

70
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,730
I got really sick

71
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,900
and he believed it.

72
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,810
Seriously?

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,340
Then we will be able to make it soon.

74
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,290
He's always busy.

75
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,290
I don't even have time to see him,

76
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,410
let alone collect hormone element.

77
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,730
Then

78
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,810
you should go to work with him every day

79
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,460
and disrupt his work.

80
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,930
If Future Group goes bankrupt,

81
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,700
he'll just stay at home all the time.

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,580
But I'm not good at disruption.

83
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,220
I just focus on how to get things done.

84
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,780
When it comes to disruption, I...

85
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,540
Okay.

86
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,020
What's the matter? What does that mean?

87
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,930
Come in.

88
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,980
After you left the house,

89
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,780
my condition got worse.

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,460
But now it's better.

91
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,460
How did you get in?

92
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,900
I walked in.

93
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,100
Assistant...

94
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,580
Han.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,170
(CEO office)

96
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,050
A smart assistant like me

97
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,900
will never interfere with
the boss's business.

98
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,900
Mr. Fang.

99
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,220
I cared so much for you.

100
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,340
Let go. I'm working.

101
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,930
I'm in the healing process.

102
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,660
What do you want?

103
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,850
As you can see,

104
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,220
I can recover

105
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,170
if I stay with you.

106
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,020
So,

107
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,660
can you let me work with you?

108
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,370
My company does not accept idlers.

109
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm smart.

110
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,660
You just don't see it yet.

111
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,370
You said you'd make it up to me.

112
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,540
You can do that by giving me a job.

113
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,290
Look.

114
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
Look at me.

115
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm in this situation.

116
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,580
Only you can help me.

117
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,730
Mr. Fang.

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,580
If you really want

119
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,980
to work for this company,

120
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,460
then you will have to follow

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,780
all the rules I have
laid down unconditionally.

122
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,660
If you violate them,

123
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,930
I will fire you immediately.

124
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,580
But if you set up overbearing rules,

125
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,490
then I...

126
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,050
Leave.

127
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,370
I agree.

128
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,410
Listen.

129
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,460
First,

130
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,700
I am the boss

131
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,660
and you are the employee.

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,730
You must obey

133
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,100
all my rules unconditionally

134
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,810
and if you break them,
I will dismiss you immediately.

135
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,930
Second,

136
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,730
don't let anyone in the company know

137
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,980
you're my ex-girlfriend.

138
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,130
If you disclose it, I'll fire you.

139
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,700
Third, you are an employee.

140
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,220
You must do all
the work required of you.

141
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,100
If you make a major mistake,

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,850
I will fire you immediately.

143
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,420
If you have any objections,

144
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,650
then the first rule applies,

145
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,610
understood?

146
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,530
Yes, sir!

147
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,610
Come to work tomorrow at 10am.

148
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,530
Don't be late.

149
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,650
I can start now.

150
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,370
Rule number one.

151
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,650
Don't worry, boss.

152
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,730
I am the best.

153
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,730
Tomorrow, I'll show you the best of me.

154
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,940
Keep it up.

155
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,420
Work hard and cheer up.

156
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,300
Give up.

157
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,580
It's the left foot.

158
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,060
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,030
(Office relationship plan)

160
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,650
You made it!

161
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,650
Here you go, Xiaoqi.

162
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,580
You can do it!

163
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,130
I can do it!

164
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,220
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

165
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,250
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

167
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,460
Hi.

168
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,220
What are you doing?

169
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
I'll go to work with you.

170
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,940
Do you think

171
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,420
I look different today?

172
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,940
Have you forgotten
about the three rules?

173
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
Of course I remember.

174
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,340
Obey all your rules,

175
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,820
complete all the tasks

176
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,980
and do not reveal our relationship.

177
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,420
I didn't break any of them.

178
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,180
I also brought you breakfast.

179
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,250
Doesn't it smell good?

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,340
Then I'll add one more rule.

181
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,580
Keep ten metres away from me at work.

182
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,700
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,220
I've been on every
kind of fancy spaceship.

184
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,370
What's the big deal with
a four-wheeled car?

185
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,370
I don't need it.

186
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,300
I have to stay in a good mood
on my first day at work.

187
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,770
Cheer up. Be happy.

188
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,700
I didn't expect the work
atmosphere to be like this.

189
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,770
I used to come here to deliver food.

190
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,340
From today onwards,

191
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,820
(Chai Xiaoqi, administration, secretary)
I'm officially an urban white-collar worker.

192
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,770
I will get close Fang Leng on all fronts

193
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,890
and collect the hormone element soon.

194
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,980
Well done.

195
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,890
Ms. Chai.

196
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Ms. Chai.

197
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,060
I will take you to your desk.

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,580
My desk?

199
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,730
Okay.

200
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,700
Ms. Chai.

201
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,650
This is your desk.

202
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,250
Here?

203
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,100
This is too far away.

204
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,890
Can you arrange another seat for me?

205
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,220
Fang Leng! Fang...

206
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,130
Mr. Fang.

207
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,580
Well,

208
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,060
he told me to stay
ten metres away from him.

209
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,220
Can you change my seat?

210
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,420
A little closer to him would be nice.

211
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
- I'll try to arrange it.
- Please.

212
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,530
Ms. Chai is not happy
with her current seat.

213
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,460
Can you arrange a new one for her?

214
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,340
This is not her company.
She can't do anything at will.

215
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,890
She can leave if she's not happy.

216
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,100
Mr. Fang said

217
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,530
this is the best seat in the company.

218
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,490
It's bright,

219
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,460
breezy,

220
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,770
and most importantly,

221
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,580
it's close to the toilet,

222
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,130
which is very convenient.

223
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,850
I don't find it convenient at all.

224
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,580
I think it's more
convenient to be near him.

225
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,300
Please talk to him again.

226
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,850
Please.

227
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,220
Thank you.

228
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,250
Mr. Fang.

229
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,730
Ms. Chai feels that sitting next to you

230
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,060
will help her to excel in the company

231
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,130
and give full play to her work ability.

232
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,100
So...

233
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,890
Tell her to stop haggling

234
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,730
and focus on her job.

235
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,010
If she makes more than three mistakes,

236
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,940
she will be fired.

237
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,530
Okay.

238
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,980
This is tiring.

239
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,340
So?

240
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,820
Mr. Fang is rooting for you.

241
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,490
He said youngsters
should be up to the challenge.

242
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,850
Giving a talented girl like you

243
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,890
three chances to make mistakes at work

244
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,730
is more than enough.

245
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,530
No way.

246
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,420
Would an indifferent guy like him

247
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,130
say something so passionate?

248
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,100
I don't buy that.

249
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,490
Anyway, in short,

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,890
hang in there, Ms. Chai.

251
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,250
Keeping you in the company

252
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,250
was the first courteous thing

253
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
the icy CEO did for you.

254
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,300
You must not be fired.

255
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,820
Otherwise, it will be a disaster.

256
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,980
What?

257
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,370
Here are the documents
for the meeting later.

258
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,220
Please make ten copies.

259
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,490
Don't forget that.

260
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,730
He's underestimating me.

261
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,940
Three chances?

262
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,650
I don't even need it.

263
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,180
This is a simple task.

264
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,300
How do I make copies?

265
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,340
I remember now.

266
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
Goodness.

267
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,940
How to use this?

268
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,100
I've only seen this in textbooks.

269
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,770
Unbelievable.

270
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,340
Like this?

271
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,700
This is interesting.

272
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,700
You're wasting paper and ink.

273
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
This is your first warning.

274
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,530
I know how to do this.

275
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,300
Recently, there have
been a lot of articles

276
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,890
published by marketing agencies

277
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,300
that smear our make-up products.

278
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,580
There were also some beauty bloggers

279
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,250
who openly denigrated our products,

280
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,180
defying our reputation.

281
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,420
What about the data report?

282
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,180
Coming.

283
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,530
Sorry.

284
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,530
Here. One for you.

285
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,060
- Here you go.
- The data show that

286
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,890
on the 20th of last month...

287
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,460
Sorry.

288
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,980
We had a lot of bad reviews

289
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,100
and our rating has
dropped significantly.

290
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,130
According to our analysis,

291
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,650
this probably is

292
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Australian natural lanolin cream,

293
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,820
which make your skin...

294
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,180
This is the wrong copy.

295
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
No, it isn't.

296
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,010
I just took the wrong one.

297
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,490
Anyway,

298
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,420
as a result of the bad reviews,

299
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,530
the sales of the new product

300
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,940
have dropped significantly.

301
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,610
The last few days have also seen

302
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,180
the lowest record ever.

303
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,140
Mr. Fang.

304
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,090
Our PR team

305
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,090
has negotiated privately
with several marketing agencies,

306
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,770
but they refused to relent

307
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,010
no matter what terms we offered.

308
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,140
Private negotiation will
only make outsiders

309
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,010
think that our products
are really faulty.

310
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,730
We got so many bad reviews

311
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,810
in just three days.

312
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,980
Someone must be behind this.

313
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,090
No way.

314
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
How come this happened?

315
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,380
Why did such a big problem happen

316
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,660
on my first day at work?

317
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,380
Now, do as I say.

318
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,460
PR Department.

319
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,220
Immediately issue a lawyer's statement

320
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,620
on the product's official website.

321
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,330
Formally warn those
accounts that have been

322
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,220
maliciously spreading false claims.

323
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,010
Secondly, we can't rely entirely

324
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,250
on the marketing team this time.

325
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,860
After all, we know

326
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,980
our own products best.

327
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,940
Technical Department.

328
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,810
Analyse the disinformation videos

329
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,570
and see if you can find a crack.

330
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,180
Also, evaluate the bad reviews

331
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,380
and see what their targeting points are.

332
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,420
Cooperate with the R&D department
to officially experiment

333
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,250
and find more data as soon as possible.

334
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,530
Finally, work with the sales team

335
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,770
to find a way to clear our name.

336
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,010
Thirdly,

337
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,090
you may have to work overtime today

338
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,660
to come up with
a solution to the crisis.

339
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,620
Although the situation is not
optimistic at the moment,

340
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,620
take this as a lesson.

341
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,770
A crisis can be
turned into an opportunity.

342
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,380
He is quite charming at work.

343
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,810
Tell me as soon as the result

344
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,010
of the product analysis is out,

345
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,700
got it?

346
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,380
Fang Leng, I...

347
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,940
Ten metres away. Have you forgotten?

348
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,420
Bear it in your mind.

349
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,420
Don't worry. You were so cool just now.

350
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,090
Really. You were shining.

351
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,490
You are handsome.

352
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,700
Super handsome.

353
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,460
You're shining like a star.

354
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,660
So cool!

355
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,380
Ms. Chai.

356
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,140
This is a bit too much.

357
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,290
Will such a handsome and smart boss

358
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,940
personally guide me?

359
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm so smart.

360
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,460
If you lead me yourself,

361
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,940
I will definitely improve super fast.

362
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,940
You have so much energy
to make up such an excuse.

363
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,180
Do you have nothing to do?

364
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,900
Xiaoqi. Chai Xiaoqi.

365
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,420
Make me a coffee after
you refill the water.

366
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,380
- Xiaoqi, where's my takeout?
- Okay, that's all.

367
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,090
Okay.

368
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,250
Xiaoqi, make copies for me.

369
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,250
Have you picked up my package, Xiaoqi?

370
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,330
Xiaoqi, where is my file?

371
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,900
Xiaoqi, don't forget to buy my milk tea.

372
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,250
Xiaoqi, don't forget
the minutes of the meeting.

373
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,090
Xiaoqi.

374
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,570
Give me a break.

375
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,380
Is it that tiring?

376
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,900
Deliver these files for me.

377
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,530
Can I have an assistant?

378
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,330
Please.

379
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,140
You only have three chances.

380
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,420
If you make another mistake,

381
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,460
you can just leave.

382
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,980
- I'll go now.
- Hold on.

383
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,380
We will solve this problem for you.

384
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,770
Okay, sorry about that.

385
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,530
I will confirm with the supplier now.

386
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,700
Hello, this is Future Group.

387
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,660
Is there an update to the submission?

388
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
Hello, this is Future Group.

389
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,090
Yes, we accept an unconditional return.

390
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,810
Okay, we got it.

391
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,140
We have run out of
trial packs of the new product.

392
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,860
Do you mind another offer?

393
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:16,900
Rest assured.

394
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,460
Do you have any questions?

395
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,090
Here's the latest list
of processes. Please check.

396
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,010
Thank you.

397
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,980
Yes?

398
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,330
Okay, noted.

399
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,380
Mr. Fang.

400
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,940
The PR Department has
located a new marketing team

401
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,050
and is now working intensively
to come up with a solution.

402
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,380
Okay, go on.

403
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,940
Okay, I'll call you again later.

404
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,180
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

405
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,980
Under your leadership,

406
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,620
we will definitely be able
to ride the waves,

407
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,730
sail straight ahead,

408
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,810
break through hardships

409
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,180
and advance.

410
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,570
This little hiccup

411
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,730
is not a big deal.

412
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,380
Aren't you tired of being so hyper?

413
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,220
Han.

414
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,860
Keep an eye on Chai Xiaoqi.

415
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,980
We're all so busy.
Don't let her cause trouble.

416
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,860
No problem.

417
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,050
You can leave Madam Chai to me.

418
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,810
Mr. Fang.

419
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,180
Who do you think is behind this?

420
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,220
This is so unethical.

421
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,660
Mr. Fang.

422
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,090
You've gone to a lot of trouble

423
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,730
to make me step down
this time, haven't you?

424
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,570
You're making me confused.

425
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,380
You should step down

426
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,810
if have made a major mistake at work

427
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,220
and caused serious
losses to the company.

428
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,770
This has nothing to do with me.

429
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Is that so?

430
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,380
An arrow is more
deadly than a bullet.

431
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm just worried that
this time it's another internal threat.

432
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,490
Except for us old staff,

433
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,530
you have interviewed and hired

434
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,660
the rest of the staff
after your appointment.

435
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,140
How could there be a betrayer?

436
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,290
Here's my advice to you.

437
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,660
Have faith in your staff

438
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,770
and more importantly,
have faith in yourself.

439
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,180
Don't worry.

440
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,010
Once this is over,

441
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,940
I'm going to bring the whole company

442
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,380
back into line.

443
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,940
I will not spare those who have

444
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,570
hidden agenda.

445
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,660
Sister.

446
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,980
Fang Leng seems to know.

447
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,940
Never mind.

448
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,700
Without proof,

449
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,220
what can he do about it?

450
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,770
Besides, if I don't deal with him,

451
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,980
he can treat me like his own mother.

452
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,420
You can rest assured.

453
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,050
He's on shaky ground.

454
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,810
I doubt he has the guts.

455
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,330
Raising children for old age
is not the point,

456
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,980
the point is that they
have to be biological.

457
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,290
Son.

458
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,700
Where are you?

459
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,660
Mum, I'm in the library.

460
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,330
Good.

461
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,090
Son, listen up.

462
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,980
Mum, I have some reading to do.

463
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,530
If there's nothing else,
I'll hang up first.

464
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,620
You're studying abroad.

465
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,490
How come you're always surrounded

466
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,810
by Chinese people on video calls?

467
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,330
No, she is not Chinese.

468
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,810
She's Korean. Look.

469
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,090
Hello.

470
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,420
Nice to meet you.

471
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,490
Tom, long time no see.

472
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,050
Hold on. Let's study together.

473
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,330
We'll have dinner together tonight.

474
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,420
Son.

475
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,940
Your classmate speaks so many languages.

476
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,730
Mum, I'm busy now.

477
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,700
I'll talk to you later.

478
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,420
Bye.

479
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
Goodbye.

480
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Impressive, Xiaobu.

481
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,900
You can speak so many foreign languages.

482
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,140
This is nothing.

483
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,620
You fixed my computer,

484
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,490
I lied for you. We have each other back.

485
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,940
It was not a bad lie.

486
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,770
It was actually a white lie

487
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,810
to ease my mother's feelings.

488
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,570
You won't get it.

489
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,250
It's a display of high
emotional intelligence.

490
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,860
Let's go. The server room is upstairs.

491
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,090
Okay.

492
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,250
Here.

493
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,900
This is the science museum
I was telling you about.

494
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,220
And this is the most advanced computer.

495
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,490
What do you think?

496
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,530
Not bad.

497
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,730
This should be able to
load up my central system.

498
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,140
Fang Lie.

499
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,940
Can you get me a bottle of juice?

500
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,420
Didn't you just buy one?

501
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,620
You also bought me a bottle.

502
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,660
I bought the wrong one.

503
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,090
Get me another kind.

504
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,420
What do you want?

505
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,660
Fruit and vegetable juice.

506
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,730
Go.

507
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,290
I'll be here.

508
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,580
(Breaking system)

509
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,680
(Welcome)

510
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,800
(Done inserting signal)

511
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,930
(Confirm, ready)

512
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,010
Xiaobu.

513
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,980
You are really something.

514
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
You have hidden talents.

515
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,220
You got me wrong.

516
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,530
I'm not an...

517
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,250
You can play games,

518
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,460
do painting and fix computers.

519
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,090
You're amazing.

520
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,010
You are totally right.

521
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,900
I am indeed quite talented.

522
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,290
Thank you for today.

523
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,620
No big deal. I just bought you
a ticket.

524
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,620
Besides,

525
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,010
I am your boyfriend.

526
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,570
It's my pleasure.

527
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,420
So couples can

528
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,090
skip a certain part of social manners.

529
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,700
However, isn't kissing and hugging

530
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,050
also social interaction?

531
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,730
I saw couples in movies and dramas

532
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,460
kiss, hug and make love.

533
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,980
Say no more.

534
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,420
Mind your words
or it can't be broadcast.

535
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,770
Which floor do I have
to deliver these to?

536
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,700
Third floor.

537
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,490
Third floor?

538
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,250
Yes.

539
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,460
Third floor again?

540
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,980
This is the fifth time.

541
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,220
Since it's on the third floor,

542
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,770
why couldn't you
give it to me in one go?

543
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,050
The lifts are out of order.

544
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,250
You should take the stairs.

545
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,090
Out of order?

546
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,420
Why now?

547
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,050
It broke down at this time.

548
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,940
Want me to run up the stairs?

549
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,620
No way.

550
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,290
Your files.

551
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,930
(Sunny Apartment)

552
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,380
I am exhausted.

553
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,010
Really.

554
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,490
Why do humans go to work?

555
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,530
Because

556
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,660
their families are poor,
hard to win the lottery,

557
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,810
money doesn't grow on trees

558
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,050
and no free lunch in this world.

559
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,460
So they have to work hard

560
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,940
to earn a good living.

561
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,420
- I'm going to die from exhaustion.
- Xiaoqi.

562
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,490
Let's do it another way.

563
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,380
What is it?

564
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,010
Xiaoqi.

565
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,730
Looks like you're going bald.

566
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,770
Am I losing hair?

567
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,730
This is the first time in my life
that I have lost my hair.

568
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,140
I give up.

569
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,810
Xiaoqi.

570
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,730
I quit.

571
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,810
No.

572
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,860
If I quit,

573
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,770
my efforts today will be in vain.

574
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,530
Xiaobu.

575
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,730
Turn on the computer.

576
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,180
(100 skills in the office)

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,440
(Punch in early and punch out late.)

578
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,320
(Do whatever's ordered.)

579
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,400
(Put your boss first before everything.)

580
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,800
(100 skills in the office)

581
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,000
(Be diligent always.)

582
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,320
(Check your blood
if you're related to the boss.)

583
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,860
Yesterday's Xiaoqi was dead.

584
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,620
I am now Niuhuru Seven.

585
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,570
Photocopier.

586
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,010
Make ten copies of each.

587
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,620
Okay.

588
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,130
(Printer is being linked.)

589
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,180
(Complete linking.)

590
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,810
The file on the left

591
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,770
is the list of proposals submitted
by the department managers

592
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,980
in descending order of feasibility.

593
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,570
On the right is the analysis
of the disinformation videos

594
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,220
and malicious comments.

595
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,180
The one with the red paperclip

596
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,380
is the most prominent.

597
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,980
P.S. Don't you think

598
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,810
I'm doing better today?

599
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,330
What does "mwah" mean?

600
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,700
It means "thank you".

601
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,180
Ms. Chai.

602
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,900
Why are you here?

603
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,140
I'm here to coordinate work.

604
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,180
You're not going to tell Mr. Fang
that I'm slacking off, are you?

605
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,860
I treat you sincerely.

606
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,940
You're not double-crossing me

607
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,420
to replace me as
Mr. Fang's assistant, are you?

608
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,900
Double-crossing?

609
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,290
What did you watch just now?

610
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,460
It looked interesting.

611
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,530
What is this?

612
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,290
This is my favourite live streaming.

613
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,980
Live streaming?

614
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,220
So this is live.

615
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,660
Why are there diamond rings

616
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,940
- and rockets?
- It's the gifts from fans.

617
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,700
It's the most valuable.

618
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,660
Really?

619
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,570
You can make money with this?

620
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,380
Yes.

621
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,140
Look, diamond rings.

622
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,380
Diamond rings are not very valuable.

623
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,900
Ms. Chai, listen.

624
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,660
This is our secret.

625
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,140
You must never tell Mr. Fang.

626
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,570
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

627
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,730
Here, look at this.

628
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,010
Who won't you tell?

629
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,770
Meeting at 3pm.

630
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,010
Don't waste time with idlers.

631
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:53,700
Also,

632
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,010
Don't interfere with
other people's work.

633
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,660
Gosh.

634
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,490
He said you are an idler.

635
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,860
Does that upset you?

636
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,460
I'll get the files ready.

637
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,530
Meeting.

638
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,780
(Meeting room)

639
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,570
Once the official
statement was released,

640
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,210
most of the disinformation videos

641
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,490
have been automatically deleted.

642
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,420
The most important thing now

643
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,490
is to regain the trust of our customers

644
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,820
and recover sales.

645
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,420
Yes.

646
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,690
Mr. Fang.

647
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,650
Since the current products
are not well received,

648
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,460
why not take advantage

649
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,170
of the publicity

650
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,570
and launch some new products?

651
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,570
This will certainly achieve

652
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,260
twice the result in terms of publicity.

653
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,980
Still, avoidance will not
solve the present crisis.

654
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,860
It will only make consumers

655
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,530
continue to lose trust in us.

656
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,090
Mr. Fang.

657
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,820
I believe we can lower the overall price

658
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,650
of the products

659
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,300
and add more special offers

660
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,940
to increase sales.

661
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,860
I don't think there are
problems with our products.

662
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,610
I won't consider any option
that is just about

663
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,940
restoring sales but doesn't contribute

664
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,980
to the brand image.

665
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,530
But we don't have

666
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,570
- any suitable options at the moment.
- Yes.

667
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,980
We can do live streaming.

668
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,690
Live streaming?

669
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,490
Yes.

670
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,340
Ms. Chai.

671
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,780
Keep your ideas for later.

672
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,420
Aren't we trying to

673
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,650
restore the image of our brand?

674
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,820
Through the live streaming,

675
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,820
viewers can have a better idea

676
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,780
of the authenticity of our products.

677
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,740
Then the rumours will be dispelled.

678
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,650
But there are so many cases

679
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,820
of live streaming fraud nowadays.

680
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,860
Even if we can really

681
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,610
prove ourselves on camera,

682
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,780
viewers may not believe

683
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,740
our authenticity when they see us live.

684
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,530
If some don't believe it, others will.

685
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,900
What people hate

686
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,380
are those fake live streams.

687
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,780
If we display our
products with dedication,

688
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,900
people will definitely feel

689
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
our sincerity.

690
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,010
Yes, she's right.

691
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,980
I think it will work.

692
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,340
It's worth a try.

693
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,380
Mr. Fang.

694
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,650
I think this method
is really worth trying.

695
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,610
It's low-cost and broad-based.

696
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,740
That's right.

697
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,690
Right now,

698
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,170
we really don't have any other way.

699
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,130
Give it a try.

700
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,650
Go ahead.

701
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,380
Okay.

702
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,900
Wise decision, Mr. Fang.

703
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,460
Look.

704
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,490
I'm using

705
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,780
Future Group's Matte Collection.

706
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,420
Take a look.

707
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
(Is this the makeup?)
(Entering live chatroom.)

708
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,180
(So little audience.)
(I like this colour.)

709
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,810
(Is this a new host?)

710
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,490
I think this colour

711
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,530
is quite subtle on the face.

712
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,690
The colour is softer

713
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,010
and natural, isn't it?

714
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,610
It's more suitable for everyday makeup.

715
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,130
You can apply it to work.

716
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,050
It's also a nice shade

717
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,420
for professional makeup.

718
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,980
(Too much filter.)
(The makeup is not nice.)

719
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,640
(Is this the makeup?)
(Filter warning.)

720
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,180
(What is going on?)

721
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,680
(Were you hired by them?)

722
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,070
(Filter warning. What is going on?
Were you hired by them?)

723
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
(It's hard to earn money now.
It all depends on what she says.)

724
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,340
(Host, can we do something real?)
I knew you would question the authenticity.

725
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,090
That's why I've set up a feature called

726
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,860
A Day at the Gym.

727
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,460
Mr. Fang.

728
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,340
The Marketing Department is monitoring

729
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,340
the comments in real time.

730
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
I will keep you informed

731
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,570
of any problems that arise.

732
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,010
Where is Chai Xiaoqi?

733
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,610
Ms. Chai should be doing
live at the gym right now.

734
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,130
It should be starting soon.

735
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,740
Mr. Fang.

736
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,570
The gym is actually very close.

737
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,610
Right downstairs.

738
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,460
If you have time...

739
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,260
I'm sure you don't have time for that.

740
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,570
You're only devoted to your work.

741
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,170
I should learn from you,

742
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,650
wasting all the time...

743
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,570
I mean, putting all

744
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,340
the passion in my job.

745
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Live room.

746
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,260
All collections of
Future Group's cosmetics

747
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,460
are the most...

748
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,780
Mr. Fang, here is
the information you requested.

749
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,090
Thanks.

750
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,570
See?

751
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,260
With all the sweating,

752
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,260
My face

753
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,460
and my makeup

754
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,940
still look amazing, right?

755
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,820
This is because I used

756
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,780
Future Group's Setting Powder.

757
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,420
Seriously, it makes my makeup

758
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,380
stay on for long.

759
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,860
Sprayed water on my face?

760
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,900
Haven't I sweated enough?

761
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,380
(Leave if you don't want to watch.
No personal remark here.)

762
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
(Mutual respect comes first
in communication.)

763
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,900
(The makeup is great. The makeup
is nice. I like orange colour makeup.)

764
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,980
(The host's makeup is amazing.)
Bill, please.

765
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,300
No need to pay. It's on the house today.

766
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,380
(The face cream is great.)
Thank you for coming.

767
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,440
(Don't you sabotage the host.)
(The colour of the powder is nice.)

768
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,200
(Anti-aging is important.)
(Skincare is important to night owls.)

769
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,010
Xiaobu.

770
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,690
Be aware of the keyboard warriors.

771
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,650
All right.

772
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,090
(Future Group's cosmetics are the greatest.)
It's all about speed.

773
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,740
Bring it on.

774
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,120
(Be cultured in commenting
on the social media.)

775
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,480
(Be cultured in commenting
on the social media.)

776
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,380
They go all out.

777
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,170
(What you said is not right.)
We are outnumbered.

778
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,300
They are coming on strong.
I can't hold it any longer.

779
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,130
(You're bad guys.)
Fret not.

780
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,740
(What you said is not right.)
I will destroy them.

781
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,860
What did you post?

782
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,460
It's worthless.

783
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,170
This person is pretty good.

784
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,170
He speaks boldly and without profanity.

785
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,650
Factual

786
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,650
but not overbearing.

787
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,650
Thumbs up.

788
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,260
Do you mean

789
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,340
Love the Boss More

790
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,300
or

791
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,460
The Cold Rain Lashing My Face?

792
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,220
(Sweat so much, so hardworking.)
They are both good.

793
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,780
One is gentle,

794
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,210
the other is bold.

795
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,570
The best!

796
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,180
(Being truthful and objective analysis.)

797
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
(Haters should go away. No malicious
comments to the host and the products.)

798
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,640
(No group argument is allowed.)

799
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,420
Is it waterproof?

800
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,780
You'll know right away.

801
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,130
Why am I suddenly so dizzy?

802
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,130
Did I work out too much?

803
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,740
That's not it.

804
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,820
Hold on.

805
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,490
Here we go.

806
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,650
Can you see me?

807
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,130
My makeup doesn't smudge.

808
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,420
It sticks to my skin.

809
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,530
It's still on.

810
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,820
