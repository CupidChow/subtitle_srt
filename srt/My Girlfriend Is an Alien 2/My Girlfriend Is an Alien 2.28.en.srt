Well,

20
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,753
do you have anything that
you want to do?

21
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:44,674
Write them in a wishlist.

22

From tomorrow onwards,

23
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,353
I'll fulfill them for you.

24
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,434
Okay.

25
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:52,434
Go and think now.

26
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:54,034
- I'll write the list down tomorrow.
- Do it now.

27
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,833
Write it now. Write more.

33
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:02,393
Write it now.

(Go to the wish tree together)

69
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,194
Your wishes are too simple.

70
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:30,313
We've done so many in a day.

71
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,834
There's no sense of achievement at all.

72
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,353
Although the wishes are simple,

73
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,353
the most important thing is
who I did it with.

74
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:38,394
But I still want to help you

75
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,394
fulfill more significant things.

76
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,194
Xiaoqi, you don't have to please me.

77
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:46,873
As long as you're by my side,

78
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,993
it's already the happiest thing to me.

79
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,834
Because I love you, Xiaoqi.

80
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:55,433
I think so, too.

81
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,233
So...

82
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,154
Anything that I'm doing with you

83
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,714
will become significant,

84
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:03,034
do you understand?

85
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,754
What wish did you make?

86
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:13,913
I can't tell you.

87
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:14,754
I saw it.

88
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:15,634
You can't look at it.

89
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:16,873
You can't look at it.

90
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:17,954
You can't look at it.

91
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,353
You can't look at my wishes.

92
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,793
I can't look at your wishes, too.

93
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,034
Otherwise, it won't come true.

94
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,394
It also won't come true
if we say it out loud.

95
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:27,714
Don't say it.

96
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,194
Okay.

97
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,313
The stars are beautiful.

98
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,233
But I think you're more beautiful.

99
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,313
Are you happy, Xiaoqi?

100
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,313
Xiaoqi?

101
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,754
I think she walked too much
in the daytime.

102
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:02,433
Why did it happen?

103
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,034
The energy used to be sufficient,

104
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,433
but now...

105
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:09,353
What do you mean?

106
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:12,194
What do you mean, Xiaobu?

107
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:14,873
Xiaoqi.

108
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:15,594
Xiaoqi.

109
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:16,954
Xiaoqi.

110
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,834
Xiaoqi, what happened to you?

111
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,034
Why did you become so weak?

112
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:21,714
I...

113
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:26,473
Nothing.

114
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,433
I didn't have enough sleep yesterday.

115
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,233
And I'm too tired today.

116
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,113
So, I'm a bit sleepy.

117
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:37,793
Take a rest. I'll be here with you.

118
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:39,834
No need.

119
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,993
I'd kick away my blanket easily.

120
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,834
What if I kick you accidentally?

121
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:46,473
Why not you go home first?

122
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,194
After all, you can't help

123
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,673
Xiaoqi much for being around.

124
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,754
I'll just be sleeping.

125
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:51,873
I'll be fine after sleeping.

126
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:52,834
Then I'll go home first.

127
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,433
Call me anytime if you need anything.

128
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,194
Make sure you do that.

129
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:57,514
Go home.

130
00:06:58,553 --> 00:06:59,233
Bye.

131
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,353
Xiaoqi.

132
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,353
Xiaobu.

133
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:22,034
You're finally here.

134
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:24,394
So,

135
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,873
this is Xiaoqi's current situation?

136
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:30,274
Xiaoqi even asked us

137
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,074
to keep it from you.

138
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:34,714
Look at her situation now.

139
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,514
She's still worried about you.

140
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:37,793
Look at you.

141
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:40,154
Do you really want to see her

142
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:41,514
die on the earth?

143
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,873
I'll convince Xiaoqi now.

144
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:51,673
I'll ask Xiaoqi to go back with you.

145
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,074
Fang Leng.

146
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:00,754
Actually, you're not as selfish

147
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:01,793
as I thought you are.

148
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,553
I still have another option.

149
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,514
Because of you,

150
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:09,673
I

151
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:12,034
absorbed your Hormone Element before.

152
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,873
When I was decomposing
your Hormone Element,

153
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,274
I found a special element.

154
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,954
This element can sustain

155
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,634
our survival on the earth.

156
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:23,913
But,

157
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,473
I can't transfer it to Xiaoqi directly.

158
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:28,154
She has to do it herself.

159
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,673
You know that her body is weak now.

160
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:32,234
She can't decompose it by herself.

161
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,553
If you can extract

162
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:35,553
this special element

163
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,474
and turn it into

164
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,154
a survival potion that can
be directly absorbed,

165
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,394
I think Xiaoqi

166
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,754
can continue to live on the earth.

167
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:44,354
But,

168
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,154
I'm not sure which element

169
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,394
it is.

170
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:48,953
You have to find it yourself.

171
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,754
I got it.

172
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:54,193
Also,

173
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:55,913
let me make this clear.

174
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:57,394
If you fail,

175
00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:58,793
I'll make the decision doing

176
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:00,354
what's the best for Xiaoqi.

177
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:02,833
Thank you.

178
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:16,114
Fang Leng.

179
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,354
- Xiaoqi.
- Look.

180
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:19,833
I told you.

181
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:22,354
I told you I'll be fine after resting.

182
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,514
I didn't lie to you.

183
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,114
We have so many more wishes

184
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,034
to be done.

185
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,833
Let's continue tomorrow.

186
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:36,673
Are you saying goodbye to me?

187
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,394
What do you mean?

188
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,433
You must be very tired.

189
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,313
Why am I tired?

190
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,193
It's not tiring to be with you.

191
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:47,913
I'm not tired.

192
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:51,313
I've found out about

193
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,234
the survival energy.

194
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:54,953
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:56,754
I was too careless.

196
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:58,713
I should've known earlier.

197
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:00,553
No.

198
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,913
I didn't want to make you worry.

199
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,553
I'm afraid we don't have much time left.

200
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:10,754
I just want us to be happy

201
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:13,154
when we're together.

202
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,234
Jiang Shiyi has told me that

203
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,433
there's a matter
in the Hormone Element

204
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,593
that can be extracted

205
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,593
to help replenish your body directly.

206
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,474
Really?

207
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,713
I'll do the experiment in the scientific
research department in the morning.

208
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,953
I'll keep you here, Xiaoqi.

209
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,634
Really?

210
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,034
I trust you.

211
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,114
Don't worry.

212
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,700
(Scientific Research Department)

213
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:07,953
Xiaoqi.

214
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:09,634
Are you okay?

215
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,394
Don't worry.

216
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,234
We have to do this

217
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,313
for the experiment,

218
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:19,394
but I'm a little tired.

219
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:20,833
Don't worry.

220
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,154
Let me do this.

221
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:23,793
Let's go.

222
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,354
Take care of yourself.

223
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,994
I'll make the survival potion
as soon as possible

224
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,673
and I can bring you out by then.

225
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:01,754
I'll listen to you.

226
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,354
- Take a rest.
- Okay.

227
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:12,913
Go ahead.

228
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,193
Be nice.

229
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,234
What's the progress on survival potion?

230
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,034
We'll continue to monitor.

Mr. Fang,

252
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:30,274
Miss Chai's lovely daily meal.

253
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,274
It's delivered on time.

254
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,713
Miss Chai told me

255
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,474
that I must make sure
you finish the food.

256
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,474
Mr. Fang.

257
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,274
You didn't sleep again?

258
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:44,553
Don't tell Xiaoqi.

259
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:11,474
This is the first experiment subject.

260
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,953
Xiaoqi is too weak now.

261
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,874
I'm afraid if the experiment fails,

262
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:20,874
it might harm her body.

263
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:25,754
Is there another way to test it?

264
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,034
Candy.

265
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:29,394
Master.

266
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:30,913
Test this trial potion.

267
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,833
Candy as the AI

268
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,193
can only test your body.

269
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,073
There's nothing I can do

270
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,754
to this unknown item.

271
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:49,634
Shiyi.

272
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:52,874
Can you test it now?

273
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,193
Monitor the changes in my body

274
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:56,593
to check if the potion works.

275
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:01,394
Shiyi.

276
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,514
I'm fine.

277
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,833
Don't look at me like that.

278
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:10,634
Don't worry. I won't die.

279
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,433
I decomposed your hormone before.

280
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,154
I'm sort of immune to

281
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,514
human's hormone.

282
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:18,673
And I believe

283
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:20,354
this kind of rejection reaction

284
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,634
should be temporary.

285
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,034
Candy, test it now.

286
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,193
Master, the potion is not qualified.

287
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,634
Although there's a special element

288
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:36,034
that can heal you,

289
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,553
there are still too many other elements

290
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,234
that will harm the body.

291
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:40,673
Is there a way to improve it?

292
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,793
If the potion can be

293
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,833
further purified,

294
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,274
there's a chance.

295
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:46,913
I got it.

296
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,313
Thank you.

297
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,114
I'll continue.

298
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,593
Did I wake you up?

299
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:53,514
Let me hug you.

300
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,633
Your eyes are red.

301
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,754
Did you sleep well
for the past few days?

302
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:02,153
Not bad.

303
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,313
Don't worry.

304
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:08,113
Let me tell you a good news.

305
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:11,113
Candy said, if we purify

306
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:12,113
the potion,

307
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,393
it can be used.

308
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:18,313
I've spoken to
the technology department.

309
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,873
We can get the second trial potion

310
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:22,514
as soon as tomorrow morning.

311
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,313
But I can't help you with anything.

312
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:30,434
You just need to take a rest

313
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,073
and take care of yourself,

314
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:33,553
okay?

315
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:38,073
There's one thing

316
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,353
that you can help me with.

317
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:40,194
What's it?

318
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:42,514
Help me recharge.

319
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,113
I miss you.

320
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,113
I miss you, too.

321
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,194
The scientific research department

322
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:02,754
has improved on the filter system.

323
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,714
If everything goes well,

324
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:06,954
it should be fine.

325
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:19,153
Candy.

326
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:21,313
How did it go this time?

327
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,234
There's no sign of rejection.

328
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,873
It shows that the potion is pure,

329
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,113
but the survival energy in the body

330
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:31,593
hasn't had any obvious increase.

331
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:33,954
Maybe it takes a few days to monitor.

332
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:34,833
Okay.

333
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:35,994
Well,

334
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,034
you shall go back first.

335
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:39,674
When Candy has the report,

336
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:40,994
I'll inform you.

337
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:43,514
Is the success rate high?

338
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,873
We're not sure of the result yet.

339
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,873
But based on the current analysis,

340
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:50,313
it has a success rate of 98%.

341
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:20,073
No.

342
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,474
Decomposing food will
consume extra energy.

343
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:23,553
You can only drink water.

344
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,474
I'll just eat a little bit.

345
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:26,313
No.

346
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:28,793
Xiaobu.

347
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:29,674
Be nice.

348
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:32,153
When can I ever eat?

349
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,393
It has been a few days.

350
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,593
How come Jiang Shiyi

351
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,553
hasn't come back to us?

352
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,474
Fang Leng, you're finally back.

353
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:44,754
Jiang Shiyi contacted me just now.

354
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,514
What did he say?

355
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,434
The second survival potion is a success!

356
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,153
Xiaoqi can stay on the earth forever!

357
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,234
- Really?
- Really?

358
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,514
That's great!

359
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:57,434
That's great!

360
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,873
That's great, Xiaoqi!

361
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,234
We finally did it!

362
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:08,873
That's great!

363
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,313
Why are you injured?

364
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,914
I was cut

365
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,153
when I was doing
the experiment in the laboratory.

366
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,434
It's such a big thing.

367
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:26,474
Shouldn't we celebrate?

368
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:27,434
Of course.

369
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,313
I've got everything ready.

370
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,100

371

Which one do you like?

383
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,034
This is too expensive for this size.

384
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,313
Also,

385
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,714
the pattern is common.

386
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,073
It's not special.

387
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:48,674
Well, our packages here

388
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,553
are Maldives,

389
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:52,353
Turkey and Thailand.

390
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:55,153
Your work is so busy.

391
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,553
Are you able to go for a trip?

392
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:58,434
I can plan it ahead.

393
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,754
Otherwise, why did I write it
down in my wishlist?

394
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,340
(Wetlands Park Luweidang)

395
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:19,793
Let's go to this place.

396
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:21,833
The Wetlands Park.

397
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:32,873
How did it go?

398
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,353
Did you have fun today?

399
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,873
I did.

400
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,674
I'm just a little tired.

401
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,113
I wonder why

402
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,754
I had to fill in the survey
in every shop that I entered.

403
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:43,714
I filled in eight surveys today.

404
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,873
That's

405
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:50,073
the most popular gimmick now.

406
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,274
I filled in 10 surveys today.

407
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:52,873
What about you?

408
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:55,113
I filled in 12 surveys today.

409
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:56,714
That's right. There are not many surveys
that you've filled in.

410
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:57,754
That's right.

411
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:58,633
Really?

412
00:23:58,873 --> 00:23:59,474
Well,

413
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:01,793
why did I feel that it's weird?

414
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:02,754
When I was filling in the survey

415
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:03,873
in the travel agency,

416
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,073
he asked me where I want to go.

417
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:07,153
I said I want to go to
the Wetlands Park.

418
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:09,274
Then Fang Leng called me and

419
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:10,714
said that he's going to
the Wetlands Park for a business trip.

420
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:12,034
He asked me to go with him.

421
00:24:12,313 --> 00:24:13,754
It's just a coincidence.

422
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:14,954
Don't mind it.

423
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,629
Yes, just have fun.

424
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,153
Yes, have fun.

425
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:19,873
I'm happy.

426
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:22,153
Just that I feel weird.

427
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,474
I feel like he's keeping
something from me.

428
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,153
The way he looked at me

429
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:27,353
obviously shows that he's troubled.

430
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:31,113
You don't know, Xiaoqi.

431
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,793
Usually, when a man

432
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,153
is in love with a woman,

433
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,153
he'd look at you like that.

434
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:45,553
Why do I feel that

435
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,914
you two are weird, too?

436
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,234
Why would we

437
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,274
keep things from you?

438
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:53,073
Come on.

439
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,194
You're thinking too much.

440
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,073
So weird.

441
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:56,553
- So weird.
- Why would we keep things from her?

442
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:57,914
- Yes.
- Why would we keep things from her?

443
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,194
Isn't she weird?

444
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:00,833
- Yes.
- Why would we?

445
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:16,474
Fang Leng.

446
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,873
- Fang Leng.
- Why are you not sleeping yet?

447
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:26,914
Why are you not sleeping yet?

448
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,194
Have you packed your luggage?

449
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:29,833
No.

450
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:31,153
Why?

451
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,954
I keep having a bad feeling.

452
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,914
What do you mean?

453
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:40,274
Although I feel happy today,

454
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:43,234
I feel like you're keeping
something from me.

455
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:45,474
No.

456
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:47,073
You...

457
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:48,994
What's this?

458
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,793
This is my work stuff.

459
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:52,954
I'm about to throw it away.

460
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:56,714
What are you keeping from me?

461
00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:57,514
No.

462
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,793
Why would I keep something from you?

463
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:04,274
Don't think too much.

464
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:05,873
I'm here for you.

465
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,073
Let's depart early in the morning.

466
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:08,914
Take a rest now.

467
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:10,593
Okay?

468
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:12,034
I'm sleeping now. Good night.

469
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,313
Let me hug you for a while.

470
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:17,873
Let me hug you.

471
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:19,514
Let me hug you.

472
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,833
We're finally here.

473
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:47,553
It's so comfortable.

474
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:50,393
There's a kitchen.

475
00:26:50,754 --> 00:26:51,393
A fridge.

476
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:53,793
Is there anything to eat?

477
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:57,274
So many nice drinks.

478
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:00,914
I like going on a business trip.
It's nice.

479
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,393
When are we going out for fun?

480
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,153
I have a meeting later on.

481
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:06,274
Go ahead and have fun without me.

482
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:12,914
Okay, I'll be quick.

483
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:14,593
I'll come back as soon as
the meeting is over.

484
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:15,914
Okay.

485
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,073
I'll come back soon.

I've recovered it.

00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:08,914
That's my idea.

00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:12,833
I recovered the ring.

559
00:33:14,313 --> 00:33:16,754
The painting on the flower road
signboard was done by me.

567
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,434

00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:32,073
I'm so stressful.

569
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,593
When it's my turn to propose,

570
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,073
you all must help me.

571
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:36,353
Okay, no problem.

572
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:37,274
- Okay.
- No problem.

573
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:38,994

576

00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:46,754
Okay.

578
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:47,833
Dear,

579
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,393
I have yet to know

580
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:51,353
what kind of proposal ceremony
that you'd like to have.

581
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:55,153
Actually,

582
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,153
as long as you're there,

583
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,434
I don't need anything else.

584
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,313
I'm sorry, Han.

585
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:09,113
Shouldn't we tone it down a bit?

586
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,593
It'd be better to think
about your feelings.

587
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:14,153
No worries.

588
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,034
Although I'm not seeing anyone,

589
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,874
the couples that I like

590
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,514
must be happy.

591
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:21,474
Han, don't worry.

592
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,474
We'll be happy forever.

593
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:25,994
We'll be happy forever, too.

594
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:28,034
- I...
- We're happy already.

595
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:28,673
No.

596
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:30,233
Come on.

597
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,073
Xiaoqi,

598
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,354
have you and Mr. Fang...

599
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:42,514
Really?

600
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:43,874
That's great!

601
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:46,914
Xiaoqi,

602
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,713
quickly set a date.

603
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:50,914
I have a tight schedule.

604
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:52,193
I need to schedule in advance

605
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:52,994
to witness your wedding.

606
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,034
Okay.

607
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,834
Not bad.

608
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:02,633
I didn't expect that
you're the type of person

609
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,474
that does great things in silence.

610
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,233
Yes.

611
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:10,434
So, cross-species reproduction
is workable.

612
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:11,874
As a robot,

613
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:13,153
I think I can get used to

614
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:14,113
human's reproduction method.

615
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:15,914
Enough, Xiaobu. Drink this.

616
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:17,434
Stop it or it can't be aired.

617
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,794
It smells so good.
It's my fried chicken.

618
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:24,434
It smells so good.

619
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:27,553
It smells so good.

620
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:28,593
I can't forget what I promised you

621
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:29,753
during the proposal.

622
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:30,354
Here.

623
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:34,434
Is it tasty?

624
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:35,713
- It's tasty.
- Fang Leng, I'm hungry too.

625
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:36,394
Here.

626
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:38,753
Eat it yourself.

627
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:41,673
You're really terrible.

628
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,514
Treat me a bit better, please.

629
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:44,753
Here.

630
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:47,753
Is it tasty?

631
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:51,193
Chai, try this.

632
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,514
Thank you, babe.

633
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:57,593
It's tasty.

634
00:37:58,753 --> 00:37:59,954

635
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:01,354
for our wedding ceremony?

636
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:02,753
Sure. It's tasty.

637
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:04,434
It's appetizing.

638
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,553
You can have as many as you want.

639
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,434
Xiaoqi.

640
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:13,034
Xiaoqi.

641
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:15,113
Xiaoqi!

642
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:15,914
Xiaoqi!

643
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,553
- Xiaoqi.
- Xiaoqi.

644
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:19,914
Xiaoqi!

645
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,193
Is there no other way?

646
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:36,914
Candy has tested it.

647
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:39,354
This impurity

648
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:41,753
can't be decomposed through any machine.

649
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,034
The only way is to decompose it

650
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,994
by Xiaoqi herself.

651
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:52,514
However,

652
00:38:53,593 --> 00:38:55,394
looking at Xiaoqi's body,

653
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,073
she can't take it.

654
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:01,474
Xiaoqi

655
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:04,914
can't live on the earth anymore.

656
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:13,153
When will the spaceship be here?

657
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:15,713
Three days at most.

658
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,113
Three days.

659
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:28,673
During these few days,

660
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:32,193
let me

661
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:34,954
bid farewell with Xiaoqi.

662
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:54,153
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,113
Xiaoqi.

664
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:05,073
