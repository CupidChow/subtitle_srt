"Friend" is

also the term used on Earth.

But most importantly,

40
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,570
friends should be sincere

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,660

Get back to your work.

Why aren't you anxious at all?

107
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,540
But don't worry,

108
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,940
I'll keep an eye on
Mr. Fang in the office.

They...

112
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,650
Enough. I've handed over my work.

113
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,250
I've packed my things, too.

114

Bye.

116

How did a sweet drama

117

turn into a love triangle?

118
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,580
The third wheel seriously
affects the relationship

between the hero and heroine.

120
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,850
Will they be reunited

121
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,340
or will they go their separate ways?

122
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,180
Follow for more updates.

123
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,940
I have discussed with the photographer.

124
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,420
The venue will be the aquarium.

125
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,420
And with Future Group Lip Gloss,

126
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,180
it will be perfect.

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,770
Okay.

134
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,130
Go on with your work.

135
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,010
I'll get going.

136
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,580
Thanks.

137
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,850
You let me go home on my own last night.

138
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,850
Aren't you going to see me off today?

139
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,770
All right, send me off here.

140
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,130
Why did you quit?

141
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,300
You were fine yesterday.

142
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,820
It was her choice.

143
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,730
A real diamond never loses its shine.

144
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,580
No matter which company
you go to in the future,

145
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,060
keep up the good work.

146
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,010
We'll be on our way. Bye.

147
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
You can't

148
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,220
fantasise over something
you don't deserve.

149
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,010
Although you gave up a little late,

150
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,580
you know your place.

151
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,650
It's not all your fault.

152
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,610
After all, Fang Leng doesn't
know how to reject people.

153
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,340
That's why you misunderstood him.

154
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,010
What's with the sudden
change in your persona?

155
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,370
I warn you.

156
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,770
Don't let me see you

157
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,300
around Fang Leng again.

158
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,340
A girl like you

159
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,180
is just a pastime for him.

160
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,650
Why are you being so rude?

161
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,580
You're exactly like...

162
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,850
The...

163
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,130
What's it called?

164
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,610
Wait, stay there.

165
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,580
Wait a moment.

166
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,650
You're just a self-centered,

167
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,370
boring and mean girl

168
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,370
who thinks you're a princess
just because you're pretty.

169
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,370
But inside,

170
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,100
you're even uglier than
Snow White's stepmother.

171
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,820
The dwarfs frown when they see you.

172
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,100
the prince avoids you,

173
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,530
and the magic mirror...

174
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,370
Yes, that's...

175
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,980
How come I haven't won

176
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,730
a single argument since I came to Earth?

177
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,890
Earth is so full of tricks.

178
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,890
I miss Cape Town.

179
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,730
Son.

180
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,250
When you get to the campus,

181
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,730
you must study hard.

182
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,300
Don't worry, mum.

183
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,010
For the sake of Future Group,

184
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,980
I will not let you down.

185
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,300
Okay.

186
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,490
All right.

187
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,060
Mum, I'll get going.

188
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,250
- Bye.
- Don't eat out too often.

189
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,980
Okay.

190
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,250
My son

191
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,850
finally sensible.

192
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,300
- Cheers!
- Let's celebrate!

193
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,420
Hooray!

194
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,100
I'm finally free!

195
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,420
Let's put on some music.

196
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,980
Xiaobu.

197
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,460
If you hadn't given me
that letter of admission,

198
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,010
I'd still be stuck at home.

199
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,770
(Rising Star Cup Art Competition)

200
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,610
(Rising Star Cup Art Competition)
I found a competition.

201
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,100
You can get prepared now.

202
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,980
No hurry.

203
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,730
An artist's mind
needs to be fully relaxed

204
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,580
so that it can be inspired...

205
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,580
Don't waste any more time.

206
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,370
You haven't drawn for so long.
You're out of practice, right?

207
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Let's go.

208
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,980
Start drawing.

209
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,580
Come on.

210
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,460
Han.

211
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,890
Ask Xiaoqi to make copies.

212
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,010
Mr. Fang.

213
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,770
Ms. Chai has resigned.

214
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,610
You do it then.

215
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,490
The top note is too strong.

216
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,220
The fragrance dosage
can be more precise.

217
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,340
Xiaoqi.

218
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,340
You will be in charge of this project.

219
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,340
Mr. Fang.

220
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,890
Ms. Chai has resigned.

221
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,220
Xiaoqi, bring me a cup of coffee.

222
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,890
Mr. Fang, it's me.

223
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,250
Mr. Fang.

224
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,370
Are you missing Ms. Chai?

225
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,420
Shouldn't you disable

226
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,220
the landline of the employee who left?

227
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,060
Do you know that
this is a dereliction of duty?

228
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,300
Bring me a cup of coffee.

229
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,060
Strawberry cake.

230
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,220
Excuse me, here's your matcha cake.

231
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,130
Thank you for waiting.

232
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,340
We didn't order this.

233
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,060
Yes, this is strawberry cake.

234
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
Sorry.

235
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,220
Sorry about that.

236
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,980
Your chocolate mousse
will be served shortly.

237
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,490
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,220
What's the matter, Xiaoqi?

239
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,700
Why are you so distracted these days?

240
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,700
I...

241
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,610
I'm fine.

242
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,490
I'll go and serve
the coke on table seven.

243
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
Table seven ordered an iced tea.

244
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,530
Then it's table three.

245
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,460
No, table three ordered lemonade.

246
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,130
No one ordered coke.

247
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,820
Are you too tired?

248
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,730
All right, I'll give you a day off.

249
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,010
You go and take a rest.

250
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,890
No, thanks. I don't need a day off.

251
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,850
It's okay.

252
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,300
We don't have many
customers these days anyway.

253
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,530
I can handle it.

254
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,580
Xiaoqi.

255
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,220
Are you free this afternoon?

256
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,220
Let's go here together.

257
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,820
(Entrance ticket)
(It's Candy Art Show.)

258
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,940
This is good.

259
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,490
I am thinking of introducing

260
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,650
an artisanal candy business to my shop.

261
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,250
You can go and learn it on my behalf.

262
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,010
What do you think?

263
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,650
Besides, he...

264
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,220
Excuse me. What is your name?

265
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,650
Jiang Shiyi. Nice to meet you.

266
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,770
Yes.

267
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,130
Your dear friend, Shiyi,

268
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,100
came all the way here to see you.

269
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,460
If you don't go,
then he will be disappointed.

270
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,220
Okay then.

271
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,130
Let's go.

272
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,580
Wait.

273
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,060
Dress up before you go out.

274
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,180
Go and get dressed.

275
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,580
Is it necessary?

276
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,060
Come on. Go and get changed.

277
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,580
Wait for me. I'll get changed.

278
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,610
I'll be here.

279
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,780
(Drink and be happy)

280
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,300
Is Xiaoqi

281
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,250
still unhappy?

282
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,420
Yes.

283
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,890
She's been in a bad mood

284
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,340
ever since she quit her job.

285
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,250
However,

286
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,220
I wasn't setting you two up.

287
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,700
It's just that Mr. Fang

288
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,420
has gone too far.

289
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,100
He put Xiaoqi in too much pain.

290
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,340
I can't stand watching it.

291
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,820
I just want you to

292
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,130
take Xiaoqi for a walk.

293
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,060
Don't you dare exploit the situation.

294
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,980
(Candy Show)

295
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,580
- Sir, here's the ticket.
- Okay.

296
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,500
(Candy Show)
Okay. Please head inside.

297
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,730
Here.

298
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,810
Hello.

299
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,940
Please head inside.

300
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,330
What do you think?

301
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,180
If one candy isn't enough,

302
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,730
these will do, right?

303
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,730
Yes, this is more than enough.

304
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,090
Can I buy all of these?

305
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,570
Take your pick.

306
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,530
I'll buy it for you later.

307
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,330
Really?

308
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,140
Don't move.

309
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,220
Photo shoot?

310
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,380
Yes.

311
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,380
You're going to
the aquarium this afternoon

312
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,290
for an advertising
photo shoot with Ms. Chen.

313
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,770
You promised it yourself this morning.

314
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,570
Ms. Chen says

315
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,090
the team is ready.

316
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,980
They are waiting for you.

317
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Cancel it.

318
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,810
We have a meeting this afternoon.

319
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,780
(Dr. Zhang: Your backyard is on fire.
Look at your moments.)

320
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,300
(Dr. Zhang: Your backyard is on fire.
Look at your moments.)

321
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,860
Mr. Fang.

322
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,940
Actually, I don't like Ms. Chen either,

323
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,810
but you have promised her.

324
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,330
- If we cancel it and delay...
- Okay.

325
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,940
We can do the photo shoot,

326
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,770
but change the location
to a candy art show.

327
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,380
That is impossible.

328
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,010
I mean, it's impossible to
change it right away.

329
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,460
I'll talk to them.

330
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,220
Make haste.

331
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,260
(Candy Show)

332
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,700
Look at that.

333
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,490
Give me back my candies.

334
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,900
My dad bought them all for me.

335
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,730
Are you all right?

336
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,660
I'm fine.

337
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,420
I'm really fine.

338
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,980
Sorry.

339
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,050
We've temporarily
requisitioned this space.

340
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,090
Come back another day.

341
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,380
What a coincidence, Mr. Fang.

342
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,770
I didn't think you'd have the time

343
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,460
to come to an art exhibition like this

344
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,730
on a weekday.

345
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,290
You've mistaken, Mr. Jiang.

346
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,140
We are all here to work.

347
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,090
What about you?

348
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,700
We have our own arrangements.

349
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,980
Please excuse us.

350
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,180
Let's go.

351
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,810
Let's get started.

352
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,700
Wait.

353
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,570
Would you like to be

354
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,730
our models?

355
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,730
Here's what I think.

356
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,140
I think it's a bit bland to just take

357
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,530
a group photo of a couple.

358
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,010
You two look photogenic.

359
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,330
Besides, you know Mr. Fang.

360
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,490
Why don't we do this together?

361
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,010
This is not a good idea.

362
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,250
I like his idea.

363
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,180
Our two companies are already partners.

364
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,090
I'm sure Mr. Jiang
won't mind helping out.

365
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,730
Xiaoqi.

366
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,250
What do you say?

367
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,620
I refuse. Let's go.

368
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,700
Indeed.

369
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,380
You can't build up chemistry

370
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,180
in a short time.

371
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,730
If it's too hard,

372
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,250
let's not waste time.

373
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,330
Come on.

374
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,810
Who says we don't have chemistry?

375
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,570
We have great chemistry.

376
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,460
Bring it on.

377
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,090
Okay, look here.

378
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,050
Good.

379
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,620
One more.

380
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,810
Perfect.

381
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,250
Be more natural.

382
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,490
Okay, one more.

383
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,940
Xiaoqi, be more natural

384
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,220
Look here.

385
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,530
Okay.

386
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,460
Open your eyes.

387
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,010
Xiaoqi, you need to look more excited.

388
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,460
- Excited?
- Think of something

389
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,290
that will make you happy, okay?

390
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,140
Happy?

391
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,530
It's okay. You're just
an ordinary person.

392
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,090
It must be hard for you to stand next to

393
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,420
a professional celebrity like me.

394
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,380
There are three key points
to focus on in photo shoots.

395
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,330
Image, appearance

396
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,330
and figure.

397
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,860
You have to work on

398
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,980
your image

399
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,220
and your appearance through styling.

400
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,940
What are you talking about?

401
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,770
Here, let me demonstrate.

402
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,290
I...

403
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,010
Okay.

404
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,810
Not bad.

405
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,660
That's it.

406
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,460
Relax a bit.

407
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,220
A little more to the side.

408
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,010
No. Do another pose.

409
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,330
Sorry.

410
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,700
This style is actually
difficult to pull off.

411
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,490
It doesn't suit you.

412
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,090
Whatever.

413
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,380
I can handle this.

414
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,730
Sorry.

415
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,010
Xiaoqi.

416
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,180
That expression just now
was nice and sweet.

417
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,420
Do it again. Come on.

418
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,700
Yes, Ms. Chai.

419
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,460
Your smile is contagious.

420
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,490
Yes.

421
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,290
- My smile?
- Yes, keep it like that.

422
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,140
Like this?

423
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,490
Very good.

424
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,620
That's it.

425
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,940
Again.

426
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,570
Perfect.

427
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,180
Keep it up.

428
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,660
Good.

429
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,860
You're getting better.

430
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,940
Okay.

431
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,460
- This one is really nice.
- Not bad.

432
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,380
They all look great.

433
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,460
Okay, we got it.

434
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
Thanks, both of you.

435
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,220
Get changed into your next outfit.

436
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,810
Go ahead.

437
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,570
Okay.

438
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,570
For the boys, we go for

439
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,140
a contrasting style.

440
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,490
It's all about the contrast between

441
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,620
the manliness and
the femininity of the makeup.

442
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,570
Okay.

443
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,980
Actually, Mr. Fang, I think

444
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,010
you can undo your button.

445
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,460
Okay. Turn up the music.

446
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:30,900
Good.

447
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,570
Very good.

448
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,180
Perfect.

449
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,980
One more.

450
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,810
Okay, change your pose.

451
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,090
One more.

452
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,330
Very good.

453
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,460
Both of them look hot.

454
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,530
Who do you think looks better?

455
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,220
Keep it up.

456
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,810
Of course it's our boss.

457
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,140
I know him well.

458
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,700
Okay, chin up.

459
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,460
Good.

460
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,700
Han.

461
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,940
Candy.

462
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,770
Perfect.

463
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,490
Do a freestyle.

464
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,090
Okay, another one.

465
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,730
Easy-peasy.

466
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,660
Han.

467
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,460
Look here.

468
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,730
Good. Very good.

469
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,090
Hold your pose.

470
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,250
He has a great body.

471
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,730
Okay, enough.

472
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,180
Don't undo your buttons. Stop.

473
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,420
This will do.

474
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,090
I can undo another button.

475
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,140
Me, too.

476
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,290
We have the shots we need.

477
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:07,980
Are you sure?

478
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
This is enough.

479
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,810
If you unbutton more,
it won't be broadcast.

480
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:11,900
Okay.

481
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,940
Okay, let's take a break.

482
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,460
Get ready for the next
couples photo shoot.

483
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,180
Slow down, Xiaoqi.

484
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,180
I slipped.

485
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,290
Sorry.

486
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,530
Here, Fang Leng.

487
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,290
Mr. Fang, good job.

488
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,810
- Here.
- Thank you.

489
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,730
I think your performance

490
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,810
- was very powerful.
- For me?

491
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,220
Well done.

492
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,980
I'll get another bottle.

493
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,940
Here, wipe your sweat.

494
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,940
Good job.

495
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
You look good today.

496
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,810
You, too.

497
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,460
Okay.

498
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,980
A little closer.

499
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,010
Okay. Look at your partner.

500
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,420
Perfect.

501
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,860
Okay.

502
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,420
Look at the camera.

503
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
Very good.

504
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,490
One more.

505
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,330
Okay, good.

506
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,010
Xiaoqi.

507
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,490
You can lift one foot.

508
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,570
Look more playful.

509
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,490
Lift my foot?

510
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,090
Like this?

511
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,900
That's it.

512
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,860
That's the vibe we want.

513
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,220
How about this?

514
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,810
Swap your partners.

515
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,010
Mr. Fang and Xiaoqi make a pair

516
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,090
and the two of you together, okay?

517
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,050
No way.

518
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,530
Why should we?

519
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,900
The initial partner is fine. I refuse.

520
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,770
Mr. Fang and I are great together.

521
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,050
Why should we swap partners?

522
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,090
Yes. That's unnecessary.

523
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,660
Yes.

524
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,050
But I guess you're trying to

525
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,250
get the best shot.

526
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,010
Why? Are you not confident?

527
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,940
No way.

528
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,730
Then show me what you got.

529
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,090
- Okay.
- Come on.

530
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:00,530
I dare you.

531
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,330
Bring it on.

532
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,140
- Come on.
- Okay.

533
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,900
- Let's start.
- Come on.

534
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,090
Then let's start with your group.

535
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,530
You two can take a break first.

536
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,770
Okay, let's start.

537
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,250
I look forward to this combination.

538
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,140
Get closer.

539
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,490
Come on.

540
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,570
That's it.

541
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,620
Why are you so distant?

542
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,050
- Are you feeling guilty?
- Don't look so stiff.

543
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,700
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

544
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,220
- What do I have to feel guilty about?
- Relax a bit.

545
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,250
Very good.

546
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,700
You're right.

547
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,660
Actually, I'd rather thank you.

548
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,660
Since you left the company,

549
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,570
our productivity

550
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,810
has increased by 25%.

551
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,620
Hey.

552
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,460
Mind your expressions.

553
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,010
Relax.

554
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,620
You left

555
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,460
without saying a word.

556
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,090
Have you liaised with Han?

557
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,460
Don't accuse me, okay?

558
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,140
I've passed all my work to him.

559
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,250
Every single one of them.

560
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,810
What about me?

561
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,980
That's it. Good.

562
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,290
You usually brought me coffee

563
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,250
and prepared documents.

564
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,420
Did you check with me

565
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,570
before you left?

566
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,620
Don't be ridiculous.

567
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,250
You said you hated me.

568
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,050
You should be happy that I left.

569
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,570
It was out of spite.

570
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,180
Now, look at the camera.

571
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,460
Very good.

572
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
Lean your head over.

573
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,620
Perfect.

574
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,700
That's it.

575
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,380
One more.

576
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,460
Good.

577
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,290
Okay, be more affectionate.

578
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,010
Mr. Jiang, you're so generous

579
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,660
to let your woman get so close

580
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,770
with someone else.

581
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,980
Aren't you too, Miss Chen?

582
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,730
I've been at home for too long.

583
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,220
I'm not inspired at all.

584
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,490
Thank you.

585
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,810
This year's theme is fluttery.

586
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,810
Just think about

587
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,980
what makes your heart flutter.

588
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,250
Fluttery.

589
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,460
Fluttery?

590
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,330
I seem to know
what makes my heart flutter.

591
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,330
What is it?

592
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,660
But would it be

593
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,900
appropriate to say it out?

594
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,380
(Alert System temperature is increasing)

595
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,500
(Alert System temperature is increasing)
No.

596
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,500
(Alert System temperature is increasing)
You can say it.

597
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,460
(Alert System temperature is increasing)
All right then.

598
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,180
First place trophy.

599
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
(Alert System temperature is increasing)

600
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,980
(System temperature is normal)
I'm excited just thinking about it.

601
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,060
(System temperature is normal)

602
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,730
First place trophy.

603
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,530
First place trophy.

604
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,380
First place trophy.

605
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,770
Why did I suddenly heat up just now?

606
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,980
I suddenly cooled down again...

607
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm excited!

608
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,330
When I heard the trophy.

609
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,980
(Mother)

610
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,900
Oh, no.

611
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,090
It's my mum.

612
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,220
I told my mum I'd be home after school.

613
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,380
It's so late now.

614
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,140
Don't worry.

615
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,980
I'll take you on a shortcut.
You'll be home in five minutes.

616
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,090
You are the best.

617
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,330
I warn you.

618
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,660
Don't touch my head again.

619
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,180
Let's go.

620
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,380
You won't let me touch your head,
but we can hold hands.

621
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,490
What kind of logic is that?

622
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,980
I don't care. Just don't touch my head.

623
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,810
That's a wrap.

624
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,250
- Good work, guys.
- Thank you.

625
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,660
Thank you for your hard work.

626
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,700
Kevin, come over.

627
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,740
Shiyi, where shall we go next?

628
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,610
Take this.

629
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,530
Shall we go to a nice restaurant?

630
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,940
- Get changed.
- Okay, I'll get changed.

631
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,650
Wait for me.

632
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,260
Sort out the photos.

633
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,010
I'll go back first.

634
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,260
- Okay.
- Good work.

635
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,570
- Goodbye.
- We'll get going.

636
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,260
Did you grab a taxi?

637
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,260
(Candy Show)

638
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,210
I must say.

639
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,490
You've certainly got a knack

640
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,780
for spoiling my day.

641
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,170
I should not have underestimated you.

642
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,690
However, I don't want to
waste too much time on you.

643
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,740
If you can give up on Fang Leng,

644
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,530
I will introduce you

645
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,940
to other rich men.

646
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,210
They're definitely
comparable to Fang Leng.

647
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,490
Thanks, but no thanks.

648
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,460
Please be realistic.

649
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,940
Fang Leng will definitely choose

650
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,210
someone who can assist him,

651
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,340
not an ordinary

652
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,570
delivery girl like you.

653
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,610
Besides, in terms of
family background and appearance,

654
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,130
how can you compare with me?

655
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,260
Wait.

656
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,610
You...

657
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,610
Why are you leaving so soon?

658
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,690
Are you feeling guilty?

659
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,090
Or this is part of your plan?

660
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,090
You're really weird.

661
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,210
Are you...

662
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,860
No swearing.

663
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,010
Why do you look down on working people?

664
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,860
We don't make money by winking

665
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,260
and squeezing those fake tears like you.

666
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,780
What's wrong with me
working for my own money?

667
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,260
Why do you look down on us?

668
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,050
Wink? Who?

669
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,170
It's just the two of us here.

670
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,610
Who do you think I'm talking about?

671
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,900
And can you please stop

672
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,460
bringing up your family?

673
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,570
Without the support of your family,

674
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,610
who cares about you
and who will recognise you?

675
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,690
No one will even see you

676
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,340
in the crowd, okay?

677
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,820
You're a nobody.

678
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,690
- I...
- You're beautiful?

679
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,740
What's the point?

680
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,460
There are plenty of

681
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,740
beautiful people like you out there.

682
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,420
Also,

683
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,090
your makeup looks cakey.

684
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,820
I think I recited it correctly.

685
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,820
Xiaoqi.

686
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,900
Let's go.

687
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,610
Wait.

688
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,170
What's going on?

689
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,130
Mr. Fang is so kind.

690
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,130
Then please take care of

691
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,260
your pretty girlfriend
who is worthy of you.

692
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,530
Let's go.

693
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,530
I sprained my ankle. It hurts.

694
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,980
Are you fine?

695
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,260
Can you take me to the hospital?

696
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,650
Ms. Chen.

697
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,570
You're a little overacted.

698
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,820
Who says we don't have chemistry?

699
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,460
We have great chemistry.

700
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,610
Bring it on.

701
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,260
You must be tired after all that work.

702
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,900
I just want to apologise to you.

703
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,090
I've apologised to you so many times,

704
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,490
yet you're still not happy.
