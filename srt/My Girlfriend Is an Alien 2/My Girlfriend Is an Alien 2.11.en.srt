19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,441
I...

20
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,161
I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,201
I accidentally fell.

22
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,600
I didn't mean to break them.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,441
Sorry.

24
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:13,441
I promise I'll clean up well.

25
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,920
I'll clean up this mess.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,241
Sorry.

27
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm sorry. Please don't get mad.

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,841
Do you smell it?

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
Applying perfume to the pulse area

30
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,760
and letting them flow with the
rhythm of the blood

31
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,320
can evaporate the perfume faster.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,961
How fragrant.

33
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,161
Which bottle of perfume was this?

34
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,920
How did I not smell this earlier?

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,920
How did mine get snatched first?

36
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,320
What did you say?

37
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Nothing.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,001
This isn't like the
fried chicken incident last time.

39
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,961
This time it's me kissing you back.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,441
Fried chicken?

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,121
Oh, so it was because of that.

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,320
The perfumes that you broke

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,401
were the results of the
R&D department.

44
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,161
I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

45
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,800
Replicate the scent earlier
as soon as possible.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,961
Blend a new perfume.

47
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm back.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,920
Back already?

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm so tired.

50
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,201
Why are you watching this?

51
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:40,161
Previously when I was drunk,
Fang Lie wanted to kiss me.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,600
So I have to find out

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,161
the kissing logic of earthlings.

54
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,321
You know,

55
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,521
I've watched this the whole day.

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,161
I realize on Earth
there's the accidental kiss,

57
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,360
love confession kiss,

58
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
and break up kiss.

59
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,120
Do you know what's the

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,680
shared logic between these kisses?

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
There's no logic at all.

62
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,920
If a person kisses you suddenly,

63
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:06,000
it shows that he's been
planning it for a long time.

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,201
So the reason why Fang Leng
kissed me earlier was

65
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,841
because I kissed him last time.

66
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,281
So that's why
he wants to return the favor.

67
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,721
It's a good thing
you explained it to me.

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,721
If not, I would have
misunderstood him. My goodness.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,920
Fang Leng kissed you?

70
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,000
Didn't you say
it's a logical problem?

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
There's no need to be surprised.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,761
Go and study.

73
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,201
So that's what it was.

74
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,040
What?

75
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
I was just having diarrhea.

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
How did I miss out on so much?

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,761
What are you agitated for?

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,761
It's the friend
I told you about last time.

79
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,560
Why do you think

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,321
he would want to kiss the girl?

81
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,721
What else?

82
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,721
It's pure interest towards her.

83
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,161
It can't be.

84
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:01,641
It was just a short kiss.

85
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,881
Maybe it's just close proximity

86
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:04,841
with the right atmosphere.

87
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,161
Maybe it's just interest and

88
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,201
attraction towards each other.

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,721
There's no need to be surprised.

90
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:09,841
Just like in western countries,

91
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,440
they greet each other with a kiss.

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,761
- It doesn't mean...
- Mr. Fang.

93
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,881
I'm also always
in close proximity to you.

94
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,480
Do you want to kiss me?

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,881
I get it now.

96
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,560
That friend of yours

97
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,600
must be experiencing stress
from having his first love.

98
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,081
What do you mean?

99
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:27,881
As humans,

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,761
when we like someone
for the first time,

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,201
we're unfamiliar
with such emotions.

102
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,440
Our hearts will subconsciously

103
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,800
deceive others to deceive oneself

104
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,761
in response to this new feeling.

105
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It's also known as self-deception.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,521
Then, do you have any idea to

107
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,240
prove that this feeling
is pure interest?

108
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,641
That'll be simple.

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,201
The eyes are the
windows to your soul.

110
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,321
First of all,

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
when you like someone,

112
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,201
you can't help but smile
when you see that person.

113
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:00,120
Secondly,

114
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,641
when you don't see her,
you'll look for her.

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,401
Thirdly.

116
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,321
Even if you close your eyes,

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
you still see her in your dreams.

118
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,841
These are the three truth-seeking rules
for finding out if you like someone.

119
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:13,401
It's also called
God of Truth's rule.

120
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,881
(Splendid.)

121
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,201
(The novel will have new material now.)

122
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,161
What else is missing?

123
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,440
How fragrant.

124
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,680
When did you come in?

125
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
However, your face.

126
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,680
Are you having allergies?
Why is it so red?

127
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:37,960
I was just feeling a little hot.

128
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,521
Isn't it initially 45 percent?

129
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,881
How can this...

130
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,800
What did you say?

131
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:14,920
(How should I tell him?)

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,320
(The ingredient
that's lacking are hormones.)

133
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,281
Nothing.

134
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:20,481
I was just blending perfumes

135
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,920
but no matter how
I still can't get it right.

136
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,481
Can I borrow your hand?

137
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,560
Thanks.

138
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,560
That's right. It's this smell.

139
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,601
Right.

140
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:45,960
It's somewhat similar.

141
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,840
But also not exactly the same.

142
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:51,161
I took everything here just now

143
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:53,040
and mixed them according to the ratios.

144
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,601
Still, I couldn't get the exact scent
no matter how I mixed.

145
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,040
But once I added your scent,

146
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
it became fragrant.

147
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,001
My scent?

148
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,450
(It's actually attraction
based on pheromones.)

149
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,080
It's actually attraction
based on pheromones.

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,440
Come in.

151
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,720
Mr. Fang, the investigation
report you asked for is ready.

152
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,641
Mr. Fang.

153
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
You smell good.

154
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,680
The vast majority of love
perfumes on the market now

155
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,440
uses animal musk.

156
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,680
In order to increase
stimulation and attraction.

157
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,040
If human hormones can be used

158
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,161
to make perfumes,

159
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,161
our company will then

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
invent a new type of scent.

161
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,840
It can also allow consumers

162
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,241
to have a new experience
through the sense of smell.

163
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,521
Hormones?

164
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Right!

165
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,281
Mr. Fang.

166
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,761
My admiration for you
has reached a new height.

167
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,241
Hormones?

168
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,401
Mr. Fang.

169
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,920
What's going on?

170
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:02,720
Ms. Chai.

171
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,440
Have you heard of using
hormones to make perfumes?

172
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,720
Hormones?

173
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:11,761
Hormones?

174
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,601
Mr. Han.

175
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,080
Go and notify the perfume department

176
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,200
to change the theme of
dreamy love perfume

177
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
to hormonal fragrance.

178
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,281
Then, notify the R&D department

179
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,560
to study on

180
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,241
how to purify human hormones.

181
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:23,960
Understood.

182
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
That's great.

183
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,761
I'll get all my completed samples

184
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:32,720
and send them
to the R&D department.

185
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,361
Mr. Fang.

186
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,521
Mr. Fang.

187
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,960
Mr. Fang, you really are

188
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,200
amazing.

189
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,680
Mr. Fang.

190
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,281
Do you still remember

191
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,641
the God of Truth's first rule?

192
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
When you like someone,

193
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,281
you can't help but smile

194
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,241
when you look at them.

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,440
Then do you remember

196
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,320
that this action will
negatively affect your bonus?

197
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,320
I do.

198
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:27,481
Greetings, Mr. Fang.

199
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,320
Where's Xiaoqi?

200
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,121
Mr. Fang.

201
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,521
Xiaoqi said she'll be going
to the R&D department.

202
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,440
Get on with your work.

203
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,241
What's taking her so long?

204
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,980
(Han Zhiming, CEO's Assistant)
(Secondly.)

205
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,080
(When you don't see her, you'll look for her.)

206
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,001
You don't like it?

207
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,001
What's wrong with me?

208
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,161
Morning, Mr. Fang.

209
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,521
- Morning, Mr. Fang.
- Morning, Mr. Fang.

210
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,001
Did you have a bad dream?

211
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,560
How did you know?

212
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,481
You look pale.

213
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:36,840
It must be from poor sleep.

214
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,080
It's fine.
I can make some coffee for you.

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,601
(It must be from seeing her every day.)

216
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
(I got used to it.)

217
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,320
Go work outdoors for today.

218
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,881
The company ordered some fresh roses

219
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,560
from Sunshine Flower Garden.

220
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,840
Go and check the balance sheet.

221
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,121
Then, take some samples back.

222
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,040
You're prohibited from coming back
into the office before your shift ends.

223
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,881
What...

224
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,321
How strange.

225
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,520
What's strange about it?

226
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,321
Aren't you a psychiatrist?

227
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,801
You can't even complete
such a simple task.

228
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,480
You're asking me
to perform hypnosis on you

229
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,041
so that you can hate Xiaoqi?

230
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,321
Don't you
that it's a strange request?

231
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
But she's already heavily

232
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,321
influencing my daily life.

233
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:27,601
I have a suggestion.

234
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,760
If you like her, so be it.

235
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,520
You have to follow your heart.

236
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:36,121
The more you run away from it,
the more it proves that you care.

237
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:38,601
You know my amnesia best.

238
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,641
I won't have a future with anyone.

239
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,200
Besides,

240
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
this isn't about likes or dislikes.

241
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:46,841
It's just a short-term emotion.

242
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,161
Do you want me to end up
like everybody else?

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,760
Just because of this short-term emotion,

244
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,041
I'll make a promise
that I can never fulfill.

245
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:55,561
You're neither being cautious

246
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,121
nor responsible.

247
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,960
You're just simply afraid.

248
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,081
Have you thought about this?

249
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,041
What if what you think is safe

250
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,680
turns out to be a missed opportunity?

251
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,081
What if she really leaves?

252
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:08,841
Will you really not regret it?

253
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:12,760
Mr. Fang.

254
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,041
Mr. Fang.

255
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,361
Hurry and look at the news.

256
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,561
Ms. Chai is in trouble.

257
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,760
(Breaking News)
There was a car accident near Qingnian Road.

258
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
(Breaking News)
An overloaded truck collided

259
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:23,280
(Breaking News)with a woman's electric scooter.

260
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
A good samaritan already called 120.

261
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
But the woman's family
has not been contacted.

262
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,041
The situation on the scene now

263
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,200
looks dire.

264
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,841
Fortunately,
the medical staff arrived in time

265
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,121
to rescue the injured.

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Can you repeat what happened?

267
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,960
I was making a right turn
like I normally do.

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,361
She didn't even notice
the traffic lights

269
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,361
and rushed out.

270
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,161
How can I avoid her in time?

271
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,121
It looks pretty serious.

272
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,200
This girl's too careless.

273
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,720
- Careful. Slowly.
- She ignored the traffic lights.

274
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,161
Right? It was a heavy blow.

275
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,520
Not sure if she could survive this.

276
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,601
That's right.

277
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,760
Doctor!

278
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
How's her condition?

279
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,720
Are you a family member?

280
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,361
I'm her boyfriend.

281
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,401
Here's the case. She suffered
blood loss from her veins.

282
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Because it was a sudden accident,

283
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,440
she suffered from shock when we arrived.

284
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Even so, she still has a pulse.

285
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:06,480
Moreover,

286
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,321
someone had already bandaged her.

287
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,720
Fortunately, someone
took hemostatic measures.

288
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
If not, it'll post even more troubles.

289
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,440
Come on.

290
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,401
Alright.

291
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,401

I'm here, Ms. Chai.

322
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,601
I parked your
electric scooter downstairs.

323
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,680
Here's your helmet

324
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,601
and your keys.

325
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:12,760
Change this helmet.

326
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,321
Replace it with a sturdier one.

327
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,121
Alright.

328
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:19,321
You can leave.

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,480
Okay, sure.

330
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Bye-bye, I'll get going.

331
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,841
Mr. Fang. If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

Mr. Han.

Find me a few successful

Love confession?

00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,760
Mr. Fang, could it be?

336
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:45,801
The sooner the better.

337
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,200
Don't worry, I have a set of ways
that'll guarantee success.

338
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,440
It'll definitely make Ms. Chai

339
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,680
touched to her core.

340
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,121
Just wait.

341
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:56,801
The surprises are yet to come.

342
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:03,480
Have a sit.

343
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,361
Thank you.

344
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,161
Mister. Miss. Here's your menu.

345
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,240
Thank you.

346
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,081
Thank you.

347
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,601
Just order whatever you like.

348
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,361
So expensive.

349
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,321
In a moment, read this first.

350
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,720
Then...

351
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,240
Remember the steps, okay?

352
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,321
Xiaoqi.

353
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,480
Why are you treating me to dinner?

354
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,081
It's because of your efforts

355
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:47,200
that the company established

356
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,000
the research direction for
hormonal fragrances.

357
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,321
It's to reward you.

358
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:52,641
Alright. Okay.

359
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:01,641
Hello.

360
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,801
Before your meal,

361
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,641
please allow me
to tell you a love story.

362
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:06,720
Sure.

363
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:10,161
Since a long time ago,

364
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:13,601
a rose represents affection.

365
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
In other words,
you're the only one for me.

366
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,841
These 33 roses here

367
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:19,960
represent our fate
across three lifetimes.

368
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:21,480
Also, my love for you
across three lifetimes.

369
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,561
My love, please be my girlfriend.

370
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,401
Say yes.

371
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:30,200
Say yes!

372
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,401
How romantic.

373
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,200
Where did you stop earlier?

374
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,881
You can continue now.

375
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,121
Gifting a rose to you

376
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,200
- represents...
- Forget it.

377
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:46,041
Get on with the dishes first.

378
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,960
Please wait a moment.

379
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,641
Why did he bring the dish away?

380
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,041
That's not a dish.

381
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,121
Hurry. Get 99 roses for me.

382
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,000
The sooner the better.

383
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,161
You can have mine.

384
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,480
Here.

385
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,920
Thanks.

386
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,280
- It's here.
- Hurry up and go.

387
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,200
Hurry.

388
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:34,000
Xiaoqi.

389
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:35,960
There's something I've been wanting

390
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,401
to tell you all this time.

391
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
Actually...

392
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,280
Look.

393
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,680
My dear.

394
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,121
- These 999 roses
- 99.

395
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,841
represent our long-lasting love.

396
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,561
Happy anniversary.

397
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,161
Thanks, honey.

398
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,480
I love you.

399
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,200
It's so romantic.

400
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,121
How romantic.

401
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
What did you want to tell me earlier?

402
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:23,321
I just wanted to say that

403
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,401
the beef steak here is delicious.

404
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
Help yourself with more.

405
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,680
I think they're delicious too.

406
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:28,680
You have some too.

407
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,680
What's that?

408
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,520
Excuse me, mister.

409
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,081
Will there be any more
love confessions today?

410
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:48,920
No more.

411
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,680
Are you sure?

412
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:50,841
Don't worry about it.

413
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:56,240
Xiaoqi.

414
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,401
This necklace is called
Wandering Polaris.

415
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
- This was...
- My love,

416
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:03,920
will you marry me?

417
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,361
The ring must be expensive.

418
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:08,041
Didn't I say a necklace will do?

419
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:08,841
My love.

420
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,321
A diamond ring must be used
to express sincerity.

421
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,081
Right, mister?

422
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,720
Congratulations.

423
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,401
Congratulations.

424
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,081
You think it's romantic too, right?

425
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
How joyous.

426
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,361
So romantic.

427
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,161
What was it about the necklace?

428
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:39,200
Oh, this necklace.

429
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,920
I want to gift it to a customer.

430
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,280
I was planning to ask
what you thought about it.

431
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,081
- Sure, let me have a look at it.
- It's fine now.

432
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
There's no need for that anymore.

433
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,240
Okay.

434
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,680
(Han)

435
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,180
(Mr. Fang, cut my bonus. This restaurant
is something else. I can't help it.)

436
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,801
Yummy.

437
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,081
Where's your car?

438
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,200
You came here by car, right?

439
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,520
After a successful love confession,

440
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
the most romantic thing to do

441
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
is for two people
to take a stroll back home.

442
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,200
Mr. Fang, worry not.

443
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,280
I'll help you drive
your car away beforehand.

444
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,960
This way, you two
can stroll under the lamplights

445
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,680
while holding hands.

446
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
I think I forgot where I parked it.

447
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,881
I'll ask Mr. Han to look for it later.

448
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,321
Are you cold?

449
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:57,161
Wear this.

450
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,480
Wear it?

451
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,200
Do you feel better?

452
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,321
Thanks.

453
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,361
You're welcome.

454
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:33,641
Thank you.

455
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,760
You weren't full earlier right?

456
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,361
The portion of that
western dish was so small,

457
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,440
how could I be...

458
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:53,401
Fried chicken!

459
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,520
I'll have two of this and this.

460
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,601
Also, some of these and these.

461
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:01,000
- Thanks, mister.
- Alright.

462
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,720
Two.

463
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,440
This one, thank you.

464
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,760
- The total will be RMB 40.
- Alright.

465
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:06,720
Take my card.

466
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
Pay by card?

467
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,401
This...

468
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,000
This is a black card.

469
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,081
I'll treat you.

470
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay, it's paid.

471
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,601
Thank you.

472
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:25,801
You go ahead.

473
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,361
How cold.

474
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
It smells really good.

475
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,161
Time to dig in.

476
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
It's so tasty.

477
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Eat slowly.

478
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:44,841
Yummy.

479
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:47,720
I really don't get it.

480
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,000
Why not give fried chicken

481
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,440
instead of roses?

482
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,601
Aren't roses the standard
for love confessions?

483
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,401
Fried chicken can be eaten.

484
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,041
Roses can't.

485
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,280
Once they wilt,
you'll have to throw them away.

486
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,641
That's not the case for fried chicken.

487
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,920
Once you eat it,

488
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
the rest

489
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,401
becomes a part of you.

490
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,440
You can't shed them away.

491
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,960
They'll become a part of yourself.

492
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,321
Don't you think so?

493
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:08,280
Doesn't it make sense?

494
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:21,641
Sorry.

495
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,401
It's okay.

496
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,760
It was cheap.

497
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,121
But you still didn't clean up well.

(Fried chicken

510
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll wait here with fried chicken.

511
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,561
Fang Leng, I'm here.

512
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,561
Xiaoqi.

513
00:31:58,161 --> 00:31:59,760
I've actually liked you for a while now.

514
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,200
Me too.

515
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,770

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
(Fang Leng)

517
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,960
(See you at the park beside the lake
at 5 pm.)

518
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,321
Mr. Fang.

519
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,601
Mr. Zhao has arrived.

520
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
- Mr. Zhao, please enter.
- You've worked hard.

521
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Hello, bro.

522
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:22,960
It's been a while.

523
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
Welcome.

524
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:26,081
Why are you so formal with me?

525
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,041
Let's hug instead.

526
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,480
It's been hectic
back in the states lately.

527
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,480
It's not easy for me to get day offs.

528
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
I purposely came to see you.

529
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,401
How are you?

530
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,161
I heard that the company
is growing steadily.

531
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,161
We are recently establishing a
R&D department.

532
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:42,121
Also, developing a new product.

533
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,240
Invest in one of them.

534
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,841
You're still the same as before.

535
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,280
All work and no life.

536
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,161
Let me guess.

537
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:55,641
You're still single, right?

538
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,920
That smile tells me something.

539
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,680
Your career's doing well and your
love life also seems to be fruitful.

540
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Let me in on the gossip.

541
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm sure you've met

542
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,321
my girlfriend

543
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:11,801
back in Los Angeles last year.

544
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,480
Los Angeles?

545
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
That's impossible.

546
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,760
You dragged me along wherever
you went when we were in Los Angeles.

547
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,881
If not meetings, it was clients.

548
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,321
There was no time for a girlfriend.

549
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,401
However, there are
a lot of scammers now.

550
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,000
Could you have been scammed?

551
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:31,361
Come here for a bit.

552
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,680
What's up?

553
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,960
Do you know that girl in green?

554
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:44,920
I don't.

555
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,440
Try to recall carefully.

556
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:54,680
Really. I haven't seen her before.

557
00:33:58,641 --> 00:33:59,401
Mr. Zhao.

558
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,641
I'll let my staff

559
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,480
give you a tour of the company.

560
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,480
Sure.

561
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,960
I'll look for you later.

562
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,760
Steven.

563
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,561
Mr. Zhao will be in your care.

564
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,561
- Alright, you get on with your work.
- Okay.

565
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,161
Mr. Han.

566
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:17,641
Come inside.

567
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,641
Mr. Fang.

568
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,240
How did you investigate Chai Xiaoqi?

569
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:24,521
I...

570
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,200
At that time, I did not immediately find

571
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,001
information on Ms. Chai's identity.

572
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,921
But with my super investigative ability,

573
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,121
I found her apartment's agency.

574
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:33,001
Only then did I know that

575
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:35,481
Ms. Chai is the daughter of
Li Chunjiao, the landlady.

576
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,320
Mr. Fang.

577
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,521
Was the information incorrect?

578
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,200
Investigate again.

579
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,780
(Personal information)

580
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,640
(Identity not clear)

581
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,770
(Family information not clear)

582
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,200
Why did you call for me?

583
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Who exactly are you?

584
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,041
What do you mean?

585
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:40,360
You don't recognize me anymore?

586
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:41,441
I'm Xiaoqi.

587
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:43,800
You're not the landlady's daughter.

588
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,481
We've never met
in the states before either.

589
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,720
Why must you lie to me?

590
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,121
I...

591
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,001
(I can't possibly
say that I'm an alien.)

592
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,880
(Even if I do, he wouldn't believe me.)

593
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,481
I...

594
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:03,601
Let's not talk about this now.

595
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,041
Wait until I

596
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,641
make something yummy for us.

597
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,641
Then I'll tell you slowly.

598
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,161
Did you call for me just to ask me this?

599
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,400
Fang Leng.

600
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,121
-Fang Leng.
-There are many rich daughters anyway.

601
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:39,561
How unfortunate. If only you
were here five minutes earlier.

602
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,720
As long as he's alive, I'm duty-bound.

603
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,561
What's going on?

604
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,561
Do you like me?

605
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,521
I do.

606
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,360
I can bring you home with me then.

607
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,641
You even held another man's hand.

608
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
You betrayed me before.

609
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,360
I didn't.

610
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,360
It's not like that. Fang...

611
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:06,441
