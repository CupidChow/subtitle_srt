19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,310
Let go of me.

20
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,430
Xiaoqi.

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,230
I bought you
your favourite fried chicken

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,120
and cake.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
I didn't know which flavour you liked.

24
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,000
So I bought one of each.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,950
You held me without authority

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,310
and you used your powers on me.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,200
You have violated

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
the basic laws of human rights

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
on the Cape Town Planet.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,710
I waited 30 minutes for this cake.

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,950
I wonder how it tastes.

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,440
Here. Try it.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Aren't you hungry?

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay, let's eat later.

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,760
Brother, did you hear Xiaoqi's voice?

36
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,390
The magnetic field
fluctuations have disappeared

37
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,710
(No designated signal detected)
and no sign of Xiaoqi's life.

38
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,040
She must have been taken away again.

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,160
I wonder if Xiaoqi has eaten

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,830
and slept well

41
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,880
in the past few days

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,160
and if Jiang Shiyi and Candy

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
have bullied her.

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,270
Don't worry. Xiaoqi should be fine.

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,360
Besides, we should be

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,790
able to find Xiaoqi soon.

47
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,670
The last time we went
to Jiang Shiyi's house,

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,710
I could feel Xiaoqi next to me,

49
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,040
but I couldn't see her.

50
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,670
This time on the street,

51
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,110
I could hear her voice again.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,390
Still, I really didn't know
where she was.

53
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,950
Xiaobu.

54
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,040
Does your planet

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,360
have a feature

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,790
that allows you to

57
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,080
contain people in one place

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,270
without being seen by others?

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,790
Barrier.

60
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,390
It must be a barrier.

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,710
I heard of this skill
before I came to Earth,

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,920
but I haven't had time to learn it yet.

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,510
In other words,

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,080
Jiang Shiyi has built
a barrier inside his home.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
It wasn't Jiang Shiyi.

66
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,320
This skill is
a special skill for robots.

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
It was probably Candy's doing.

68
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,270
So can you access Candy's system

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,600
to find the location of the barrier?

70
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,480
To break into Candy's firewall,

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,510
I'd need

72
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,550
a computer with
a more powerful CPU.

73
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,320
I have an idea.

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,710
Why did you lie to me?

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,360
I didn't mean to.

76
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm sorry, Shiyi.

77
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,080
No matter how many
days you hold me,

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,950
I won't change my mind.

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
I remember

80
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,440
you told me personally

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
back on the home planet

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,510
that there was
no lying between friends.

83
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Have you forgotten?

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,680
Let's be friends.

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,910
Friends?

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,560
Friends should be sincere

87
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,950
and never betray each other.

88
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,880
At that time,

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,390
I was selected

90
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,590
as one of the chief candidates
to be trained individually.

91
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,950
I didn't have time to find you,

92
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,680
and then when I did,

93
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,910
you have left.

94
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,680
Yet, I always remember

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
what you said to me.

96
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,000
So we've known each other for so long.

97
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,800
I was really happy to learn that

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,150
you were my genetic match.

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,830
I thought

100
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
I had found my partner.

101
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,680
Every day since I came to Earth,

102
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,150
I've been hoping

103
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,710
that the mission would be over

104
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,640
so that we could go home together

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,470
and become official couples.

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,710
Yet, I just can't understand

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,950
why there's Fang Leng between us

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,350
and you've changed.

109
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,760
Shiyi.

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
I really don't remember much

111
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,560
from those early days.

112
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,830
I know.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,390
Anything I say now

114
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,150
will make you think I'm your enemy.

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,950
Listen, Xiaoqi.

116
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,240
You have to believe me.

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,910
Whatever I do to you now,

118
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,560
everything I do

119
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
is to protect you

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
because you're the only
person I care about

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
and the only friend I have.

122
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,830
Let's forget all this

123
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,710
and go home.

124
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,950
Shiyi.

125
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm really touched

126
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,350
that you've been thinking
about these things for so long,

127
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,440
but it's really just
friendship between us.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
Even if we are genetically matched,

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,470
it's just some data.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
It doesn't mean anything.

131
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,080
As I've said before,

132
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,270
love is the only condition

133
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,760
for two people to be together.

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,830
You probably haven't loved before.

135
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,950
So you don't know

136
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,200
what it's like to be with

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
the person you love.

138
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,150
I know

139
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,270
that I have violated
the rules of the planet.

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,240
I know you're loyal to our home planet.

141
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,440
However, I love Fang Leng.

142
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,080
This is something that can't be undone.

143
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,710
I'm really sorry, Shiyi.

144
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,320
Brother.

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,440
We're up against
the latest robot in Cape Town.

146
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,150
Can our computer do it?

147
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,470
This is the most advanced computer

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,800
in our Research Department.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,270
So it should be fine.

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
How dare 3.0 version Kubri

151
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,240
invades my system?

152
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
What's the matter, Xiaobu?

153
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,830
Candy should have found out.

154
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
It's all right. I can go on.

155
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,830
Xiaobu, why are you so hot?

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,400
Xiaobu, why don't you take a break?

157
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,110
You'll suffer if you keep going.

158
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,280
No.

159
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,920
This is the only way
to break the barrier

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,230
and rescue Xiaoqi.

161
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Master.

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,830
The Earth seems to spread

163
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,350
a blindly confident energy.

164
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,040
What makes Kubri think

165
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,350
she can beat Candy?

166
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,040
Xiaobu.

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,160
Rest for a while.

168
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,990
Otherwise, you'll turn
into a tortoise again.

169
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,590
A tortoise?

170
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,260
(Love Program, ready to attack)

171
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
(Love Shot)

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,520
Master.

173
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,160
I have detected an unknown program.

174
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,920
My firewall is compromised.

175
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,870
This is Kubri's emotional programming

176
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,750
due to the influence of the Earthlings.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,350
Kubri was also instigated.

178
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,320
Master, thank you

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,830
for cutting off my system.

180
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
However, my firewall

181
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
is already buggy

182
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,710
and will take a while to fix and update.

183
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,040
Candy.

184
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,440
Our home planet

185
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,470
has no defenses against

186
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,400
Earth's emotional program,

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,560
I can only help you

188
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,680
block its attack signals for now,

189
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,630
but if she's going to

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,750
keep using this program,

191
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,080
the barrier will break sooner or later.

192
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,230
So I have no choice.

193
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm at my wit's end.

194
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,830
Master.

195
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,200
What are you doing?

196
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,590
Have you decided to bring Xiaoqi
back to the home planet now?

197
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
Candy.

198
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,110
If I absorb Fang Leng's hormones,

199
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,800
will I have

200
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,440
the same smell as Fang Leng?

201
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,710
Master, what are you trying to do?

202
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,110
If

203
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,950
I have the same smell as him,

204
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,470
Xiaoqi will go home with us,

205
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,160
won't she?

206
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,520
Hormones are banned from the planet

207
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,230
and concentrated hormones

208
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,590
can cause serious damage to your body.

209
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,870
You must not do this.

210
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,870
Master.

211
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,040
Master.

212
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,320
Master.

213
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,870
Don't do it.

214
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,470
Master.

215
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,800
Master.

216
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
Please stop.

217
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,040
This can cause
serious damage to your body.

218
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,680
Master.

219
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,350
Master.

220
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,950
Master.

221
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,110
Please stay calm.

222
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,920
Master.

223
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,870
Hi.

224
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,520
Fang Leng.

225
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,160
Fang Leng.

226
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,200
Fang Leng.

227
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,560
Hormones.

228
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,710
Hormones.

229
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,520
The barrier is removed.

230
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,560
It's really you.

231
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,750
How did you...

232
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,350
How come it's you?

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,590
Xiaoqi, let's eat.

234
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,560
Why do you

235
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,590
smell like Fang Leng?

236
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,520
Didn't you say you like
the smell of Fang Leng?

237
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,350
So I absorbed his hormones.

238
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,230
Why did you do that?

239
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,830
I just want to prove to you

240
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,400
that you don't love Fang Leng at all

241
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,440
and that

242
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,920
you're just blinded by his hormones.

243
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,750
No.

244
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,830
No.

245
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,080
You are not him.

246
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,400
There's no point in you doing this.

247
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,830
I love Fang Leng.

248
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,350
You can't deceive me.

249
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Brother, we're here.

250
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,110
Be careful, Xiaobu.

251
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,950
Xiaobu, how are you recovering?

252
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,520
Don't worry. I have no problem

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,320
being a hacker again today.

254
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,680
No.

255
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
You were too tired yesterday.

256
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,920
You need a good rest today.

257
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,350
Don't use your powers.

258
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,470
For the sake of Xiaoqi, this is nothing.

259
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,870
I am ready to go

260
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,230
to the Research Department at any time.

261
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,710
But if Xiaoqi were here,

262
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,830
she wouldn't want to see
you pushing yourself so hard.

263
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,520
Don't worry.

264
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,830
I found another way.

265
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,400
What is it?

266
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,350
Brother.

267
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,680
You're still in the mood

268
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,590
to cooperate with Jiang Shiyi
at this point in time?

269
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,080
If we keep focusing

270
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,400
on Jiang Shiyi's home,

271
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,230
he will definitely be on alert

272
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,200
and on guard.

273
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,710
He may even move Xiaoqi

274
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,040
to another place.

275
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,520
Then we might as well
go straight to his company

276
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,800
and perhaps even find out

277
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,830
more clues.

278
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,950
Xiaobu.

279
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,710
In the meantime, you can check

280
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,560
if Xiaoqi has been
locked up in the company.

281
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,990
By the way,

282
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
I need you to do me another favour.

283
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,800
Chief.

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
We're almost finished with our mission.

285
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,560
We will soon return to the planet.

286
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,590
We have detected signs
of energy instability

287
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,950
and even physical repercussions on you.

288
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,950
Can you explain what this is all about?

289
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,200
It should be due to the disturbance
of the magnetic field.

290
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,870
Everything is fine with me.

291
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Don't worry.

292
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Master, what should we do now?

293
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,440
The chief told us to
return as soon as possible,

294
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,680
but Chai Xiaoqi was still determined.

295
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,280
This seems

296
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,230
to be the only way.

297
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
We have no choice.

298
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,630
Xiaoqi.

299
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,920
I suggested to the chief

300
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,990
to do the formatting of your mind

301
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,160
when you get to the home planet.

302
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,680
However, I didn't expect

303
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,950
I'd have to do it myself this time.

304
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,160
Master.

305
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,720
Your body is suffering
from a backlash of the hormones.

306
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,390
You should not use

307
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,630
any superpowers until
you have fully recovered.

308
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,870
Besides, formatting a mind

309
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,520
is very energy consuming

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,350
and can cause
permanent damage to your body.

311
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,350
I have to do this.

312
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,320
Xiaoqi.

313
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,150
You're only with Fang Leng

314
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,630
for the mission.

315
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
You don't love him at all.

316
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Jiang Shiyi is your genetic match.

317
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,800
You should follow his orders.

318
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,480
What's wrong?

319
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,960
Master.

320
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,110
It should be due to her
inner feelings for the Earth

321
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,350
that makes her
subconsciously resist formatting.

322
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,390
Xiaoqi.

323
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,150
You're only with Fang Leng

324
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,560
for the mission.

325
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,350
You don't love him at all.

326
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
Jiang Shiyi is your genetic match.

327
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,040
You should follow his orders.

328
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,350
No.

329
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,150
Starchief.

330
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
What should we do next?

331
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,150
Just follow my arrangement.

332
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,590
Okay.

333
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,150
I'll leave the data

334
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,080
on your desk this afternoon.

335
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,760
Okay.

336
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,110
Hello, we have

337
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,150
a meeting with Mr. Jiang at 10am.

338
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,800
Okay, I'll take you to
the conference room.

339
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,390
Mr. Jiang. He's here.

340
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,830
Mr. Fang.

341
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,430
You came to my house before

342
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,000
and now you're here
to cause trouble in my company.

343
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
I just want to re-negotiate with you

344
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,350
about the contract.

345
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,350
What do you mean?

346
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,430
You said you are a Cape Townian.

347
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,040
So any contract signed

348
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,320
should be in accordance
with interstellar contract law.

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,150
However, there is no clear indication

350
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,800
in this contract as to whether

351
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,430
the payment is in Earth currency

352
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,110
or in Cape Town crystals.

353
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,590
Mr. Fang.

354
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,040
Is this the thing you should be
most worried about right now?

355
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Of course.

356
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,910
I am responsible for the profit
and loss risk of the entire company.

357
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,830
There is no room

358
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,830
for carelessness in business.

359
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,740
(Searching for designated signal)

360
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,350
(Chai Xiaoqi's life signal
is not detected)

361
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,760
(Chai Xiaoqi's life signal is not detected)
This is odd.

362
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,720
(Chai Xiaoqi's life signal is not detected)
There's still time.

363
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,910
(Chai Xiaoqi's life signal is not detected)
I'll take my time to find her.

364
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,430
Mr. Fang, don't worry.

365
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,670
My assistant will be right over.

366
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
I think she knows all the details

367
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,320
of this contract better than I do.

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,670
Mr. Jiang.

369
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,320
You're here.

370
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,520
Xiaoqi.

371
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,190
Are you okay?

372
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,560
Mr. Fang, please show some respect.

373
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,630
What's wrong with you, Xiaoqi?

374
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,000
Mr. Jiang should have told you before

375
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,870
that I was only with you

376
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,000
to accomplish my mission.

377
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,080
I have no feelings for you.

378
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
Now that the mission is complete,

379
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,960
we have nothing more
to do with each other.

380
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,480
What did you do to Xiaoqi, Jiang Shiyi?

381
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,320
I believe Xiaoqi has
made it very clear to you.

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,670
I hope you will keep
your distance from her.

383
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,760
Mr. Fang.

384
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Please respect her.

385
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,350
Xiaoqi.

386
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,830
You've worked hard.

387
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,760
You may leave.

388
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
As for you...

389
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,390
Mr. Fang.

390
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,110
See yourself out.

391
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,830
What are you doing?

392
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,670
I'm looking for Xiaoqi.

393
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,560
Kubri.

394
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,590
Xiaoqi.

395
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I finally found you.

396
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,760
Kubri.

397
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Did you get permission

398
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,520
from Jiang Shiyi before you came in?

399
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,670
No.

400
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,190
Then you've violated the rules.

401
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,320
I need to report this to him.

402
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,150
Xiaoqi, I'm here to find you.

403
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,000
Fang Leng is here, too.

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll take you to him.

405
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,960
I broke up with him.

406
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,830
From now on,

407
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,190
I have nothing to do with him.

408
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,350
You knew I was only with him

409
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,560
to complete my mission.

410
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,800
Now that I've accomplished my goal,

411
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,150
it's normal to break up.

412
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,520
No, Xiaoqi.

413
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,040
Didn't you say you were
in love with Fang Leng

414
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
and would stay on Earth for him?

415
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,110
Why have you suddenly changed your mind?

416
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,910
Our planet forbids love.

417
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,190
How could I possibly violate the rules?

418
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,150
Xiaoqi, are you sick?

419
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,480
Let me check it for you.

420
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,190
Kubri.

421
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,910
Did you come here with Fang Leng?

422
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,190
What did you do to Xiaoqi?

423
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
You don't need to worry.

424
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,110
I just

425
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,430
helped Xiaoqi make the right choice.

426
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,110
As for you,

427
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,350
I don't want to waste my time and energy

428
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,670
on a low-end robot.

429
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,190
So get lost.

430
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,430
Don't get in my way.

431
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,430
Xiaoqi, let's go.

432
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,110
Xiaoqi.

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
How could she become like this?

434
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
The current Xiaoqi is
definitely not the real her.

435
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,870
Jiang Shiyi must have
done something to her.

436
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,080
If I'm not mistaken,

437
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,870
Jiang Shiyi should have

438
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,190
formatted Xiaoqi's mind.

439
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,800
Formatting mind?

440
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,830
What does that mean?

441
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,190
Has Xiaoqi completely
forgotten about the past?

442
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,560
There are many different levels
of formatted brainwashing.

443
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,350
The most thorough, of course,
is to completely erase the memory.

444
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,240
However, the way I see
Xiaoqi's attitude today,

445
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,320
she remembers us,

446
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,430
but just forgotten

447
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,960
her feelings towards us.

448
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,800
So Xiaoqi should now be
under the impression

449
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,150
that she doesn't like you

450
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,110
and only approached you
to complete her mission.

451
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,000
How can we get her back to normal?

452
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,590
If we forcefully use superpowers

453
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,320
to bring back her memory,

454
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,150
it will definitely cause damage

455
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,280
to her nerve centre.

456
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,350
The best way

457
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
is to let her restore
her memory by herself.

458
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,110
Brother, we'll think of a way together.

459
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,960
Fang Leng used to keep hormones

460
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
in the Research Department.

461
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,000
However, they've been
a lot more cautious

462
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,430
since Mr. Kang's break-in.

463
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,190
They have set up a special security room

464
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,760
and strengthened the network firewall.

465
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,830
Have you been to that security room?

466
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,590
No.

467
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,560
Candy.

468
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,520
Yes, master.

469
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,430
Look into it.

470
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,760
Yes, master.

471
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,670
(Xiaoqi, I've kept your luggage, get it at the milk tea shop)
Xiaoqi, I've packed your things.

472
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,190
Come and pick them up
at the milk tea shop.

473
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,870
Kubri said

474
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,190
she packed my things

475
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,590
and asked me to pick them up
at the milk tea shop.

476
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,320
May I go?

477
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,110
Sure, Xiaoqi.

478
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,630
Well,

479
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,760
you don't have to
report everything to me.

480
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,040
We can just get along like we used to.

481
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,040
By the way,

482
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,590
this is for you.

483
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,830
Today is your first day at work.

484
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,150
You performed very well.

485
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,720
You are my boss.

486
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,430
I feel I need to

487
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,800
keep you informed of everything.

488
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,150
I'll be home as soon as

489
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,080
I've picked up my things.

490
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,190
Xiaoqi.

491
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,870
Why don't you eat candy?

492
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,520
I've had enough sugar for today.

493
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,520
Of course, if you want me to,

494
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,590
I can eat it now.

495
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,080
Xiaoqi.

496
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,150
Why don't we have dinner together?

497
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,320
All right.

498
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,670
What do you want to eat?

499
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,720
Anything is fine.

500
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,190
How about we eat fried chicken?

501
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,830
Don't you like fried chicken the most?

502
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,110
Sure. You make the call.

503
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,390
I'll get going.

504
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,560
Master.

505
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,800
Chai Xiaoqi is performing
as expected today.

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,800
Why are you still not happy?

507
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm not unhappy.

508
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,630
I...

509
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,390
I just didn't expect

510
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,590
how Xiaoqi's personality

511
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,240
had changed so much
since the formatting.

512
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,320
The loss of certain emotions

513
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,350
does lead to a change in personality.

514
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,240
This is normal.

515
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,720
You don't have to worry.

516
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,520
Look.

517
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,110
I've been working out.

518
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,390
- Long time no see.
- Catch it.

519
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,080
Why are you here?

520
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,830
Are you okay?

521
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,760
I'm fine.

522
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,830
Shiyi, what's wrong?

523
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,760
I'm fine.

524
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,830
Sit down.

525
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,110
Shiyi.

526
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,040
What's wrong with you?

527
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,760
Tell me.

528
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,520
Shiyi.

529
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,830
Shiyi, what's wrong?

530
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,590
I am back.

531
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,670
I also brought you gifts.

532
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,520
Wait.

533
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,760
I haven't been gone long.

534
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,870
Why are you guys so indifferent to me?

535
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,480
Chai, you've missed a lot of stuff

536
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,830
while you've been away.

537
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,350
Let me do a fast track for you.

538
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,240
You're awake.

539
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,760
Here, slowly.

540
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,870
Do you feel better?

541
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,800
Here, tuck in.

542
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,080
Xiaoqi, what are you doing?

543
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,960
You've used up your energy

544
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
blocking the ball for me.

545
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,190
Your functions are damaged.

546
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,350
Let me treat you.

547
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,560
Don't worry about me.

548
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,350
Just take care of yourself.

549
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,800
Then eat this.

550
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,150
You...

551
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,190
I thought you didn't like candy.

552
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,870
Sugar is really not a necessity

553
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,560
for Cape Townian.

554
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,190
Besides, sweetness is

555
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,080
a very boring taste experience.

556
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
I don't like it,

557
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,720
but you seem to enjoy candy.

558
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,110
If it helps you to recover,

559
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll try to take it.

560
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,040
Thanks.

561
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,190
Master, I have checked.

562
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,670
The Research Department
did set up a security room.

563
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,560
I need some time to break
through the network firewall.

564
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,590
I am familiar with Future Group.

565
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,830
Why don't I go and get it myself?

566
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,830
I think

567
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
we should wait until Candy destroys...

568
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,760
Drink some water.

569
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,960
Slowly.

570
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,080
What's wrong with your body?

571
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,390
Why are you so weak?

572
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,760
This is your fault.

573
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,830
Candy.

574
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,040
Stop it.

575
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,240
Notify the company that
I have to take a few days off.

576
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,720
Yes, master.

577
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,350
I knew there was something
wrong with Jiang Shiyi.

578
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,110
I've always resented him.

579
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,760
When kidnapping didn't work,

580
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,390
he resorted to brainwashing.

581
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,960
Still, Xiaoqi is unbelievable.

582
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
How could she just forget it?

583
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,520
Xiaoqi will be here soon.

584
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,870
Try and talk to her.

585
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,240
Maybe she'll be back to normal.

586
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,350
Candy.

587
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,760
Yes.

588
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,560
What did you mean

589
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
when you said that Shiyi is weak

590
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,110
because of me?

591
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,870
I only listen to master.

592
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,560
He doesn't permit me to tell you.

593
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,630
If I don't know what happened to Shiyi,

594
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,190
I won't be able to take care of him.

595
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,190
You don't want his health

596
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,390
to deteriorate, do you?

597
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,760
All right.

598
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,240
Chai Xiaoqi.

599
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,000
The first time you were
compelled on Earth,

600
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,830
you should have been punished
severely and exiled from the universe.

601
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,350
It was master who pleaded for you.

602
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,630
I am willing to vouch for Xiaoqi

603
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,760
as a candidate for Chief.

604
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,190
The elders agreed to let you
go on a mission to Earth

605
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,760
to make up for your mistakes.

606
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,480
Yet, when you came back here,

607
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,910
you were bewitched by Fang Leng again.

608
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,560
My master concealed it from the chief

609
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,560
to protect you.

610
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,240
We should send a competent person

611
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:46,830
to monitor

612
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,800
Jilisikaqiusuolakalaka No. Seven.

613
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,150
We protect her

614
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,910
and assist her

615
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,960
with her mission in secret.

616
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,350
He also came to Earth
to help you with your mission.

617
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,630
He has been

618
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,350
watching over you
since he came to Earth.

619
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,800
He helped you punish Nana at the party.

620
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,910
He helped you with
your contract at work.

621
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
Later, when you became homesick,

622
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,390
he even wanted to

623
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,910
give up his position
as the chief's successor

624
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,000
and take you home

625
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,630
even if the mission failed.

626
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,560
He could have taken you

627
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,670
back with him when he got the hormones,

628
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,760
but he was worried that
you might still be punished

629
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,520
for having feelings for Earthlings.

630
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,320
If

631
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,110
I have the same smell as him,

632
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,720
Xiaoqi will go home with us,

633
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,320
won't she?

634
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,560
In order to wake you up

635
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
and make you realise

636
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,870
that you are only under
the influence of hormones,

637
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,830
he

638
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,280
absorbed the hormones.

639
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,670
He suffers alone from the immense pain

640
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,150
caused to his body by hormones.

641
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Did you say that Shiyi
absorbed hormones?

642
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,190
Yes.

643
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,960
Why do you think he is so weak?

644
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,720
He did it all

645
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,230
for you.

646
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,440
Xiaoqi, when are you coming over?

647
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,790
I'm waiting for you
at the milk tea shop.

648
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,480
Some other time.

649
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,270
Shiyi is sick now.
I need to look after him.

650
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,920
So when are you free?

651
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,560
Bye.

652
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,920
Xiaoqi never failed to show up before.

653
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,520
Sick?

654
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,000
Brother, why don't you
pretend to be sick?

655
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Pretend to be terminally ill

656
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,480
and unable to take care of yourself.

657
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,790
Then I go to Xiaoqi

658
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,790
and say that my brother's
greatest wish before he dies

659
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,190
is to see her for the last time

660
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
and be with her.

661
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,040
It's useless.

662
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,150
Xiaoqi will never go soft.

663
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,270
I have an idea.

664
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,750
Isn't it all very simple?

665
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,840
We've all been through it before.

666
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
Chai, what do you mean?

667
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Mr. Fang.

668
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,960
Don't you think your current situation

669
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,110
with Xiaoqi is a lot like

670
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,560
when you two first met?

671
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,880
It's just a role swap.

672
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,790
You can use the same method
that Seven used to approach you

673
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,560
to win her back.

674
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,190
Be brazen. Stalk her

675
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,150
and never give up.

676
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,630
I'm sure you will

677
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,670
win her heart back.

678
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,190
I'm so clever.

679
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,480
You're awake.

680
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,670
Do you feel a lot better?

681
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,150
Have you been with me all night?

682
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,040
I feel like

683
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,920
there's nothing much I can do to help.

684
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,750
So I use my powers

685
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,520
to ease your pain.

686
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,920
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

687
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Do you want some water?

688
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,480
Good morning, master.

689
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,190
I don't know what you like to eat.

690
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,270
So I bought some of everything.

691
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,710
He is an advanced creature in Cape Town

692
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,230
and only need regular
replenishment of energy to survive.

693
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
Earth's lowly food

694
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,790
will only accelerate energy consumption.

695
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,840
He is very weak now.

696
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,630
You shouldn't feed him these things.

697
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,880
Sorry, I...

698
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,630
It's okay.

699
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,840
Eating this much

700
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,310
won't affect my recovery.

701
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,960
Join me.

702
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,400
Thanks.

703
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,630
Which would you like to eat?

704
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,840
What do you like to eat?

705
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,230
Small wontons.

706
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,880
Okay.

707
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,710
Thank you.

708
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,710
Thank you.

709
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,020
(Explore Unknown World)

710
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,920
Earthlings know so little

711
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,310
about us aliens.

712
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,840
They think

713
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
we look like this.

714
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
Ridiculous.

715
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,230
With their current level of technology,

716
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,630
it will be at least half a century

717
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,230
before the Earthlings
can detect our planet.

718
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,790
Are you indicating
that Earthlings are stupid?

719
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Don't you agree?

720
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,670
But how did stupid Earthlings

721
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,520
manage to invent

722
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,080
so many good foods?

723
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,270
Foods like the ones we eat on our planet

724
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,040
are all interstellar imports.

725
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,790
Then

726
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,400
do you have a particular Earth food

727
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,270
that you like to eat?

728
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,190
When we get home,

729
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,670
I can reproduce it with technology.

730
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,270
I don't seem to have
a particular favourite one.

731
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,480
By the way, don't you like candy?

732
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,520
When we get back,

733
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,630
let's replicate it.

734
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,230
Sounds good.

735
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,440
There's only one left.

736
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,710
I'll go out and buy some.

737
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,900
(Trailer is here)

738
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,440
(Trailer)
Are you sure you and Jiang Shiyi

739
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,790
(Trailer)
can't break the genetic match?

740
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,480
(Trailer)
Are you still bothered about it?

741
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,790
(Trailer)

742
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,630
(Trailer)
Your Cape Town planet is so backward thinking.

743
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,400
Are you looking down on aliens?

744
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,560
I just don't want my girlfriend

745
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,750
to be 99% compatible with someone else.

746
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,310
Can you really bear to see her

747
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,310
die on earth for you?

748
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
It's almost time, Fang Leng.

749
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,590
You will

750
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,000
never see Xiaoqi again.

751
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,000
Do you regret it?

752
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,590
It doesn't matter how I feel.

753
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,150
What matters is that

754
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,440
I want Xiaoqi to live happily.

755
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,190
A glimpse at the wedding.

756
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,230
He pursues.

757
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
She runs away.

758
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,480
Eventually, she falls into his arms.

759
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:16,670
Kiss!
