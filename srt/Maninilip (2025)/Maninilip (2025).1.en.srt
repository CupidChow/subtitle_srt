1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,055
Oh my god! Oh shit!

2
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:19,708
- They'll hear us next door.
- Oh shit...

3
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:24,312
Oh, shit! Oh!

4
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,590
Oh, shit! Oh god!

5
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,018
Oh, shit!

6
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,443
Oh, shit!

7
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,296
Shhh!

8
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:48,168
They'll hear us next door!

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,399
Shit!

10
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,982
Oh, shit! Yes!

11
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,160
Shit! Yes!

12
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,076
Oh, shit!

13
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,490
Oh yes! Oh, shit!

14
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,761
Yes!

15
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,963
Oh, shit!

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,970
Oh, fu-

17
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,938
You're too loud.
They can hear us next door.

18
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,247
Hey!

19
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:53,847
Oh yes! Oh, shit!

20
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,179
Oh, shit!

21
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:10,364
Shit!

22
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,066
Yes!

23
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,950
Here, you might forget this.

24
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,100
Wow, I look so good here.

25
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,473
Thanks.

26
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,406
I'll go ahead.

27
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,642
Bopis...

28
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:03,042
Miss, I'll order
two eggplant omelets,

29
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,848
and squid, and rice.

30
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,273
- Oh, and please add ketchup too.
- Sure.

31
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,580
- I got this.
- Okay.

32
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:14,292
- Just grab the ketchup inside.
- Alright.

33
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,834
Two of these?

34
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,158
Yes.

35
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,986
Martha! Martha!

36
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,424
Did you iron this?

37
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:39,969
There's a hole!

38
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,711
Sorry, someone came to buy earlier,
so I forgot.

39
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,245
Dammit. You can't even iron it right!

40
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,108
Even cooking, you leave to your cooks.

41
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,109
By the way, where's the razor
I asked you to buy at the market?

42
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:02,850
Sorry...

43
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,464
I also forgot.

44
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,824
You can't do anything right.

45
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,287
You're useless around the house.

46
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,348
You can't even be told what to do.

47
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:17,941
You're only good in bed.

48
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,676
- Berto, come on.
- It's true.

49
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:26,021
If you weren't good in bed,
I would've kicked you out long ago.

50
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,005
- This is all you're good for.
- Stop it!

51
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,106
Joy.

52
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,271
Hey! Are you the new guy
who moved in across the street?

53
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,296
Damn! You hooked up
again earlier, didn't you?

54
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,309
You two are so loud!

55
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:58,034
Next time, cover your girl's mouth, okay?

56
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,677
Yes, boss.

57
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,941
Be careful with Berto, bro.

58
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:16,028
That guy's full of himself.

59
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:20,163
He's got strong connections,
he used to be a cop.

60
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:23,122
He got fired
because he's an idiot.

61
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:24,944
He doesn't care who he hurts.

62
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Thanks, man.

63
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:38,339
I've got to go.

64
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:44,012
Um, can I use your bathroom?

65
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,678
Oh, I don't think it's clean...

66
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,754
Stay here, I'll be quick.

67
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,648
That asshole... he's a monster.

68
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,907
Maybe we should stop this,
we might get caught.

69
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,500
He's not that smart, you know.

70
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,505
And we've done this so many times,
he hasn't caught us, right?

71
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:24,706
If this drags on,
we might end up getting shot.

72
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,214
Don't think about what he might do yet.

73
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,057
Just shoot on me first.

74
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,471
That son of a bitch...

75
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,216
He'll get what's coming to him.

76
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,863
Why are you the one doing that again?
Where's Joy?

77
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:16,304
Didn't I tell you yesterday?
She already asked to leave.

78
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:18,624
The new one's arriving tomorrow.

79
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,127
Aren't you gonna
stop acting like that?

80
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,246
I'm getting scared, you know.

81
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:35,787
You're really dumb, huh?

82
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,141
How would anyone find out if
you just keep your mouth shut?

83
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:46,080
If they get wind of this,
it won't just be you who gets caught.

84
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,507
I'll go down with you...
me and my business.

85
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:52,460
This is all I've got left.
Have some mercy.

86
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,473
You really are an idiot.

87
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,434
How would I get caught?
I've got powerful connections.

88
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,866
You talk too much.

89
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,305
There— you're well taken care of.

90
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,509
Uh... I'd like to order.

91
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,701
What is it?

92
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,054
Uh...

93
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,311
- Two eggplant omelets—
- What?

94
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,643
Two eggplant omelets,

95
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,424
and sinigang, and rice.

96
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,760
Alright, I'll bring it to your table.

97
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,296
Thank you.

98
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:25,662
Here you go.

99
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,319
Thank you.

100
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,830
What's your order?

101
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,034
Looks good, huh?

102
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:50,498
Huh?

103
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,062
Is the soup good?

104
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,962
Ah...

105
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,915
I haven't tried it yet.

106
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,169
But I'm sure it's delicious.

107
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,671
That's Luisa, Joy's replacement.

108
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,706
Anyway, enjoy your food.

109
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,152
Alright...

110
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:39,757
Berto?

111
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,252
That's a lot.

112
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:45,896
Ten million.

113
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,313
Delivery's at the end of the month.

114
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:52,058
It's too hot now, so they dropped it here.

115
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,633
That's a lot!

116
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,770
Well, it's from the big boss.

117
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,770
That's more than enough for us
to start over...

118
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,328
to run away and change our lives.

119
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,384
Wait, wait. Are you insane?

120
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:12,101
They don't know you.

121
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,025
But me? They know me very well.

122
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:18,868
No matter where I hide,
they'll find me.

123
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,906
We'll hide really well.

124
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,224
Your screws are loose.

125
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,230
If you want to die,

126
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:30,613
go ahead and do it alone.

127
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:32,243
Idiot!

128
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,510
- So, eight total, right?
- Yes.

129
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:50,712
Here you go.

130
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,662
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

131
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,315
Let me help you.

132
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:03,923
Uh... I'm Alex.

133
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,504
The one at the eatery.

134
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,852
- Ah...
- I bought food from you yesterday.

135
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:12,001
Ah, right. Thanks.

136
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:13,147
I'm Luisa.

137
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,392
Heading home?

138
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,719
I have a motorcycle,
but it's in the shop.

139
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:25,434
If you want, we can ride the tricycle
together, I can help carry your things.

140
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,696
Sure.

141
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:33,914
Ah...

142
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:38,419
I just moved here too,
from Romblon.

143
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,589
How about you, where are you from?

144
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,281
Far…

145
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,693
All the way from Aparri.

146
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:49,387
That's really far.
Why'd you come here?

147
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,273
I'm working on my papers
so I can go to Dubai.

148
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,965
Dubai? Hey, if you ever need a photo...

149
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:02,168
for your passport or ID—just tell me.

150
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,292
Huh? Why?

151
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:09,068
Oh… I forgot to say,
I'm actually a photographer.

152
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,702
I've got a small studio in my apartment.

153
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,593
So if you ever need pictures,
just let me know. It's on me.

154
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:22,371
Hey, that's too much.
We just met.

155
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:23,845
It's nothing.

156
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,380
I'm a regular at your eatery anyway.

157
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,467
When I buy food from you,
just give me extra servings.

158
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,215
Sure.

159
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,851
This way.

160
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,189
This is our stop, sir.

161
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:01,511
Alright, thanks. I can carry it from here.

162
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,456
Uh... Alright then.

163
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:06,724
Sir.

164
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,018
Ma'am.

165
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,008
That's enough.

166
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:31,706
What the hell!

167
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,430
Why are you resisting?

168
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:37,449
You're used to this—guys
doing that to you at the club.

169
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:41,548
That's exactly why I went with you—
because I wanted to leave that behind.

170
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:46,201
I don't want to be disrespected anymore,
and now you're doing the same?

171
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:49,109
- If I had known, I would've...
- Would've what?

172
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,751
Would've what?

173
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,782
Stop it!

174
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,737
That's enough.

175
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,300
Listen, here...

176
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:03,761
I'm the only one who gets to
disrespect you. No other guy.

177
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,358
You want me to send you back there?

178
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,310
Back to whoring? Huh?

179
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,756
I'm doing everything
for you, and besides...

180
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,892
you have nowhere else to go.

181
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:22,817
Here...

182
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,609
you're protected,

183
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,323
and you have money.

184
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:30,552
Right?

185
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,970
Thanks.

186
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:20,728
Have you been a photographer long?

187
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:23,172
Ah… kind of.

188
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:26,562
Back in college, I used to do side gigs
back home in Romblon.

189
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,969
And I'd often assist my uncle.

190
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:32,761
So when I graduated,

191
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,453
I came straight here.

192
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,830
Took a chance. They say,

193
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:42,471
you can earn a lot as a shooter here.

194
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:44,197
A what?

195
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:47,816
Shooter. Uh...

196
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,589
It's a Visayan term for photographer.

197
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:55,971
Oh, so that's what that means.

198
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:59,923
- Though the word sounds kind of—
- Hey.

199
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,836
You're here to work, not to flirt.

200
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,045
Sorry.

201
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:17,460
You're slick, huh?
What's your deal?

202
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,422
You're making moves, aren't you?

203
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,914
No, sir. Nothing like that.

204
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,174
Want to compete?

205
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:31,806
Watch your back, kid.

206
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:46,112
So you are slick.

207
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:49,941
That guy's packing heat.
We've got nothing on him.

208
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,484
Heading out?

209
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:04,582
Just off to the market.

210
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,353
I'll drop you off.

211
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Thank you.

212
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,296
Hold on tight.

213
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:27,714
Why do you even want to go to Dubai?
Isn't it crazy hot there?

214
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,378
I just want to see the tallest building
in the world.

215
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:36,654
That's it?

216
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:39,417
Kidding.

217
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,522
It's easier to get in there,
and the fees aren't that high.

218
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,830
And of course, the pay's pretty good too.

219
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:53,357
You? Ever thought of going abroad?

220
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,797
Photographers probably
make good money out there.

221
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,310
Nah, I'm happy here.

222
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:06,489
Aside from the studio,
I get a few side jobs now and then.

223
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:07,855
So it's enough.

224
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:10,720
You? How's work?

225
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:13,262
It's alright. The pay's small,

226
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,749
but I'm only staying
because of Ma'am Martha.

227
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,942
She's really kind.

228
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,465
Yeah, she is.

229
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:22,333
Her husband, though—total jerk.

230
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:24,527
No kidding.

231
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:34,529
What's that?

232
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:38,508
Nothing. Just wanted
to give you a sample.

233
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,068
Look over here.

234
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,053
And then... smile.

235
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:46,714
There.

236
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:52,373
One more. This angle.

237
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,322
Smile, smile.

238
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:59,859
There. Check this out.

239
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:04,333
See?

240
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:08,008
Wow, you're good.
You actually made me look decent.

241
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,296
Come on. The camera never lies.

242
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,934
And that's unedited.

243
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,307
Once I fix it up, you'll look even better.
Might not even recognize yourself.

244
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,588
Teaser.

245
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:25,420
One more. Look here again.

246
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:27,425
Okay.

247
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,052
Smile.

248
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,932
Wait—battery's dead.

249
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:44,912
It's busted... I really need a new one...

250
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,415
keeps shutting off.

251
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:50,621
Can't afford a replacement yet.

252
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:53,448
But it'll power back up.

253
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,850
You just have to shut it down so it resets.

254
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,882
Kind of like refreshing it.

255
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:04,911
There! All good…

256
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,476
One more. Look this way.

257
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:27,869
Look.

258
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:29,799
Beautiful, right?

259
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,052
Ma'am, do you have change for...

260
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,817
Ma'am, that's a lot of money!

261
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:44,396
- That's not mine. It's your sir's.
- Sir's?

262
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah. Don't tell anyone, alright?

263
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:52,380
Don't say a word.
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

264
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:07,132
Thank you.

265
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,670
Oh!

266
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,812
Berto! Aren't you leaving yet?

267
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:20,027
Yeah, I'm going!
You're such a buzzkill.

268
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:30,356
Luisa, I'm heading out—
just need to pay something first.

269
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:43,155
That bastard!
He'll get what's coming to him!

270
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:47,822
Martha—Martha, wait!
Come on, we need to stop this.

271
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:55,983
Why?

272
00:34:57,914 --> 00:34:58,914
Why?

273
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:01,713
You don't want this anymore?

274
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,384
You're done with me?

275
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:27,445
Is it because someone
younger came along?

276
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:52,502
Wait—seriously, Martha.
We have to end this.

277
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,798
Is it because of Luisa?

278
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,823
What?

279
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:02,457
I'm not that stupid.

280
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,762
Then again, I can't
really blame you.

281
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,215
She's younger,

282
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:11,552
fresher—no strings attached.

283
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Shit!

284
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,379
Does it feel good? Huh?

285
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,611
Go on—give it your all!

286
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:44,775
Don't worry. I'm not the jealous type.

287
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,200
Besides, I don't even like you,

288
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,585
you're just payback.

289
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:30,879
Where's Martha?

290
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:33,174
She just went out
to buy something.

291
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,318
I need you to do something for me.

292
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:21,031
You know, Martha,

293
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,431
Luisa's a good girl.

294
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:26,843
Polite, obedient,

295
00:41:27,594 --> 00:41:28,929
never complains.

296
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,097
Make her regular staff, okay?

297
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,108
Tastes good?

298
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:51,349
I saw you, kid...

299
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,033
You know what happens
to peeping toms like you?

300
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,312
Boom!

301
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,236
I'm just waiting for
the right moment.

302
00:42:18,612 --> 00:42:20,739
Go on, eat up…

303
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,304
Who knows...

304
00:42:22,993 --> 00:42:24,830
that might be your last meal.

305
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,900
Oh, hey Luisa! Come in.

306
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:07,693
What are you doing here?

307
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:12,770
Didn't you say I could come
for a photo for my requirements?

308
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:17,034
I'm all fixed up today.
Are you free now?

309
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:20,954
Absolutely. Perfect timing—
I've got a client later.

310
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,106
I'm just setting up.
Go ahead and sit there.

311
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,816
This won't take long.

312
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,762
There you go.

313
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,750
Okay...

314
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:37,871
One sec.

315
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,720
Not working again...

316
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:51,954
What are you doing?

317
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:55,119
Ah—just letting it cool off.

318
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,569
It acts up sometimes.
The flash stops working.

319
00:44:00,756 --> 00:44:03,717
But I think it's fine now.

320
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Wait...

321
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:10,939
Alright. Good to go.

322
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:16,251
Just checking... Yep, it's working now.

323
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,619
Uh...

324
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:20,892
Uh...

325
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:23,413
Wait, because...

326
00:44:23,824 --> 00:44:27,202
We need to be neat
for this kind of thing.

327
00:44:40,121 --> 00:44:41,829
Look at the camera. Straight ahead.

328
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,641
Alright...

329
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:46,870
Chin up a bit.

330
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:53,174
One more.

331
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,237
Just relax. Take it easy.

332
00:44:57,105 --> 00:45:00,067
Smile, then look straight at the camera.

333
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,615
One, two, three.

334
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,617
Last one—same thing,

335
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:10,485
maybe... if you can relax,
just a little more...

336
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:14,218
Smile.

337
00:45:17,892 --> 00:45:19,012
There we go...

338
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:20,876
Here.

339
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,077
Take a look.

340
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:25,289
You look beautiful there.

341
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:29,825
See? Look here.

342
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:32,743
You seem a little stiff,

343
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,066
but when you compare it
to the one where you were relaxed...

344
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,459
Your smile is beautiful.

345
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:37,673
Very natural.

346
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,457
Are you okay?

347
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:57,181
Yeah, I'm good.
I'll just pick it up once it's printed.

348
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,708
I can see it in your eyes.

349
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:02,274
Luisa, the camera doesn't lie.

350
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,433
Luisa, I saw you.

351
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,662
I saw what happened.

352
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:11,476
I know what he did to you.

353
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,377
I'm sorry, Luisa.

354
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,307
I didn't do anything
because I was too scared.

355
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,952
I'm sorry...

356
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,492
I hope you can forgive me.

357
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:39,061
I didn't know what to do.

358
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:45,286
I tried to go in earlier. I tried...

359
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,162
to help.

360
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,916
But I felt like I couldn't risk my life.

361
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:00,339
Help me.

362
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,259
Luisa, how can I help you?

363
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:08,416
We can't report him to the police.
His friends are the cops.

364
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:13,391
Big syndicates are behind him—
he's backed into a corner.

365
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:17,098
- Just help me.
- How...

366
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:20,824
Help me, I'll make it up to you.

367
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:14,375
You're still here, Martha?
I was about to close up.

368
00:53:17,048 --> 00:53:18,090
I'll do it.

369
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:21,622
That's enough, Martha.
You've had enough.

370
00:53:23,943 --> 00:53:25,028
Want some?

371
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:27,307
Come, sit here.

372
00:53:28,258 --> 00:53:32,195
Let's hang out while my husband's out.
He might not be back until tomorrow.

373
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:44,586
How's the thing you're working on?

374
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,836
It's slow. There's no budget.

375
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:51,896
The placement fee is huge.

376
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:55,080
You can do it. You're hardworking.

377
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:02,899
- Do you really love your husband?
- Huh?

378
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:09,878
To endure everything,

379
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:13,192
you must really love him.

380
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,527
What are you saying?

381
00:54:16,348 --> 00:54:18,642
I know what your husband's doing to you.

382
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:22,437
I also know what my
husband's doing to you.

383
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:35,512
But,

384
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,332
why can't you leave him?

385
00:54:40,734 --> 00:54:42,942
I've been in bars
since I was a kid.

386
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,668
I'm tired of it.

387
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,080
Berto's the reason I was able to leave.

388
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:51,302
He even gave me a business.

389
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,318
So you're just enduring everything?

390
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:07,475
And you? Why haven't you left yet?

391
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:10,984
- You're scared, aren't you?
- To be honest... I'm not.

392
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:17,120
No, it's just that maybe he might
share some money with me.

393
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,291
You're crazy. It's not his,
he's just keeping it.

394
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:26,248
If he does give me some, even half,

395
00:55:26,893 --> 00:55:28,278
I won't go to Dubai.

396
00:55:30,017 --> 00:55:31,394
I'll just go home.

397
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,315
Wanna come with me?

398
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:40,737
You're probably more drunk than I am.

399
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:49,752
Does that hurt?

400
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:55,463
This? It feels like an ant bite.

401
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:59,256
A big ant—like the size of a dog.

402
00:56:08,572 --> 00:56:10,783
Oh, you're still not used to it?

403
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:13,408
We've been sharing things for a long time.

404
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,358
If it's you, Martha,
WI can't turn you down.

405
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:15,773
Berto, what the hell!

406
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:20,189
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

407
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:25,833
I didn't mean it!

408
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,321
Stop!

409
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:32,038
Where are you going?

410
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:39,522
I'll make sure your brain's splattered
before you leave.

411
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,694
Tomorrow's headline:

412
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:48,237
‘Police kill two thieves,

413
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:49,680
partners in crime.'.

414
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,243
You guys are too serious...

415
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,564
You,

416
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:06,484
you slapped me, huh?

417
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,195
Huh?

418
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:12,490
And you!

419
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:16,077
You're joining in, huh?

420
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,290
If you want to join, fine.

421
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:26,163
I have an idea,

422
00:59:29,423 --> 00:59:30,799
let's play a game...

423
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:37,974
Let's play!

424
00:59:45,241 --> 00:59:46,494
You better do well.

425
01:02:05,028 --> 01:02:06,074
Kiss each other.

426
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,302
– Let me help you.
– I got this.

427
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:09,975
Ugh. If you really did,
you wouldn't still be here.

428
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:13,874
Easy for you to say.
You have somewhere to go.

429
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:15,495
A place to come home to.

430
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:17,696
Me? None.

431
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:22,263
What if I tell you that's not true?

432
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:37,489
If you can't handle it anymore, say so.

433
01:03:37,587 --> 01:03:40,192
I may look weak...
but I'm stronger than I seem.

434
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,834
You're such a stupid woman!

435
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,536
You don't use your damn brain!

436
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:58,577
You're so dumb!
Why won't you use it?

437
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:00,810
Stop it—I'm getting hurt!

438
01:04:01,092 --> 01:04:04,089
Shut up! Stop being so stupid!

439
01:04:04,532 --> 01:04:07,302
You're useless in my life.
Just bad luck!

440
01:04:07,327 --> 01:04:09,982
- Please, that's enough!
- I'm only putting up with you!

441
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:13,266
- Stop!
- Why are you so stupid?

442
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,335
- Stop!
- You're a pest!

443
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:19,881
- You're hurting me!
- You're worthless! I can't count on you!

444
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,882
It's like this every day!

445
01:04:27,347 --> 01:04:29,974
- You're so stupid!
- Stop...

446
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,630
Stop what—

447
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,910
Are you ready with our plans?

448
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:42,891
Thank you!

449
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:33,738
– Did Martha leave?
– Yes.

450
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:39,228
Then what are you waiting for? Let's go.

451
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,165
Hey! Get out–

452
01:07:57,594 --> 01:08:01,341
Sir... Can I have a look?

453
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:08,240
Berto!

454
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,960
Sir!

455
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,694
Sir, wait, wait... Luisa...

456
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:36,137
I'll catch up.
I'll bring these photos.

457
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:40,641
Thanks. Thank you so much.

458
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,158
Let's go.

459
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,606
Move along. Go home now, it's over.

460
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:53,035
All right, clear the way.

461
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:21,104
Thank you.

462
01:09:28,897 --> 01:09:30,030
Please wait.

463
01:09:35,773 --> 01:09:36,899
What's your order?

464
01:09:38,324 --> 01:09:41,960
Uh... omelet, sinigang, and rice.

465
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,643
Where's Luisa, Martha?

466
01:09:51,426 --> 01:09:52,594
Luisa?

467
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:58,296
Well, after she was cleared,
she just suddenly left.

468
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,457
I think she went home to Aparri.

469
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:06,428
And you? How are you?

470
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:09,789
I'm okay...

471
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,077
I'm doing okay now.

472
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:23,558
Wait, I need to get something.

473
01:10:35,926 --> 01:10:39,137
Here. Luisa wanted you to have this.

474
01:10:39,915 --> 01:10:41,675
She said it's her way
of making it up to you.

475
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,866
Have a seat.
I'll bring your order to you.

476
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:53,970
What is it?

477
01:10:54,028 --> 01:10:55,874
- Bopis.
- Bopis... Okay.

478
01:10:55,927 --> 01:10:57,727
Okay, I'll bring it to you.

479
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,943
Okay.

480
01:11:13,546 --> 01:11:16,506
The camera doesn't lie.

481
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:30,214
Hello, boss?

482
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:31,342
Negative.

483
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:34,038
The house is already for rent,
nobody's here.

484
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:47,856
So? There's nobody home?

485
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:50,882
They're gone, boss.

486
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:52,518
Don't worry, we'll look for them.

487
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,619
Okay.

488
01:12:55,595 --> 01:12:56,595
Yes, boss.

489
01:12:56,814 --> 01:12:59,024
- Hey!
- Yes, sir?

490
01:13:01,336 --> 01:13:03,046
When did the people living here leave?

491
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:05,982
Oh, I'm not sure, boss.

492
01:13:08,246 --> 01:13:09,789
Do you know where they went?

493
01:13:10,694 --> 01:13:13,717
No idea. But...

494
01:13:14,165 --> 01:13:17,626
What I know is...
the woman's from Jolo.

495
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:21,002
- Why are you asking?
- Oh, nothing.

496
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:23,232
We were just hoping
to order some food.

497
01:13:23,658 --> 01:13:24,658
Ah.

498
01:13:25,509 --> 01:13:26,510
All right, then.

499
01:14:41,623 --> 01:14:45,292
- You took forever.
- Great things come to those who wait.

500
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:16,954
Here.

501
01:15:18,206 --> 01:15:19,613
If it's you, Martha...

502
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:22,708
I can never say no.

503
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:38,801
If you can't take it
anymore, say so.

504
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,302
I may look weak,
but I can handle it.
