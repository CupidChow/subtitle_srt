00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Music

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Music

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's the point of bleeding?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's just blood.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But my powerful witch summoned the Great God!

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Enough! Don't summon them again!

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hmph! You! Come out!

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey! You're so weird when you summon them!

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There are so many witches here and there.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are you unable to summon new ones?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Unable?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The god of the South Plateau has taken over the Ji Sheng.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Come out!

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Xuan Pu!

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
De Ling!

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I told you not to summon the beauties,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but you didn't have to summon the old lady!

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Take off the salt stone on the fruit!

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Listen to my summon! Come out!

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Xu Chang Shi!

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Summon!

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's the problem now?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I said this is also a competition!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you see that?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can summon him too!

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So what?

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You think my old lady is more powerful?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which eye are you looking at?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My old man has already suppressed your old lady!

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You bastard!

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It seems that it's not going to work if you don't use your real power!

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Deep in the South Plateau, the secret end of the ancient road!

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Deep in the South Plateau, the secret end of the ancient road!

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They're saying the same spell in Song Chang.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Hell-slaying Spell.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Hell-slaying Spell can transfer the power of the One Sword.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If it fails, the power is enough to wipe out everything in the world.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then...

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If they use it together...

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Both of them will die.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The spell recorded on the back door!

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come to my side!

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Become my sword!

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Become my flag!

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No...

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No...

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No!

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Stop!

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stop fighting!

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you doing, little flower?

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop fighting!

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You bastard!

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Bastard!

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Spell!

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Destroy the Hell!

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Hell-slaying Spell

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you crazy?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You suddenly rushed over and wanted to die!

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I shouldn't have come!

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I should have let your brother blow you up!

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do you know how disgusting it is to abandon a child?

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is his home!

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I left him at home!

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's wrong with that?

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're being unreasonable!

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who cares?

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What you said is not worth mentioning.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I won't hate him for such a small thing.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But...

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Such a small thing.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Shut up!

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You mean...

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You don't care that he abandoned you.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then why did you...

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you done?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to keep fighting!

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shut up!

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What he did...

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
is more disgusting than this!

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What else did he do?

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The day we met...

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The day the sea of the sky was so blue...

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was young and was about to pick up some poisonous mushrooms

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and give them to the old ladies next door.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Suddenly, I saw...

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kill them!

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The steam of the black snake and the dragon

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,620
took me to the

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,000
Lost World.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There,

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
they killed the demons of the three realms.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I...

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
hid behind the bodies of the demons

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and waited for them to finish the battle.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go home.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then I went to the Demon Lord

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and asked him to take me home.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But where is he?

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I see.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're the one who killed the demons.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I see.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You came here from the three realms.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll take you home now.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I just wanted to go home.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Your...

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your home...

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My home is in the sea of the sky!

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So the demon said he would take you to the three realms

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
because he thought this was your home!

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, Zhang Zheng Shu Jie!

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:01,060
He did it for the sake of the

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can tell you!

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But Zheng Zheng Shu Jie has never come back!

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So you tried to open the three-dimensional passage

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
not to invade my three realms?

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I just wanted to go home.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I see.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Go home!

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You killed the demons!

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're the one who killed the demons!

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Then I'll take you home now!

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now...

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go home?

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Even if you say that, I won't forgive you!

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So open the passage now!

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not looking forward to it!

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He agreed.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can you handle your current power?

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just call me when the passage is open.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go, go!

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Chun Hua, come here.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Lady, I'm leaving.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But...

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't belong here.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm just a passer-by who borrowed the tree.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll leave everything in the three realms to you.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You will be the queen of this place from now on.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Take good care of this place.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You must do better than me.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because this is your home.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The door is open!

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's go!

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're too loyal to the rules.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't know how to change.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have to change this.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You have to learn to smile when you meet again.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I...

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
command you.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She's still here!

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Dongfang, you're here again!

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What?

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you want to take that thing back?

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, Demon, what the hell is she talking about?

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The time you sent me to the Three Realms,

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
was it really your first time there?

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's strange.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are many legends about you in the Three Realms.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Even in the deepest part,

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
there are your statues.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Just legends.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's go, let's go.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Go?

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're leaving again?

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You'll come back.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You'll come back to beg me!

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You'll come back, Dongfang!

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No one came at all.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Will the spell really work?

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What you've been through won't be wrong.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Maybe...

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The power?

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Isn't there no one on the island?

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why is there such a huge power?

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's the Space Spell.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Someone's here.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The door can only be reached here.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's the Demon Lord.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What does it mean?

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Someone will come to say their favorite words.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Lord Wang Meng taught me that.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sea...

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Light...

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The tree has fallen.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Finally...

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I see light again.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You've been in the Three Realms for so long.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You've worked so hard.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The Three Realms?

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This guy is...

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You have no power.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You were a dead man in the past.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How can you take revenge for your life?

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't worry.

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's figure out why the Demon Lord

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
is with the Three Realms.

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The sea water is so cold.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you feeling better?

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I feel like I'm dreaming

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
when I see the real world.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I won't forgive you so easily.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're a weak old man.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Watch your words.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's what they say in books.

220
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He...

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He just called me old man.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, it's gossip.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The biggest gossip in the Three Realms.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Demon Lord has a daughter in the Three Realms?

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What is gossip?

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The future is full of questions about unknown things.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They call the surprising news gossip.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The future is so amazing.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come on.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's attack the Sea of Cangyan.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now?

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You just hit me.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You want to hit me again?

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Can you eat?

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't eat.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're talking nonsense while bleeding.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm telling you.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't beat anyone in the Sea of Cangyan.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He can't?

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's just a fight in the Sea of Cangyan.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's nothing.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But why do you fight in the Sea of Cangyan?

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because...

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's what I should say.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Get them!

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, get them!

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Kill them!

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You...

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Fine.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What else can I say?

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's go.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Come on out, gossip.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Follow me.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I, Long Hua.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Coming.

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I used this when I was at the Sky Tower.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey, big wood.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't need to use your hands.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't want to use them.

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm so weak.

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We're going to fight in the Sea of Cangyan.

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're going too?

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Where is he going?

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Where am I going?

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But...

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're so weak.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He'll protect me if you go.

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I see.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Black Eye.

272
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No way.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll kill you.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The Sea of Cangyan.

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They...

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They just left like that?

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's okay.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They brought out a Shadow Three-Dimension from that space gate.

279
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know what that means?

280
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That gate is the way to the Shadow Three-Dimension.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We have no power.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So what?

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is a new style.

284
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, big wood.

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I think we should take a break.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Your body...

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It doesn't matter.

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't be so anxious.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But...

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're bleeding.

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Blood will stop eventually.

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It stopped!

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't see it!

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't worry.

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's fine.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why are you so sure?

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
According to the ancient books,

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
a creature like Dad can't be killed.

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Did you imagine Dad as something strange?

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How far do you think we can fly?

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Big wood.

302
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey!

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh my god!

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The Shadow Six-Eye and White Eye are dead!

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The sky is far away.

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's a long way.

307
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But it's okay to move to the Nine-Eye.

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Big wood!

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I finally found you!

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I wasn't hurt.

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But over there...

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What happened?

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Lord Mo Xi!

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He was negotiating with Wang Wang.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They were chatting in Songbai Peak.

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Suddenly, they were...

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They were like this.

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And then...

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They disappeared.

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Time and space spell.

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How did you know?

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I didn't say anything.

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lord Mo Xi's power is incomparable.

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Wang Wang has to attack.

325
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He can only attack with his time and space spell.

326
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I...

327
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I was looking for you.

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I wanted you to use your heavenly eyes to find me.

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How is Songbai Peak now?

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't jump around and talk.

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm tired.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Here's the thing.

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Just now,

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Songbai Peak was so loud.

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Then, the sky was full of fire.

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm telling you,

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it's been a long time since that happened.

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you know?

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The whole Water Cloud Sky was shocked.

340
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All the nearby immortals rushed to save people.

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But suddenly,

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
there were several spirits of the Clouds on the top of Songbai Peak.

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The fire of the day is burning.

344
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The light of the day is spreading across the sky.

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The stars are falling.

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The wind is blowing in the clouds.

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The dead are the only ones who can't come.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The phantom is coming.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The phantom is coming.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The Four-Spirit Realm.

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It seems Wang Wang has prepared for it.

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They summoned a huge seal.

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The entire Songbai Peak has been sealed.

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No one knows what happened inside.

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Because no one can enter.

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wang Wang has taken Lord Mo Xi away.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why should we wait for the seal at Songbai Peak?

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go and see first.

360
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Stop!

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Stop!

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Stop!

363
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Kill him!

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Kill him!

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Kill him!

366
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Kill him!

367
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
The Drops of Thunder,

368
00:15:42,500 --> 00:16:07,380
the

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The magic power is ineffective.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,500
This...

371
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,000
It's the effect of the barrier.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ying Jie, you're here.

373
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,500
This...

374
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
Wu Cheng Sun, why haven't you broken this yet?

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hey, why didn't you tell me about my husband?

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
You can try it yourself if you're capable.

377
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, this thing has no weakness.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you break the barrier, it will be useless.

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,500
What?

380
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You have a way?

381
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
I'll show you.

382
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
The barrier is broken.

383
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
As expected, breaking this barrier can only be done from within.

384
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
But we can't get in.

385
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,000
This...

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,500
I've found the living.

387
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
I won't let you go.

388
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Open.

389
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
As expected, within this barrier,

390
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
you still can't use the Great Formation.

391
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Four people, four pillars,

392
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
and the power of the four sides.

393
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
If you want to destroy this barrier,

394
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
you can only kill four people.

395
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
And...

396
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
as the eye of the eye, you.

397
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
But to kill me,

398
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
you have to rely on physical strength.

399
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I don't know if you're ready.

400
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
The wall of the Luo family in the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the Luo family.

401
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
I didn't expect you to become a ghost of Yun Mengze.

402
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
And...

403
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
You seem to have found the phone

404
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
that you lost in the Sui Mo Yuni River.

405
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Lord Wang Mang worked hard to get me.

406
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm a man of great security.

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
The Qingyuan Army is 72 times more powerful.

408
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But the gun method seems to be less than mine.

409
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
When I was human, I was proud and fearless.

410
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I became a ghost and still didn't change my arrogance.

411
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm going to teach you today.

412
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
The essence of the wall of the Luo family.

413
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Please,

414
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
the young king of Luo City.

415
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You can awaken Yue San.

416
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
The time of three realms collapse.

417
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
The old and the new.

418
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
The three realms are full of trouble.

419
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
The spring and the autumn are cold.

420
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
The time of three realms collapse.

421
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
The time of three realms collapse.

422
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Who will I fight with?

423
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Who will I fight with?

424
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Who will I fight with?

425
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Who will I fight with?

426
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Who will I fight with?

427
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Who will I fight with?

428
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Who will I fight with?

429
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Who will I fight with?

430
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Who will I fight with?

431
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
The wind blows in the future.

432
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
The sky is full of stars.

433
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll stand in the field.
