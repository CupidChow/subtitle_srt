Oh!

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,260
Hi-yah!

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,560
Duh!

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,600
Duh!

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm a master of the cultivation of magic.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm a member of the Jinsha clan.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,760
I wonder when the ancestors

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,520
had the Yang family's gunplay.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,360
I see.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,480
What do you mean?

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
When did you enter Shui Yun Heaven?

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Song Liao Golden Beach,

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
the soul of the Heaven Realm.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,840
Zi Ya Xi Qi's seal,

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,840
that's why I entered Shui Yun Heaven.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
So,

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,680
you don't know about the seal of Shang Zhou?

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
The battle of Shang Zhou

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,480
has nothing to do with Zi Ya's seal.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
You don't know about the Yang family's gunplay,

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,320
the battle of Song Liao.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
It seems that you people

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,680
only have a generation of memories.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
You...

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
What do you mean?

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,120
I don't think

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Lord Qing Yuan will believe any of my words.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
You'll understand

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,040
when Wang Mang returns.

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Where are they now?

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
The time point

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,320
when the three realms collapsed last time.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Wang Mang,

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
you and I have tried our best.

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
We can't stop them.

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,600
No.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the limit.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Our power is nothing but this.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,840
The power wave is too huge.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,920
The three realms will be devoured soon.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
We can't turn back now.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,360
What is this?

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,600
This is the guardian beast of the time line.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's go.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
The power of the soul.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,240
Red Army, please come.

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Weapon,

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
relax.

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Go to the Mystic Beads,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Six Water Formation,

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
Flying Moon,

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,920
and the Star-Compassion.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,600
Break!

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
The weapon in your left eye

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
is the star chain of Red Army.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
The weapon in your body

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,920
is no more important than the star chain.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,760
So,

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,200
that was the truth

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,560
you wanted me to see.

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

77
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,920
How many times did you go to that time point?

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Three times.

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,160
You could return with your body.

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,360
Right eye.

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,600
It's broken.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,320
Come on.

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,920
Tell me how you feel.

84
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,440
It's hard to believe,

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,760
but

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,720
I have to admit

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
that the three realms are just a continuation.

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
We think the beginning of chaos

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,880
is the starting point of this world.

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,800
But before that,

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
there was a world like this.

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
And that world

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
collapsed long ago.

94
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,240
And our world

95
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
will soon be re-entered

96
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,840
and we will have the same fate again.

97
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,280
The point is wrong.

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,680
First,

99
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,800
the world didn't collapse once,

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
but five times.

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,160
Five times?

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

103
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
And every time it collapses,

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,200
it will return to its original place

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
and resume.

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,640
Second,

107
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,600
the five times of collapse

108
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
were caused by the same person.

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
Dongfang Qingtang.

110

优优独播剧场——YoYo Television Series Exclusive

111
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
I mean it,

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,480
how far will it fly?

113
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,760
Wily.

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,480
Hey !

115
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
It's not a big deal.

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Big Boss! Big Boss!

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Is Big Boss really dead?

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh no!

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
How is that possible?

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
He's gonna die!

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Stop pretending to be dead!

122
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Get up!

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
No.

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Didn't you know that he has a curse?

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
He can't use much magic

126
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
or things will happen.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
No wonder he was so weak during the battle.

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
So now he's actually...

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
It's too dangerous!

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,080
He's actually walking towards death.

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,440
Maybe he's already seen his old grandma.

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,480
It's okay.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
Even if he's hit by a curse,

134
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,720
a thing like dad can't die.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,920
What the hell is dad?

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
It's something that we can't die from.

137
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,000
So what is it?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't you read books?

139
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,480
The book says that a thing like dad can't die.

140
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,360
What kind of book are you reading?

141
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
A summer where the crops are planted and the day is gone.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is it good?

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
I'll lend it to you next time!

144
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Thank you!

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
You're welcome!

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
What is that?

147
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,600
He's suddenly made a strange face.

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Just blow him away!

149
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
It seems that he's fine.

150
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,640
But his hair is like being crushed by a nail.

151
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
This is...

152
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,680
Flying Demon Lord.

153
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,600
It's not the time to play the name-binding game, right?

154
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,280
Relax.

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,920
As long as Black Demon Lord is still in the dragon form,

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,120
it means that the power of Flying Demon Lord is still there.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Then...

158
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
What's the situation now?

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,800
His power is gone.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
But as the one who's in the magical circle, I'm still here.

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,960
It means that he's fine.

162
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
The Demon Lord fell!

163
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
What the hell?

164
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Demon Lord!

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
I can't catch you!

166
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Wake up!

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,120
If you fall, you'll fall to your death!

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,160
It's okay.

169
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,480
The sea is below. You won't die from falling.

170
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Sea?

171
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,480
Only the part where we fell is the land!

172
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,240
What kind of strange coincidence is this?

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,440
The three bodies on the bottom are the only ones.

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,920
How could something happen?

175
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
But he's almost out of energy now.

176
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
He's all about the body.

177
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,720
What's the meaning of your head-up-down posture?

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
Do you want to prove something?

179
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,600
And...

180
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,520
Aren't you fainted?

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
That's right.

182
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
You're good at it!

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come on!

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,480
Don't be ridiculous!

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Are you really in the same boat?

186
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,680
Chao Ha!

187
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,320
Chao Ha!

188
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,840
Chao Ha!

189
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Chao Ha!

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,240
Come on!

191
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,800
Come on!

192
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Don't be ridiculous!

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,280
You're really in the same boat!

194
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,800
Come on!

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,400
Come on!

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Come on!

197
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
Chao Ha, come on!

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,120
I told you to stop!

199
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Stop it!

200
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,280
Demon Lord!

201
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,640
Demon Lord, are you okay?

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Demon Lord!

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,560
What are these strange things?

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,080
They don't look so sharp.

205
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,280
They look like the dead gods of the Western Ming Dynasty.

206
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,920
You...

207
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Why are you covering your dad?

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Because he's about to die!

209
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,680
I...

210
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Demon Lord!

211
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
I was born in the Three Realms.

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
How could I die?

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
So, you're fine now?

214
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760
Then...

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
Is your magic power back?

216
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Magic power?

217
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,680
Why did you go back so early?

218
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,040
You're so ridiculous!

219
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Let him go. Let him go.

220
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
After a long fight,

221
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
with the spell you mentioned,

222
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
he should need to rest.

223
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
But...

224
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,920
Don't worry.

225
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
He's the Demon Lord.

226
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
He'll be fine.

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
For now...

228
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
I can only do this.

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,640
The damn Demon Lord.

230
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
He never lets me go.

231
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
He ran out and designed these strange things!

232
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
You're so ridiculous!

233
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
Are you worried about Dad?

234
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
Worried about his power?

235
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Maybe.

236
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,760
He used to be able to use his power to do magic.

237
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,440
But now?

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,280
He's cursed by the people of the Sea of Cangyan.

239
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,880
His magic power is gone.

240
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
But he's still so angry.

241
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,600
He...

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,880
Cangyan people cursed?

243
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
No wonder you went to fight in the Sea of Cangyan.

244
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,240
I don't know who it is yet.

245
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,040
But the Demon Lord...

246
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
What's your relationship with Dad?

247
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,280
No!

248
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
It's not related!

249
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,880
He and I live in the same body!

250
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,320
No!

251
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't get me wrong!

252
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,280
I can see everything when I'm angry!

253
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,800
No!

254
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,760
He's nice to you.

255
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,220
He gave you the

256
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,200
LoL clothes, right?

257
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah.

258
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
The LoL clothes are made by the merchant girl.

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
And the merchant girl

260
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
is a special gift from Dad

261
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
that he has.

262
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
Because her three abilities are very special.

263
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
So...

264
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
The summoning beast

265
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,160
is made by devouring the master's magic power.

266
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,440
The more powerful the summoning beast is,

267
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,080
the more magic power it requires.

268
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,800
The merchant girl is one of them.

269
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
Just now,

270
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
Dad was forced to remove the magic power

271
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,160
from the merchant girl.

272
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,000
Only the LoL clothes on you are left.

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
So I think

274
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,200
he's really nice to you.

275
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,600
He...

276
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Sometimes...

277
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
But...

278
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
But he...

279
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,000
This...

280
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
The clothes are back!

281
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,000
The summoning beast is removed.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,280
That means...

283
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
Where is Dad now?

284
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,920
Just by the beach under the sun.

285
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
I'm so ugly!

286
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Did the devil really die from the smoke?

287
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
Stop it!

288
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,720
You're so annoying!

289
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,520
You can't even think of this!

290
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,400
Water?

291
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
Who?

292
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
The water from the Three-Dimension Pond

293
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
is so old.

294
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,720
How long will he last

295
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
in this state of coma?

296
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
It's hard to say.

297
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
It should take a while.

298
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,080
What are you doing?

299
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,240
I'm hungry!

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
The devil's hair is so hard.

301
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,680
If I tie my hair with a stick,

302
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,880
it'll be dry.

303
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,960
You want food?

304
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
Yes.

305
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Everyone needs it.

306
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
This kind of food?

307
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,160
Let me do it.

308
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
Give it to me.

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Come out!

310
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are you...

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Use your magic to threaten the surroundings.

312
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
This food...

313
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Come on.

314
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Food.

315
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Which one do you want?

316
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
No.

317
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I want...

318
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
I want food.

319
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
You're so picky.

320
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Go back!

321
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,680
You're so strong.

322
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
With you around,

323
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I feel like even if the devil doesn't have magic,

324
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,680
it's okay to go to the Three-Dimension Pond to take revenge.

325
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
It depends on who you take revenge on.

326
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,400
It's hard to deal with someone who can do this to my father.

327
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And this person

328
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
is probably the ruler of the Sea of Cangyan.

329
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
If the Sea of Cangyan can't stop the devil's power,

330
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
who dares to hurt my father?

331
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
You mean...

332
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,400
The devil, the master of the Sea of Cangyan,

333
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
was abandoned by the whole Sea of Cangyan?

334
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I mean...

335
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Our enemy is the whole Sea of Cangyan.

336
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
The whole world.

337
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Wang Meng,

338
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
is there no news yet?

339
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,120
He and Mo Xi should still be in the past.

340
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I hope

341
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,120
after Mo Xi finds out the truth about this world,

342
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
he can make a right decision for Shui Yun Tian.

343
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Isn't that what you're worried about?

344
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Wang Meng,

345
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
he should know

346
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
soon enough

347
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
why you killed Jiu Yuan.

348
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Jiu Yuan is like the Demon Lord.

349
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
He is the key to this world.

350
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
So he can't die.

351
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
And he has to stay with us.

352
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
But according to Wang Meng,

353
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
if Jiu Yuan is alive,

354
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
the Three Realms...

355
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
There's still half a year left

356
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
before the collapse of the Three Realms he predicted.

357
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
But it's only a few days

358
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,840
before the Lord comes to take revenge.

359
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
It's only a few days.

360
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
So...

361
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
he kidnapped Jiu Yuan.

362
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,840
The other two worlds can only fight against the Demon Lord

363
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,840
in the same battle with the Sea of Cangyan.

364
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
The Demon Lord...

365
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
He really knows you did it?

366
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I know I can't hide it from him.

367
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
So I didn't hide it from him

368
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
when I was in the week.

369
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
How's the deployment of the troops?

371
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
All the troops

372
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
are heading to the various borders of the Sea of Cangyan.

373
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
There are only 20,000 troops at the entrance of the past forest.

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Three Great Wilderness Lords are coming.

375
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Hong Tao, Li Hai, and the other three ghost ships

376
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
are stationed around the borders of the Sea of Cangyan.

377
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
The people of the White Chess World

378
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
are all at the border.

379
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Except Hong Tao and Li Hai,

380
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
we'll withdraw the rest of the troops

381
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,840
and all of them will be concentrated at the entrance of the Sea of Cangyan.

382
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Our opponent is the Demon Lord.

383
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,840
He can only attack from the front.

384
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
100,000 Demon Lords!

385
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,840
There are many Demon Generals and Demons.

386
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
How... how do we fight them?

387
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
If Dad recovers his power,

388
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
it won't be a problem.

389
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
But now he can't even beat me.

390
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,840
You're the only one here.

391
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Oh, right.

392
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
He has two good friends,

393
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Kong Que and Shang Que.

394
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I can guarantee that

395
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
they're Dad's enemies now.

396
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Why?

397
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
In the past,

398
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
weren't they close?

399
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,840
They have a great power in the Sea of Cangyan.

400
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,840
If they were as close as they were in the past,

401
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
they would have already found out who killed Dad.

402
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
If you're really going to say it,

403
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,840
they might have cast the spell.

404
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
They?

405
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
In the past,

406
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
did Dad make any friends in the Three Realms?

407
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
It's always good to have a few people to help.

408
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Friends?

409
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,840
The enemies are...

410
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
He...

411
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Maybe he can help?

412
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Although I don't know where he is now,

413
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,840
if he knows we're in trouble,

414
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,840
he'll definitely come to help.

415
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh?

416
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
He's already up?

417
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Why did he wake up so early today?

418
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I don't know.

419
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Suddenly,

420
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I feel restless.

421
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Hey, don't go!

422
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Look at this two-legged horse.

423
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Isn't it as cute as me?

424
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
The owner said that if you sweep it,

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,840
you can get the latest news and special benefits of Cang Lan Jue.

426
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
You can eat it with the melon.

427
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
In the mortal world,

428
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
it's only a few places that can be avoided by the pursuit of water and sky.

429
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
I've known it since I was a child.

430
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
You mean...

431
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,840
That's great! Thank you!

432
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
But even if you find him,

433
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
why would he believe what I said?

434
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
He doesn't know me.

435
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
That's true.

436
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
You mean the poison knife?

437
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
The devil likes the poison knife he gave me!

438
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Should I explain it to him?

439
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
No, I'm afraid of disgusting lies.

440
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Who do I cry with?

441
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,840
The wine is as deep as the peach tree.

442
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,840
The cup is as big as the knife.

443
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I'll give you another one.

444
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I only miss you.

445
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Thousands of light come to find you.

446
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I hug you.

447
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:40,740
I miss you so much that my heart beats like a
