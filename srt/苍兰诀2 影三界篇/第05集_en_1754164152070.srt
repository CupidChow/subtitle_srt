You are looking for Chen Xiang?

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In the mortal world, it's only a few places that can be avoided by the pursuit of water and sky.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I knew it since I was a child.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You mean...

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's great! Thank you!

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But even if you find him, why would he believe what I said?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He doesn't know me.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's true.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I...

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,520
You mean the

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
I...

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Should I explain?

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm afraid of the evil eye.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Actually...

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
After I leave, you must stop dad from going to the Sea of Cangyan.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You must wait for me to meet with you.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you do it?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will kill the devil no matter what!

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Absolutely!

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,520
Devil Lord's

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not angry!

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Take care!

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now I don't even have a speaker.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When will the devil wake up?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, it's troublesome if he wakes up.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But if he doesn't wake up, I will be bored.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Devil Lord?

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He must be attracted by my magic power.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He won't attack the little devil, right?

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Forget it.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's that?

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It hurts!

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What a trouble!

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can guess it.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As long as the little devil is in danger,

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Dad will come out no matter what.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The night has come.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Come out, the devil of the Moon.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You devil!

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Get out!

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You!

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who tied me up on the shelf?

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He... actually...

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The little devil did it.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No matter how much you remember, he did everything.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Really?

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's my best friend.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All my friends call me a honest and cute little bird.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you didn't do anything to me?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He did everything.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But my ability is limited and I can't stop him.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry, little devil.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was forced to do it.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Where is he?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He escaped for the sake of the devil.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is afraid that you will wake up.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He is afraid that he won't.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He is afraid of me?

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In the three realms, who is not afraid of the devil?

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's true.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm really too powerful.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a sacrifice to have no opponent.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm so embarrassed.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But it seems that I'm in trouble.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right, don't care about that little devil.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's go to the vast sea of Cangyan.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, no, no, no, no!

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do you mean?

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's...

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You think I'm not strong enough?

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, you are very strong, but...

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But?

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Everyone knows that you are powerful.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The rest...

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For example?

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Swordsmanship.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
For example, swordsmanship.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone doesn't know how powerful your swordsmanship is.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Everyone doesn't know how powerful my swordsmanship is.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You keep using summoning.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everyone will misunderstand you.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't you think so?

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Speaking of which,

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
his Shufeng Sword should be taken.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
His?

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then we should...

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Stretch out your hand.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Gu...

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Gu Lan?

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are...

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I've found my power back.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Although the spell is still there, I can't use it easily.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I don't need it to protect myself.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But the demon is the risk of taking the sword.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So you need it.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Demon is...

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Taking the sword?

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You promised not to go to Cangyan Sea first.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I want everyone to know that

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the best swordsmanship in the three realms is not mine.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The most powerful swordsmanship of the demon.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Come out, Black Demon.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Honorable, honorable.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You...

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where were you just now?

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Did you see anything?

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Honorable sister, except for the magic power, I disappeared naturally.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Fortunately, I almost got caught.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Listen to my order.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dragon painting.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Dragon painting.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I said, Black Demon,

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
haven't you recovered your magic power?

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you leaving or not?

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I...

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I said, Black Demon,

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
haven't you recovered your magic power?

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You...

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Protection spell?

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are...

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The demon is in the deep pool.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's faster to go into the water.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But...

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Black Demon,

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
head.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you yelling?

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can't get in with my protection spell.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So,

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
can I say it completely?

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Say it.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Haven't you recovered your magic power?

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why don't you use the sword?

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I did it on purpose.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You know, just now...

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have you already set your IQ on the meat?

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Open the door.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Open it.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Turn around.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I...

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's really convenient to see the door.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But it lacks the scenery along the way.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You are so stubborn.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But this place is the same as before.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And it seems to be night and day.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Brother.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you want some new Dodo?

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I...

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go, go, go.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
One day,

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will destroy all the Dodo.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, yes.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Dodo should have been destroyed long ago.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But did we get the sword back first?

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What if someone stole it?

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The magic is in the magic.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Who else can go except me?

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's the case.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So...

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Shuo Feng was taken away?

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The sword was taken away as soon as it was made.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You dare to let others take the sword?

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Today, all the heroes of the three realms will be killed.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No.

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You took my sword.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My Lord is afraid that Shuo Feng sword will kill people with cold air.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So he came here to take Shuo Feng sword away.

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He has been in the Snow Palace for a long time.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When he was in the Lianyao,

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
he sent a girl to pick him up.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What did you say?

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will take you to take the sword.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will take you to take the sword.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What did you say?

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Can't you hear me?

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I will take you to take the sword.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You are so cruel.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I said I would take you to take your Shuo Feng.

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You are the one who is cruel.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your strategy is reliable.

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are crazy.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will take you to take the sword.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You will be crazy, right?

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't take it.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Take it.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are crazy.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I am crazy.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Take it.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You are crazy.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You heard what you said.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So you took the sword?

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You know it's my sword.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You dare to take it without permission.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Your courage is not small.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm flattered.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But if you want to take back Shuo Feng sword,

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
you need to follow me.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't need you to take me.

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I will go by myself.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You...

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know me?

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then how can you go?

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I hate you.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I will go by myself.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But you don't know me.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So what?

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Remember.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When I find your master,

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you will be the first to mess him up.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just leave like this?

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It doesn't matter.

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They took a shadow three-dimensional person from that space gate.

253
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you know what it means?

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That gate is the way to the shadow three-dimensional world.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We have no power.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So what?

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I appreciate your temper.

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This is the shadow three-dimensional world?

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It should be the way to the barrier.

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Damn it.

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
How long will it take to reach the shadow three-dimensional world?

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's the hurry?

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You came from outside.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You have no power.

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But you want to enter the shadow three-dimensional world.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Are you going to die?

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You...

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are from the shadow three-dimensional world?

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I will kill you.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We don't know each other.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But you want to kill me.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How can you be so rude in the three-dimensional world?

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No need for excuses.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I just want to kill the people in the shadow three-dimensional world.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Come up.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You...

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Come down.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come down?

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are a stupid guy who can't even fly.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Who said I couldn't come up?

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Wait.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You seem to be able to understand people.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you want to negotiate?

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What are you doing in the shadow three-dimensional world?

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Revenge.

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Kill all the people in the shadow three-dimensional world.

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You are joking.

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Very serious.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can't do it.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why?

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
A-Yin.

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can help you.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why?

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because you don't have a choice.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now I am the highest ruler in the shadow three-dimensional world.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I need to go to the three-dimensional world.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I need to be taken in.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You help me get in.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will give the shadow three-dimensional world to you.

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How to deal with it,

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
it's up to you.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Who are you?

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You are so bold.

308
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The current female emperor of the shadow three-dimensional world,

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Zhang Chunhua.

310
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Zhang Chunhua.

311
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I am curious.

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You are so lonely.

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What do you want to do in the three-dimensional world?

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have no desire.

315
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I just want to follow someone.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is a good reason.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The deal is accepted.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Negotiation is done.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The three-dimensional world

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A shovel?

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I only know that there is a shovel in the depth of the shadow three-dimensional world.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Dig it.

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Maybe we will find it.

324
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you really think we are the Kuli?

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We are.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you think we are the Kuli?

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Dig a hole and find mud.

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Dig it.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The conditions are good.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Why don't you dig?

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You want revenge, I don't need it.

332
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Such a big knife,

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
how long will it take to dig?

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's collapsed.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It seems that there is another hole below.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Interesting.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I didn't expect that the inside of Qianyin Island is empty.

338
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why are there so many talismans?

339
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is this the real face of the formation of Qianyin Island?

340
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No, look around carefully.

341
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is the arrangement of this place familiar?

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's the formation of Shuiyuntian.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There is a Shuiyuntian formation under Qianyin Island.

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Interesting.

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The arrangement seems to be a formation that secures the power to eliminate the pursuit.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The person who sets up the formation wants to hide something, right?

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Maybe it's hiding himself.

348
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The empty golden gate.

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Looking at the place inside,

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
this gate leads to the three-dimensional world.

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There is a seal in the gate.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This gate has been sealed to death.

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This seal...

354
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Could it be...

355
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's the God of War seal of Shuiyuntian.

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's right.

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But when did Lord Jiuyuan...

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's not Jiuyuan.

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This seal is from the internal seal.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Lord Jiuyuan has never been to the three realms.

361
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How did he do it?

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But the God of War seal is only the one I, Shuiyuntian, call God of War.

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Could it be...

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's right.

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It should be him.

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
After fighting with the Demon Lord, he disappeared from the three realms.

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
After that, the thousand realms disappeared.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He...

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Could it be that he went to the three realms?

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The God of War of the previous generation.

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The God of War.

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Brother.

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't go.

374
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Look at this two-dimensional horse.

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Isn't it as cute as me?

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The owner said that he could get the latest news and special benefits by scanning.

377
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are melons to eat together.

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You mean...

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Our world and people now have experienced five restartations.

380
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Not everyone.

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Not all the worlds.

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The Eastern Qing Cang never died.

384
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Every time the world restarted,

385
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it would wake up somewhere.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It just lost its memory.

387
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And every time it woke up, the locations were the same.

388
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The three realms were destroyed.

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The three realms.

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The three realms.

391
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The three realms.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The End

393
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you for watching.
