in a mountain in Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.

00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:52,780
Her body was found in the trunk of a car
with an unidentified license plate.

114
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,221
Doctor, I don't think he dropped the dog.

115
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,392
Focus on the surgery for now.

116
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,398
Her organs are severely ruptured.

117
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,941
Did you beat Potato?

118
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,153
Well,

119
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,654
to be honest,

120
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,908
I lost Potato accidentally
when we were taking a walk last night.

121
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,871
I finally found her today.
But she was in that condition.

122
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,165
Potato has bad separation anxiety disorder

123
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,709
so I guess she barked all day
when I was out for work.

124
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,253
My neighbors complained a lot
that she was loud.

125
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,923
-Maybe they…
-You are saying a neighbor found Potato…

126
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,093
and beat her with something heavy?

127
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,803
Something heavy?

128
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,432
Yes. You end up like this
if you're beaten with something heavy.

129
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,728
How's Potato?

130
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,980
Did the surgery go well?

131
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,614
She is over the worst of it.
But we have to see.

132
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,699
It's a miracle that she's alive.

133
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,248
It's all my fault.
I should've kept a good hold on her leash.

134
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,587
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the truth from the beginning.

135
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,758
I was afraid you'd see me
as a lousy guardian.

136
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,818
Baek-ryeon! Baek-ryeon!

137
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,325
-Did something happen?
-There was an emergency surgery just now.

138
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,828
I think she's in shock
after seeing the dog's condition.

139
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,497
The owner said he dropped the dog
by mistake.

140
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,917
But it looked like he hit her
with something heavy

141
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,002
to kill her.

142
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,754
What?

143
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
What kind of a person would do that?

144
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,053
Baek-ryeon!

145
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,566
You found a red notebook
at Kim Myeong-sik's desk?

146
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,860
That means Myeong-sik is--

147
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,194
He isn't the culprit.

148
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,367
-You said you found a red notebook though.
-He was the target, not the culprit.

149
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,454
Kim Myeong-sik is dead.

150
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,831
He's dead?

151
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,210
No, the culprit was targeting women.
How did he--

152
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,588
The last one, jealousy,
was meant for Kim Myeong-sik.

153
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,593
That's why we need to get him soon.

154
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,354
We need to go somewhere together.

155
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,942
Kim, arrested for the murder
of the Inwangsan Mountain missing woman,

156
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,153
died in a detention center today.

157
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,614
The culprit committed suicide?

158
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,533
-He's probably not the culprit.
-After being recently accused

159
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,076
of killing his other mistress, Ms. Song,

160
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,246
-he is presumed to have killed himself.
-I don't feel good about this.

161
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,958
The police said they would be open
to all possibilities as they investigate.

162
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,752
According to Ms. Park So-yeong's husband,

163
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,172
a teenage boy was living
in the semi-basement at that time.

164
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,425
But he was too young,
so people didn't think it was him.

165
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,552
So they dismissed him as a suspect.

00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,145
It means there was a change
in the state of mind.

181
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,690
Pyomyung Group's finance team
where Kim and Song worked.

182
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,692
The detention center where Kim died. And…

183
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,446
I'll search all the semi-basements
in Jongseo-gu.

184
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,282
Please support me with the search team.

185
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,828
Hurry up and get him.

186
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,629
We'll search these four districts.

187
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,798
Sang-hyuk, Detective Kim, and I
will take charge of District One.

188
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,092
And Detective Shin
will be in charge of District Four.

189
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,553
-Yes, sir.
-Hurry up.

190
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,305
Group One, stand in front of Group Two.

191
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,806
You can follow them.

192
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,475
-Group One, this way.
-Go, go.

193
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,602
Hurry.

194
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,355
All right.

195
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,773
You can check this one.

196
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,108
The rest of you can follow me.

197
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,652
-You two, go downstairs.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,911
Excuse me, is anyone here?

199
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:03,995
Yes.

200
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,457
-Who are you?
-We're the police.

201
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,708
Please cooperate with us.

202
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,293
Can we see the semi-basement?

203
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,878
This is it.

204
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,506
-Does anyone live here?
-Nobody lives here.

205
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,928
Did the red notebook look like this?

206
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,266
Yes. It was this.
It said "jealousy" right here.

207
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,185
I see.

208
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,583
I drank too much that night.

209
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,045
It doesn't make sense.

210
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,298
CHEON DONG-GU

211
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,134
What the heck?

212
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,434
Hello?

213
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,108
I run the restaurant.

214
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,819
But Mr. Cheon Dong-gu here
is the actual owner.

215
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,823
The employees don't really know about him,
so they made a mistake.

216
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,907
Please don't get him wrong.

217
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,992
Okay.

218
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,744
Today's meal is already paid for.

219
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,830
Have a good time.

220
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,962
You didn't have to make him explain.

221
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,672
If he had not explained,

222
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,008
you'll think that all the things
I said until now were lies too.

223
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,676
The things you've said?

224
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,012
I said I'll only be interested in you
from now on.

225
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,347
I said you were my hobby.

226
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,517
I said you were prettier than Kim Tae-hee.

227
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,188
I meant all of those.

228
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,361
What made you fall for me?

229
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,824
-What made me fall for you?
-What made you fall in love with me?

230
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,125
During the 500 years
I've been stuck on this earth,

231
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,170
all human women have been cold to me.

232
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,838
It hurt.

233
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,882
But it was my first time.

234
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,928
You were the first human woman
who listened to me.

235
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,975
We don't judge people by their looks.

236
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,894
Put them on.

237
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,523
You're the first human woman
who looked into my eyes warmly.

238
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,109
My lips.

239
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,032
-Are you okay?
-You didn't treat them like a bug.

240
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:52,371
You're a cool human woman
who treated me without prejudice.

241
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,540
That's who you are, Do-ra.

242
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,507
Let me ask just one more question.

243
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,427
Are you really a fairy?

244
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,015
You saw me at the playground that day.

245
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,435
I'm sure you remember.

246
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,647
-I saved you.
-So that was really you?

247
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,569
I was here
when you went to the restroom too.

248
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,488
You were here?

249
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,740
I saw you quietly
walking out with the bill.

250
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,244
I was impressed once again
to see how elegantly you handled it.

251
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,747
I almost cursed.

252
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,832
I'm glad I didn't.

253
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,544
There were so many things
I wanted to do with you.

254
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,172
I wanted to take you out on a date,
get married,

255
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,551
and have a Maldives in the mojito.

256
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,262
I wanted to go on a honeymoon with you.

257
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,180
I wanted to have a honeymoon baby

258
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,268
and live happily ever after
together with you.

259
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,436
You went too far.

260
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,689
You didn't even ask me
how I felt about it.

261
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,359
And now I can't.

262
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,862
What are you talking about?
Is it a one-man show?

263
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,114
I'm

264
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,658
leaving soon.

265
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,204
To up there.

266
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,623
Up there?

267
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,502
These wings are telling me
that it's almost time.

268
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,885
I really don't get this guy.

269
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,432
Thank you for your help.

270
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,475
All right, detectives. Bye.

271
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,352
Yes, thank you.

272
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,362
This was the last semi-basement
in Jongseo-gu.

273
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm sure his place
is around here somewhere.

274
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,536
Maybe it's not a semi-basement.

275
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,217
What?

276
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,641
This house isn't on
the housing status map.

277
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,233
Excuse me. We're the police.

278
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,027
Anyone there?

279
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,159
-Who are you?
-Hello, sir.

280
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,663
We're from Jongseo Police Station.

281
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,789
What's wrong?

282
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,290
I want to ask you something.

283
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,544
There's a connection between
the missing and murder cases

284
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,837
that happened in Jongseo-gu?

285
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,130
Yes, there is.

286
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,799
Ms. Go who went missing
in Inwangsan Mountain.

287
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,176
Ms. Song who worked in a finance team
of a large corporation.

288
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,763
And Mr. Kim who was accused of
murdering these two women.

289
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,224
They all received red notebooks.

290
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,935
This is the notebook.

291
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,813
Have you ever heard of
Seven Sins for Women?

292
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,607
Aren't they seven things
that were considered to be crimes

293
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,234
committed by women
during the Joseon Dynasty?

294
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,236
Right. Three of the seven sins

295
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,031
were written on the red notebooks.
Adultery, disease, and jealousy.

296
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,867
So the culprit gave them this notebook?

297
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,371
Yes, according to what the police
have collected as evidence.

298
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,706
And there's something new

299
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,791
we found out as we covered this.

300
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,501
The rest of the four happened already.

301
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,879
Gossip, disobedience, inability to bear
a male heir, and theft.

302
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,173
All those happened in Jongseo-gu, 1993.

303
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:39,056
Song, a missing victim of the Polka Dot
High School Girls case in 1993,

304
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,643
received one of the red notebooks
that said "theft."

305
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,688
The police found out that there were
red notebooks that said gossip,

306
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,775
disobedience, and inability to bear
a male heir in previous missing cases

307
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,154
during the recent police investigation.

308
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,530
I see.

309
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,034
The culprit killed that many people?

310
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:03,372
Ms. Oh, take some time off
and stay home with Sang-hyuk.

311
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,583
Is it because I'm the last witness?

312
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,128
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,756
This wouldn't have happened
if I caught him sooner.

314
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,424
You will get him.

315
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,052
I can read people's eyes.

316
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,681
I see determination in your eyes.

317
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,601
You're determined to catch
the bad guy no matter what.

318
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,395
That's why I believe that

319
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,855
you will get him, no matter what.

320
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,024
I am going to trust you

321
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,610
and live my life, Detective Seo.

322
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:34,987
I won't hide.

323
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:38,908
Ms. Oh.

324
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,785
Hang in there.

325
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,162
Hang in there and get him.

326
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,499
Thank you

327
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,583
for believing in me.

328
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,016
Don't come out until I pick you up
tomorrow. Okay?

329
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,395
I won't step out
until the sun rises tomorrow morning.

330
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,817
Baek-ryeon, you are a good girl.

331
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,904
Get home safely.

332
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,199
Go in.

333
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,620
By the way…

334
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,629
Never mind.

335
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,713
See you tomorrow.

336
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,300
Bye.

337
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,488
What? Lead?

338
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,866
You want me to shoot you
with a lead arrow?

339
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,621
Do you mean that scary lead arrow

340
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,458
that makes you hate
something at first sight?

341
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,460
You're talking about that scary thing?

342
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,129
-Yes. Shoot me with that.
-No! I don't want to.

343
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,715
-You will die if you get shot with that.
-It's the only way

344
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,134
to end everything.

345
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,553
No!

346
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,139
You don't know what will happen
when you touch it.

347
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:26,849
I don't want to.

348
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,267
I can't. I won't do it.

349
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,810
I'll shoot it.

350
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:35,316
If that is the only way
to bring you back to your senses.

351
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,266
I wonder what would have happened…

352
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,354
if I shot him right?

353
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,813
You can shoot him again.

354
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,732
Properly.

355
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,735
What?

356
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,448
Regrets won't change anything.

357
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,868
You are right.

358
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,454
Everyone gets a second chance.

359
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,418
I've been meaning to ask you this.

360
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,587
-How old are you?
-I'm nine.

361
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,755
Which apartment unit?

362
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,216
It's 501. Two floors down from yours.

363
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,676
Really?

364
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,805
I didn't know
you lived two floors down from mine.

365
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,307
Are you going home?

366
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,644
It's 9:00 p.m.

367
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,229
I have to brush my teeth and go to bed.

368
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,855
I'll visit you soon.

369
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,315
Anytime.

370
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,699
Should I…

371
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,910
shoot it again?

372
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,166
Sang-hyuk!

373
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,103
There are guys like that.
It's as if someone's helping him.

374
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,022
After you get the culprit,

375
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,108
you'll see they're in the evidence
and security camera footage we reviewed.

376
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,736
But strangely,
we missed it during the investigation.

377
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,531
It's as if someone from above
helped the culprit.

378
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,792
We've checked all semi-basements
in Jongseo-gu.

379
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,461
There aren't any suspicious ones.

380
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,588
Sir, why don't we wrap it up?

381
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,089
I don't think there's anything.

382
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,382
Let's make one more round.

383
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:06,592
What? One more time?

384
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,137
There are some houses that aren't on
the map. We have to check one more time.

385
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,848
My goodness.

386
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,853
Let's go and check one more time.

387
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,937
Okay.

388
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,400
Hurry up and come.

389
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,361
One thing I don't know?

390
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,237
Yes. He said if you find out

391
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,823
you may end up doing it
depending on the situation.

392
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,159
-What's that?
-I don't know.

393
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,036
Ask Dong-pal.

394
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,456
I don't know if he's going to tell you.

395
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,250
Are you kidding me?

396
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,503
By the way,

397
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,049
why do you think the last witness to
the murderer is Baek-ryeon of all people?

398
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,261
Why do you think Lee Seon is in charge
of the investigation of all people?

399
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,640
Of all things, he's someone who killed
Lee So-hee 500 years ago.

400
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,600
He didn't kill her. She was just dead.

401
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:58,686
She killed herself.

402
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,272
What? She killed herself?

403
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,901
She was told that she had to be reborn
to meet me again.

404
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,361
Who told her that?

405
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,489
-A kid.
-A kid?

406
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,034
How old is the kid?

407
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,161
I don't know that.

408
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,205
That's strange.

409
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,542
When I said I was worried about something,

410
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,336
the kid from Unit 501
told me a simple solution.

411
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,965
He said everyone has a second chance.

412
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,386
Come to think of it,
he also said something cool to me before.

413
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:37,307
What do you think you need the most
when you are in love?

414
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,352
He said it's courage.

415
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,648
What is love?

416
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:45,983
Then why do you ask?

417
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,026
I might have to do it soon.

418
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,365
Which unit does that kid live in again?

419
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,743
Why? Are you going to ask for advice, too?

420
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,166
Who is it?

421
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,794
My goodness.

422
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,963
Look who's here.

423
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,050
You two are the good-looking sweethearts
from Unit 701.

424
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,260
Sweethearts?

425
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,346
Are you sure about that?

426
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,685
I call all handsome men "sweetheart."

427
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,229
I see.

428
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:30,778
By the way, what brings you two here
at this late hour?

429
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,280
I'm really sorry to bother you at night.

430
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,200
Madame, do you happen to have-- What?

431
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,744
"Madame"?

432
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,704
Don't call her that.

433
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,751
Ma'am.

434
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,671
You have a nine-year-old kid, right?

435
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,840
A son, right?

436
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,221
Hey, people usually have kids
once they're married.

437
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,308
And you call people ma'am
when they have a kid!

438
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,354
That's not what we meant, ma'am--

439
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,523
Madame?

440
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,318
Missus. Right. Missus.

441
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:16,198
Isn't a nine-year-old boy
who's about this tall your son?

442
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,200
-Why you little!
-Oh, gosh!

443
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,868
I'm not even married yet!

444
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,287
Watch what you say.

445
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,290
I don't even have a son!
Why are you looking for a boy here?

446
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,209
How dare you insult me at this hour!

447
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,961
You two are ugly.

448
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,589
We're sorry, miss! Miss!

449
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:36,218
Get lost, you ****!

450
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,806
I don't think it's here.

451
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,643
He said he lives in Unit 501
earlier though.

452
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,232
Where are you going?

453
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,903
Are you that kid?

454
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,697
The one who appeared
before Lee So-hee 500 years ago?

455
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,742
I appeared before her
because she prayed a thousand times.

456
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,827
Why did you tell her to die
and be born again?

457
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,539
For those two chances to meet you.

458
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,504
I'm about to go through
the last metamorphosis.

459
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,715
What do you mean by a chance?
Why would you do this now?

460
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,512
Don't hide behind excuses.

461
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,349
She prayed a thousand times
just to meet you.

462
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,353
Please let me meet him.

463
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,190
Please allow me to meet him.

464
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:01,196
Please allow me to meet him.

465
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:10,247
And she died and was born again
just to meet you.

466
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:16,128
While Baek-ryeon was endlessly trying hard
for those two chances,

467
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,005
what

468
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,048
did you do?

469
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,556
You had your chances too.

470
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:32,394
For your second chance,
think of the thing you didn't do

471
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,272
when you had your first chance.

472
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:40,736
-The thing that I didn't do?
-God will give you one more chance.

473
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,493
Wait!

474
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,964
Everyone gets a second chance.

475
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,551
You can shoot him again.

476
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,470
Properly.

477
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,233
Tell me.

478
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,194
What is that one thing that I can do?

479
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:23,904
I can't tell you.

480
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,989
What will I do depending on the situation?

481
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,117
-I don't want to lose you.
-I'm not asking you for a favor right now.

482
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:30,619
So tell me.

483
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,622
Answer me.

484
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,874
Tell me what I can do.

485
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,460
You will regret it.

486
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,546
-I'll decide after listening to you.
-I will regret it.

487
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,800
I will regret that
I shared the secret today.

488
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,347
It's where the metamorphosis happens.

489
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,685
The core of your heart and wings
and the outer pores of the cocoon.

490
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,439
There is a thin transparent tube
that connects the three organs as one.

491
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,275
It's as thin as hair.

492
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,071
That's the vital spot for metamorphosis.

493
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,202
A vital spot?

494
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,246
The critical point
where it makes the wings transparent.

495
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,711
If an arrow goes through that,

496
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,631
your metamorphosis will stop.

497
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,597
That's how you can wake up
and wait for the next metamorphosis.

498
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:37,227
Hey.

499
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,229
If you knew a method like that,

500
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:44,025
-why didn't you tell him earlier?
-The problem is when the arrow misses it.

501
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:49,281
What do you think the chances are for
an arrow to pass through the vital spot?

502
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,790
Let's make another round there.

503
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,876
-We'll go this way.
-Okay.

504
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,633
I'm home.

505
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,097
In 1993, the Polka Dot High School Girls
case shocked the whole country.

506
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,932
What are you watching so seriously?

507
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,768
The witnesses who testified
about the girls' whereabouts

508
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,854
all died for unknown reasons.

509
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,274
The last witness, who testified that he
saw a suspicious man at a rice paddy field

510
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:28,403
where Yoo Jeong-ah's clothes were found,
also died.

511
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,698
-So he's a serial killer?
-Who is the culprit?

512
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:35,535
Did he really kill all the witnesses?

513
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,624
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

514
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,212
Sir, someone is here to see you.

515
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,047
Who?

516
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,842
Long time no see, sir.

517
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,142
It was Yoo Jeong-ah.

518
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,312
I want to hear that voice again.

519
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:04,940
You want to hear the voice?

520
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,233
Yes.

521
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,276
We can get the culprit then, right?

522
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,695
That man.

523
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,991
SUSPECT CAUGHT ON CAMERA
NEAR INWANGSAN MOUNTAIN

524
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:48,817
You are going back to December 1993
in Sungin-dong.

525
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,279
Where are you right now?

526
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,782
I'm off to school!

527
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,286
Jeong-ah! Don't forget your lunch box.

528
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,787
I forgot it again. I'll be back.

529
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,205
Have fun at school.

530
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:04,958
Da-hee!

531
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,711
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

532
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,974
By the way, I lost my polka dot coat.

533
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,226
-Your polka dot coat?
-Yes.

534
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,228
I guess someone took it during PE class.

535
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,397
I cried because I was so upset.

536
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,316
Let's go.

537
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,151
Ta-da!

538
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:34,779
-Isn't it pretty?
-I love it.

539
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,906
My goodness.

540
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,159
-It's so pretty!
-Goodness.

541
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,452
Are you that happy?

542
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,510
Can you see the culprit's face?

543
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,471
I can't see his face
because it's too dark.

544
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,476
Hey.

545
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,313
-Are you a good girl or not?
-I'm a good girl.

546
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:51,856
I'll be a good girl.

547
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,733
Please don't kill me.

548
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,027
You're lying.

549
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,740
You're lying.

550
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:01,866
You're lying.

551
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,926
I wanted to be honest.

552
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:25,098
Because you're the first human woman

553
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,434
who treated me like a human being.

554
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,779
Goodness.

555
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,240
Did you wait a long time?

556
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,617
I'm on time, though.

557
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,830
I guess it's not happening today.
You showed up.

558
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,876
Right, I guess not.

559
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,795
-Then let's go on a date today.
-Sure.

560
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,422
Let's do that.

561
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,011
Wait.

562
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,095
Do what?

563
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,598
You don't know what a date is?

564
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,435
You mean that thing that
a human man and a human woman do?

565
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,898
That lovey-dovey and sweet thing?

566
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,318
You said you wanted to do
a lot of things with me.

567
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,488
You wanted to go on a date, get married,

568
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,282
and have "a Maldives in the mojito".

569
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,951
But your wings are telling you
it's almost time,

570
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,245
so you can't go that far.

571
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,207
Just go on a date with me today.

572
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,753
If your wings are still okay,
we'll go on another date tomorrow.

573
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:39,506
What?

574
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,759
Tomorrow, too?

575
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,260
Yes.

576
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,263
Not as a fairy and a human.

577
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:50,141
As a man and a woman.

578
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,169
I've never done this before.

579
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,943
Try this.

580
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,198
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

581
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,913
-A cotton candy!
-It's white.

582
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:56,583
Gentle gaze.

583
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,502
Here, try this.

584
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,587
Okay.

585
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,006
-Gentle gaze.
-One.

586
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:04,757
Gentle gaze.

587
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:07,760
Roar.

588
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,471
PHOTO PICKUP

589
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,894
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

590
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,716
No.

591
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,011
I want the whole space.

592
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,680
Okay. I'll be there soon.

593
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:53,765
Okay.

594
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:55,391
Are you going somewhere?

595
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,650
There's a place we need to go together.

596
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,444
Where?

597
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,615
Welcome!

598
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,035
-Mr. Park.
-It's been a while!

599
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,955
Come in.
I prepared everything you asked for.

600
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,040
Do you like it?

601
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,251
Mr. Park, you never disappoint me.

602
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,254
Do-ra, this is it.

603
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,404
Love is fearless.

604
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:51,989
Love is reckless.

605
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,577
But because of that…

606
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,416
you become a part of each other…

607
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,045
or become everything.

608
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,467
You may be weak for yourself,

609
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,804
but you can be strong for the other.

610
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:19,600
That is why…

611
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,648
miracles are made.

612
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,152
Miracles began

613
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,530
with love.

614
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:37,452
I underestimated myself.

615
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,163
You're getting on my nerves again.

616
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,263
You finally showed up.

617
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,071
Hello, sir.

618
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,575
Ms. Oh Baek-ryeon dropped by
the hypnosis room yesterday.

619
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:00,868
She did?

620
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,411
Why did she go there all of a sudden?

621
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,007
MS. OH BAEK-RYEON

622
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,904
That fate you created

623
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,908
was bound to be broken
if it was for someone with a strong will.

624
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:46,038
I finally realized
why you've been warning me.

625
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,709
Lee So-hee broke the red thread of fate
to come and meet me.

626
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,419
She was building her time.

627
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,380
Meanwhile, you made me
spend time being scared…

628
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,301
because we were going to meet
in this lifetime.

629
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:03,222
I'm a variable that's not affected
by your threads of fate.

630
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,184
I should have run faster.

631
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,856
Then our first chance
would have been different.

632
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,065
Have you forgotten?

633
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,153
You will go through metamorphosis soon.

634
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,237
No.

635
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,990
I will refuse it.

636
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,244
There is no more metamorphosis
in my plans.

637
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,924
I learned something
during my hypnosis testimony.

638
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,676
-I know it's hard to believe, but I am--
-I believe you.

639
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,555
I believe you too, Ms. Oh.

640
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:50,269
I heard from Lieutenant Lee
that you are Yoo Jeong-ah,

641
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:54,649
the missing girl from the 1993
Polka Dot High School Girls case.

642
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,198
That's when I heard the culprit's voice.

643
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,202
So I have one last testimony to make.

644
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,162
Go ahead.

645
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,082
I heard the same voice recently.

646
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,283
Wait. This place isn't marked.

647
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:48,995
I'll check here first.

648
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,079
Okay.

649
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,028
That court lady

650
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,614
has her own red thread of fate.

651
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,910
Lee So-hee broke
that red thread of fate already.

652
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,788
While she was building her time with you,

653
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:38,377
the time to reattach
the broken thread was built too.

654
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,177
-I'll be back after a call.
-Okay.

655
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,604
It's tonight.

656
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:42,191
What wasn't fulfilled that night.

657
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:44,860
What wasn't fulfilled?

658
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:04,922
Yes, Detective Myung.

659
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,424
Sir, I found him.

660
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,553
GOSSIP - DISOBEDIENCE

661
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,642
Who is it?

662
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,144
It was that guy.

663
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,541
MY MAN

664
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,044
Yes, Sang-hyuk.

665
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,546
Where are you?

666
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,089
Well, I am--

667
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,257
Where are you?

668
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,134
I'm at the police station.

669
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,512
I was going to tell you,
but I didn't want you to worry.

670
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:55,931
Get out of there right now.

671
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,853
I came out to go home now.
I'm in Detective Seo's car.

672
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,479
Whose car?

673
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,856
Get out of the car.

674
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:06,609
Get out!

675
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,818
MY WOMAN

676
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,581
Sang-hyuk, what's wrong?

677
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:23,626
Hello? Hello?

678
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,672
Hello? Sang-hyuk.

679
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,382
Sang-hyuk!

680
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,932
The court lady should have died
for the prince that night.
