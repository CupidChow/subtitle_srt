1
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,673
-You're hiking again?
-Yes. I have the afternoon off.

2
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,968
I'll quickly hike before the sun sets.
Then I'm heading home.

3
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,846
-How many times more?
-I'm almost there.

4
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,930
I'm almost done.

5
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,058
Goodness, you hiked so much.

6
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,144
You will live up to 100 years old.

7
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,564
-Be careful.
-Okay.

8
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,071
I forgot to return it.

9
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:18,704
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

10
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,623
Bye.

11
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,004
Thank you for the other day.
I'm sorry I took so long to return it.

12
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,715
I even forgot that I lent it.

13
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,468
Thank you. It snowed so much that night.

14
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,720
I'll get going now.

15
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,972
-Bye.
-Bye.

16
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,600
-Bye, Dr. Oh.
-Bye.

17
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,188
Why don't we order some snacks?

18
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,857
We would love to!

19
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,152
-Fried chicken?
-Tteokbokki.

20
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,779
-Let's have chicken.
-No, tteokbokki.

21
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,713
I'm sorry. I beg for your forgiveness.

22
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,091
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,690
God of the Mountain, this is the man.

24
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,234
The man I told you about.
Cheon Sang-hyuk of Gugi-dong.

25
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,281
Now that I showed you what he looks like,

26
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,117
I'm sure you won't make a mistake.

27
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,754
KIM HYUNG-RAE

28
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,177
MS. OH BAEK-RYEON

29
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,686
Good.

30
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,864
My goodness.

31
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,254
He's young and good-looking.

32
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,839
MR. SUPERMAN

33
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,468
What the heck?

34
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:39,762
He's handsome.

35
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:44,016
They bring someone who's uglier
and less successful than them.

36
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,687
Did he mean what he said?

37
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,402
MS. OH BAEK-RYEON

38
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,946
Is he not her type?

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,408
He's good-looking and young though.

40
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,161
Rejected.

41
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,371
Rejected?

42
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,207
What's the reason?

43
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,301
He doesn't look like Won Bin,
Hyun Bin or Zo In-sung.

44
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,930
Where can I find a man who looks like
Won Bin, Hyun Bin and Zo In-sung though?

45
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,140
This woman is asking for too much.

46
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,857
I think he's okay.

47
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,119
You can find all the men you want.
I'll just reject them all.

48
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,000
Ideal type.

49
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,425
-Disgusting.
-I think I ate too much.

50
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,801
I'm so full.

51
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,720
Are you sure your stomach
isn't always that big?

52
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,645
Wait.

53
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,399
-Is Zo In-sung married?
-He's single.

54
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,235
Why? Would you propose to him

55
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,570
-if you were free?
-Propose?

56
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,866
He does a lot of good deeds.

57
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:26,869
If that's the case,

58
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,457
maybe he can show some compassion
to a pitiful soul

59
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,917
who wants to have warm memories
with someone.

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,128
Celebrities often help
the less fortunate in the winter.

61
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,671
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,136
Does any one of you fairies
know where Mr. Zo lives?

63
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,806
Why? Is there a less fortunate person
who needs help?

64
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,060
Why are you asking Zo In-sung to help?

65
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:06,408
EP5. A THOUSAND TIMES,
AND A MAN OF DESTINY

66
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,791
Who are you?

67
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,463
Are you her boyfriend?

68
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,256
No, I'm not.

69
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,634
I'm a police officer.

70
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,302
The police? What brings you here?

71
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,804
Did she do something wrong?

72
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,347
No, she didn't.

73
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,893
I came here earlier to ask your daughter
something, but I left my stuff here.

74
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,853
You did?

75
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,693
-Please wait here for a minute.
-Okay.

76
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,741
Ye-won.

77
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:24,361
I'll be at the top of the suspect list
if my girlfriend goes missing.

78
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,239
Yes, I'll report you first.

79
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,953
-Hey, it's not a crime to love someone.
-"Sir."

80
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,414
Sir.

81
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,959
What I mean is that
the man might be innocent.

82
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,588
The only thing he did wrong so far
is that he dated that missing woman.

83
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,048
He wasn't dating her.
He was having an affair with her.

84
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,719
You don't know the world of adultery
because you're still young.

85
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,470
That world is

86
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,848
a spectacle and a horror.

87
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,060
We found blood in his car
and a bloody skirt too.

88
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,897
We haven't found the link yet,
but he's a prime suspect.

89
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,065
And we have to find the evidence
that links him.

90
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,693
-Got it?
-Yes.

91
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,241
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,784
Are you watching Kim Myeong-sik?

93
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,870
Kim Myeong-sik?

94
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,790
-He just walked out of the building.
-One more person died.

95
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,418
Purchaser Number 620.
She bought the flower-patterned umbrella!

96
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,128
-What?
-Return to the office now.

97
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,588
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,964
Hey, let's go.

99
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,474
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

100
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,442
-Hey.
-Hey.

101
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,278
What happened? Was there an accident?

102
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,822
Someone in this building killed herself.

103
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:51,990
What? Suicide?

104
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,869
It probably happened because she was
pessimistic about her life.

105
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,538
You have to admit that
life isn't always that great.

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,918
It's kind of creepy.

107
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,587
How can such a thing happen
in our apartment building?

108
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,090
-Let's go.
-Okay.

109
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,763
WEIGHT LOSS,
WATER-FREE DIET

110
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,598
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

111
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,392
Could it be a side effect of the diet?

112
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,811
I heard that if you take a lot of
supplements like this,

113
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,730
you could suddenly lose
the motivation to live.

114
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,819
Did you see any signs of that
when we saw her this afternoon?

115
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,904
No.

116
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,740
I don't think so either.

117
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,000
We need to find
that flower-patterned umbrella soon.

118
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,420
-I think--
-It will be fine.

119
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,757
We haven't found her yet.

120
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,034
I think I can find him.

121
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,675
-Where is Building 206?
-From here to here.

122
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,597
-Hello.
-May I ask you something?

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,223
-Did you happen to see…
-Yes.

124
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,492
-Why haven't we found anything?
-Is he invisible or what?

125
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,869
There are so many security cameras
in the apartment.

126
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,205
-Why is there no sign of him?
-There are guys like that.

127
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,332
It's as if someone's helping him.

128
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,835
Help him? Are you saying
there's an accomplice in the apartment?

129
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,920
No.

130
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,547
Someone from up there.

131
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,384
What do you mean by that?

132
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,761
You'll get what I mean
as you keep working.

133
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,929
After you get the culprit,

134
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,765
you'll see they're in the evidence
and security camera footage we reviewed.

135
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,810
But strangely,
we missed it during the investigation.

136
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,771
It's as if someone from above
helped the culprit.

137
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,608
You waste your time like that.
It's good if you get the culprit.

138
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,652
If you don't get the culprit,
it remains unsolved.

139
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,280
We should check
the security camera footage again, right?

140
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,241
-Of course.
-Again?

141
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,700
I feel like my eyes are gonna fall out.

142
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,412
While you are at it,
please cover my part too.

143
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,621
Please don't do this.

144
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,873
The youngest one has to do
this kind of job.

145
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,586
By the way,

146
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,006
why do you think the culprits get help
from above?

147
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,801
They're bad guys.

148
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,649
Sang-hyuk, I heard you changed
Ddaeng-chil's hospital.

149
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,527
Why would you change it
when you're leaving soon?

150
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,112
Do they have something special there?

151
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,616
Dr. Ha-ja's special interest in me.

152
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,161
-It's too much for me to handle.
-After all this time?

153
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,454
Kind of late, don't you think?

154
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,748
The new hospital is bigger.

155
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,250
There are more vets too.

156
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,253
Are they prettier too?

157
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,967
I heard that you bring Ddaeng-chil there
a lot, just to see the pretty vet.

158
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,345
-When Ddaeng-chil's not even sick.
-Sick?

159
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,182
Don't you know that
prevention is the best treatment?

160
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,558
Especially by a pretty vet.

161
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,354
Don't forget the reason we are here.

162
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,317
I haven't forgotten it for a single day.

163
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,323
Stop dragging him to the hospital.
Ddaeng-chil isn't sick.

164
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,451
Ddaeng-chil is…

165
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,704
-What about me?
-He's obese.

166
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,876
I'm not obese!

167
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,003
The police are investigating
a case of a missing woman

168
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,590
in her 40s who went missing
near Inwangsan Mountain on December 21.

169
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,260
The police believe that it may be more
than just a missing persons case

170
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,888
due to the deaths of witnesses
as they continue to investigate.

171
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,890
Reporter Choi Ji-won
has more on the story.

172
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,893
The whereabouts of a woman in her 40s
who went missing in the public parking lot

173
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,937
near Inwangsan Mountain
still remains unknown.

174
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,189
A woman in her 20s,
whom the police investigated,

175
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,358
was found dead two days ago.

176
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,736
In addition, Ms. Ham, in her 60s,
and Mr. Kim, in his 50s,

177
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,281
who had been interviewed as witnesses,
died in a fire and a fall, respectively.

178
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,825
The police are investigating
the possible connection

179
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,536
between the case and the deaths.

180
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,248
The woman went missing on December 21,
the night of heavy snowfall.

181
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,000
Police arrested the woman's secret lover
as the prime suspect,

182
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,753
but he was recently released
due to lack of evidence.

183
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,922
The police are searching
the Inwangsan Mountain area,

184
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,966
open to the possibility
the woman may be dead.

185
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,385
They have yet to find any new evidence.

186
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,684
INWANGSAN MOUNTAIN MISSING WOMAN

187
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,274
RECORD-BREAKING HEAVY SNOWFALL
THE DAY WOMAN WENT MISSING

188
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,110
Record-breaking heavy snowfall
the day she went missing.

189
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,779
The prime suspect.

190
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,739
A man in his 40s.

191
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,158
A secret lover.

192
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,537
Do you think it's related to

193
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,665
the Polka Dot High School Girls case
from 1993?

194
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,749
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,010
Do you think it's related?

196
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,553
I have a bad feeling about this.

197
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,138
What do you mean?

198
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,641
It's just a missing persons case
that happened on a snowy day.

199
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,768
All the witnesses are dead.

200
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,355
-Everyone who died had a reason.
-We had a reason back then too.

201
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,401
-Or at least it appeared so.
-He could've killed people back then.

202
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,279
-Why would he have waited 29 years?
-There must be a reason.

203
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,865
A reason why he couldn't

204
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,117
or he didn't want to.

205
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,580
Her secret lover.

206
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,207
The missing woman.

207
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,170
She was having an affair.
He won't get caught if he's the same guy.

208
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,254
Even back then,

209
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,050
he managed to escape
as if someone was helping him.

210
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,593
It was as if

211
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,096
the case was meant to remain unsolved.

212
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,023
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

213
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,694
-How many more times to go?
-Two.

214
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,948
You're finally almost done.
Did you describe your ideal man?

215
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,826
I told the god who he is.
I even showed his picture.

216
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,162
They can't act like they didn't know now.

217
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,457
By the way…

218
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,084
Don't start a sentence with that.

219
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,045
…what exactly is that man who's going
to appear supposed to be?

220
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,588
-What do you mean?
-Is that man

221
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:07,509
supposed to set you up
with someone, or is he your man?

222
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,264
Climb to the top of Inwangsan Mountain
and face the east side.

223
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,183
You'll see a cliff in that direction.

224
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,268
Go there and beg with all your heart
for forgiveness.

225
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,438
On the day of the thousandth time
you go up to ask for forgiveness,

226
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,149
someone will appear.

227
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,236
A man who knows the past will come to you.

228
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,447
Didn't he say it's someone
who knows the past?

229
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,740
Right.

230
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,326
-Did you know Mr. Superman before?
-No.

231
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,288
Then if that person who's going to show up
is the one, it's not Mr. Superman.

232
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,833
If that person is supposed to
set you up with a man,

233
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,919
then an old acquaintance of yours
may show up

234
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,547
and set you up with Mr. Superman.

235
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,759
Will that do?

236
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,512
You have two more times to go.
We will see.

237
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,638
Here, cheers.

238
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,789
A man who knows the past.

239
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,773
Lonely souls, come to me.

240
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,357
If you don't know what love is,

241
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,028
it's because nobody told you
the secret to love.

242
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,654
I would know if someone told me

243
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,948
because I'm smart.

We don't catch fish for you.

We teach you how to catch fish.

254
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,231
So you can't say this is expensive.

255
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,983
You have to love
for the rest of your life.

256
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,528
Why did you open so late?

257
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,695
I'm about to leave.

258
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,948
Are you going somewhere?

259
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,616
Abroad?

260
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,119
You can use the skills outside Korea.

261
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:44,791
If I take this course,
will I find a woman in three months?

262
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,668
Of course.

263
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,379
If you study hard,
you'll definitely find one.

264
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,298
I don't have much time.

265
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,717

Hey. How are you?

280
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,110
The woman in her 40s who went missing
by Inwangsan Mountain parking lot,

281
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,696
-give me her address.
-Why are you asking about that case?

282
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,781
Don't tell me…

283
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,533
I need to check something.

284
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,745
It's not what you're thinking.
The prime suspect is her secret lover.

285
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,914
We found bloodstains in his car.

286
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,000
We have security camera footage
of him driving there that night too.

287
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,544
We even caught him
throwing away that bloodstained skirt.

288
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,670
An affair.

289
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,048
Heavy snowfall.

290
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,132
Jongseo.

291
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,301
The witnesses all died.

292
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,136
And the missing woman,

293
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,180
she was having an affair.

294
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,289
-Excuse me.
-Who are you?

295
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,376
First of all, hello.

296
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,466
What? A red notebook?

297
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,597
It's about this big. You didn't see it
when you were at Go Eun-seo's place?

298
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,891
What? Adultery?

299
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,476
Did you say adultery?

300
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,270
A red notebook?

301
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:15,441
Yes, my sister had an affair.
But that's not a crime.

302
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,985
Did she deserve to die for that?

303
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,738
The police were going on and on about
the secret lover being the prime suspect.

304
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,825
So my brother-in-law found out
about my sister's affair too.

305
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,453
Everyone at work and everyone
in this neighborhood know too.

306
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,874
-Firstly, you should calm down.
-How can I calm down?

307
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,211
You can't even find my missing sister!

308
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,504
Who are you to come here

309
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,424
and ask me to look for a red notebook
that says "adultery"?

310
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,927
Stop it with your nonsense.
Get out of my sight!

311
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,387
Ma'am, I…

312
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,854
I didn't take a good look
around the house.

313
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,107
I just went to check a few things
with her husband.

314
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,155
It was probably a crime of passion.

315
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,907
We found bloodstains in the car.

316
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,161
We even found the bloodstained skirt
at the lover's place.

317
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,747
You haven't found the body yet?

318
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:12,874
No, sir.

319
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,836
It will only be clear if we find the body.

320
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,216
By the way,
what was that red notebook all about?

321
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,843
It's nothing.

322
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,974
That would be ridiculous.
It's been 29 years.

324
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,757

00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,608
Sir.

326
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,154
That man wants to tell you something
regarding the Inwangsan Mountain case.

327
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,329
You?

328
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,914
You're Detective Seo Jae-hee?

329
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,594
It feels weird to see you here
instead of at the animal hospital.

330
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,181
No wonder you looked familiar.
Which is it?

331
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,683
You're the captain in charge of

332
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,060
that missing persons case
near Inwangsan Mountain?

333
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,145
Yes, that's right.

334
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,689
Do you know the 1993 missing
Polka Dot High School Girls case

335
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,816
that happened in Jongseo?

336
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,192
I do.

337
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,444
We recently found their remains
in Inwangsan Mountain,

338
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,405
so our precinct handled the case.

339
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,489
That case…

340
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,118
-The culprit still hasn't been caught.
-We're aware of that too.

341
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,870
The case remains unsolved.

342
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:18,666
There's a chance that the same guy
could be responsible for this case.

343
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,754
-What did you say?
-Unfortunately, some things overlap.

344
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,131
Overlap?

345
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,342
There were three more
missing person cases in Jongseo in 1993

346
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,552
in addition to the missing girls

347
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,179
from the Polka Dot High School Girls case.

348
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,683
Fifty-one-year-old Ms. Hong Hye-kyeong
of Changsin-dong,

349
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,810
37-year-old Ms. Jang Mi-ok
of Dongsung-dong,

350
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,105
35-year-old Ms. Park So-yeong
of Cheongun-dong,

351
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,025
18-year-old Song Da-hee of P'ungin-dong

352
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,611
and…

353
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,239
YOO JEONG-AH

354
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,160
…Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah.

355
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,998
All women.

356
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,836
It snowed on all the nights
they went missing.

357
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,547
They were all
record-breaking snowfalls too.

358
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,135
They all seem to be separate incidents.

359
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,263
They just seem to be people
who went missing during the winter

360
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,556
when it often snows.

361
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,143
Or people who died in accidents
that are not related to the case.

362
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:24,232
Yes. So nobody noticed it at the time
that all the cases were related.

363
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,068
But a year later, this was found.

364
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,361
ADULTERY

365
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,321
"Seven Sins for Women."

366
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,532
Seven things that were considered
to be crimes

367
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,451
committed by women
during the Joseon Dynasty.

368
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,578
"Seven Sins for Women"?

369
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,373
The culprit gave the victims
this red notebook

370
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,625
24 hours before he committed crimes.

371
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,294
As if it was a forewarning.

372
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,881
"Gossip" to Ms. Hong.

373
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,676
"Disobedience" to Ms. Jang.

374
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,678
"Inability to bear a male heir"
to Ms. Park.

375
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,138
"Theft" to Song Da-hee.

376
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,682
THEFT

377
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,183
And…

378
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,143
DISEASE

379
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,854
…disease. This is the one he failed at.

380
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,607
A red notebook?

381
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,360
It's about this big.

382
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,904
You didn't see it when you were
at Go Eun-seo's place?

383
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,865
The culprit stopped committing crimes

384
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,034
when he failed
in his attempt at "disease" in 1994.

385
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,079
So there are three sins left
out of these seven sins.

386
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,789
Disease, adultery and jealousy.

387
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,125
If it's the same culprit,

388
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,045
you will find this red notebook
at Ms. Go Eun-seo's place.

389
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,214
Her affair falls under "adultery".

390
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,384
Please check Ms. Go's place.

391
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,637
If you see this red notebook,

392
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,182
there will be two more
missing person cases of women in Jongseo.

393
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,532
Don't look for witnesses.

394
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,201
You should find the culprit.

395
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,609
I'm sorry. I beg for your forgiveness.

396
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,236
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

397
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,988
I'm sorry. Please forgive--

398
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,049
I just have one more time to go.

399
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,151
Dear God of the Mountain.

400
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,737
I think this man is my destiny.

401
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,365
So since you're going to send
someone to me anyway…

402
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,245
please set me up with this guy.

403
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,626
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,254
Please forgive me.
I beg for your forgiveness.

405
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,547
Forgive me.

406
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,174
1993 JONGSEO
MISSING PERSON CASES

407
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,011
I checked his ID.

408
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,180
I think it is him.

409
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:52,982
Come in.

410
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:25,431
You seem to know a lot about the incidents
that happened in 1993.

411
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,975
But you were born in 1994, Mr. Cheon.

412
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,147
You are 29 years old.

413
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,232
How do you know so much

414
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,276
about the things that happened
29 years ago?

415
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,278
These happened before you were born.

416
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,074
I guess you watched a lot of movies.

417
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,244
I believe the suspect is
in his late 40s to early 50s.

418
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,622
-Are you an aspiring mystery writer?
-There will be another victim

419
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,956
when there's heavy snowfall.

420
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,918
You must've researched a lot.
Everything's on the Internet these days.

421
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,003
The culprit targets people around him.

422
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,839
You still have two more cases
of "Illness" and "Jealousy".

423
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,216
Interesting.

424
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,343
Are you not going to catch the culprit?

425
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,680
"Seven Sins for Women"? My goodness.

426
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,226
Hey, did you take these photos?

427
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,561
Did you make this?

428
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,314
-Detective Seo--
-This notebook, these papers…

429
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,484
The National Police Agency doesn't have
these things recorded as evidence.

430
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,486
-That's because--
-I know.

431
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,948
An interesting idea
for a detective fiction writer-to-be.

432
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,576
I don't have time to listen to all this.
Okay? Go home.

433
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,245
My goodness.

434
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,499
Hey, don't forget to get your ID
before you leave.

435
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,763
YOO JEONG-AH

436
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,936
If I had ignored you back then…

437
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,983
If I hadn't opened up to you…

438
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,408
Enjoy your meal.

439
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,119
One makgeolli and a scallion jeon, please.

440
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,245
Okay.

441
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,335
Right, his photo!

442
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:44,445
You are…

443
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,464
Baek-ryeon.

444
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,257
What brings you here?

445
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,760
What brings you here, Mr. Superman?

446
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,595
To this cliff?

447
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,683
How do you know this place?

448
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,686
This is the cliff.

449
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,522
The one I mentioned
I have to come to a thousand times.

450
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,651
Where someone is supposed to show up.

451
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,611
I see.

452
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,281
Why are you here?

453
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,286
I came for…

454
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,999
I come up here sometimes

455
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,043
because the view is nice.

456
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,551
Do you always come here this late?

457
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,680
It's not that.

458
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,226
I went down, but I forgot…

459
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,106
to bring something.

460
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,734
I came up to get it.

461
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,320
But it's not here.

462
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,704
It's gone. The real one's here instead.

463
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,001
What did you forget

464
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,839
that you would come all the way
up here again at this hour?

465
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,008
It's dangerous. Don't do that next time.

466
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,135
Let's go down.

467
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,604
Let's go.

468
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,054
Thank you for giving me a ride.

469
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,806
Get home safely.

470
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,233
I don't want you to be lonely.

471
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,860
Since you have been so lonely until now…

472
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,364
I want you to be with a good man,
even for just a bit,

473
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,911
and to be extremely happy.

474
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,094
Mr. Cheon Sang-hyuk.

475
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,597
Did you find my ideal man?

476
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,390
I'm still looking for him.

477
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,101
You said it wasn't the man
I texted you last time.

478
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,647
-I might as well find Zo In-sung--
-You won't find my ideal man.

479
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,898
Trust me.

480
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,317
I just need to find out
where Mr. Zo lives--

481
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,069
You will never find him.

482
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,491
Of course. He's a famous celebrity.

483
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,202
He probably lives in a place
with tight security.

484
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,038
But he still lives in Korea.

485
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,123
You won't find my ideal man…

486
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,212
because he's right in front of me
right now.

487
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,180
-What?
-It's you.

488
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,809
Cheon Sang-hyuk.

489
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,703
What you just said…

490
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,787
I like you.

491
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,499
-Take it back.
-Don't look for other guys.

492
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,585
-Take it back now.
-He's right in front of me.

493
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,752
-Stop.
-You are…

494
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,629
-I said stop!
-…the one I've been waiting for.

495
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,755
You're my type!

496
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,932
-I'll pretend I didn't just hear that.
-You heard me.

497
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,108
What do you mean you'll pretend
you didn't hear that?

498
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,568
That's so cowardly.

499
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,820
It's your turn to answer me now.

500
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,238
You told me before.

501
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,451
You said you don't want me to be lonely.

502
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,745
You want me to be extremely happy

503
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,749
with a good man, even for a short while,

504
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,500
because I've been so lonely.

505
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,171
A good man who will make me happy.

506
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,964
To me…

507
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,508
you're that man.

508
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,063
To me, you are just…

509
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,815
someone I feel sorry for.

510
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,030
Someone you feel sorry for?

511
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,617
You hiked up a cliff a thousand times
to find the right man.

512
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,161
To me, you're a foolish woman.

513
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,747
A pitiful woman who was born an orphan,

514
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,124
so she never received love
from her parents or her siblings.

515
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,542
This is why

516
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,128
you can't tell who likes you
or is just being nice.

517
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,881
And you're confessing your love
to the wrong guy.

518
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,300
You're a woman I feel sorry for.

519
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,809
-What did you say?
-You heard me. Should I say it again?

520
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,561
Did you mean that?

521
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,276
None of the things I just said were meant
to express any romantic interest in you.

522
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,073
I just wanted to set you up
with your ideal type

523
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,576
because I felt sorry for you.

524
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,661
So

525
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,163
don't even think of liking me.

526
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,125
Hey. Why are you crying?

527
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,048
Why are you crying? What happened?

528
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,114
-Mr. Superman.
-Are you okay?

529
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,117
I'm the man

530
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,495
you've been waiting for.

531
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,581
Since you've been so lonely until now,

532
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,167
I want you to be with a good man,

533
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,877
even for just a bit,

534
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,004
and to be extremely happy.

535
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:47,427
None of the things I just said were meant
to express any romantic interest in you.

536
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,722
Yeah, right.

537
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,185
You were expressing interest in me.

538
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,135
I like you.

539
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,429
You are the one I've been waiting for.
You are my type!

540
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,281
YOO JEONG-AH

541
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,130
Hey.

542
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,133
You were crying all night.

543
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,220
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

544
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,346
It's today.

545
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,724
-Today's my thousandth time.
-Thousandth?

546
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,601
What? Hey!

547
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,812
You are finally seeing
the face of your man?

548
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,941
Do you remember my nickname from college?

549
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,234
Your nickname from college?

550
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,402
"Shaman's Eye"?

551
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,820
People called me that

552
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,324
because I could tell if people were sick
with just one glance.

553
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,492
What about it?

554
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,370
His eyes were telling me
something different.

555
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,957
How dare he try to fool me.

556
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,626
Hey.

557
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,379
You're comparing apples to oranges.

558
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,589
It's in a completely different category.

559
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,549
You can't put those two like that.

560
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,802
I believe in what I saw.

561
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,226
That's exactly what a stalker would say.

562
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,812
Oh, dear.

563
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,912
He kills the witnesses no matter what.

564
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,123
Don't look for witnesses.

565
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,792
You should find the culprit.

566
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:02,766
Yes?

567
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,685
I got the caller's number
from that burner phone.

568
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,899
The technician who installed
the security camera called someone.

569
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:15,153
The number is 02-093-3829.
It's from Pyomyung Building.

570
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,530
That's where Kim Myeong-sik works.

571
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:21,326
While I was looking into
Ms. Go Eun-seo's recent whereabouts,

572
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,952
I found out that she was pregnant.

573
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,162
-She was pregnant?
-Yes.

574
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,791
I think that's why she's been having
problems with Kim Myeong-sik lately.

575
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,253
Okay. I'll be right there.

576
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,172
Alexandra.

577
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,925
He's your new daddy. Say hello.

578
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,177
My goodness.

579
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,263
-How are you?
-Dr. Oh is off work today.

580
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,183
I'm in charge of this meaningful reunion.

581
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,269
We're going home thanks to you. Thank you.

582
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,897
Is everything okay with Dr. Oh?

583
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,023
Of course.

584
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,609
She took a day off
because it's a meaningful day for her.

585
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,778
A meaningful day?

586
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,655
Good.

587
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,990
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

588
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,535
-Goodness.
-My goodness! It's raining.

589
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,080
-Do you have an umbrella?
-It's all right.

590
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,373
I brought my car.

591
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,127
Hey, could you walk him to his car
with an umbrella?

592
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,671
-Okay.
-No, I'm good.

593
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,301
Is that yours?

594
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,512
Yes. Why?

595
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:29,018
Did you use that umbrella
on the night of the heavy snowfall

596
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,603
on December 21?

597
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,772
December 21?

598
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,358
On the night of heavy snowfall…

599
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,653
I lent it to Dr. Oh.

600
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,363
Dr. Oh…

601
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,032
Dr. Oh Baek-ryeon?

602
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,077
Yeah.

603
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,413
Go up and check on Kim Myeong-sik
right now.

604
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,422
This stop is

605
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:01,176
the entrance to Inwangsan Mountain.

606
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,409
Hurry!

607
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,204
Hey, this way!

608
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,836
Excuse me. Where is Mr. Kim Myeong-sik?

609
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,130
He's not here today. He took the day off.

610
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,846
Kim Myeong-sik is off work today, sir.

611
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,181
Okay, I got it.

612
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,653
Do you know what time it is?
Why aren't you making breakfast?

613
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,006
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

614
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,852
Welcome.

615
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,272
Dr. Oh took a day off today.

616
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,357
I see.

617
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,028
-Is she sick?
-No, it's not that.

618
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,740
I'll come back next time.

619
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,242
Goodbye.

620
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,496
So Dr. Oh is the witness
of that Inwangsan Mountain's

621
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,540
missing person case
that was all over the news?

622
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,126
-Yes!
-She used this umbrella that night?

623
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,586
What did you just say?

624
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:02,255
Baek-ryeon is the witness of that case?

625
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,384
Where is she right now?

626
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,639
Please.

627
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:13,808
Please.

628
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,022
-The number you dialed cannot be reached…
-Damn it.

629
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,025
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

630
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,152
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

631
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,322
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

632
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,449
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

633
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,095
One thousand.

634
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,870
Is that you, Sang-hyuk?

635
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,713
Who--

636
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,257
Who's there?

637
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,312
Baek-ryeon!

638
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,147
Oh Baek-ryeon--

639
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,871
You are…

640
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,557
You forgot my warning again.

641
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,145
I told you not to
open up your heart to a lady.

642
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,870
You're so foolish.

643
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,289
I told you.

644
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,708
Humans and fairies can't be together.

645
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,172
Remember.

646
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,509
The moment you open up your heart
to a lady,

647
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,596
it will end in tragedy.

648
00:50:58,473 --> 00:51:01,476
A cruel and heartbreaking tragedy.

649
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:05,938
You have

650
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,233
no love whatsoever.

651
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:10,735
I will not…

652
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,071
set you up

653
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,991
with anyone.

654
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,104
So keep your distance.

655
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:53,694
That's the only thing you can do.

656
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,512
I'm going to kill you.

657
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,376
You foolish thing.

658
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,922
The life of an individual
without a red thread of fate…

659
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,050
will end in tragedy.

660
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:01,155
In the end, it's up to them

661
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,575
to recognize each other.

662
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,620
Are you okay?

663
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:48,828
-Oh, my gosh!
-I'd like to report a missing person.

664
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,538
Please search Inwangsan Mountain
right now.

665
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,914
A missing person?

666
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,126
Missing?

667
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,961
That lady is missing?

668
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:01,507
Yes. And you are the witness of that case.

669
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,723
Does fate not want us to meet again?

670
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,599
According to the security camera footage,

671
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:14,061
you were looking at this parking lot
at that specific hour.

672
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,044
So that man in black…

673
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,338
Man in black?

674
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,175
Is there anyone that comes to mind?

675
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:53,184
INWANGSAN MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE

676
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,353
So tell me.

677
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:59,482
How are you related to the missing lady?

678
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:00,941
Are you her family?

679
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,652
-No.
-Are you a relative?

680
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,529
-No.
-Are you her boyfriend?

681
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,283
-No.
-Then who are you?

682
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:11,994
-I'm not related to her.
-Gosh!

683
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,706
Who are you? Why are you asking the police

684
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,125
to search for a woman
who has nothing to do with you?

685
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:21,170
What did you say about Inwangsan Mountain?

686
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:22,880
Send search troops?

687
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,633
Hey, punk!
What do you take the police for?

688
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,926
-My goodness.
-Hold on.

689
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,723
This is the woman.

690
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,101
-This flower-patterned umbrella.
-Wait.

691
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,979
Do you know
this flower-patterned umbrella lady?

692
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:42,191
Yes. She is the missing woman.

693
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,609
Sang-hyuk?

694
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,821
What brings you here?

695
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,323
Baek-ryeon?

696
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,410
Where did you get all hurt like this?

697
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,082
Baek-ryeon?

698
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,708
Blood.

699
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,169
What's with all this blood?
Did you get hurt?

700
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,131
Goodness, what's all this?

701
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,383
Do you think the police are a joke?

702
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,136
You asked us to search for her

703
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,805
just because your girlfriend didn't
pick up the phone?

704
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,057
Hey, Detective Park.
They are not a couple.

705
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:16,475
I called you so many times!

706
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,394
I didn't know. It was in my bag.

707
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,271
Why did you call me so many times?

708
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,315
Hey, you two.
Finish up your love drama at home.

709
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,109
I told you that they're not a couple.

710
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,487
-I mean--
-Let's disinfect the wounds first.

711
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,199
Excuse me.
Do you have a first aid kit here?

712
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,369
Why aren't you doing anything
when this man is injured?

713
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,121
Hold on.

714
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,040
-I'm fine.
-My gosh.

715
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,584
What's happened?

716
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,044
-Why did you…
-Do you know how worried I was?

717
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,921
Why are you glaring at me?

718
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:48,174
He couldn't reach his girlfriend
for a second

719
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,758
so he told us to search for her.

720
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,802
He thinks the police are so free!
Glare at him.

721
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,513
-She's not his girlfriend.
-Here's the first aid kit.

722
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,348
Take a seat here.

723
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:57,433
Hurry up.

724
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,438
Oh, my goodness.

725
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,399
What on earth happened?

726
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,028
Did you get into a fight?

727
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,989
Why did you get beaten up?

728
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,366
You were good at fighting last time.
What happened?

729
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:17,578
From now on,

730
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,330
answer your phone.

731
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,253
Okay. I'll tell the captain.

732
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:27,838
Look. Look at them.

733
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:31,091
See? They're obviously a couple!

734
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,719
They're not a couple!
She's just treating him.

735
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,095
She's a vet!

736
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,514
A vet? Then is that guy a dog?

737
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,350
-Is he a cat?
-He's neither a dog nor a cat.

738
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,809
He's a human, an animal.

739
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:42,686
Hey! Animal, my foot!

740
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,480
-Hey?
-Yes.

741
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,565
-Did you just call me "hey"?
-Yes.

742
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,400
-Did you? My gosh!
-Goodness.

743
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:51,070
-What's going on?
-My gosh!

744
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,821
-My goodness!
-Sang-hyuk, is that you?

745
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,115
What brings you here, sir?

746
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,909
Sir?

747
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,119
Why is he calling him "sir"?

748
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,830
What happened to you?

749
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:05,042
You should go to the hospital.
What are you doing here?

750
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,002
Dae-sik.

751
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,088
What on earth happened?

752
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:14,551
-Dae-sik?
-What do you make of this now?

753
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:16,887
I have no idea.

754
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,640
I really don't get what's happening.

755
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,852
Come on. There's no reason
why he would call him "sir".

756
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,356
The chief looks obviously older than him.

757
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,277
He doesn't look just a little older.
They look like uncle and nephew.

758
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,197
Maybe that's the case.

759
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,117
They could be distantly related,
and their family could be

760
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,827
a family that's really strict
about hierarchy.

761
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,164
Why else would an old man
run to a young man

762
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,003
and treat him like he's someone
who's much older than him?

763
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,463
That has to be it!

764
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:53,966
Is our chief from a very traditional
and prestigious family?

765
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,051
So you're saying they're relatives?

766
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,219
Right.

767
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,930
Didn't you treat
that young man badly earlier?

768
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,558
You were speaking down to him.

769
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:08,188
Oh, my gosh.

770
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,569
Here. Drink this, sir.
That must've scared you a lot.

771
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,698
If my girlfriend was the witness
of a sensitive case,

772
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,199
I would've done that too.

773
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,951
I would've been worried
if she wasn't answering her phone.

774
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,370
I would've had the army look for her too.

775
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:24,955
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

776
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,000
She's not my girlfriend.

777
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,085
Come on. I know she is.

778
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,879
You two were so sweet.

779
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,422
I could tell you were a couple.

780
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,632
Is it not official yet?

781
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,176
Or is it just a fling?

782
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:39,928
Good job.

783
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,515
Baek-ryeon.

784
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,226
-Let's go.
-Wait.

785
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,023
The police will take
the witness home safely.

786
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,486
Save it. You should use the time
to get the culprit.

787
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:56,904
Stop bringing the witnesses here.

788
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,202
Let's let her decide then.

789
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,663
Let's ask her if she wants to go home
with the police

790
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:08,582
or with a civilian.

791
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:19,927
That's a good idea.

792
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:35,275
I choose…

793
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,969
