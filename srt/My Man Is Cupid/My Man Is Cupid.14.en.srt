1
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,580
Thank you.

2
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:45,921
I love all the moments I was excited
and happy because I met you.

3
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,216
I love them all.

4
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,059
The first time I saw you and all the times
I spent with you since then.

5
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,562
As wild grass,

6
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,439
a wild flower,

7
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,149
a bug and a butterfly.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,945
After being reborn like that…

9
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,741
Even when I was 19 years old,
and 29 years old as well.

10
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,250
-How did you--
-Thank you for being by my side

11
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,460
and in front of me.

12
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,046
-Baek-ryeon.
-I love you.

13
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,341
No matter what you are.

14
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,326
So when you fell off the cliff…

15
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,328
I had killed myself.

16
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,246
Why did you do that?

17
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,249
He said I had to be reborn
to meet you again.

18
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,753
He told me I'd have two chances
as a human.

19
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,048
Who? Who told you that?

20
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,425
It was a kid. A little boy.

21
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,053
I think I saw his face.

22
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,687
But if you keep changing like this,

23
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,689
doesn't it mean you'll disappear soon?

24
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,858
It's metamorphosis, right?

25
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,693
You remember?

26
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,446
When will it start?

27
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,157
And when will you come back
once it starts?

28
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,117
Once it starts, it takes about

29
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,577
-a week or so.
-A week?

30
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,537
That's not bad.

31
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,581
You can go. Take as much time as you need.

32
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,459
-Sometimes, it takes a month.
-A month?

33
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,419
Some trips take a month.

34
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,504
Now that I think about it,

35
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,130
-it lasted a year once.
-That's too long.

36
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,466
Actually, there was one
that lasted two years too.

37
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,136
I can just pretend that you went
to the army for two years.

38
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,972
Baek-ryeon.

39
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,432
-There was one that lasted five years.
-Five years?

40
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,559
Sometimes it took ten years.

41
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:28,978
Ten years?

42
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,688
That's ridiculous!

43
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,524
Even long-distance couples
can see each other from time to time

44
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,900
if they fly back and forth.

45
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,277
People in the army
can even make video calls these days.

46
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,364
But I can't even see you or talk to you
once you go into metamorphosis.

47
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,157
And you want me to wait ten years?

48
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,618
Are you serious? Ten years?

49
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,996
I can't wait that long.

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,373
Listen, Baek-ryeon.

51
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,166
The metamorphosis
I'm going through this time--

52
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,085
Why do you even go through it?

53
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,754
I explained it to you last time.

54
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,381
Five hundred years ago, my wings--

55
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,883
Your baby face.
It's because of that, right?

56
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,521
It's a necessary process to maintain

57
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,606
a baby face,
which is essential to a fairy.

58
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,066
That's what metamorphosis is.

59
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,158
If that's the case, reject it.

60
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,492
Don't go through with it.

61
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,372
-Reject it?
-I didn't tell you this before,

62
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,751
but your baby face
makes me very uncomfortable.

63
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,085
You look too young.

64
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,882
It would be perfect
if you look just a little older.

65
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,427
You can't be 500 years old.
You look too young.

66
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,974
There are sheet masks and beauty devices
that could prevent you from aging

67
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,560
even if you don't
go through metamorphosis.

68
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,314
Why don't you use them
and grow old with me in this lifetime?

69
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,983
You can go through it all at once
when I die.

70
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,778
I won't care if you'll be away
for ten or a hundred years,

71
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,571
because I'd be dead by then.

72
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,198
Okay?

73
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,784
-Well--
-What's that face?

74
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,703
You don't want that?
You can't give up on looking young?

75
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,583
Just to meet you again, I became a weed,

76
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,585
a fly, a moth

77
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,047
and a dung beetle in a field of poop
the past 500 years.

78
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,342
But you can't even give up your baby face.

79
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,261
-Come on, Baek-ryeon.
-Choose. Is it me or your face?

80
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,347
If I could choose, I would.

81
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,182
-But--
-But what?

82
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,102
-I can't do that.
-You can't?

83
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,188
-It's because--
-I don't want to hear it anymore.

84
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,898
You're so firm about it.

85
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,901
-Baek-ryeon--
-We should call it a day now.

86
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,947
I've had enough of your bewitching face
for today.

87
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,533
-I need time to think.
-But…

88
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,911
Baek-ryeon!

89
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,685
Did I roll around in cow and horse poop
just to be treated like this?

90
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,188
I clearly thought too highly of him.

91
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,440
I can't believe he surprised me
with a twist like this.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,734
Damn it!

93
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,450
-How could you do that?
-What do you mean?

94
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,078
-Come to your senses!
-Yes, come to your senses!

95
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:38,125
You both ruined
the happiest moment of my life!

96
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,336
You're a fairy and she's a human. Wake up.

97
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,463
Yes, it's almost time for us to go.

98
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,466
-It's too late now.
-You two dated all the women you want.

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,926
But I just met her!

100
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,511
You couldn't give me a break?

101
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,971
You ruined everything!

102
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,765
She was the first female human

103
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,226
who said I was attractive!

104
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,980
She said

105
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,315
you were attractive?

106
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,400
How?

107
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,444
She said I was unexpectedly charming!

108
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,946
But at that moment,

109
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,744
I disappeared,
leaving behind a bill for 285,000 won.

110
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,496
-What is she going to think of me?
-She probably thinks you're a jerk.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,664
Damn it.

112
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,918
That was definitely unexpected.

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,643
EP14. JEALOUSY

114
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,480
Am I going crazy?

115
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,065
Am I drunk?

116
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,817
I don't get what the problem is.

117
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,611
Maybe it needs something more.

118
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,488
Like what?

119
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,532
I don't know.

120
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,409
You guys should figure it out.

121
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,828
What did you say?
You brought us into this mess.

122
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,372
Come out!

123
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,624
Samsin, come out right now!

124
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,962
I'll burn down everything too!

125
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,758
Damn it. Damn it.

126
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,887
I'm going to burn
these burdensome wings too!

127
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,931
I'll go back to Do-ra right now--

128
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,182
My gosh, it's hot!

129
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,392
That burns!

130
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,437
Hey! Are you crazy?

131
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,274
You'll never be able to burn your wings.
It's too hot for you.

132
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,070
You're ruthless.

133
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,699
He's such a ruthless guy.

134
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,119
How did he endure this?

135
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,414
Do-ra…

136
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,916
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,295
It's too hot.

138
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,049
It's just too hot.

139
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,093
I can't do this.

140
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,128
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

141
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,427
Chief, you know about Sang-hyuk.

142
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,348
Who on earth is he?

143
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,237
I had killed myself.

144
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,365
He said I had to be reborn
to meet you again.

145
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,159
He told me I'd have two chances
as a human.

146
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,870
Who? Who told you that?

147
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,248
It was a kid. A little boy.

148
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,376
I wonder who that kid is.

149
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,338
"Two chances as a human."

150
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,304
I'm about to go through
my last metamorphosis.

151
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,557
What are the chances?

152
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,658
He looks like someone.

153
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,957
He's that crazy king! Isn't he?

154
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,590
Sang-hyuk, you're Cupid.

155
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,844
I guess they're Cupids too.

156
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,763
Is Ddaeng-chil one too?

157
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,892
I don't see the dog today.

158
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,061
Are you here to see Ddaeng-chil?

159
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,439
-When it's this late?
-Of course not.

160
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,526
I need to speak to him in private.

161
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,278
Could you give us a minute?

162
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,791
How did he know?

163
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,377
Shouldn't we run away?

164
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,046
You said he's a cop.

165
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,007
A cop wouldn't have come at this hour
to arrest a fairy. What for?

166
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,177
Maybe he wants to eat us!

167
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,804
We are just delicate and fragile fairies.

168
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,932
Who said he's attractive?

169
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,767
Geez.

170
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,607
So you found out the truth.

171
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,276
I told you it was just a matter of time.

172
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,946
If you need help urgently
in terms of my area of expertise,

173
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,614
we can talk tomorrow morning.

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,742
We need to sleep at night too.

175
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,247
You know the woman in the photo, right?

176
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,961
I need to know who she is.

177
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,675
From this man who was with her.

178
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,058
Did you go to my old house?

179
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,602
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask for your permission.

180
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,522
Humans only ask other humans
for permission.

181
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,193
Who is this woman?

182
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,362
I don't think I have to answer that.

183
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,989
I'll ask you again.

184
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,491
Is she Baek-ryeon?

185
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:57,105
I need to know
why I'm in the middle of you two.

186
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,737
You said you saw your past life.

187
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,530
Then you should know.

188
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,824
You weren't in my past life.

189
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,495
But the woman in my memory was with you.

190
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,914
I need to know what happened.

191
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,087
Five hundred years ago…

192
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,050
you killed me.

193
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,267
I killed you?

194
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,521
Then how are you standing
before me right now?

195
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,983
You saw it. You saw what I'm capable of.

196
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,528
And you want to know who that woman is?

197
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,406
I'll tell you what.

198
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,452
You tried to kill that woman as well
500 years ago.

199
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,872
What?

200
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,917
You said that woman is in your memories.

201
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,295
You should die for me.

202
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,636
MY WOMAN

203
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,354
Yes, Baek-ryeon.

204
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,564
I'm going to bed now.

205
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,526
You're not going to go into metamorphosis
while I'm asleep, right?

206
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,860
I won't go through it tonight.

207
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,028
Are you sure?

208
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,655
I'm sure. Don't worry.

209
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,198
How can I believe you?

210
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,911
Call me as soon as
you wake up tomorrow. Okay?

211
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,913
I will.

212
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,790
Good night, my woman.

213
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,557
What was that?

214
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,641
"My woman?"

215
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,398
"My woman."

216
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,282
You killed me 500 years ago.

217
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,079
You tried to kill that woman as well
500 years ago.

218
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,959
I also want to know why we met again.

219
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,339
I'm sure this was all his doing.

220
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,592
Who?

221
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,721
Does he not exist in your memories?

222
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,687
Who is he talking about?

223
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,243
Don't go!

224
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,424
MY MAN

225
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,227
Please answer the phone.

226
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,400
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

227
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,452
Don't tell me he's gone.

228
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,790
Yes, Baek-ryeon.

229
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,045
Hello?

230
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,171
Hello? Baek-ryeon?

231
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,924
Why did it take you so long
to answer the phone?

232
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,427
-What?
-You said you'd call me when you wake up.

233
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,388
You promised.

234
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,224
I just got out of the shower
and was about to call you.

235
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,477
You should have called me
before you took a shower. Geez.

236
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,606
I hate metamorphosis. It's the worst!

237
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,792
What if you go through metamorphosis
while I'm working?

238
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,961
Promise me you won't go through it.

239
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,089
That's not something I can promise.

240
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,049
My gosh.

241
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,968
Wait.

242
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,970
Baek-ryeon. Geez.

243
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,726
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

244
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,399
Detective Seo, you're here.

245
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,567
Hello.

246
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,361
I was told that
Alexandra needs a regular checkup.

247
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,530
Has it been that long already?

248
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,532
Hello, Alexandra.

249
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,327
How have you been?

250
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,704
Let me see if you got better.

251
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,919
A major surgery can destabilize
the level of inflammation for a while.

252
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,672
But you took good care of her.
Her results are much better.

253
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,593
Her white blood cell
and CRP levels are all okay.

254
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,887
You are a good guardian.

255
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,724
Alexandra must have done
a lot of good deeds in her past life.

256
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,935
She is lucky to have met you,
Detective Seo.

257
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,700
Why do you think we met again?

258
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,623
Why did I try to kill you back then?

259
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,212
I have to go now.

260
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,091
Hold on a second.

261
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,353
Come on.

262
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,647
Detective Seo.

263
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,482
Here.

264
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,734
Apply it where you got hurt.

265
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,326
You're bound to get hurt as a detective.
You need one of these effective ointments.

266
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,414
I applied it on someone.
It works right away.

267
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,960
Do your best to wipe out
all the bad guys today.

268
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,253
Detective Seo.

269
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,803
Jealousy.

270
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,223
Some types of jealousy
are great for relationships.

271
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,271
I guess Dong-gu is not here today.

272
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:54,939
You're right.

273
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,316
He usually comes half an hour early.

274
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,780
Maybe he got a girlfriend.

275
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,368
-The hamburger girl.
-That must be it.

276
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,746
They could be eating the set meals.

277
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,164
I'm so jealous.

278
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,666
Let's begin the class.

279
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,087
Ms. Ahn.

280
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,221
You're prettier than Kim Tae-hee to me.

281
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,349
Dong-gu.

282
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,992
It helps you get interested
in him or her again.

283
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,370
On the other hand, there's a type
of jealousy that's bad for relationships.

284
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,081
You should never do this.

285
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,166
The more you do it,
the more obsessed you become.

286
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,292
Obsession leads to

287
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,586
destruction.

288
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,343
I'll save you, Chae-yeon. Stop the car!

289
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,637
-Go away!
-Stop the car!

290
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,055
Chae-yeon is mine.

291
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,389
Don't fight over me.

292
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,100
No one can choose me.

293
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,310
Stop the car right now! This is an order.

294
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,728
There's something here.

295
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,484
What's that?

296
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,819
It's on.

297
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,571
Hey!

298
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,032
What are you doing in someone else's car?
Everyone, get out.

299
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,159
I know it's a crappy car,

300
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,454
but you can't go into someone else's car
without permission.

301
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,680
FORENSIC SERVICE

302
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,348
My gosh.

303
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,350
Please tell us what happened in detail.

304
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,896
These kids were playing in the car.
I told them to get out.

305
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,399
And I came over here
and I saw that the car trunk was open.

306
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,901
When I opened it, I saw a dead body.

307
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,320
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

308
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,035
Ms. Song was famous.

309
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,120
LEE HYEON-JI

310
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,622
She flirted with a guy in every division.

311
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,292
One of them was Mr. Kim Myeong-sik.

312
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,837
But after he was investigated
by the police as a suspect

313
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,381
of the famous Inwangsan Mountain
missing woman's case…

314
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,342
You are under arrest
for the murder of Ms. Go Eun-seo.

315
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,720
That's when Ms. Song started
to stay away from Mr. Kim.

316
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,849
Ms. Song.

317
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,851
AIN DRUG STORE

318
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:38,603
It's an STD.

319
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,354
AIN DRUG STORE

320
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,107
He gave her the notebook
knowing that she had an STD,

321
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,526
just like he gave Go Eun-seo
the Adultery notebook.

322
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,320
But don't you think it's strange?

323
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,571
Why? What do you mean?

324
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,823
I just feel that it's strange.

325
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,033
It's strange.

326
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,872
Let's go.

327
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,956
Okay.

328
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,335
DNA COMPARISON RESULT

329
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,551
Your DNA was found
on Song Jin-ah's fingertips.

330
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,261
DNA SAMPLES ARE
FROM THE SAME INDIVIDUAL

331
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,725
I only killed Go Eun-seo.

332
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,019
I didn't kill Ms. Song.

333
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,942
The signs say she was strangled.

334
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,069
Song Jin-ah fought back,

335
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,154
and in the process,
she scratched a part of your body

336
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,572
and it was left as evidence.

337
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,700
I told you not to see other men!

338
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,495
Who do you think you are?
I just flirted with you. That's all.

339
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,038
Stop acting like you're my husband!

340
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,431
You killed her because you were mad
that she had a change of heart.

341
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,602
It…

342
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,479
It wasn't me.

343
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,940
I didn't kill her!

344
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,737
Damn it!

345
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,074
I'm sorry.

346
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,619
Are you okay?

347
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:32,008
A red notebook was found
inside Song Jin-ah's studio.

348
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,719
You did this, right?

349
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,638
DISEASE

350
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,182
Did you do this?

351
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,601
How did you get this?

352
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,400
I want to stop.

353
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,112
Officer!

354
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,864
I want to get out.

355
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,116
Officer!

356
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,785
Officer!

357
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,454
I want to leave!

358
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,208
The body of a woman in her 30s
who went missing ten days ago was found

359
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,294
in a mountain in Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.

360
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:12,089
Her body was found in the trunk of a car
with an unidentified license plate.

361
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,841
To find out the exact cause of death,

362
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,385
National Forensic Service is performing
an autopsy.

363
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,179
Meanwhile, Song's death is…

364
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,263
I'm safe.

365
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,640
It's safe here.

366
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,113
What do you think the problem is?

367
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:44,080
Have you ever missed any shots?

368
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,623
No, never.

369
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,792
That's not true.

370
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,502
You missed this.

371
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,890
Shoot it now.

372
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,836
You're right. I did miss a shot.

373
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,754
I missed this shot.

374
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,925
I think I missed a shot before too.

375
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,765
You missed a shot too? When?

376
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,165
BANG MYEONG-SOO DATING ACADEMY

377
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,708
Yong-bok and Il-yong,

378
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,295
tell me five things
that are attractive about you.

379
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,671
Il-yong, you can go first.

380
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,340
Right.

381
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,348
There's no right or wrong.

382
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,433
Tell me your charms.

383
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,146
Try to think of your fifth charm.

384
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,773
Have you thought about it?
What kind of charms do you have?

385
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,151
What's the third one?
Is it the same as the first one?

386
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,195
Hold on. What's the second one?

387
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,378
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

388
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,005
Yes, goodbye.

389
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,715
Make sure you do your homework.

390
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,799
-Okay.
-Yes.

391
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,971
-What's this?
-What's this?

392
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,936
Ms. Ahn, I think this is for you.

393
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,232
MS. AHN DO-RA

394
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,567
-Then this must be for you too.
-Goodness.

395
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,431
What? He just left this?

396
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,779
I also want to know why we met again.

397
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,157
I'm sure this was all his doing.

398
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,867
Who?

399
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,789
He said that the last case won't happen.

400
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,708
That's why it's Kim Myeong-sik!

401
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,419
He's in the detention center.
What can he do?

402
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,213
And the evidence is so clear.

403
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,383
-Don't you think it's strange?
-What is it again?

404
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,012
The body was found
right when we needed it.

405
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,930
How come there's evidence
on the dead body?

406
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,892
We found Eun-seo's body
in the abandoned factory

407
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,769
when he said he didn't kill her.

408
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,272
So that's when he admitted
that he killed Go Eun-seo.

409
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,941
But he kept insisting
that he didn't kill Song Jin-ah.

410
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,485
And then her dead body just showed up.

411
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,863
Don't you think it's strange?

412
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,783
What do you think, sir?

413
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,497
Sir.

414
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,041
Sorry?

415
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,251
What did you say?

416
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,419
Anyway,

417
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,340
I still think
the guy in black is suspicious.

418
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,303

LESS THAN 175 CM TALL

GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

420
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,598
I'M WAITING INSIDE THE CAR SO

421
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,244
I'M WAITING INSIDE THE CAR SO

422
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,042
What if he disappears
while he's waiting for me in the car?

423
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,336
What if it takes a hundred years
for him to come back?

424
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,860
Sang-hyuk.

425
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,102
How can he really disappear?

426
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,689
Sang-hyuk.

427
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,316
Baek-ryeon.

428
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,407
Sang-hyuk.

429
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,242
Baek-ryeon.

430
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,302
I thought you were gone.

431
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,231
I finally met you.

432
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,069
I just found out everything.

433
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,366
What am I supposed to do
if you disappear like that?

434
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,041
What am I supposed to do
if you disappear before I'm ready?

435
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,931
Baek-ryeon,

436
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,267
wanna spend the night with me today?

437
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,274
I want to be with you tonight.

438
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,872
Let's stay together, Baek-ryeon.

439
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,961
Yes, let's stay together,

440
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,088
Sang-hyuk.

441
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,872
Where are you?

442
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,790
Come out.

443
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,211
Let's drink outside today
so we can refresh ourselves.

444
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,506
What?

445
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,924
Where?

446
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,885
I'm refreshing myself.

447
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,428
I'm outside.

448
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,389
Somewhere where the mountain is cool,
the water is nice and the air is fresh.

449
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:26,435
Who did you go with to that place
at this hour?

450
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,186
With who?

451
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,771
Superman?

452
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,856
You got it.

453
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,193
Do I have to say more? I'm hanging up.

454
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,412
Wow.

455
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,048
Are you here alone?

456
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,969
Yes.

457
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,390
But we should drink together.

458
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,988
I think he's so funny.

459
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,406
What's so funny about him?

460
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,575
He's funny.

461
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,580
Why don't we go out
and have another drink?

462
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,792
Should we?

463
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,918
Okay, let's do that.

464
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,797
I need to use the restroom first.

465
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,049
-Over there.
-Okay.

466
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,468
See you.

467
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,853
Hey.

468
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,938
Me?

469
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,315
I'm at the bar that we came to before.

470
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:56,984
I just got a girl.

471
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,403
I'll be leaving soon.

472
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,238
It's just a one-night stand.

473
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,158
I'll talk to you later.

474
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:06,743
Bye.

475
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:59,212
Where's the man who was here?

476
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,715
He ran away.

477
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,509
-He ran away?
-Yes.

478
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,721
-Why did he run away?
-By the way…

479
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,306
Here.

480
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,694
TOTAL: 570,000 WON

481
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,242
Those guys are ridiculous.

482
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:35,082
Why do they all leave me with the checks?

483
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,168
Did they lend me money or what?

484
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,712
They're ridiculous.

485
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,217
Oh, my.

486
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,678
They must be so happy.

487
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,894
There we go.

488
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,522
Okay.

489
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,694
Okay.

490
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,489
Why isn't this working?

491
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,534
Come on!

492
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,912
I have to fly.

493
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,924
I'm flying!

494
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,013
I'm flying!

495
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,836
This is fun!

496
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:31,990
Oh, my gosh.

497
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,242
Goodness.

498
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,079
Do you want a drink?

499
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,915
We drank earlier though.

500
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,418
Let's have one more drink.

501
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,117
You are still here.

502
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,537
I stayed here without even moving.

503
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,187
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

506
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,386
Are you sure you aren't going to be tired?

507
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,514
I just recharged. Why would I be tired?
I'm fine.

508
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,435
I'll wait for you
until your night shift is over.

509
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,520
Thank you.

510
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,522
You'll be here in ten minutes?

511
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,190
You're lying.

512
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,278
You're lying.

513
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,786
What's wrong?

514
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,331
I just remembered his voice.

515
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,216
-Stay in two lines.
-Come out.

516
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,136
-Hurry up and move.
-Stay in two lines.

517
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,723
Hurry up and line up so we can go eat.

518

Prisoner 1275.

519
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,078
It's time to eat.

520
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,204
Get up.

521
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,504
Are you sick?

522
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,132
I…

523
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,344
I'm burning up with a fever.

524
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,263
Officer, could you get me some medicine?

525
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,890
Wait for a second.

526
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,042
You brought the medicine?

527
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,670
Can you also get me a cup of water?

528
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,842
Who…

529
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:30,927
Who are you?

530
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:36,140
That last case won't happen.

531
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,143
Because I'm in here.

00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,402
It's because you're not a good kid.

My wife has a son from a one-night stand.

535
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,078
Does anyone live there?

536
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,081
He's a college student
from the countryside.

537
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,126
But he looks like a teenager.

You're lying.

540
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,613
I'll be right back.

541
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,532
Where are you going?

542
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,868
I have to look into something.

543
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,328
Don't go anywhere after work. Stay here.

544
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,038
Don't go anywhere, okay?

545
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:46,294
Don't disappear too.
Stay by my side, okay?

546
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,338
I'll be back.

547
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,693
This is the security camera footage
from the day she went missing.

Hello, Homicide Unit One.

551
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,107
What?

552
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,734
What happened to Kim Myeong-sik?

CHEONGUN-DONG 14-2

555
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,986
It's quiet today.

556
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,115
How about tteokbokki
for a late-night snack?

557
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,533
Sounds good to me.

558
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:26,871
Please help.

559
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,789
What happened?

560
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,251
I dropped her by mistake.

561
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:33,544
She's not breathing.

562
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,131
-Let's go to the treatment room.
-Okay.

563
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,466
-This way, please.
-Yes.

564
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:41,928
She needs surgery right away

565
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,679
because there is
significant internal bleeding.

566
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,768
It's all my fault.
I dropped her by mistake.

567
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,229
Her blood type is 1.2.

568
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,691
There's none left. What should we do?

569
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,860
-Check with the other hospitals right now.
-Okay.

570
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,656
I'm calling
from Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

571
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,282
We need blood type 1.2 urgently.

572
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:04,867
Please save her.

573
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,035
-Yes.
-My dear Potato.

574
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,124
Doctor, there's blood.

575
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,044
Haengbok Hospital has it. It'll take
15 minutes to make a round trip by taxi.

576
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,128
-Go right now.
-Okay.

577
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,674
Please help me until she gets the blood.

578
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,008
Well…

579
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,386
How can I help you?

580
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,638
Hold this like this.

581
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,349
Okay.

Once she goes into surgery,
she will be fine soon after.

593
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:34,910
Don't worry too much.

594
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,289
You're lying.

595
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,834
You're lying.
