1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,869
The police are searching for a woman
in her 40s who went missing ten days ago

2
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,205
from a public parking lot near
Inwangsan Mountain, Jongseo-gu.

3
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,668
She stopped by a makgeolli restaurant
right before she went missing.

4
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,255
So the police are investigating
all the vendors in the area.

5
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,925
Go Eun-seo was born in 1976.

6
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,844
She lives in Sungin-dong, Jongseo-gu.

7
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,181
She's a nurse in the Department
of Rehabilitation at Myeongin Hospital.

8
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,726
On December 21st, at 11:15 p.m.,

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,897
she left a makgeolli place near
Inwangsan Mountain, Jongseo-gu.

10
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:10,321
She went missing on her way to
the public parking lot where her car was.

11
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,241
There are four surveillance cameras
in the vicinity.

12
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,535
But one of them wasn't working.

13
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,663
It was the camera that was facing
the public parking lot.

14
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,415
So? What about the other cameras?

15
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,543
One of the three filmed the restaurant.

16
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,670
The other one filmed the entrance
of Inwangsan Mountain.

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,216
The last one was facing the bus stop.

18
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,594
At that time,
a man was seen following her.

19
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,846
According to the statements
by the makgeolli place owner,

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,558
and the real estate agency owner,
Mr. Kim Tae-kwang,

21
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:43,979
we believe the incident happened
around this area.

22
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,024
The last person Ms. Go spoke to that day

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,944
was a 47-year-old man named
Kim Myeong-sik.

24
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,320
He's married.

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,531
Is she married too?

26
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,615
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,201
Does her husband know that she's cheating?

28
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,329
At the time of the incident, her husband,
Song Yeong-cheol,

29
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,248
was in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do
where he works.

30
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,875
And seven hours before she went missing,

31
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,919
he talked to her at 4:15 p.m.
for the last time.

32
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,882
He couldn't reach his wife for two days.
He reported her missing on December 23rd.

33
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:17,471
That makes her lover suspicious.

34
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:22,560
She left Yeon-ja's restaurant
after getting a call from Myeong-sik.

35
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,396
She was standing with this woman
for about a minute.

36
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:31,235
After that, Ms. Go went to the parking lot
and this woman went to the bus stop.

37
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,655
Her name?

38
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,282
I don't know her name.

39
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,910
All I know is that she's a pretty lady
who comes here once or twice a week

40
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,413
and has makgeolli and jeon.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,250
They drank together that night.

42
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,794
But they met for the first time.
That I know.

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,883
That missing lady paid for the bill.

44
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,554
If she's a regular,
can I see her payment history here?

45
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,769
I don't know why
but this woman only pays in cash.

46
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,647
There wasn't any mobile connection
that was detected that night.

47
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,650
The surveillance camera
on the bus was broken too.

48
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,369
I found a strange guy caught
on the surveillance camera.

49
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,289
It's a little hard to tell
because of the snow. But take a look.

50
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,674
Isn't that a gun?

51
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,636
Who is that guy?

52
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,797
You pretended like you were not.
But you're so predictable.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,131
Predictable?

54
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,718
Is that how you've been looking at me?
With such passion in your eyes?

55
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,762
I was looking at the painting near you.

56
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,515
-That one.
-I'm as beautiful as the painting, right?

57
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,812
-What?
-I have eyes in the back of my head.

58
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,358
It's because men stare so much
at me from behind.

59
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,783
Don't fall for me.

60
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,079
You'll get hurt if you fall for me.

61
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,209
I'm saving you too.

62
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,920
Don't fall for me
if you don't want to get hurt.

63
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,382
-I don't think you need to worry.
-Don't be so sure.

64
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,634
You'll fall for me
if you let your guard down.

65
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,395
By the way, what is this smell?

66
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,611
-What are you doing?
-Hold on. I smell something.

67
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,157
Smell? What smell?

68
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,535
Are you talking about that?

69
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:45,095
Hey, you're that lady.
The one who called Cupid a bastard.

70
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,059
I guess you hold a mean grudge.

71
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,936
You heard me wrong.

72
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,397
-I did?
-Yes.

73
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,024
You misheard me.

74
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,902
I said that Cupid is so sexy.

75
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,530
See? He's sexy.

76
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,622
What does that mean?

77
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,959
My goodness! Why do you
keep teaching a kid bad words?

78
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,796
Why do you keep making him
walk around alone?

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,215
You will be in big trouble
if he goes missing.

80
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,468
You don't know where kids would go
if you don't pay attention.

81
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,514
Also, "sexy" is a good word.

82
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,059
Let's just go, Joon.

83
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:49,743
Well, enjoy the sexy Cupid paintings.
I should get going.

84
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,070
EP2. DON'T FALL FOR ME,
YOU WILL GET HURT

85
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,660
Why is my heart beating so fast?

86
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,040
My gosh! What are you doing here?

87
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,420
I'm going home.

88
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,715
Why did you park here?

89
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,217
Is there a reason
I can't park my car here?

90
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,888
No.

91
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,270
I'll get going then.

92
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,430
I just want one shot at love.

93
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,351
I should have a heartwarming memory
of being with someone.

94
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,812
What in the world?
She really has no red thread of fate.

95
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,546
But unless the culprit is a psycho,
there's no way he'd be doing this here.

96
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,590
Aren't most criminals psychos?

97
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,346
Sir, I got the result.

98
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,640
-It's him.
-Let's go.

99
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,285
PYOMYUNG GROUP

100
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,169
-Mr. Kim.
-I'll call you back.

101
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,631
It's December 31st, 2021.

102
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:55,721
As of 7:30 p.m., you are under arrest
for the murder of Ms. Go Eun-seo.

103
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,805
What?

104
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,517
You have the right to an attorney,
to make rebuttals,

105
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,102
and you have the right to remain silent.

106
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,604
You can also contest the arrest
in a court of law.

107
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,793
You two didn't just have a cup of tea
and a few meals together.

108
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,131
CALL HISTORY

109
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,972
We found blood in your car.
We had the DNA tested.

110
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,058
It's Go Eun-seo's.

111
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,024
-We had a little fight in my car.
-It couldn't have been a little fight

112
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,359
if there's blood all over the car.

113
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,528
-We had a few drinks.
-So you got drunk. And beat her to death.

114
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,159
The day we fought wasn't the day
she went missing.

115
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,079
You met her that night too.

116
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,624
Ms. Go left the makgeolli place
after getting your call.

117
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,334
You're here?

118
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,586
Okay. I'll be right there.

119
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,009
You were seen entering at 11:00 p.m.

120
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,763
and leaving at 12:39 a.m.
on the surveillance camera.

121
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,932
It's true that I went there that night.

122
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,393
But I didn't get to meet her.

123
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,772
-The person you are calling is…
-I was waiting for her nearby.

124
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,150
But she didn't show up
even after an hour and a half.

125
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,611
I thought she was still mad at me.

126
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,114
It was snowing so hard.
Why did you wait outside the car?

127
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,825
I was going to find her.
She didn't pick up my calls.

128
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,992
Check the call records.

129
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,663
You sure you didn't do it on purpose
as if you were looking for her?

130
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,091
Is he the man you saw that night?

131
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,509
I think so.

132
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,304
I think the guy was slimmer.
He was shorter too.

133
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,310
You threw away Ms. Go's skirt
two days ago, right?

134
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,358
-Wake up.
-What?

135
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,360
-It's Kim Myeong-sik.
-Kim Myeong-sik?

136
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,154
That's him, right?

137
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,171
I didn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

138
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,507
The police are investigating
because she's missing.

139
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,970
-That's a lot of blood on the skirt.
-That's the night we fought.

140
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,722
Why did you take her skirt off?

141
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,849
I didn't take it off. She took it off.

142
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,477
She asked me to buy a new skirt
because of the blood.

143
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,770
So I bought a new one
from a nearby clothing store.

144
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,940
I only found out later
that she left it in the car.

145
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,526
Check the dates
of the security footage at the store.

146
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,321
You can even check
the credit card payment history.

147
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,209
He was wearing a black jacket
and a black hat.

148
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,336
I think…

149
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,632
he was about 175cm.

150
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,219
He looked shorter than 180cm.

151
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,679
That's strange.

152
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:31,019
I'm sure that the person I saw had
a similar build to him.

153
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:32,854
Goodness.

154
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,421
I wonder if how I felt earlier
is how men feel when they see me.

155
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,054
I should have asked for his number.

156
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,766
What's wrong with me?

157
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,812
NURSE KIM

158
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,855
Hey, Ms. Kim. What's wrong?

159
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,482
Dr. Oh, we have an emergency.

160
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,984
Why? What happened?

161
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,779
A car accident patient with a rebar
penetrating the abdomen just came in.

162
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,241
But I can't reach the chief
or the deputy head.

163
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,201
Only the internist is on duty.

164
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,954
I'll go. I'm nearby
so I'll be there in ten minutes.

165
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,666
What am I doing here?

166
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,174
What's with her?

167
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,023
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

168
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,450
Is it okay to just do the surgery?
We didn't get consent last time, and--

169
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,785
Then do you just want
to let the patient die like this?

170
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,038
I'll take responsibility. Let's start.

171
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,914
IN OPERATION

172
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,217
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

173
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,304
POPPY ANIMAL CLINIC

174
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,182
I didn't know there was a hospital here.

175
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,516
Is it new?

176
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,966
Good work.

177
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,802
-Good job.
-Good work.

178
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,969
Good job.

179
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,661
It's going to hurt a lot tonight.

180
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,288
But you have to hang in there.

181
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,805
-Good work.
-You did a good job.

182
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,225
-Please keep checking on the dog.
-Okay.

183
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,457
Everyone has a red thread of fate.

184
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,543
If it's thick, you find love in this life.

185
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,670
If it's thin,
you find love in your next life.

186
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,131
If it's long,
it means your love is still far away.

187
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,759
If it's short,
it means your love is very near you.

188
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,763
But…

189
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,310
she doesn't have one.

190
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,104
She doesn't have that red thread.

191
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,248
What? Again?

192
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,088
Don't you remember
what happened last month?

193
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,383
You performed surgery out of kindness.
But the guardian threw a fit.

194
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,260
You had to cover the cost.

195
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,470
They blamed you
for performing without their consent.

196
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,806
-What if they blame you again?
-I can cover the cost again.

197
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,392
Cover the cost again?
Do you think you're rich?

198
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,896
You live in a 20-year-old,
two-bedroom apartment with a roommate.

199
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,693
I get that it was an emergency,
but you should have asked the boss.

200
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,988
They said she wasn't answering.
She usually doesn't.

201
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,117
She knows calls this late at night
are usually emergencies like this.

202
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,743
I can't believe you're laughing.

203
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,746
It looks like you'll have
to cover the cost again.

204
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,957
You said the dog's owner is unconscious…

205
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,417
I saved the dog.

206
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,921
The dog didn't get hurt because of me.

207
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,673
It survived because of me.

208
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,599
That's why I'm so happy right now.

209
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,020
As long as you're happy.

210
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,105
It's your money, not mine.

211
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,398
Cheers.

212
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,775
Geez.

213
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,987
This is nice!

214
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,735
What's wrong with me?

215
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,202
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

216
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,956
He did buy the skirt
two days before she went missing.

217
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,043
Mr. Kim Tae-kwang says the person he saw
matches Kim Myeong-sik's build.

218
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,880
Ms. Ham Yeon-ja says he doesn't.
She said he was a bit slimmer and shorter.

219
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,925
-She said he was about 175cm.
-175cm?

220
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,178
Yes. Kim Myeong-sik is over 182cm,
so there is a difference.

221
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,106
Find this man.

222
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,155
You can be Superman.

223
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,534
This voice…

224
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,291
You're Gwyneth of Gugi-dong.

225
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,793
How did you get in here?

226
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,009
I warned you.

227
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,011
If you fall for me, you'll get hurt.

228
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,431
I won't fall for you, so don't worry.

229
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,141
Wait a minute.

230
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,145
What is this?

231
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,147
What did you do to me?

232
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:55,857
Untie me.

233
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,316
Untie me right now!

234
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:04,073
You should still be my Superman
because you have to save me.

235
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,825
Says who?

236
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,661
I don't like Superman.
I don't want to be Superman.

237
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,455
So untie me right now.

238
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,290
Hurry up and untie me!

239
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,583
Untie me!

240
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,792
No!

241
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:15,960
No!

242
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,763
Hey, Dong-chil.

243
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,806
Cheon Dong-chil.

244
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,184
Get up!

245
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,269
I said get up!

246
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,607
Hey! Why did you push me?

247
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,108
You're back.

248
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,401
-Look.
-I am back?

249
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,784
I'm back.

250
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,703
How long has it been?

251
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,081
It's nice to see you again.

252
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,124
It's good to see you again,
Cheon Dong-chil.

253
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,209
Wait.

254
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,628
Was I hugging you again?

255
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,343
I don't know why I always want to sleep
in your arms when I become a dog.

256
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,720
That's why I told you to lock
the door when you sleep.

257
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,598
Look what you got us into
because you didn't lock the door.

258
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:12,850
Hey!

259
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,352
Hey!

260
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,855
Why is he the one getting mad?

261
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,982
Damn it.

262
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,504
What's for breakfast?

263
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,923
Gosh, I feel so sick.

264
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,802
I think I drank too much last night.

265
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,303
-Gosh.
-Me too.

266
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,513
You scared me.

267
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,142
You're back. When did you turn back?

268
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,601
Last night.

269
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,728
I opened a bottle of wine to celebrate.

270
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,438
Looks like more than one bottle.

271
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,234
Hey, Sang-hyuk.
What's for breakfast today? Man--

272
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,737
We need some soup for a hangover.

273
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,700
Cream pasta.

274
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,664
The investigation of a woman in her 40s
who went missing near Inwangsan Mountain

275
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,333
when there was heavy snow
still remains unsolved.

276
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,254
The police recently arrested
her lover as a prime suspect.

277
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,299
But he will be released soon
due to insufficient evidence.

278
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,759
-Reporter Lee is covering the story.
-Another case there?

279
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,222
-Of all days, it was a snowy day.
-Of all places, Inwangsan Mountain.

280
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,725
Of all cases, it's a missing woman's case.

281
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,310
Hey, let's eat.

282
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,734
I looked up the credit card
this man used at the public parking lot

283
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,194
and it belonged to this company.

284
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,029
His car belongs to this company too.

285
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,574
Who is he? Is he your employee?

286
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,367
He's not an employee.

287
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,078
Is he a family member or a friend?

288
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,247
Is he the culprit?

289
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,166
No. He's a witness for the moment.

290
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,045
He would never kill anyone.

291
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,715
Look at what he's doing.
It doesn't look normal.

292
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:16,224
You can ask the owner of the car
what he was doing that day.

293
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,226
I can't cooperate.

294
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,269
You should get a warrant.

295
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,240
She's fine now.

296
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,951
I'm talking about Elizabeth.

297
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,664
-Is this her?
-Yes, that's right.

298
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,083
It's her. Elizabeth.

299
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,337
Do you know why this man was like this?

300
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,257
He told me to pull myself together.

301
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,967
It wasn't a real gun.

302
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,343
My car is fine too.

303
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:59,809
Well, if you find this person,
can you let me know too?

304
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,813
He's a nice man
who found Elizabeth for me.

305
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,483
I couldn't thank him properly
because it was all hectic.

306
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,153
Right, Elizabeth? We have to thank him.

307
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,531
Thank you. My goodness.

308
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,825
I love you.

309
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,871
-Have you found something?
-No.

310
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,124
Please let us know if you do!

311
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,375
Did you find anything?

312
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,335
Anything yet?

313
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,298
Goodness.

314
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,384
Come to think of it,
she hasn't come here for a few days.

315
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,469
Is there anything you can share with us?

316
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,180
Do you know where she lives?
Or where she works?

317
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,391
I don't know.

318
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:44,353
I just know her as the lady who orders
jeon and makgeolli all the time.

319
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,189
You should wait. She will drop by soon.

320
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,651
She seems to really like hiking.

321
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,198
This is happening again.

322
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,285
My heart beats so fast these days.

323
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,247
I get scared when I see black jackets.

324
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,749
Look at this.

325
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,960
I can't sleep without this.

326
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,507
Why don't you install
a security camera in the restaurant

327
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,134
just for yourself too?

328
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,053
I already signed up for one.

329
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,221
They said they're coming today.

330
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:25,102
Did something bad really happen there?

331
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,900
-Sir!
-Hey.

332
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,527
I don't think it was the man who
was on the car hood.

333
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:37,198
The owner of the car said
that the man found his dog for him.

334
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:38,949
This dog is Elizabeth.

335
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,994
Elizabeth?

336
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:45,164
-Then--
-That's the dog. It's the car owner's dog.

337
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,209
The man found the dog for him.
This guy even warned him.

338
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,586
Both the driver and the car are fine.

339
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,548
And the owner of the Love Room said
that this guy wouldn't kill anyone.

340
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,425
He told me to bring a warrant.

341
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,428
Sir, this dog…

342
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,972
Yes, it's a dog.
Do you know the dog or what?

343
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,228
The name doesn't match the dog.

344
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,439
I think it's a mutt.

345
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,152
Cut it out.

346
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,616
This is Seo Jae-hee of Homicide Unit One.

347
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,700
Yes.

348
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,037
What?

349
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,334
He's dead?

350
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,430
I heard the DUI driver survived.

351
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,517
He killed two innocent people,
but he got lucky and survived.

352
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,062
He's receiving treatment
and eating three meals a day.

353
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,189
My goodness. This is unbelievable.

354
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:56,235
What if they had a baby?
The child would have been an orphan.

355
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,113
Didn't they have a dog?

356
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,323
-Wasn't it a big dog?
-That dog?

357
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,992
Are you okay?

358
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,536
There is a dog in the back seat.

359
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,746
I heard he was rescued at the site.

360
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,081
Apparently, he survived.

361
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,752
A huge bar went through his abdomen.
But a vet saved him.

362
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,296
Really?

363
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,840
What's the use? The dog's owners are gone.

364
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:24,597
Where is that animal hospital?
The hospital that saved the dog.

365
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:27,850
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

366
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,352
When will I be released?

367
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,689
They haven't found any solid evidence,
so you'll be released soon.

368
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,067
-Please wait a little longer.
-I have no reason to be here.

369
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,906
There's one more person
who saw the culprit that night.

370
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:48,370
If they find him,
it will help you get out of here.

371
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,210
Who's the other person?

372
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,129
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

373
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,801
I hope your parents are okay too.

374
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:09,975
Let me see.

375
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,074
Over there.

376
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,921
It's driving me crazy.
What's wrong with me?

377
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,258
It's because of the scent.

378
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,972
What was it?

379
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,766
That familiar scent.

380
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,621
Right! This was it.

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,001
What are you doing?

382
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,877
It was this scent.

383
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,424
The scent that drove you crazy
during lunch

384
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,884
because you couldn't remember what it was?

385
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:26,969
Yes.

386
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,888
It was bothering me so much that
I thought I was going crazy.

387
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,849
It was this. Plum blossom.

388
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,982
-Let's run!
-Goodness.

389
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,623
There were many plum trees on the hill
near the orphanage where I grew up.

390
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,669
Every spring,
lots of petals scattered in the wind.

391
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,882
The spring sun was warm,
and the petals were dancing in the wind.

392
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,967
The wind was gentle.

393
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,270
I used to fall asleep on the hill
because I liked how it felt.

394
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,022
I fell asleep as I smelled the scent.

395
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,986
It's that scent.

396
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,198
Maybe that's why I reacted like that.

397
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,829
It seems like you fell in love
with him at first sight.

398
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,331
What?

399
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:41,460
Why would a strange man
remind you of a childhood memory?

400
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,213
The part of the brain
that controls the sense of smell

401
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,965
is closest to the part
that stores memories.

402
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,472
A fleeting moment of smelling something
brought back a good childhood memory.

403
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,892
You are in love with him.

404
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,686
Goodness.

405
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,733
I fell for him at first sight?

406
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,792
What the hell?
Why are there so many men here?

407
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,628
Welcome. Is this your first time here?

408
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,547
Yes.

409
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,302
I'd like to ask you something.

410
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:33,887
It's time for Coco.

411
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,989
Coco.

412
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,407
You're here again.

413
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,375
-Shall we go in?
-Sure.

414
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,721
You're number 36.

415
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,515
Okay.

416
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,767
WAIT NUMBER 36

417
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,813
Yes, that's it!

418
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,692
That's it!

419
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,292
-Good work.
-You too.

420
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,884
Why doesn't she have a red thread?

421
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:55,677
Why?

422
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:14,863
I'll be back. I'm meeting Mi-ja.

423
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,366
-Will you have dinner with her?
-You should just give up.

424
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,244
You dated for three months
and then ghosted her for six months.

425
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,829
We'll be leaving this place soon.

426
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,582
I don't want her to think of me
as the bastard who suddenly ghosted her.

427
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:29,211
Go ahead. But she might think
you're a son of a bitch instead.

428
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,880
What's the difference?

429
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,007
-They're different.
-Mi-ja is different.

430
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,470
Of all the girls I dated over 500 years,
she is the sweetest.

431
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,098
All right. I'll be back.

432
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,935
All girls are sweet
for the first three months.

433
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,604
Why are they sweet
for the first three months?

434
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,068
You have to date a girl
for at least four seasons.

435
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,987
Especially when it's hot and cold.

436
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,739
That's when she shows her true self.

437
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:08,458
Why didn't you tell me
you were in the hospital?

438
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,252
I didn't want you to worry.

439
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,965
How sick were you?

440
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,846
I got the wrong idea
because I had no idea you were sick.

441
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm sorry.

442
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,937
All my friends told me
that you ditched me.

443
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,274
They heard about men disappearing during
blind dates after using the restroom.

444
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,235
But they've never heard of a boyfriend
who ghosts his girl for six months

445
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,570
after using the bathroom.

446
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,947
Do you know how harshly they teased me?

447
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:41,742
I'm sorry, Mi-ja.

448
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:49,875
It's okay. You showed up
in front of me again.

449
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,566
Damn it.

450
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,580
Dong-chil?

451
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,382
Dong-chil.

452
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,846
Dong-chil!

453
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,600
This jerk disappeared on me again?

454
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:53,146
I can't believe this. Dong-chil, you ****!

455
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,399
You disappeared again
after just 30 minutes?

456
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,317
You're the worst man in the world.

457
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:00,779
I ought to make omelets out of
your eyeballs to teach you a lesson!

458
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,781
You ****!

459
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,077
If I ever date you again,
I'm a dog myself!

460
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,664
OUR DOG BITES
BEWARE OF DOG

461
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,587
What? You turned back into a dog?

462
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:24,970
So Mi-ja was a nice girl like you said.

463
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,974
-A nice girl?
-Are you serious?

464
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,519
All she did was swear at him even though
he showed up for only 30 minutes

465
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,147
after ghosting her for six months
when they'd dated for three months.

466
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,065
She's nice.

467
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,031
Hey, don't you see that he's heartbroken?

468
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,742
Let's go to the hospital.

469
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,161
-You need to see a vet when you're sick.
-A vet?

470
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,123
POPPY ANIMAL CLINIC

471
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,876
Hey, hey.

472
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,961
Get up.

473
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,713
Nobody is visiting us today.

474
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,466
-What should we do?
-We're always this empty.

475
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,806
They all used to come to my clinic.

476
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,813
What? Isn't that Ddaeng-chil?

477
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,192
Losing Andre was one thing.
I won't lose Ddaeng-chil too.

478
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,334
What's going on here?

479
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,846
Bbong-soon should take that medicine.
I'll see her in a week.

480
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,306
Okay. Thank you.

481
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,483
Mr. Superman?

482
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,119
How is he here?

483
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,725
Gosh, she's so pretty.

484
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,022
Seriously?

485
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,400
You are number 37.

486
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,949
WAIT NUMBER 37

487
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,920
-Thank you.
-She grew so much!

488
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,380
Thank you.

489
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,384
It's all thanks to you.

490
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,720
Why is Cupid only hard on you?

491
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,264
You just need one shot?

492
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,727
-Let me check on her.
-Sure, thank you.

493
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,771
You want at least one heartwarming memory
with someone?

494
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,693
Your memories seem too hot to handle.

495
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,156
He's…

496
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,143
Does he recognize me?

497
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,148
He's good-looking just like me.

498
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,237
Hello. Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

499
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:12,822
The ambulance?

500
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,076
I see. So that's what happened.

501
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,786
I'll discuss it with the director.

502
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,455
Please take a seat and wait.

503
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,873
Thank you, Doctor.

504
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,298
-Doctor, we have a problem.
-What's wrong?

505
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,510
The owners of the dog
that had surgery passed away.

506
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,765
Did you just get the call?

507
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,850
Yes, both of them passed away.

508
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,019
I feel so bad for the dog.

509
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,980
She's struggling to hang in there.

510
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,066
She can't go back to her owners now.

511
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,068
I'll call the shelter.

512
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,987
It won't be easy
for the dog to stay there.

513
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,905
She needs treatment for some time too.

514
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,825
It'll be hard for her
to get adopted, right?

515
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,953
Who would pay for all that?

516
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,291
I'll adopt her.

517
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,594
I'll take her with me.
What's the adoption process?

518
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:23,226
-Why is he acting like he's cool?
-Does he think it's easy?

519
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,603
It won't be easy to raise a dog.

520
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,691
YEON-JA'S
MOUNTAIN VALLEY RESTAURANT

521
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,452
Welcome.

522
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,038
Sit wherever you like.

523
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,813
I think we have to call it a day.

524
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,066
We have to find him though.

525
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,360
Let's just call it a day.

526
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,903
All right.

527
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,073
-Let's wrap it up!
-Yes, sir!

528
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,533
Sir.

529
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,553
119 AMBULANCE

530
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,390
That dog's owner was a good friend
of mine at work.

531
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,142
Really?

532
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:50,105
I came here because I heard the dog
survived when I attended the funeral.

533
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,608
I'm sorry for your loss.

534
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,027
Yes.

535
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,363
My heart is heavy.

536
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:00,990
He was my first boss.

537
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,165
How is the dog doing?

538
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:11,126
She's holding up well.

539
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,754
If she keeps recovering,
she can go home in about a week.

540
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,590
After that,
she'll need outpatient treatment.

541
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,844
-Are you really going to adopt her?
-Yes.

542
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,512
Have you owned a dog before?

543
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,097
No.

544
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,684
Then why don't you think about it
for a little longer?

545
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,269
-Think about it?
-Yes.

546
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,814
You'll be responsible for her
for the rest of your life.

547
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,608
I feel like you're rushing into this.

548
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,861
She just had major surgery.

549
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,280
So she'll need a lot of attention
and care from now on.

550
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,323
She won't be like the other healthy dogs.

551
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:47,370
If you rush into adopting her
and then you end up giving her up later…

552
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,543
She's already confused about
not being able to get back to her owners.

553
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,173
Everyone has a first time. Right?

554
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,469
I may not be perfect,
but I won't be irresponsible like that.

555
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,142
I'm a homicide detective
at Jongseo Police Station.

556
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,144
You can report me if I give up on her.

557
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,730
Are you single?

558
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,984
I was going to ask you that first.
Yes, I'm single.

559
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,611
That's even worse.

560
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,237
Isn't it better?

561
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:25,867
You're a busy detective who lives alone.
That's the worst for a dog.

562
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,411
You should think about it some more.

563
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:31,122
Think about whether
you can be a good guardian.

564
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:35,543
What? You don't think I'll feed her?
You think I won't be home all the time?

565
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,588
I'm not saying you would do that.

566
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,643
I'm a detective.

567
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,604
I can see it in your eyes.
You're convinced.

568
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,400
Let's do it this way.

569
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,612
Why don't you find out more about me?

570
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,490
I'll drop by whenever I can
until she can leave.

571
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,574
Keep an eye on me.

572
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,119
How can I?
I'm not one to decide that anyway.

573
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:13,289
A murderer's neighbor would think
that he's an angel in most cases.

574
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:27,428
I'm the detective
who catches those murderers.

575
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,057
A man who loves justice,
who is like the light of society.

576
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,185
Just keep an eye on me.

577
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,772
See if I'll be a good guardian
or a good man.

578
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,234
He's flirting with her.

579
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,778
What? He's flirting with her?

580
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,162
Where is she now?

581
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,040
She's recovering in the room.

582
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,959
Her name is Alexandra.

583
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,711
That's what my colleague used to call her.

584
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,421
Did he?

585
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,507
-Let's go and check on Alex.
-Sure, let's go.

586
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,310
A sharp bar pierced through her body.

587
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,396
We removed it and performed surgery
to connect the broken blood vessels.

588
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,608
Luckily, she hung in there.

589
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:31,409
Luckily, she met a skilled doctor like you
and she survived.

590
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:36,497
That's very sweet of you to say.

591
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,627
I only say nice things to pretty people.

592
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:51,262
From now on, she'll need a guardian's
careful observation and care.

593
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,808
Fine, you pass.

594
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,811
First of all, you have a way with words.

595
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,189
My actions are even better.

596
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,690
You can keep an eye on me.

597
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,194
Okay.

598
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,784
I'll be back tomorrow.

599
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,828
-Is he coming back tomorrow?
-You don't have to come every day.

600
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,830
You can drop by when you have the time.

601
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,667
I'll drop by every day,
even when I don't have the time.

602
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,545
Bye, Alex's father.

603
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:25,630
All right. Bye.

604
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,101
Ddaeng-chil can come in.

605
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,270
Let's go.

606
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,327
Thank you for your first visit.

607
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:00,998
We cherish our relationship with you.
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

608
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,544
It must be destined.

609
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,672
I've never had a chance
to be with animals before.

610
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,598
Yes, come in.

611
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:18,975
Let's go.

612
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,232
I'll leave you to it.

613
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:34,991
Hello.

614
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,371
We meet again. Mr. Superman.

615
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,206
Mr. Superman?

616
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,168
It should have my name on it.

617
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,627
I know.

618
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:48,921
Mr. Cheon Sang-hyuk.

619
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,343
You must be Ddaeng-chil.

620
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,971
You're pretty.

621
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,056
VETERINARIAN
OH BAEK-RYEON

622
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,892
Is your name Oh Baek-ryeon?

623
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,269
Yes, I'm Oh Baek-ryeon.

624
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,397
-Oh Baek-ryeon.
-Watch out for the pronunciation.

625
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,482
It means "pitiful."

626
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,818
-Your name is…
-Pitiful, right?

627
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:14,322
It sounds like I have a sad love story
that's 500 years old.

628
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,498
Why do you smile like that?

629
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,875
So this is how you flirt with men.

630
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,877
What? Flirt with men?

631
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,505
There are tons of guys outside.

632
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,299
-They all fell for this trick.
-What do you mean?

633
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:37,553
You tell those men your sad love stories
to make them want to protect you.

634
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,930
Oh, that…

635
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,642
You said you wanted to ask Cupid
why he's only harsh towards you.

636
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,853
It's so obvious
why Cupid isn't shooting at you.

637
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,024
All the men out there are staring at you.

638
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,777
-The people outside are not men.
-Are they women then?

639
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,403
-They're guardians.
-They're male guardians.

640
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,572
They're just regular guardians.

641
00:51:56,656 --> 00:52:00,618
They're just the usual guardians
who are here to get their pets treated.

642
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:04,622
What about that man who just left?
Is he a special guardian?

643
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,374
-What?
-You seemed so happy.

644
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,417
You two were laughing together.

645
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,294
-You even blushed.
-I did?

646
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,509
WAIT NUMBER 36

647
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:21,931
I guess he's Superman Number 36.

648
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:27,728
The number you gave me last night
was Superman Number 37.

649
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,775
There seems to be
a misunderstanding, Mr. Superman.

650
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:35,862
I don't want to be that Mr. Superman.

651
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,324
You didn't need me in the first place.

652
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:44,579
What do you mean? I thought you came
to get Ddaeng-chil treated.

653
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,545
I'm not here to get him treated.

654
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,130
I'm here to get him groomed.

655
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,756
-Groomed?
-Yes.

656
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,092
I want to have his nails cut
and his anal sac treated.

657
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,177
What? Anal sac?

658
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,679
Are you kidding me?

659
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,808
Hey!

660
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,310
-Hey!
-Let's go.

661
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,853
I'm not going.

662
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,564
-Let's go.
-I said I don't want to.

663
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:12,940
Goodness.

664
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,943
I don't want my anal sac to be treated.

665
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,278
Hey! Hey!

666
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,697
His anal sac has to be treated.

667
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,699
What's wrong with him?

668
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,951
Why is he angry?

669
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:28,748
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

670
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,917
Are you giving him the eye drops?

671
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,251
Yes, I am.

672
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,614
-Sir.
-Hey.

673
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,220
-What happened?
-There was a fire about two hours ago.

674
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:38,859
It looks like she fell asleep
and forgot to turn off the stove.

675
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,028
The restaurant would've been busy
at the time though.

676
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,367
I can't sleep without this.

677
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,623
We need to do an autopsy, right?

678
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,425
-Yes.
-Sir, we need you here right away.

679
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,468
What's going on now?

680
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,471
Mr. Kim Tae-kwang, the owner
of Daebak Real Estate, has passed away.

681
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,016
What?

682
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,291
I think he was drunk and he fell
on his way home.

683
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,712
I can't believe both of them passed away
in a day.

684
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:40,796
What do you mean?

685
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,840
Ms. Ham passed away too?

686
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,354
I'm not the only one who's
uncomfortable with this, right?

687
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,231
It can't be a coincidence.

688
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,776
Witnesses of the Inwangsan Mountain
missing woman's case.

689
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,319
Right?

690
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:04,904
It's weird.

691
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,074
How can two witnesses die on the same day?

692
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,332
There's still one witness left.

693
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,127
We don't know who she is yet?

694
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,843
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

695
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,553
He's so cute.

696
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,643
What are you doing after work?

697
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,953
Aren't you Ddaeng-chil's guardian?
What are you doing here?

698
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,374
-I'm drinking coffee.
-Come in. Let's drink together.

699
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,792
Why are you outside? It's cold.

700
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,794
It's not cold. I turned on the heater.

701
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,296
It can't be as warm as the clinic though.

702
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,589
Let's go in and drink together.

703
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,299
No, I'm really fine.

704
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,385
Why would I get in the clinic
without Ddaeng-chil?

705
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,765
Goodness, we can have a cup of tea
without Ddaeng-chil.

706
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:17,059
Let's go in. Come on.

707
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,602
I don't think we're close enough for that.

708
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,104
Come in.

709
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,731
No, I don't want to.

710
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,655
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

711
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,323
You don't want to?

712
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,909
Why did you park here then?

713
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,705
Are you there yet?

714
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,876
I'm on my way too.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

715
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,546
I took a shortcut. I'll be there soon.

716
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,385
I guess this whole alley
is taking the day off today.

717
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,014
Should I have taken a detour?

718
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,115
Am I hearing things?

719
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,114
Who are you?

720
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,645
Mr. Superman?

721
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,628
Are you okay?

722
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,344
Are you okay?

723
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,180
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Are you sure you are okay?

724
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,100
Let me see.

725
01:00:58,364 --> 01:00:59,615
You didn't get hurt.

726
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,451
You're not hurt at all.

727
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,620
Why aren't you hurt?

728
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,206
Was I supposed to get hurt?

729
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,083
How come you are fine?

730
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,252
Should I not be fine?

731
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,462
It makes no sense.

732
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,094
-Your back should have been broken.
-What?

733
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,637
No broken shoulders?

734
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,972
Your arm must be broken at the very least!

735
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,432
How can you say such things?

736
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,602
Your leg. Is your leg okay?

737
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:35,109
Your injury should've been bad enough
to be hospitalized for 50 weeks.

738
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,860
What? 50 weeks?

739
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,488
-You mean 12 months? A year?
-Yes.

740
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,533
It's always been like that.

741
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,494
What do you mean?

742
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,122
Men around me would get hit
by a random lightning bolt

743
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,124
or pass out after choking on cold water.

744
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,086
One even fell backward and broke his nose.
He lost a lot of blood and went to the ER.

745
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,170
My goodness.

746
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,465
Another one nearly died
from eating pudding too.

747
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,342
Pudding?

748
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:02,052
So why…

749
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,879
