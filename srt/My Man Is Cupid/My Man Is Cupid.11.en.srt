1
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:44,211
God creates a big framework of fate.

2
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,758
It's humans who act accordingly.

3
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,012
It's also humans who go against it.

4
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:59,059
It takes only one thing
to change the game.

5
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,395
And that is…

6
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,237
Three.

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,448
I got it.

8
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,033
I got my love.

9
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,960
And that is…

10
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,795
courage.

11
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:28,440
There's nothing you can do.

12
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:53,382
Love without the thread of fate
ends in a tragedy.

13
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,651
Start the appointment ceremony.

14
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,453
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

15
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,039
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

16
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,208
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

17
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,843
-What?
-Why is he here?

18
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,061
-What is he doing here?
-Why is he here?

19
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,309
Who is he?

20
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,070
I see archers!

21
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,793
No!

22
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,129
What? There is a way to change my fate?

23
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,431
What is it?

24
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,600
How do I change my fate?

25
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,345
Stop.

26
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,702
If you can't give me your heart,

27
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,287
then…

28
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,748
you should die for me.

29
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,044
I can't die for you.

30
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,964
The only person I will die for is…

31
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:17,497
Run after So-hee right now.
You will find that odd man there.

32
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,332
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:27,925
What is it?

34
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,760
How do I change my fate?

35
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,929
Kill yourself.

36
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,182
On that cliff.

37
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,270
-What?
-And be born again.

38
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:46,318
That fairy just earned 500 years
by burning his own wings.

39
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,070
It's your turn now.

40
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,405
Die for that fairy.

41
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:54,534
That's where a new bud will bloom.

42
00:08:55,118 --> 00:09:00,207
You and that fairy will be connected
by a new thread of fate.

43
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,894
Your Highness.

44
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,988
After you're born again,

45
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,906
you will be given two chances.

46
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,868
Will I be able to recognize him?

47
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,051
Your Highness. Please don't do this.

48
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,807
I will be born again right here.

49
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,393
I'll do my best to reach you.

50
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,525
Please don't forget me.

51
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,491
Your Highness!

52
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:40,015
One, two, three!

53
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,568
I got it.

54
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,070
I got my love.

55
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,308
You will go through a painful
and miserable time

56
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,853
while the wings you burned recover.

57
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,692
No woman will be allowed

58
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,195
to be with you.

59
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,042
No!

60
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,671
EP11. THE POWER
TO FACE FATE… COURAGE

61
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,467
-We'll go first.
-Hurry up.

62
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,135
Wait for me!

63
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,470
Watch out! Move!

64
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,784
Are you okay?

65
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,800
You smell nice.

66
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,305
You smell like flowers.

67
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,609
-He's out.
-He's here.

68
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,245
-What are you doing?
-Try this.

69
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,996
-What are you all doing?
-Try this.

70
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,164
-It's delicious.
-Try this.

71
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,290
-You can't come like this.
-Hey, just try this.

72
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,626
-I made it today.
-Try it.

73
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,294
Could you please try it once?

74
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,213
-It's really delicious.
-Please!

75
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,798
It's so filthy here.

76
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,716
There's nothing there.
Why are you sweeping?

77
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,842
What do you mean?

78
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,303
It's still dusty,
even though I've been sweeping!

79
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,347
My goodness.

80
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,227
Superman. You said we should
go eat tteokbokki together last time.

81
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,436
Let's go.

82
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,106
-When did I say that?
-You said that the other day.

83
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,858
You said you'd buy me
the wheat flour tteokbokki that I like.

84
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,318
What? Hey, wait.

85
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,659
I have something for you. It's a gift.

86
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,008
-Excuse me.
-Jeong-ah…

87
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,302
Please find my baby, Jeong-ah…

88
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:51,182
Detective. Please find Jeong-ah…

89
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,019
Please find my girl…

90
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,822
I just went there
because she said she would wait.

91
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,240
Have you forgotten?

92
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:14,289
I said I won't match you with anyone.

93
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:18,877
I just went there. That's it!

94
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't do anything.

95
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:26,092
That's the only thing you can do.

96
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,810
To humans, geob means cosmic time.
But to me, it means fear.

97
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,272
That's how I had accumulated geob.

98
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,077
It was you.

99
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,390
You're my man.

100
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,913
Are you okay?

101
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,924
Ms. Oh, how are you feeling?

102
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,009
Doctor.

103
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,347
I think I've finally lost my mind.

104
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,315
You should go in first.

105
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,194
-No, you go first.
-I'll go after I see you go in.

106
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,738
Okay, give me a kiss.

107
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,282
Bye.

108
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,791
What is he doing?

109
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,636
Can I have your number?

110
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,981
Dong-gu!

111
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,360
-Stop it!
-Don't do that!

112
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,528
What did he just do?

113
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,905
I said don't do it!

114
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,575
Based on the results,
I don't think there is a problem.

115
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,453
Do you still see the angel?

116
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:02,499
The angel I saw in my dream
had a clear character.

117
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,668
What did the angel look like?

118
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,753
His face…

119
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,136
He looked just like Superman.

120
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,721
-Superman?
-Superman?

121
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,475
That Superman with a blue uniform
and red underwear?

122
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,726
No, Doctor.

123
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,646
Do you remember the man you saw
in her room earlier?

124
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,357
His nickname is Superman.

125
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,151
He has a long history with her.

126
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,488
To put it simply, she likes him.

127
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,365
It's one-sided love.

128
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,993
Then it makes sense.

129
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,620
It makes sense?

130
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,913
Superman is the angel.

131
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,875
Your wish can be projected in your dream.

132
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,962
He could appear in your dream
if he was the first thing

133
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,589
that crossed your mind
in an urgent situation.

134
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,716
In the form of an angel.

135
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,970
It was so intense though.

136
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,348
Hello, everyone.

137
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,643
I'm the man who researches aliens.

138
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,437
-Where is Ms. Oh?
-She's gone for a checkup.

139
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,022
She said she feels like
she's lost her mind.

140
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,858
What? She lost her mind?

141
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,578
Are you okay?
Did the doctor say you're okay?

142
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,415
I guess you missed him so much,
you had to see him in your dreams too.

143
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,716
Did you see that just now?

144
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,467
Let's watch it one more time.

145
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,554
What is that suspicious moving object?

146
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,848
Night vision goggles at an air base
in California spotted

147
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,057
this unidentified flying object.

148
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,768
When this clip was released
on social media,

149
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,522
countless people argued
over the authenticity in the comments.

150
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,441
-Surprisingly, at the air base…
-Hey.

151
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,861
…not a single airplane…

152
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,030
-So there are such things as aliens?
-Of course.

153
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,783
-Are you sure?
-I told you this last time too.

154
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,078
There are beings who are not
from this world around us.

155
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,204
In Chungcheongnam-do…

156
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,630
Ho-jin.

157
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,049
Is this what Sang-hyuk was having?

158
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,218
No, I was eating this.
I didn't finish it because it wasn't good.

159
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,688
What about this?

160
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,023
Was Sang-hyuk using this?

161
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,776
We both use that. I used it too.

162
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,499
Is this Sang-hyuk's toothbrush?

163
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,583
It's mine.

164
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,544
Why is it all yours?

165
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,089
What has been used by Sang-hyuk here?

166
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,466
Sir, do you--

167
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,717
What?

168
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,887
Do you like Sang-hyuk?

169
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,599
What are you talking about?

170
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,228
Then why are you looking for things
that are used by Sang-hyuk?

171
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,564
Don't tell me…

172
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,402
you want an indirect kiss.

173
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,237
Are you kidding me?

174
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,905
-Hey.
-Yes?

175
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,700
There's no such thing
as an indirect kiss in my book.

176
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,369
A kiss is about sharing your breaths.

177
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,787
That's a real kiss.

178
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,998
Exhale and inhale.

179
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,467
I know, right?

180
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,429
Kissing is about exchanging breaths.

181
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,112
Why are you looking at me like that?

182
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:05,992
Look.

183
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,830
Ten days ago, I got cut by a knife here
when I was trying to arrest a culprit.

184
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,292
When the skin is cut by a sharp knife,
we, the police, call it a laceration.

185
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,753
It takes a day or two
for the wound to close

186
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,755
and about two weeks
for the scar to be gone.

187
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:23,468
If you're an ordinary person,
the scar could remain for a long time.

188
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:28,181
But that wasn't the case for the scar
that I saw yesterday on your index finger.

189
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:33,686
You probably had it a day or two earlier.
It was just starting to heal.

190
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:41,194
I'll help her.
It looks like you hurt your finger.

191
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,531
Why did it disappear
in just a few minutes?

192
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,246
I should get going.

193
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,276
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

194
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,872
How long will it take?

195
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,833
We're backlogged right now.

196
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,209
It'll take a while.

197
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,295
Please have it tested as soon as possible.

198
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,380
Okay.

199
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,493
One.

200
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,371
Two.

201
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,999
Three.

202
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,125
How creepy.

203
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,421
SECOND WOMAN - CREEPY

204
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,563
Why are you staring at me?

205
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,149
It's because you're pretty.

206
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,153
Give me your phone.

207
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,162
This is my number.

208
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,539
-I'll call you.
-All right.

209
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,423
One.

210
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,720
-Two. Three.
-What the heck?

211
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,764
-What?
-You're pretty.

212
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,682
You think I was born pretty
for you to see?

213
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,017
How ridiculous!

214
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,652
THIRD WOMAN - RIDICULOUS

215
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,954
He's your guardian now.

216
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,207
-You look great together.
-When are you two getting married?

217
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,334
Congratulations.
You'll have a housewarming party, right?

218
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,503
-What?
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

219
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,548
Is there anything you want to eat,
Baek-ryeon?

220
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:50,633
What I want to eat?

221
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,136
Tteokbokki.

222
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,683
Tteokbokki! Okay, I'll be back.
See you later.

223
00:25:58,766 --> 00:25:59,976
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

224
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,853
-Bye.
-He's so cool.

225
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:07,024
-You can't fall for him.
-You must be happy, Ms. Oh.

226
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,901
Anyway, what happened?

227
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,237
Why did you go there so late at night?

228
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,533
Well…

229
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,159
-Goodness! Are you okay?
-What happened?

230
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,369
-What was that?
-Be careful.

231
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,745
My goodness.

232
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,998
-The chair is fine though.
-Goodness.

233
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,800
What's wrong? Do you remember something?

Hello.

257
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,452
I just sent you an e-mail regarding
the hypnosis testimony by Ms. Oh.

258

SENDING YOU OH BAEK-RYEON'S

259
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,251
Yes, I got it. Thank you.

260
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,586
By the way…

261
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,089
Never mind.

262
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,341
Call me if you have any questions.

263
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,177
Okay.

264
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,061
It's made of rice.

265
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,523
Right. Rice tteokbokki is the best.

266
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,423
Does it taste bad?

267
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,427
I went all the way there
because I heard it was a good place.

268
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,638
I guess beef tripes are all
you and I have in common.

269
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,140
What? No.

270
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,225
Hold on.

271
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,607
It's good.

272
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,567
I'll have some fish cake.

273
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,325
The fish cake tastes good.

274
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,487
Ms. Song isn't here yet?

275
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,739
She isn't here yet, sir.

276
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,823
How about Mr. Kim?

277
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,499
How can your eyes be so pure?

278
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,170
Can I dive into your eyes?

279
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,922
Go ahead.

280
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,967
But…

281
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,262
it's only for a month.

282
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,264
One month?

283
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,860
-Gentle gaze.
-What the heck? What a creep.

284
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,783
-Gentle gaze.
-What the hell? He must be crazy.

285
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,250
-Gentle gaze.
-What are you looking at, jerk?

286
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,929
Excuse me. It looks like you're blessed.

287
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,847
Okay, bye.

288
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,067
One.

289
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,111
Two.

290
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,781
Three.

291
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,325
Gentle gaze.

292
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:24,211
Excuse me. It looks like you're blessed.

293
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,295
What?

294
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,424
-I look blessed?
-Yes.

295
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:32,177
Your face tells me that you're so blessed
that you can fly away with your wings.

296
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,595
How did you know?

297
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,431
Can you see my wings?

298
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,559
Yes. You can fly higher.

299
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,311
But something is on your shoulders,
stopping you from flying higher.

300
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,896
How did you know?

301
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,149
-You can see that too?
-Sure.

302
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,692
You need to get rid of that energy.

303
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,614
Can I talk to you for a second?

304
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,245
Select the menu you'd like to order from.

305
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,665
Press the complete button
after selecting the menu.

306
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,503
TOTAL: 13,200 WON

307
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,426
ORDER A SET?

308
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,096
Please insert your credit card.

309
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,114
What? One million won for the fruits?

310
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,702
If you do a ritual with all your heart,
along with the fruits,

311
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,411
you can fly away in no time.

312
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,538
Then,

313
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,626
I shouldn't do it.

314
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,878
I can't fly away right now.

315
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,922
What? Why?

316
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,051
I'm only saying this
because I want the best for you.

317
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,305
I really feel bad for you, Dong-gu.

318
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,309
She's the first female human
who wants the best for me.

319
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:06,230
You would be so successful
if you just did this.

320
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,565
Will she be a good wife and a wise mother?

321
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,192
If one million won is too much,

322
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,320
500,000 won is still okay.

323
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,156
How about 100,000 won?

324
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,705
It's best if you go now.

325
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,376
I'll think about it for a day.

326
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,505
Give me your phone.

327
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,309
This is my number.

328
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,312
She's the first female human
to give me her number.

329
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,941
I'll see you here at 9 p.m. tomorrow.

wheat flour, not rice.

332
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,586
-Did she ask for wheat tteokbokki?
-No, just tteokbokki.

333
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,962
Then why did you buy that?

334
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,256
-Wheat tteokbokki is the best.
-We just clicked.

335
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,259
Thank you.

336
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,429
-Ho-jin, join us.
-I can't eat spicy food.

337
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,432
I can eat tteokbokki and kimchi
only after rinsing them in water.

338
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,601
-He's like that.
-Right.

339
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,151
I love flour.

340
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,695
Back in school,
my friends used to call me "Bread Girl".

341
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,947
It was because I was always eating bread.

342
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,992
This reminds me of the old days.

343
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:48,290
A guy I liked bought me jjajangmyeon
and wheat tteokbokki.

A guy you liked?

345
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,421
You used to like this guy?

346
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,673
Who is the guy
that bought you wheat tteokbokki?

347
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,303
Wait.

348
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,805
I forgot who he was.

349
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,393
You let a guy treat you to food
when you don't even know who he is?

350
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:09,603
Come on.

You scratched his neck?

357
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,568
Yes. I'm sure of it.

358
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,112
I scratched it hard.

359
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,536
Then it must have left a scar.

360
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,677
GO DAE-SIK

361
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,721
Yeah.

362
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,142
The result said it's who?

363
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:14,895
It's the police!

364
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,688
Is anyone inside?

365
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,732
I'll open the door and get in.

366
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,983
Please open the door.

367
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,819
Ms. Song Jin-ah, are you here?

368
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,196
Ms. Song!

369
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,455
DISEASE

370
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,596
-This way.
-Follow me.

371
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,558
Please take off your mask.

372
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,742
You were in a hurry.

373
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,036
Were you going to leave Korea?

374
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,414
You went to this abandoned factory
in Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.

375
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,166
It's where Ms. Go Eun-seo's body
was found.

376
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:25,132
We found the cigarette butt
you smoked there.

377
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,760
DNA FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL

378
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,428
Where is Ms. Song
from the finance department?

379
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,021
Let me check your neck.

380
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,497
He's exercising
his right to remain silent.

381
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,083
-He's not responding to anything.
-Is there more to listen to?

382
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,961
Send him. Transfer him to the prosecutors.

383
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,757
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

384
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,009
-He's here.
-He's out.

385
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,887
Do you plead guilty? Please say something.

386
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,889
-Why did you kill Go Eun-seo?
-Do you plead guilty?

387
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,474
-Do you plead guilty? How do you feel?
-Give us a comment.

388
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,897
Sir!

389
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,150
Why? Why did you kill her?

390
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,944
Why did you kill her? Why?

391
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:29,988
Let go!

392
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,283
Let go!

393
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,118
Damn it.

394
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,954
Let go of me. I'll kill him.

395
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,372
Let go!

396
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,000
I need to kill him.

397
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,673
I took care of the discharge procedures.

398
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:49,758
Breaking news.

399
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,678
Kim, the lover of a woman in her 40s
who went missing near Inwangsan Mountain

400
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:56,139
and was found murdered, was just arrested.
Reporter Kim Ji-hun has more.

401
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,644
Kim was subpoenaed once but was released
due to insufficient evidence.

402
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,563
The police have recently secured
solid evidence to…

403
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,358
Did they finally get him?
You can finally stop worrying now.

404
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,401
So the culprit is Kim Myeong-sik?

405
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:20,497
Kim was subpoenaed once but was released
due to insufficient evidence.

406
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,169
The police have recently secured
solid evidence to pin him as the culprit.

407
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,507
AHN DO-RA (PHONE NUMBER UNKNOWN)
VS. (NAME UNKNOWN)

408
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,971
Ahn Do-ra is…

409
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,224
pretty.

410
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,226
You're set.

411
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,021
-Thumbs up.
-She's kind. And she's cool.

412
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,150
The girl with the phone number
ending in 4772 is proactive.

413
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,153
Can I talk to you for a second?

414
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,364
But she doesn't pay at all.

415
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,160
-But…
-I really feel bad for you, Dong-gu.

416
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,037
…she worries about my future.

417
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,707
I'm only saying this
because I want the best for you.

418
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,750
She will make a really good wife.

419
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,170
Do-ra is…

420
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,047
The 4772 girl is…

421
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,885
AHN DO-RA (PHONE NUMBER UNKNOWN)
VS. (NAME UNKNOWN)

422
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,679
EYE CONTACT REPORT

423
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,725
And so, I'm meeting the 4772 girl tonight.

424
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,103
In front of the hamburger place.

425
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,646
CASANOVA'S SECRET

426
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,399
Just by gently gazing
into someone's eyes for three seconds,

427
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,735
you got a girl and you're going on a date.

428
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,321
I'm so jealous of you.

429
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,702
Why are there only nine people
on the list?

430
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,849
I just arrived.

431
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,477
A woman who's waiting for me.

432
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,909
A woman whom I like.

433
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,663
-This is not easy.
-You can go first. I'll close this.

434
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,749
Gosh, thank you.

435
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,000
-I'll go first.
-Bye.

436
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,890
Where are you?

437
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:44,974
Hurry up.

438
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,086
Dong-gu! Over here!

439
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,254
I'm here!

440
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,005
Over here!

441
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,801
Thumbs up.

442
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,230
I'm here.

443
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,401
What's with him?

444
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,612
Hey!

445
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,115
I'm right here!

446
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,659
This way. Over here.

447
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,624
Where are you going?

448
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,877
Hey!

449
00:45:58,798 --> 00:45:59,799
Excuse me.

450
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,428
-You leave a great first impression.
-No, thanks.

451
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,394
Dong-gu. You're still here.

452
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,942
I wanted to give this back to you.

453
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,695
You could've returned it to me next time.

454
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,907
I didn't have a tenth person on purpose.

455
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,455
Are you talking about
making eye contact for three seconds?

456
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:34,501
From now on, I'll only look at you.

457
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,044
I won't look at other women.

458
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,881
What is he talking about?

459
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,717
Because I don't need any other reason.

460
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,930
You're the only one I see.

461
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,768
Gentle gaze.

462
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,027
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

463
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,780
What? No fingerprints were found?

464
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,365
No. Not even a single one.

465
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,575
There was no DNA detected either.

466
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,370
That's impossible.

467
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,454
ANALYSIS RESULT

468
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,082
FINGERPRINTS COULD NOT BE
OBTAINED FROM DISPOSABLE CUP

469
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,166
NO DNA WAS DETECTED

470
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:21,881
He picked up the cup
and drank from it with his mouth.

471
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,175
Is it possible to not get any DNA
from that?

472
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,594
Yes, if they erased it on purpose.

473
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,305
He didn't though.

474
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,808
What if it wasn't erased on purpose?

475
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,227
That's not possible.

476
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,064
Unless they're a ghost
or an alien without fingerprints.

477
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,413
Is Sang-hyuk there?

478
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,206
No. He's at the Seoul Police Agency.

479
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,125
Seoul Police Agency? For what?

480
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,380
Do you believe in the past life?

481
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,342
The past life?

482
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,055
We have a Crime Investigation
Hypnosis Room at the Seoul Police Agency

483
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,807
because we believe in human memories.

484
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,351
Retrieving memories
from somewhere in the brain

485
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,021
and accessing the clues to solve the case.

486
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,148
That's what I do.

487
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,568
I think the past life is
a type of memory too.

488
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,948
I discovered something strange
as I helped Ms. Oh retrieve her memories.

489
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,494
Something strange?

490
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,956
The Polka Dot High School Girls
who went missing in Jongseo in 1993…

491
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,836
I think Ms. Oh is
one of those high school girls.

492
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:53,181
-Who is it?
-Detective Seo has the official report.

493
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,808
This is an unofficial report.

494
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,353
It's up to you to decide
whether you think it's true.

495
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,065
I'm only giving it to you
because I believe that

496
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,526
you're the one Ms. Oh trusts
and relies on the most.

497
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,679
WITNESS TESTIMONY GIVEN
UNDER HYPNOSIS (OH BAEK-RYEON)

498

What was that?

499
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,369
Is that you, Seo Jae-hee?
It's so good to see you!

500
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,372
What brings you here? You look great!

501
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,708
Why didn't you call me?
What brought you here?

502
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,042
Are you visiting the Seoul Police Agency?

503
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,335
Well, I came…

504
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,880
Hey, I'm sorry. I'll call you.

505
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,716
I'm sorry!

506
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,780
Hey! Guys!

507
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,283
Sang-hyuk. Where is he?

508
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,868
He isn't here yet. What's wrong?

509
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,952
Damn it.

510
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,041
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

511
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,293
He's not picking up.

00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,748
Q: WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE?
A: ORIGAMI FROGS

536
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,631
You just smiled, didn't you?
You smiled just now.

537
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,718
You can refuse me 100 times.

538
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,178
I'll just confess 101 times.

539
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,391
"YOU CAN REFUSE ME 100 TIMES,
I'LL JUST CONFESS 101 TIMES."

540
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:10,646
A: WHEAT TTEOKBOKKI

541
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,650
You said you'd buy me
the wheat tteokbokki that I like.

542
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,027
What? Hey, wait.

543
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:22,491
The guy I liked bought me jjajangmyeon
and wheat tteokbokki too.

544
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,501
Q: WHAT DO YOU SEE?
A: FLOWERS… PLUM BLOSSOMS…

545
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,545
Q: WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
A: THE PALACE BACK GARDEN

546
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,222
AT THAT MOMENT,
I SAW AN ANGEL'S WINGS

547
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,573
FAINTLY SAW THE WINGS
I SAW THAT NIGHT

548
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,333
BLEEDING
AFTER BEING SHOT BY ARROWS

549
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:21,676
No!

550
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,276
No!

551
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,530
Please don't leave me!

552
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,199
No!

553
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:51,956
No, don't go!

554
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,710
Please don't go!

555
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,504
As I sit next to my love
who is as beautiful as a flower,

556
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:45,718
nothing else in the world matters to me.

557
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,641
I MARRIED SOMEONE. WEDDING NIGHT
INSIDE A WATER MILL

558
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,226
Water mill…

559
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,645
I spent my wedding night there

560
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:59,565
with an angel with wings.

561
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,368
I got it. I got my love.

562
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,704
I got it.

563
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,501
From now on,

564
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,253
I'm going to fight against my destiny.

565
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,380
You're right in front of me.

566
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,925
It's so obvious I have feelings for you.

567
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:30,596
It would be unfair if I don't even try.

568
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:40,231
-Where is Baek-ryeon?
-Baek-ryeon went out.

569
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,315
Where did she go?

570
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,876
What brings you here?

571
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,754
I come here a lot. This is my 997th time.

572
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,548
Excuse me.

573
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:08,384
Mr. Superman.

574
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,553
Do you want to go for some makgeolli?

575
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,680
I didn't go all the way up that day.

576
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:19,311
As of today, I've gone up there 997 times.

577
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,498
One thousand.

578
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,712
Baek-ryeon!

579
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,726
Baek-ryeon.

580
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,925
Baek-ryeon, it was you.

581
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,302
It was all you.

582
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,597
It was you.

583
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:38,933
One thousand.

584
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,812
My woman.

585
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,690
My man.
