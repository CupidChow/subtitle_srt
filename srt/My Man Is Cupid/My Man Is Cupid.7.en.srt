1
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,510
It's cold.

2
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,641
I'm sorry for making you worry.

3
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:02,021
I thought it would be fine
since there were two of us.

4
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,399
I don't care if it was just you
or with someone else.

5
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,067
I told you not to go out!

6
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,277
I'll do that next time.

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,653
And, Do-ra.

8
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:11,489
Come on.

9
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,911
I'll go now.

10
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,037
Okay.

11
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,665
Hey, Mr. Superman.

12
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,750
What?

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,544
Come up and have some makgeolli
before you go.

14
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,214
He drove here. He can't drink.

15
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,885
He can call a driver or sleep over.

16
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,597
What did you say?

17
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,390
What do you mean?

18
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,517
Sleep over?

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,398
If he's worried about you every second,
he can stay with you then.

20
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,485
You two can stay together
and hold hands like this.

21
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,488
You can sleep under the same blanket.

22
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,783
You can stay together 24/7 like this!

23
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,205
What are you thinking? Goodness.

24
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,668
Why are you two blushing?

25
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,379
What were you imagining just now?

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,423
Imagine? No.

27
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,552
You look like you're blushing
because you imagined what would happen

28
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,345
if you two were under the same blanket.

29
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,138
No, I didn't imagine.

30
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,891
I never thought of that.

31
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,185
Baek-ryeon. You did, right?

32
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,688
She did. She imagined it.

33
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,273
Baek-ryeon!

34
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,359
What were you imagining?

35
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,445
What do you mean?

36
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,323
You're unbelievable!

37
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,701
Come in.

38
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,204
Come up and have makgeolli with us.
You can sleep over.

39
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,707
Why does she keep telling him
to sleep over?

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,126
She's so not conservative.

41
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,504
-Are you?
-Aren't you going to come up?

42
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,883
What if I drag her out at night again?

43
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,344
Gosh, it's snowing a lot.

44
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,888
It's snowing so hard.

45
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,556
Will it snow all night? Goodness.

46
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,266
Come on. Let's go.

47
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,155
-Hey.
-Yes?

48
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,824
Do you want to come up?

49
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,288
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,547
Can you give me a hand?

51
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,966
Thank you.

52
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,428
All right.

53
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,684
What do you like so much about Baek-ryeon?

54
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,520
Like her? Who likes her?

55
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,689
Who?

56
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,734
You, Mr. Superman, like Baek-ryeon.

57
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,281
I don't like her. I don't like her at all.
I swear I don't like her at all.

58
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,077
Then why were you shaking?

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,370
What? Shaking?

60
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,746
Who's shaking?

61
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,833
You were shaking because you were worried
something happened to Baek-ryeon.

62
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,461
You were?

63
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:15,839
Well…

64
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,220
That's because I ran there in a hurry.

65
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,389
Why were you running in a hurry?

66
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,432
That is…

67
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,397
You were worried that
something bad happened to her, right?

68
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,234
-That is--
-That means you like her.

69
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,988
-No. I don't like her.
-Stop denying it. You like her.

70
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,407
I said I don't like her.

71
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,659
Yes, you like her. It means you like her.

72
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,952
No, I don't like her.

73
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,578
Hey, come on.

74
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,372
-I'm 100% sure you do.
-A 100%?

75
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,165
How do you know that?

76
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,626
I've dated 100 men.

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,711
I know everything.

78
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,295
It's so obvious

79
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,006
that I don't like her.

80
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,300
See?
A strong denial is like an affirmation.

81
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,387
-You like her.
-A strong denial means no.

82
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,556
-That's not true.
-No! I said I don't like her.

83
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,099
Okay! I get it.

84
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,437
He said he doesn't like me.

85
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,397
Why do you keep asking him?

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,649
How many times do you have to ask?

87
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,987
He said it countless times!
He said it's definitely not true!

88
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,659
How many days have we had
beef bone soup now?

89
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,244
His mind is somewhere else because of her.

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,788
CHEON SANG-HYUK

91
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,707
All right. I got it.

92
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,791
No, you didn't.

93
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,377
-Why do you keep asking him?
-I mean…

94
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,588
-I hear a woman's voice.
-What do you mean you got it?

95
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,714
There are two women.

96
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,966
I made dinner.
Don't you see it on the table?

97
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,051
Hey!

98
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,553
Do you think we're some old retired men?

99
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,847
We've been having beef bone soup for days!

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,474
Go to Love Room if you don't like it.

101
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:53,228
But it's snowing! It's too far away!
Come and make us dinner right now.

102
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,398
Just have the beef bone soup and sleep.

103
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,025
Kkakdugi is well-ripened too.

104
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,902
Hang up now.

105
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,282
He hung up on me.

106
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,202
I told you he's preoccupied.
He's with two women at this hour.

107
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,745
Which of the two is it?

108
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,247
The girl with the loud voice
or the one with the really loud voice?

109
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,375
The one with the really loud voice.

110
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,630
Hey, Mr. Park.

111
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,131
I called you because--

112
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,217
Do you think you can send us some food?

113
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,594
What?

114
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,678
It's well ripe.

115
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,598
Where was I?

116
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,649
Was that your brother?

117
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,733
Yes.

118
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,697
How many brothers do you have,
Mr. Superman?

119
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,199
He has three older brothers.

120
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,992
How did you know?

121
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,369
They came to the hospital.

122
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,578
They did?

123
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,333
How old are your brothers?

124
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,336
How old are they?

125
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,380
They are-- Well--

126
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,424
We are all two years apart.

127
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,640
How old are you, Mr. Superman?

128
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,435
I'm 29 years old.

129
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,855
-Twenty-nine?
-We're the same age?

130
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,817
Yes, I guess we are.

131
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,946
Then your eldest brother must be 35.
It's perfect.

132
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,740
-Perfect for what?
-I'm 37.

133
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,368
So?

134
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,289
I'm just saying.

135
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,253
Does your eldest brother
look like you, Mr. Superman?

136
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,384
His eldest brother?

137
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,727
You're the best, Mr. Park!

138
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,520
What would we do without you?

139
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,316
Thank you for coming in the snow.

140
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,609
You're welcome.

141
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,402
Enjoy your dinner.

142
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,701
I would have dreamed of a cow's leg
if I had the beef bone soup again tonight.

143
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,288
By the way, where is Sang-hyuk?

144
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,417
Did he go somewhere?

145
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,050
She's the witness of that case?

146
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,135
Yes, of all people.

147
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,137
So you three brothers
are the only siblings.

148
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,890
Right. I have one more brother, though.

149
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,059
That man is here every day.

150
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,437
She's the witness of the missing case
in Inwangsan Mountain.

151
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,855
I guess he's worried.

152
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,358
He's always with her
like a bodyguard these days.

153
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,450
They recently had dinner together
at Love Room.

154
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,534
They had dinner?

155
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,869
-Together?
-Yes.

156
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,540
And he was trying
to set her up with a man.

157
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,625
What?

158
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,169
Set her up with a man?

159
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,546
He went through the profiles
of my male employees.

160
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,426
That means he doesn't like her.

161
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,930
No. It seemed to me that he liked her.

162
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,098
At least to me, he did.

163
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,064
Mr. Superman, what do you do for a living?

164
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,734
I run a restaurant with my brothers.

165
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,736
A restaurant?

166
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,406
It's quite big, isn't it?

167
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,283
How did you know?

168
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,829
It was obvious from the suits you wear
and the car you drive.

169
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,081
I could just tell.

170
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,042
It's on the outskirts
of Gyeonggi-do, right?

171
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,337
-Sorry?
-You sell about 1,000 bowls,

172
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,048
-like those soup or noodle places, right?
-No.

173
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,136
You run a noodle restaurant?
I love noodles.

174
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,430
-It's--
-I'm so jealous.

175
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,558
You will eat noodles for the rest
of your life if you marry him.

176
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,809
Hold on.

177
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,186
-What? Marry me?
-Marry him? No.

178
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,566
Come on. Isn't that too fast?

179
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,942
Goodness.

180
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,153
When will you marry her
and serve me noodles?

181
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,697
Noodles?

182
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,910
What are you two doing?

183
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,957
Let's just put him on the wanted list.

184
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,250
For what?

185
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,378
"I'm sure he's the man who killed
Go Eun-seo because he ran away."

186
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,838
You want me to say that
on the wanted list?

187
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,214
Without any evidence?

188
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,549
Then do we just do nothing?

189
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,885
Then you should have gotten him.

190
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,971
Hey, how fast can you run 100 meters?

191
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,848
I can run faster than you.

192
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,767
You're all talk.

193
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,352
Your lips are so thick.

194
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,561
I hope nothing happens.

195
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,729
Let's go.

EP7. WHAT THE CRIMINAL KNOWS

197
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,756
As you can see, we only have two rooms.

198
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,508
Baek-ryeon's room.

199
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,884
Do-ra's room.

200
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,765
All right. It's getting late.

201
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,225
Let's go to bed.

202
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,229
All right, then.

203
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,523
Hey, you two.

204
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:32,984
What are you doing?

205
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,445
What do you mean?

206
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,406
We're not doing anything.

207
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,783
We're just going to sleep.

208
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,493
That's right! Nothing will happen.

209
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,577
Don't worry.

210
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,331
You guys are ridiculous.

211
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,583
-Ridiculous? What is?
-What's ridiculous?

212
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,629
Baek-ryeon, you can sleep
with me in my room.

213
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,216
Mr. Superman, you can sleep comfortably
by yourself in Baek-ryeon's room.

214
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,634
Don't you think you should do that?

215
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,679
Single men and women
shouldn't stay together at night.

216
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,812
Why didn't I think of doing that?

217
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,439
You're right.

218
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,107
I didn't think of that.

219
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,486
Maybe you two wanted to sleep together.

220
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,946
What? No!

221
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,157
No! Don't say such things.

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,290
Let's go.

223
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,959
You should go.

224
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,090
Come on.

225
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,343
Good night.

226
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,923
What's up?

227
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,554
These are the biggest ones I have.

228
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,140
Right.

229
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,102
You want me to wear these?

230
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,854
What's wrong? You are going to sleep.

231
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,814
It's fine
as long as they're comfortable, right?

232
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,566
Right.

233
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,777
These aren't my type.

234
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,028
But, thank you.

235
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,404
My pleasure.

236
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,077
Aren't you going to go out?

237
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,662
I'm going to get changed.

238
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:54,042
Right. Call me if you need anything else.

239
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:01,841
Are you going to keep helping
the investigation as a witness?

240
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,304
Yes.

241
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,642
I have to speak up for the missing victim.

242
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,530
We just have one more to go.

243
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,157
Why does it have to be
the witness of that case of all people?

244
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,492
I'm sure nothing will happen.

245
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,912
You said all the witnesses died.

246
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,583
So you think she will get killed?

247
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,297
Well,

248
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,091
isn't that what you're worried about?

249
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,470
How did he look at the vet?

250
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,265
His eyes were…

251
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,840
You foolish thing.

252
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,302
The life of an individual without
a red thread of fate will end in tragedy.

253
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:27,404
The man you're destined to be with is
right there, but your heart is elsewhere.

254
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,952
Aren't you that--

255
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:38,248
Don't ever let go of the hand that
the man of your destiny offered.

256
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,332
What?

257
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,086
If you let go of his hand,
this is the result that you will face.

I just--

290
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,575
Just what?

291
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,201

You were? Why?

Well, it was instinct because it's my bed.
So I was just--

00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,794
Instinct? What did you do instinctively?

295
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,047
I was just lying down.

296
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,173
I didn't do anything.

297
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,009
I didn't do anything!

Are you sure you didn't do anything?

I didn't even lay a finger on you!

Why wouldn't you trust me?

302
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,478
Then why did you sneak into bed
next to me?

00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,397

Where's that?

361
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,755
I ran to Sungin-dong.

362
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,967
Then why did you run away?

363
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:20,222
That's because that man has been
following me for the past few days.

364
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,600
Gosh.
You ran away just because he followed you?

365
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,684
You didn't do anything wrong.

366
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,355
I borrowed money from a loan shark.
But I couldn't pay him back.

367
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,732
I thought the loan shark sent him
to get me.

368
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,570
I heard you got Cho Byeong-cheol.

369
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,823
My goodness!

370
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,787
Does he look meticulous to you?

371
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,539
Does he look like a serial killer?

372
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,505
He signed a waiver over his body
because of money.

373
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,298
He was the only one who was admitted

374
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,801
to the hospital in that area
because of a car accident then.

375
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,471
You said he looked similar.

376
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,972
When you go out,

377
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:06,185
you will see so many men
who are 175 cm tall and thin.

378
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,937
You can't say that now.

379
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,814
You agreed with me.
You thought it was him too.

380
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,148
That's not true.

381
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,234
I didn't totally agree with you.

382
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,320
I just said he looked like him.

383
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,072
You should have investigated more!

384
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,907
Am I a cop? You're the cop.

385
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,826
You've been a cop all this time.

386
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,246
You've been a cop, sir.

387
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:26,914
Right.

388
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,879
You can leave now.

389
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,385
I shouldn't have gotten scared. Goodness.

390
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,179
Get home safely.

391
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,266
You won't file a complaint, right?

392
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,603
-A complaint?
-What?

393
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,022
I'm the chief here.
That's what matters to me the most.

394
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,735
Unbelievable.

395
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,994
OUR DOG BITES
BEWARE OF DOG

396
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,760
Dong-chil.

397
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,389
Dong-pal. Dong-gu.

398
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,974
Aren't you going to eat?

399
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,562
Hey, Dong-gu!

400
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,691
Hey, Ddaeng-chil.

401
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,195
What's going on?

402
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,116
Dong-pal.

403
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,786
Did they go out to work?

404
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,665
But it's the weekend.
And it's still daytime.

405
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,644
LONELY SOULS, COME TO ME!

406
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,937
BANG MYEONG-SOO DATING ACADEMY

407
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,690
BANG MYEONG-SOO DATING ACADEMY

408
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,242
Oh, my gosh.

409
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,038
Welcome. How can I help you?

410
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,166
-What is this place?
-What on earth is this place?

411
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,085
Oh, what do we do here?

412
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,964
-This is where we teach about love.
-What?

413
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,298
You teach about love?

414
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,675
MY DATING HISTORY

415
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,516
Now, let's continue sharing
your dating history.

416
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,602
Next student, please come forward.

417
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,438
AMATEUR WHEN YOU ENTER
EXPERT WHEN YOU LEAVE

418
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:01,902
HEY! YOU CAN DATE TOO

419
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,366
I don't have a dating history.

420
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,617
Oh, me too.

421
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,371
I've been single since birth.

422
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,164
Me too.

423
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:17,251
I went to all-boys middle and high school.
I majored in engineering.

424
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:22,464
Currently, I'm working in a poor work
environment with 16 men and two women.

425
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:24,925
It really is a poor environment.

426
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,470
On top of that, the two women are married.

427
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,056
So I've never dated a woman.

428
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,768
I don't know how to make eye contact
with ladies.

429
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,854
I don't know how to talk to them.

430
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,732
I don't know how to ask them out
on another date either.

431
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,067
I really have no idea.

432
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:47,364
But do you know what's funny?

433
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:54,204
My 15 male co-workers
who went to all-boys schools, like me,

434
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,498
are all married.

435
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,375
The world is so unfair!

436
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,047
I don't know where they met women,

437
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,923
how they dated them,

438
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,842
and how they got married!

439
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,510
I really don't understand.

440
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,012
Neither do I.

441
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,974
Why are women only interested
in Dong-chil and Dong-pal?

442
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:18,145
That guy is a jerk!

443
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,898
-Let's go!
-Come on.

444
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,361
-Let's go get him!
-Let's go!

445
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,446
Excuse me.

446
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,243
We're in the middle of a class.
Where are you going?

447
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:39,667
Well…

448
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,796
I need to go to the bathroom.

449
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,510
Everyone, Cupid is in this room right now.

450
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,512
What? Did we get caught?

451
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,681
-What?
-There's nobody.

452
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,307
It's…

453
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,268
me!

454
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,937
-Geez!
-Goodness.

455
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,650
I'll be your Cupid from now on.

456
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,616
Guys.

457
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,535
Why would you pay and take classes?

458
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,912
Subscribe, turn on notifications,
and like.

459
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,498
You press that, and I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

460
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:25,045
Just do as I say from now on,
and you won't be lonely this winter.

461
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,882
Today, we have "Beautiful Full On."

462
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,469
AHN DO-RA'S BEAUTY FULL

463
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,888
For today's episode of Beauty Full,

464
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,766
I'll show you makeup
that will have guys asking for your number

465
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,059
even at a convenience store.

466
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,689
Is there such a thing?
Of course, there is.

467
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,692
Nothing ever happens,
because you don't put on makeup

468
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,193
and buy cup noodles in tracksuits.

469
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,947
Try the makeup look
that I will show you now.

470
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,368
Then go to the convenience store.
Pick a guy and make eye contact.

471
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,079
One, two, three.

472
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,540
Look at him in the eye for three seconds.

473
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:08,380
Then he'll ask for your number.

474
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:09,465
Like destiny.

475
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,050
Like destiny.

476
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,223
Don't ever let go of the hand
that the man of your destiny offered.

477
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,032
-Gosh, are you all right?
-My cards.

478
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,743
I'm so sorry.

479
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,567
Come in.

480
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,487
Doctor.

481
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,617
It's on January 30.

482
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,164
WEDDING INVITATION

483
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,210
It's a red thread.

484
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,088
People say married couples are destined
to be together by the red thread of fate.

485
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,341
I'm sure the one you're connected to
by the red thread is out there somewhere.

486
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,524
Is there any yarn that's similar to this?

487
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,610
Wait a minute.

488
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,868
This is the closest one.

489
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,744
Thank you.

490
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,792
Now, I'll put on my makeup.

491
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,210
One, two, three!

492
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,045
NO WAY HAHAHA

493
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,133
I want to look like I don't have makeup on
but I don't want to look too bare-faced.

494
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:20,053
It's just enough for a convenience store.

495
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,764
Is this it? No.

496
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,308
What did I say in the beginning?

497
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,936
This will have guys asking you for
your number even at a convenience store.

498
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,524
I'll go to the convenience store now.
With this makeup.

499
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,241
ARE YOU REALLY GOING?

500
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,387
What? Is she really doing it?

501
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,472
Why am I nervous?

502
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,600
-What if nobody asks for her number?
-Go, Do-ra!

503
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,694
I think he's looking this way.

504
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,154
-He's my type.
-Goodness.

505
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,447
His eyes are on Do-ra.

506
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,532
One.

507
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,035
Two.

508
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,245
Three.

509
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,919
He's fallen for me.

510
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,630
-The guy's coming.
-What?

511
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,757
-Is he asking for her number?
-He's coming.

512
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,093
-Is this for real?
-I think he's cute.

513
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,220
I don't think so.

514
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,222
Excuse me.

515
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,306
Do you need my number?

516
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,850
Yes, I think so.

517
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,144
-Did she get it?
-Is this real? Isn't it a setup?

518
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,022
-She's so cool. You're the best.
-I'll go to a convenience store now.

519
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,360
How old are you? I'm a bit old.

520
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,611
You are?

521
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,781
-What's wrong with the man's face?
-What's going on? Do-ra.

522
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:09,746
She was standing next to you.
Is she old too?

523
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,667
Do you need her number?

524
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,128
Yes, can I get her number?

525
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,381
Do-ra, it's okay. Cheer up.

526
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,175
-This show is funny.
-It's okay. It's okay.

527
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,273
LEE HO-JIN

528
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,486
Yes, Ho-jin.

529
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,947
What?

530
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,866
This woman is who?

531
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,076
Hang up.

532
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,639
So this is the man of your destiny.

533
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,808
Do-ra.

534
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,438
You're very good-looking

535
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,231
for a police officer.

536
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:22,527
I'm good-looking
outside the police station too.

537
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,576
Are you Baek-ryeon's stalker or what?

538
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,286
You're following her everywhere.

539
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,163
I'm her bodyguard.

540
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,247
For the time being.

541
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,668
I called and asked him to come with me.

542
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,337
I see.

543
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,301
I don't know why these things
keep happening.

544
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,095
Especially around me.

545
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,432
I heard this woman is missing.

546
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,479
Yes. It's been two days.

547
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,086
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,796
I saw it.

549
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,131
I saw his face.

550
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,426
You saw his face?

551
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,762
Yes.

552
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,733
Don't ever let go of the hand
that the man of your destiny offered.

553
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,304
Sir, I have to update you on something.

554
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,513
What?

555
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,310
Look, the man in black in the video.

556
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,397
This is the night the girl
from Room 620 committed suicide.

557
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,442
This is the day
Ms. Oh went up Inwangsan Mountain.

558
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,444
And the recent security feed
at the convenience store.

559
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,613
It's all the same guy.

560
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,200
If you look here, he's looking at Ms. Oh.

561
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,828
It's likely that the girl
in the red puffer jacket got killed

562
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,580
because she was near Ms. Oh.

563
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,129
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,643
So-jeong! So-jeong!

565
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,734
So-jeong.

566
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,410
Sir.

567
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,330
The witness who was on the bus…

568
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,044
She is dead.

569
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,266
It's all my fault.

570
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,352
It's because I testified that I saw her.

571
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,105
No, the police shouldn't
have gone to see her.

572
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,817
You should stop now.

573
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:50,819
It's too dangerous.

574
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,071
He won't kill me if I stop now?

575
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,660
I saw the culprit.

576
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,414
I'll try to remember him no matter what.

577
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,876
Okay.

578
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,461
Breathe comfortably.

579
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:19,055
You're at the convenience store
that evening.

580
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,564
Try to remember his face.

581
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,836
Ms. Oh, look into his eyes.

582
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,388
I'm sorry.

583
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,806
Ms. Oh, I know it's hard.

584
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,517
Try to remember his face slowly.

585
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,811
You're at the convenience store.

586
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:08,646
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,899
Try to remember what he's wearing.

588
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,276
What color was it?

589
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,737
It's black.

590
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:17,822
Look at his nose.

591
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,367
Look at his mouth.

592
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,186
Does he know who I really am?

593
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,440
He must have recognized me.

594
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,692
What do I do now?

595
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,696
I really need to take that class though.

596
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,367
They said I'd have a girlfriend
in three months.

597
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,994
Is there anything I can do?

598
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:13,920
I have the aura of a fairy.
How am I supposed to hide it?

599
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,215
It's too hard. It's just too hard!

600
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,096
Should I just tell him that I'm Cupid?

601
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,269
Here's your drink.

602
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,854
Thank you.

603
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:37,694
Excuse me.

604
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,406
Drink this and cheer up.

605
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,578
It's under maintenance.

606
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,497
Goodness.

607
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:56,963
Are you okay?

608
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,465
SELLING INSTANT RAMYEON NOW

609
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:25,742
I feel lighter.

610
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,788
Dong-gu recommended us a good spot.

611
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:36,169
He's going around and doing weird things
when we're about to leave.

612
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,136
We don't have much time left.

613
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:51,893
Gosh, so this is what it feels like
to be bittersweet.

614
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,482
It's not over until we leave.

615
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,947
I'm worried about Sang-hyuk these days.

616
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:09,327
Have you ever seen it?

617
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,413
Have you seen what happens

618
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,999
if you resist the last metamorphosis?

619
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,590
You'll lose your last chance.

620
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,703
It's snowing.

621
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,375
-Let's get in now.
-Why? It's nice that it's snowing.

622
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,127
Are you a child?

623
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,047
-You know what your situation is.
-What about my situation?

624
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:49,552
Why should I be afraid of snow just
because of the culprit? It's so pretty.

625
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,182
You know what?

626
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,311
People say life isn't about
avoiding heavy rain.

627
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,521
It's about dancing in it.

628
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:04,192
But this isn't rain, it's snow.

629
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:05,943
Pretty large snowflakes.

630
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,710
It's the first snow.

631
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,766
Sang-hyuk. You know that scarf
you gave me last time?

632
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:40,186
It's stained with a lot of blood
because I covered an injured dog with it.

633
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,230
It's okay. You don't have to return it.

634
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,606
That's why…

635
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,777
I knitted a white scarf myself.

636
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,551
I told you that when I was first found
at the orphanage,

637
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,096
I was abandoned in a ramyeon box.

638
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,725
It was a snowy winter night.

639
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:23,938
They told me that I was wrapped up
in a white scarf like this.

640
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:25,565
But…

641
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,569
it's you again.

642
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,363
And the white scarf too.

643
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,166
I read somewhere
that it takes 8,000 cosmic periods

644
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,418
for a man and a woman to be a couple.

645
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,296
You know how many stitches
it took to knit this scarf?

646
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:52,592
8,000.

647
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,394
From now on…

648
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,356
I'm going to fight against my destiny.

649
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,450
You're right in front of me.

650
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,705
It's so obvious I have feelings for you.

651
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,797
It would be unfair if I don't even try.

652
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,514
You regret it, right?

653
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,915
You regret that you didn't look
at me sweetly one more time.

654
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,422
You regret that you didn't talk
to me sweetly one more time.

655
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,928
You regret that you didn't smile
at me one more time.

656
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:18,362
You regret that you didn't give me
another warm hug.

660
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:16,128
Something should've already happened
to her according to the order of events.

661
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,215
Why do you think he skipped her?

662
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,884
OH BAEK-RYEON

663
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,349
What? You're sure he's the culprit
of the case in 1993?

664
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,521
Baek-ryeon is the evidence.

00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,359
He can't kill Baek-ryeon.

673
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,528
It's proof that he's the killer.

674
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,006
It was nice to meet you.

675
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,134

677
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,153
It's because I'm next to Baek-ryeon.

678
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,837
Help.

679
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,473
Help me.

680
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:35,518
Help.

681
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,937
Please help me.

682
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,963
The police are investigating
the Inwangsan Mountain missing case.

683
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:08,884
The person who saw the victim last
was put under hypnosis

684
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:12,680
and the police were able to get
a sketch of the prime suspect.

685
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,267
The missing case happened
on a snowy night, December 21.

686
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,062
All the witnesses stated
that there was a man in a black jacket

687
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:22,857
who approached the missing woman.

688
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,608
But due to heavy snow,

689
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:28,404
it was difficult to get an
accurate impression of the man.

690
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:32,658
The police got the sketch of the suspect
based on the witness testimony.

691
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,954
They expect to make significant progress
with this new development.

692
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,208
That guy saw me.

693
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:46,839
He's been keeping an eye on me
because I was with Baek-ryeon.

694
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,133
He's watching you?

695
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,427
Speaking of which…

696
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:57,474
This is the sketch of the culprit based on
the testimony of the witness, Ms. Oh.

697
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,938
SUSPECT SKETCH

698
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,749
Someone is here
to help us with the investigation.

699
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,379
He's the last witness of the missing case
of girls with polka-dot jackets in 1993.

700
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,125
That's probably not what he looks like.
