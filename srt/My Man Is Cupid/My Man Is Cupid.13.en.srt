1
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,948
MY MAN IS CUPID

2
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,217
He was a short guy.

3
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,303
So why did he…

4
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,096
That last case…

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,349
won't happen.

6
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,770
Because I'm in here.

7
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,897
He knows about the Seven Sins for Women.

8
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,690
What could he have meant?

9
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,692
An accomplice.

10
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,781
He's the accomplice.

11
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:15,326
The short guy Ms. Oh saw
at the parking lot.

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,790
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,210
That jerk who was seen
at the convenience store.

14
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,504
He's an accomplice,

15
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,673
but Kim Myeong-sik made a confession.

16
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,386
Is he trying to take all the blame?

17
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,264
So why?

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,481
Jealousy.

19
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,943
If it's for that last one…

20
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,572
For the last one remaining…

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,202
I'll get going first.

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,703
Where are you going?

23
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,387
Huh?

24
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,930
This place is…

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,474
It's this neighborhood?

26
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,811
Yoo Jeong-ah and Song Da-hee,
the fourth victims, used to live here?

27
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,895
Yes.

28
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,024
This is where
Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah used to live.

29
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,318
My goodness.

30
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,070
-My gosh.
-Here.

31
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,948
I called a cab, so it'll be here soon.

32
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,033
My goodness. I hope it comes soon.

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,833
The number you have dialed…

34
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,800
Ah-rom.

35
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,344
Hang in there. My goodness.

36
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,429
My poor baby.

37
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,639
-It will be okay.
-There, there.

38
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,851
The test shows that
both her liver and kidney are fine.

39
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,562
Most importantly,
she doesn't have a heartworm infection.

40
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,147
So don't worry.

41
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,151
Does that mean it's okay
for me to raise her?

42
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,485
Yes, thank goodness.

43
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:19,158
We don't know what kind of environment
stray dogs are exposed to.

44
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,162
It looks like she's fine
based on this simple blood test.

45
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:27,499
But keep her isolated and monitor her
for about a week just in case.

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,376
Considering the latent period.

47
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,086
Okay.

48
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,798
But what happened?

49
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,428
It was that day.

50
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,472
The day Eun-seo's body was found.

51
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,974
It rained a lot that day.

52
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,811
She was whimpering in front of my place,
drenched in the rain.

53
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,480
I just saw her then.

54
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,608
It felt like Eun-seo had shown up.

55
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,445
That's why I named her Potato.

56
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,532
Eun-seo liked everything made
with potatoes.

57
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,242
I guess it's meant to be.

58
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,536
Thank you.

59
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,706
You helped me find Eun-seo's body,
at the very least.

60
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,502
You should visit
with Potato from time to time.

61
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,337
There's so much I don't know.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,880
Please give me guidance.

63
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,049
All right.

64
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,642
This way, please.

65
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,727
-Yes. Come on.
-Ah-rom.

66
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,020
Hang in there.

67
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,188
-It's here.
-Okay.

68
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,398
Okay.

69
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,778
Detective Yeo. Is everything okay?

70
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,862
Sir.

71
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,367
Excuse me! Excuse me!

72
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,286
Our dog just swallowed a peach seed.

73
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,417
A poster? What are you talking about?

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,752
It lists seven things
children shouldn't do.

75
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,380
We found a Seven Sins for Children poster.
I sent a photo.

76
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:57,965
Hold on.

77
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,679
SEVEN SINS
CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT

78
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,889
Where did you find this?

79
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,433
Angel Orphanage in Changsin-dong.

80
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,059
It's where Ms. Oh grew up.

81
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,022
It's where Ms. Oh grew up?

82
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,570
She'll go into surgery right away.

83
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,280
So don't worry.

84
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,656
Thank you.

85
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,585
I got it.

86
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,881
Luckily, I removed it before
it went down to the intestine.

87
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,427
This small thing went into her stomach
and gave her such a hard time.

88
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
You must have been scared.

89
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,018
I guess this is your first time
at our clinic.

90
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,062
It's actually our first time
at an animal clinic.

91
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,229
Oh, really?

92
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,732
The dog looked pretty old.

93
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,609
A few days ago,

94
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,029
I found her whimpering at our front gate.

95
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,240
So we just took her in, not knowing
what we'd gotten ourselves into.

96
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,421
My goodness. Thank you.

97
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,799
-How did it go?
-It went all right.

98
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,426
We were in such a rush
that we didn't thank you properly.

99
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,386
-Please check on Ah-rom.
-Sure.

100
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,479
I heard you brought them to our hospital.

101
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,773
Yes. Luckily, it was nearby.

102
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,297
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae?

103
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,152
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae?

104
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,490
Don't be ridiculous.

105
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,742
He went missing 28 years ago.

106
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,703
Even if he's alive,

107
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,037
he can't be that young.

108
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,502
I'm sorry. My wife thought
you were someone else for a second.

109
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,047
Maybe he's the detective's son?

110
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,842
Detective Cheon wasn't married.

111
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,932
Maybe he's his secret son.

112
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,684
Or he's someone

113
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,604
who can't reveal who he really is.

114
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,529
Doctor, Ah-rom's awake.

115
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,864
She is?

116
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,033
Shall we see her together?

117
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,117
Okay.

118
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:35,015
EP13. CAUSE AND EFFECT

119
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,726
Ah-rom.

120
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,979
Mommy's sorry. I shouldn't have left
the peach seed there.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,316
First-time dog owners often make mistakes.

122
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,443
It's just like raising a kid.

123
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,739
I left things everywhere
when I was raising Jeong-ah too.

124
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,991
So we often had to go
to the emergency room.

125
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,995
It was Jeong-ah's birthday
when we first met Ah-rom.

126
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,790
Jeong-ah's your daughter?

127
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,375
Yes.

128
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,877
She went missing 29 years ago.

129
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,883
I thought Ah-rom could be our daughter.

130
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,389
That's why I named her Ah-rom.

131
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:20,394
My daughter loved the cartoon,
Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog.

132
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,863
She always tended to do
the opposite of what she was told.

133
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,701
After my daughter went missing

134
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:40,455
on a snowy night 29 years ago,

135
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,791
I couldn't do anything for a while.

136
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:49,381
I couldn't smile or eat for a while.

137
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,758
Because I felt so guilty.

138
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,762
I didn't even know where my daughter was.

139
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,808
So how could I smile?

140
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,227
How could I eat?

141
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,278
Thank you.

142
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,322
Thank you for saving her.

143
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
She will be fine in two to three days.

144
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,917
You can take her home then.

145
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,754
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

146
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,931
You should have greeted them properly.

147
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,101
You haven't seen them in a while
but you treated them like strangers.

148
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,194
Don't aliens have any manners?

149
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,570
-Aliens?
-Yes.

150
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
You're an alien.

151
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,240
An alien.

152
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,992
Me?

153
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,954
Tell me the truth if you don't want me
to get the wrong idea.

154
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,082
Why should I do that? For whose sake?

155
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,419
I have a favorite saying from Earth.

156
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,922
"He that would eat the fruit
must climb the tree."

157
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,090
A "saying from Earth"?

158
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,925
All right.

159
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,427
I have a favorite saying too.

160
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,889
"Don't overplay your hand."

161
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,482
Goodness.

162
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,362
Hey, were you crying?

163
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,948
Well…

164
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,701
It's because we were telling her
about our daughter.

165
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,789
Honey, let's get going.

166
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,874
The doctor should rest too.

167
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,836
Thank you so much for today.

168
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,671
Don't mention it.

169
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,215
We'll be back
when Ah-rom is ready to go home.

170
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,633
Please take good care of her.

171
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,760
Don't worry. Get home safely.

172
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,845
Thank you.

173
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,891
Take care.

174
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,358
Goodness. Here.

175
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,447
She cried last time too.

176
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,574
Huh? What are you talking about?

177
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,201
She cried in front of our place
the other day too.

178
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,792
Goodness.

179
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,591
-Why did you cry?
-Who made you cry?

180
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,553
I'm talking to her.

181
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,185
What's wrong with you two?

182
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,353
You showed up out of the blue

183
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,731
and told me not to hang out
with him because he's an alien.

184
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,025
And you ran to the hospital late at night

185
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,652
and dragged me towards you,
telling me to stay away from him.

186
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,530
What's wrong with you?
You're both old enough to know better.

187
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,075
-You're older, aren't you?
-Well…

188
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,954
You two should be friends.

189
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,331
Friends?

190
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,875
I can't be friends with a man

191
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,586
whose identity is unclear, like this guy.

192
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,130
I can't be friends
with someone who acts so childish.

193
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,882
-What?
-"Don't overplay your hand"?

194
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,010
-A cop shouldn't threaten people.
-Seriously. Knock it off!

195
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,314
That's why I cried.

196
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,193
They said she was a stray they found
on their missing daughter's birthday.

197
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,446
I guess it was meant to be.

198
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,451
By the way, I saw their house in my dream.

199
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,787
Do you remember the place?

200
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,289
The neighborhood we went to
with Detective Seo.

201
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,960
It's here. I don't know how it happened.

202
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,379
But she keeps showing up in my dreams.

203
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,676
Actually, I went there by myself before.

204
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,636
Thank you.

205
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,137
Goodbye.

206
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,563
I cried then, too.

207
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,857
I choked up
for some reason, and I was sad.

208
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,491
Don't you miss your parents?

209
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,911
My parents?

210
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,708
No.

211
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,586
Why would I miss them
when they abandoned me?

212
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,759
What would you do
if they hadn't abandoned you?

213
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,637
What if they actually missed you very much

214
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,181
and searched for you desperately?

215
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,649
SEVEN SINS
CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT

216
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,235
After Director Hong Ae-kyeong
beat the kids,

217
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,572
she made them write about
what they did wrong in a red notebook.

218
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,117
Doesn't this mean that the culprit

219
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,453
is one of the kids from the orphanage?

220
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,456
As you know,
Kim Myeong-sik is not an orphan.

221
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,833
Then why did he confess?

222
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,085
Maybe he's trying to protect
the accomplice.

223
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,507
That short guy Ms. Oh and Ms. Ham saw.

224
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,384
So why would he do that?

225
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,599
Why is he protecting his accomplice
by going as far as confessing?

226
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,979
If he's the same guy who was responsible
for the 1993 Seven Sins for Women cases,

227
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,773
then he has just this one case left.

228
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,192
"Jealousy."

229
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,486
There is one witness left too.

230
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,657
The last witness.

231
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,158
OH BAEK-RYEON
LAST SEEN WITH EUN-SEO

232
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,004
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae?

233
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,882
Maybe he's the detective's son?

234
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,343
Detective Cheon wasn't married.

235
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,137
-This man is--
-He said that was his father.

236
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,934
I told you to stop coming.
And to stop bringing flowers.

237
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,146
I can do whatever I want.

238
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,067
Stop. I told you to stop.

239
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,767
I told you to stop coming.

240
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
And to stop bringing flowers.

241
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,437
You should go inside.

242
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,230
You should really go in now.

243
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,357
The voices are…

244
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,197
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

245
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,531
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

246
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,825
6. NOT CLEAN
7. COMPLAIN

247
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,205
So, you're going to reinvestigate?

248
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,166
There are things
that still seem suspicious.

249
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,334
If there's an accomplice--

250
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,961
It has already been transferred
to prosecution.

251
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,214
The suspect even confessed that he did it.

252
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,552
-But if there's an accomplice--
-What if you don't get the accomplice?

253
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,596
If you don't get him
after you stir things up?

254
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,599
Don't go asking for trouble.

255
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,017
There is no accomplice.

256
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,444
You can eat now.

257
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,529
Thank you.

258
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,073
It's been so long
since we had a team dinner.

259
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,370
-Is it good?
-We're here to eat.

260
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,080
We're not here to just admire the meat.

261
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,627
If that's what the chief says,
we should just wait.

262
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,756
I was swayed by it too
because it all made sense.

263
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,007
If you think about it,

264
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,886
it's Sang-hyuk who's trying to link things
with the Seven Sins for Women.

265
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,556
If you ignore the cases in 1993 and 1994,

266
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,767
this is just a missing case
for Go Eun-seo and Song Jin-ah.

267
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,812
The only common contact
between them is Kim Myeong-sik.

268
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,939
All the evidence points to Kim Myeong-sik.

269
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,691
And he even confessed.

270
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,609
What about the girl
from the convenience store?

271
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,074
That's a missing case that's
not related to these cases.

272
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,617
We didn't find a red notebook either.

273
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,911
What about the witnesses,
Ham Yeon-ja and Kim Tae-kwang?

274
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,038
What about Im Ye-won
who we thought was the witness?

275
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,291
And Ms. Yoon So-jeong,
the witness from the bus?

276
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,751
They're all unrelated cases.

277
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,630
Ham Yeon-ja died from a fire.
Kim Tae-kwang was killed in a fall.

278
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,717
Ye-won and So-jeong killed themselves
because they had their own reasons.

279
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,428
I guess you can say
they're separate cases, if you insist.

280
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,142
Well, Kim Myeong-sik confessed.

281
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,435
Let's wait and see.

282
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,814
The problem is his height.

283
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,700
A short guy was also seen.

284
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,079
Isn't there an Omega-3
that doesn't smell fishy?

285
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,457
There is.

286
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,083
Zo In-Sung.

287
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,711
It gets absorbed fast.

288
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,588
What does he have that I don't?

289
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,881
It has a less fishy smell.

290
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,634
It's smooth on the throat
because it's a small capsule.

291
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,971
Consecutively, number one. Promega.

292
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,806
Is there anything besides his height?

293
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,309
Until everyone's blood circulation
in Korea gets better.

294
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,895
Healthy blood circulation, Promega.

295
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,396
I don't have time.

296
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,522
I have no time.

297
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,665
Dong-chil.

298
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,334
I'm going to ask you some questions now.

299
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,961
Answer them properly.

300
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,046
What is it?

301
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:00,134
What do I have to do first
to get close to a woman?

302
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,553
Tell me the most effective way.

303
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,264
I have no time.

304
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,603
Eat. You should eat together first.

305
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,230
Eat?

306
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,234
I said I don't have time.

307
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,152
But that's how you begin.

308
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,072
When it comes to a relationship
between a man and a woman,

309
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,407
you have to eat together first.

310
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,491
Are you sure?

311
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,910
-I just have to eat with her?
-Yes.

312
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,933
LOVE ROOM

313
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,488
Mr. Park.

314
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,510
It's this room, sir.

315
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,488
Cheon Dong-chil!

316
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,698
Dong-pal!

317
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,826
Do something!

318
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,662
-I'm all tied up.
-Hey, my neck is killing me.

319
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,290
Damn it. I want to go to the bathroom.

320
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,460
You don't know what I'm going through.

321
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,837
You can just pee anywhere. But for me…

322
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,381
-Hey.
-A chamber pot.

323
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,966
I'll figure something out.

324
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,901
I got it.

325
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,405
I hope you have a good time.

326
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,327
Thank you for the meal.

327
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,878
I guess you're close to the owner.

328
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,755
You must be a regular.

329
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,134
This is my business.

330
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,094
I run this place.

331
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,639
You run this restaurant?

332
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,350
This is why he told me to eat with her.

333
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,434
Yes.

334
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,270
That's right.

335
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,022
MR. DONG-CHIL

336
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,361
Yes, sir. Mr. Dong-gu is actually here--

337
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,612
Mr. Park! Help me.

338
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,698
What's wrong?

339
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,084
-Mr. Park.
-Sir.

340
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,567
Dong-pal!

341
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,825
Don't tell me that you…

342
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,623
Dong-chil.

343
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:00,958
A chamber pot?

344
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,795
Sir.

345
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,020
Luckily, the key
was in Mr. Dong-gu's room.

346
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,065
I won't let Dong-gu get away with this.

347
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,859
He's having dinner
in the Love Room with a lady.

348
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,946
-A woman?
-A female human?

349
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,489
-Dong-gu?
-Cheon Dong-gu?

350
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,950
Yes, he's dining with a woman.

351
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,451
-Just the two of them.
-Then…

352
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,702
So he actually has a girl.

353
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,037
We should hurry.

354
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,790
These days, Dong-gu's a ticking bomb too.

355
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:48,005
This siraegi jeon
is what we're promoting this season.

356
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:54,929
It's delicious.

357
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,640
-Plus, it's unique.
-I came up with the recipe.

358
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,851
-You make the menu, too?
-I told you. This is my business.

359
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:07,817
It must have been hard for you
to run a restaurant of this size.

360
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,571
How do you know that?

361
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,783
I don't need to hear the full story
to know that it probably wasn't easy.

362
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,746
It was really hard for me.

363
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,998
It was my friends' fault.

364
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,208
I didn't want to do it,
but my friends forced me.

365
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,627
I was just hanging on to the edge.

366
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,005
That's why all four of us got stuck here.

367
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,464
I have wings.

368
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,175
But I can't even fly
because the lead weighs down my wings.

369
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,722
Wings?

370
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,850
I told you. I'm a fairy.

371
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,560
Right.

372
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,104
You mean the wings that a fairy has?

373
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,647
You don't believe me?

374
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,482
You don't believe that I'm a fairy?

375
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,988
That's not important.

376
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,867
What's important is that
you piqued my curiosity now.

377
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,370
I don't know what you mean.

378
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,457
I want to know more about you.

379
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,336
You keep telling me that you're a fairy.

380
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,258
You're attractive.

381
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,178
You have that unexpected charm.

382
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,734
I'll get going first.

383
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,819
My wife's going to kill me
if I'm home late again.

384
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,571
You can't die. Go home.

385
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,074
-My mom told me to come home.
-You're still here? Go home.

386
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,158
-Yes.
-Bye.

387
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,701
-Bye.
-Bye.

388
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,328
-Bye.
-Great job today.

389
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,090
So…

390
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,426
-Did you see anything?
-I saw a lot.

391
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,055
They were just so lovey-dovey.

392
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,141
-Damn it.
-I thought I'd die of loneliness.

393
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,395
Did you see him change?

394
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,938
He didn't change.

395
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,857
Why doesn't he change?

396
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,318
I don't know
if Sang-hyuk's an alien or not.

397
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,362
But they're in love.
Why interfere with that?

398
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,990
This is so unlike you. Why are you going
after a girl who doesn't like you?

399
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,702
I don't know either! Before I know it,
I'm next to Baek-ryeon.

400
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,163
Before I know it, I'm worrying
about Baek-ryeon.

401
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,500
Maybe we knew each other

402
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,210
in our past lives.

403
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,258
My dream. It was in my dream.

404
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,639
A sword dripping with blood.

405
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,476
A sword dripping with blood?

406
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,772
-You mean your nightmares?
-Yes.

407
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,525
-That suddenly crossed my mind.
-When?

408
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:01,365
When Sang-hyuk and Baek-ryeon
were hugging.

409
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,952
Did you secretly watch them hug?

410
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,414
-Secretly? No.
-You just happened to be there.

411
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,374
You just happened to be there?

412
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,168
Well…

413
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,379
I felt the same rage

414
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,548
that day.

415
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,469
It was irrationally intense.

416
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,429
Maybe you two were ill-fated
in a past life.

417
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,805
Remember Detective Park?

418
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,099
His heart pounded a lot
whenever he saw Detective Go,

419
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,392
so he had a tough time too.

420
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,228
He saw his past life through hypnosis.
He's all okay now.

421
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,647
Why don't you go there too?

422
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,150
-Hypnosis?
-Yes.

423
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,361
Your obsession may decrease
after you see what was in your past life.

424
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,946
It's not an obsession!

425
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,741
Interest.

426
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,915
JONGSEO BARBECUE RESTAURANT

427
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,666
I'm full.

428
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,129
Get home safely.

429
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,339
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

430
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,550
-You're going this way?
-Yes.

431
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,869
Drive slowly!

432
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,372
Are you okay?

433
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,051
Yes, I'm okay.

434
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,294
-Dong-pal.
-Dong-chil.

435
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,088
-Finally!
-It's back.

436
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,730
FELL OFF A CLIFF
AND SAW THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL

437
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,483
That's when I saw them.

438
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,985
Your wings.

439
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,956
I'm done.

440
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,626
Don't they look like this?

441
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,255
How did you see them?

442
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,883
When I put a flower petal
on top of my index finger

443
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,051
and counted to three,

444
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,303
I saw them.

445
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,055
Three.

446
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,768
That's how I recognized you.

447
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,773
Because you're the man
I'm destined to be with.

448
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,853
Q: WHAT DO YOU SEE?
A: FLOWERS. FLOWER POTS.

449
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,939
Q: WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE?
A: ORIGAMI FROGS

450
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,403
By the way, I saw their house in my dream.

451
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,739
I choked up
for some reason, and I was sad.

452
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,715
You're leaving work soon, right?
I'll be there soon.

453
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,878
You're attractive.

454
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,755
You have that unexpected charm.

455
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,034
Do-ra!

456
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,994
Can't you see me? Do-ra!

457
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,758
Here's your bill.

458
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,387
Did the owner go somewhere?

459
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,932
-The owner?
-Mr. Cheon Dong-gu.

460
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,726
Who's Cheon Dong-gu?

461
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,729
This restaurant owner's name
is Mr. Park Seung-jun.

462
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,941
No, it's me.

463
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,944
He's just Mr. Park! I'm the real owner!

464
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,153
Do-ra!

465
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,199
Can't you see me?

466
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,742
Do-ra!

467
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,582
TOTAL AMOUNT: 285,000 WON

468
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,053
Your payment is complete.

469
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,513
Thank you.

470
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,310
No! No!

471
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,729
This can't be happening!

472
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,691
Do-ra. Do-ra!

473
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,067
Do-ra!

474
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,151
Do-ra!

475
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,181
What happened?

476
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,311
Hey, you two.

477
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,937
What are you doing?

478
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,655
-We're back.
-What happened?

479
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,866
Why did it stop?

480
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,706
You're having the same nightmare.

481
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,629
I see a sword dripping with blood
every single time.

482
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,383
One was a long sword,
and the other one was a short sword.

483
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,428
Were you scared when you saw that sword?

484
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,139
No, it wasn't fear.

485
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,684
It was rage.

486
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,949
I was so angry that I wanted to kill.

487
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,456
Now, breathe comfortably.

488
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,750
One.

489
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,335
Two.

490
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,505
One.

491
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,840
Two.

492
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,553
Go to that place you saw in your dream.

493
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,639
What do you see?

494
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,642
A court lady.

495
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,270
She's looking at a flower petal.

496
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,355
Please.

497
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,945
A court lady who's smiling.

498
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,462
If you can't give me your heart,

499
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,381
then you should die for me.

500
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,844
I can't die for you.

501
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,513
The only person I will die for is…

502
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,957
-You're Soon-yi's owner, right?
-Yes.

503
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,083
This way.

504
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,258
Soon-yi.

505
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,018
Hang in there. Please.

506
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,405
I think it's time for you to say goodbye.

507
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,496
Soon-yi.

508
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,748
Soon-yi.

509
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:43,799
Thank you for all the happy memories
these past 19 years.

510
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:49,096
Let's meet each other again.

511
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,959
Soon-yi…

512
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,934
I'm sure she was happy

513
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,689
to have a family who was sad
in her last moments

514
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:43,859
and remembers
the time they spent together.

515
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,903
You have someone like that too.

516
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,886
Goodness, your drawing looks amazing.

517
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,203
I got it.

518
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,705
I got my love.

519
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,059
That's when I saw them.

520
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,186
Your wings.

521
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,896
Don't they look like this?

522
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:40,660
I'll be with you wherever it may be.

523
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,757
What?

524
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,926
There is a way to change my fate?

525
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,513
It's your turn now.

526
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:04,100
Die for that fairy.

527
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,190
That's where a new bud will bloom.

528
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,268
You smell nice.

529
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,355
You smell like flowers.

530
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:52,625
You smiled. I guess we both like frogs.

531
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,335
I guess we both like frogs.

532
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,791
"When I called his name,

533
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,669
he came to me and became a flower."

534
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,556
You have two more people
who are just like these flowers.

535
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,233
I'm off to school.

536
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,040
That's why you feel like
you've been here before.

537
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,177
My goodness. Doctor Oh.

538
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,729
Ah-rom has gotten a lot better.

539
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,689
So I've been meaning to visit you.

540
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,695
What brings you here?

541
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,614
Well…

542
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:32,201
-She has a friend who lives around here.
-I see. Is that so?

543
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,831
Have you eaten?

544
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,752
We were about to have dinner.
Would you like to join us?

545
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,588
Come on in.

546
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:44,839
Come in.

547
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,758
Come on now.

548
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,760
Let's go in.

549
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,421
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
YOO JEONG-AH

550
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:32,220
Can't you see the other girls?

551
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,971
Please? Please?

552
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,269
You're a kid. Stop saying
such ridiculous things.

553
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,979
You should eat now.

554
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,401
I'm not a kid. I'm a grown woman.

555
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,946
You may not know this,
but I'm very popular.

556
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,866
It's embarrassing for me
to say this myself, but…

557
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,702
Lean closer.

558
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,499
I'm known as one of
the top five most beautiful girls

559
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,917
in Sungin Girls' High School.

560
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:06,963
I see.

561
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,215
I got it. We should eat now.

562
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,175
Hurry up and eat.

563
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,639
I have something else to tell you.

564
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,099
Lean closer one more time.

565
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,810
The top five most beautiful girls
in Sungin Girls' High?

566
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,562
No, it's about something else.

567
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,398
Okay.

568
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,911
Hey, you can't do this.

569
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,916
You're in trouble.
You're my man now, Superman.

570
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,923
You didn't come here
to eat tteokbokki, right?

571
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,008
No.

572
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:56,721
SEOUL RECORDS

573
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,852
Kim Hyun-sik.

574
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,938
Could you do a gift wrapping?

575
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,483
-A gift?
-Yes.

576
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,401
Who are you giving it to?

577
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,488
To the man I've been chasing after
with everything I have.

578
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,531
He's a lucky guy.

579
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,659
A pretty lady like you is after him.

580
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,787
But he keeps saying no.

581
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,122
I'm so upset.

582
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,054
I can't believe I'm laughing
like this again.

583
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,642
Goodness. I told you,
it's like Jeong-ah is back.

584
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,228
I laughed a lot when she was around.

585
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:08,584
-Goodness. Doctor, you're crying again.
-My gosh.

586
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:12,380
I guess it's because
we keep talking about our daughter.

587
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:14,257
No.

588
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:20,096
-It's because the food tastes so good.
-You're a crybaby.

589
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,764
My daughter used to cry a lot, too.

590
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,308
Let's stop talking about her now.

591
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,482
May I be Jeong-ah for you?

592
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,241
I'll be Jeong-ah.

593
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,697
Thank you.

594
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,538
I love all the moments I was excited
and happy because I met you.

595
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,167
I love them all.

596
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:46,010
The first time I saw you and all the times
I spent with you since then.

597
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,596
As wild grass,

598
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,723
a wild flower,

599
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,683
a bug, and a butterfly.

600
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,146
After being reborn like that…

601
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,691
Even when I was 19 years old,
and 29 years old as well.

602
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:08,616
How did you--

603
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,702
Thank you for being by my side
and in front of me.

604
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,996
-Baek-ryeon.
-I love you.

605
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,875
No matter what you are.

606
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,463
