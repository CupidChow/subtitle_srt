1
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,952
Mr. Superman.

2
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,871
Are you okay?

3
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,586
Are you okay?

4
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,422
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Are you sure you're okay?

5
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,050
Let me see.

6
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,149
You didn't get hurt.

7
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,443
You didn't get hurt at all.

8
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,612
Why didn't you get hurt?

9
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,780
What?

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,866
-Was I supposed to get hurt?
-Why is he fine?

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,036
Was I not supposed to be fine?

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,537
This doesn't make sense.

13
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,043
Your back should have been broken.

14
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,212
-What?
-Your shoulders should have been crushed.

15
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,007
-Your arm must be broken, at least!
-How can you say that?

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,177
How about your legs? Are they okay?

17
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,517
You should have enough injuries
to be in hospital for 50 weeks.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,435
What? 50 weeks?

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,396
-You mean 12 months? A year?
-Yes.

20
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,316
It's always been like that.

21
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,069
What do you mean?

22
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,738
Men around me
would get struck by lightning

23
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,782
or pass out after choking on cold water.

24
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,577
One even fell and broke his nose.
He lost a lot of blood and went to the ER.

25
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,954
My goodness.

26
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,206
One nearly died from eating pudding.

27
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,667
Pudding?

28
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,377
So why…

29
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,595
You don't even have a scratch on you.
You didn't even bleed a drop.

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,433
-Was I supposed to bleed?
-This is a miracle.

31
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,563
Stop looking at me.

32
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,523
Thank you!

33
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,109
Thank you, Mr. Superman.

34
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,153
Thank you so much!

35
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,697
Thank you!

36
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,876
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,008
What was that all about?

38
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,302
I didn't do anything.
You started hugging me.

39
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,014
So who was that man?

40
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,101
Can't you tell from the fight?

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,394
We're not close at all.

42
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,231
Right. So why did you fight
in front of me?

43
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,774
Given the circumstances,

44
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,903
I think I saved you
from being attacked by that man.

45
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,281
Oh, that's right.

46
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:27,499
I was so glad that you're okay
that I forgot what happened exactly.

47
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,172
Are you sure he's not a stalker?

48
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,049
You seemed popular.

49
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,597
So, that's what he was. A stalker.

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,434
Why are you walking around
so late at night?

51
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,396
-I was just passing through.
-Passing here?

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,898
You were passing through a dark alley?

53
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,110
I'm meeting someone at a tripe restaurant
nearby, and this is the shortcut.

54
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,820
Otherwise, I have to go around.

55
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,449
My friend is already grilling
four portions of beef tripe.

56
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,617
I'm in a hurry.

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,078
Don't put yourself in danger,
just to be a few minutes early.

58
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,164
Take the safe route. Okay?

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,291
Okay.

60
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,088
By the way, why are you here?
What brought you to this dark alley?

61
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,799
You could have taken the safe route.

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,689
-This is the shortcut.
-Where are you going?

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,110
-To the beef tripe restaurant.
-You like beef tripe too?

64
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,572
-Yes.
-Why do we have so much in common?

65
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,991
We met at the makgeolli place.

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,994
-Now you're on your way to a tripe place.
-I didn't go there to drink.

67
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,787
Where is your dinner reservation?

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,623
Why would you want to know that?

69
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,042
We must be meant to be if we're
going to the same places.

70
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,752
"Meant to be"?

71
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,505
-How are we "meant to be"?
-The makgeolli place and the tripe place.

72
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,299
-If this isn't fate, I don't know what is.
-Just a coincidence.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,385
-A coincidence.
-It's fate.

74
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,972
Where is that beef tripe place?

75
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,059
Wherever it is,

76
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,478
it's not where you are going.

77
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,772
How do you know
which restaurant I'm going to?

78
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,818
-I just have a feeling.
-Do you?

79
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,987
Why don't we go and check together?

80
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,780
Let's see if we're going
to the same place.

81
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,034
Let's go.

82
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,914
-Aren't you coming?
-Do we have to go together?

83
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,499
I want to go by myself.

84
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,044
Why? You think I'll get clingy
if it's the same place?

85
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,422
Let's just check.

86
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:52,603
EP3. THE NOBLEMAN OF FATE
AND THE PLUM BLOSSOM MAN

87
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,854
WANGSIMNI AUTHENTIC BEEF TRIPE

88
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,689
Come to the authentic one.

89
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,942
REAL BEEF TRIPE

90
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,110
Come to our stall!

91
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,531
Which one is it? Authentic or Real?

92
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,826
Why are there
Wangsimni restaurants in Gugi-dong?

93
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,953
It doesn't matter,
as long as it tastes good.

94
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,747
Which is it?

95
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,665
Wangsimni Authentic or Real Beef Tripe?

96
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,543
-Which one are you going to?
-Authentic Tripe.

97
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,379
Oh, I see.

98
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,090
I'm going to Real Beef Tripe.

99
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,053
-We're meant to be.
-What?

100
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,847
-I'm headed to Real Tripe.
-But you said the other one!

101
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,599
I just lied.

102
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,604
I just lied too.

103
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,940
In fact, I'm headed here.

104
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,608
Really? Me too.

105
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,195
Why do you keep changing?

106
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,697
Why don't you go to the place
you were originally going to?

107
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,741
You're the one who keeps lying.

108
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,661
My friend is waiting for me,
so I can't lie anymore.

109
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,745
So,

110
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,373
go in first.

111
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,293
My gosh.

112
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,636
Welcome!

113
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,879
Are you serious?

114
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,589
No.

115
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,257
Then why are you here?

116
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,342
I had to tell you something.

117
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,596
Tell me what?

118
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,847
Thank you.

119
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,015
You saved me earlier.

120
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,933
Oh, that.

121
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,020
Anyone would've done the same.

122
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,522
Yes, that's probably true.

123
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,276
But I'm grateful it was you, Mr. Superman.

124
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm glad that you're safe.

125
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,325
That's what I'm most grateful for.

126
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,791
Enjoy your dinner then. I'm sorry,
but I'm headed to Authentic Beef Tripe.

127
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,505
Bye.

128
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,101
Are you here by yourself?

129
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,604
Can I have it to go?

130
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,897
Welcome.

131
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,707
Did you have an octopus or what?
Why are you limping?

132
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,252
It's the first time that nobody got hurt.

133
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,337
Who didn't get hurt?

134
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,505
He didn't get hurt.

135
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,716
He didn't even have a scratch on him.
He didn't even bleed a drop.

136
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,885
Who? When? Where?

137
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,179
What? How? Why?

138
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,431
Please walk me through it.

139
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,227
On my way here, a stalker followed me.

140
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,688
What? A stalker? Again?

141
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,565
Who was it?
What kind of jerk was it this time?

142
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,026
What poor bastard would stalk you?

143
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,111
Is he okay?

144
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,990
Keep going. What happened?

145
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,244
The stalker followed me
and was about to attack me,

146
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,913
when a man suddenly appeared
like Superman and saved me.

147
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,625
He caught the stalker and punched him.

148
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,210
He punched the stalker twice.

149
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,713
He punched and pushed him.
They were fighting.

150
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,048
Then a big pot fell.

151
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,686
He didn't get hurt.

152
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,147
He didn't?

153
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,982
Yeah, he didn't get hurt.

154
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,694
He didn't get hurt at all.

155
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,573
Supermen don't get hurt
because of small fights.

156
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,657
Drink.

157
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,167
He didn't even have a scratch.

158
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,918
He didn't?

159
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,590
My hard work
is finally starting to pay off.

160
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,010
I guess my prayers in the mountain
are starting to work now.

161
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,390
The light of romance

162
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,143
started to shine on me.

163
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,816
This is the man.
He's the man of my destiny.

164
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,319
WANGSIMNI AUTHENTIC BEEF TRIPE

165
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,656
The man I'm destined
to be with is finally here!

166
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,329
Did you climb up the mountain
a thousand times?

167
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,247
Not yet. Six more to go.

168
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,333
Then he's not your destiny.

169
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,335
You said he'd be there
on the thousandth day.

170
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,091
Maybe they just sent him ahead of time.

171
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,301
-Like a trailer.
-Are you checking samples?

172
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,428
I think you just like him.

173
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,391
Did you fall for Superman?

174
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:29,439
What would you do if you
and the mountain god have different ideas?

175
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,607
Then what happens?

176
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,277
Let's say they send him to you
on the thousandth day…

177
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,529
My destiny?

178
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,742
No. This can't be happening!

179
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,620
…but he's just not your type.
Then what happens?

180
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,124
Do you have to negotiate
with the mountain god

181
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,542
to get you another guy?

182
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,046
But it's a god.

183
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,967
I'm sure it knows what my ideal type is.

184
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,138
Did you picture your ideal type
when you were hiking?

185
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,889
-No.
-Not even once?

186
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,391
-No.
-Not even a little?

187
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,147
This is bad. It's going to be random.

188
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,566
What do I do now?

189
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,778
For the remaining six times,
picture your ideal type in your head.

190
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:22,075
Be precise. Clearly tell the god
what your ideal man is like.

191
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,328
Right.

192
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll do that.

193
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,292
I'll picture him clearly.
I even know his name.

194
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,105
The police station that got
the first report checked on it.

195
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,733
They couldn't see the umbrella
with the flower print in the picture.

196
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,485
I told them to check again,

197
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,903
but as you can see…

198
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,072
It's impossible to not get off the bus
once you're on it. We missed her.

199
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,242
Let's split up and check.

200
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,119
Detectives Ko and Lee.

201
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,538
From Inwangsan Mountain
to Sungeun Hospital.

202
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,789
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,083
Detective Myung and I will check
from Sungeun Hospital.

204
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,168
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,129
I don't think she's here.

206
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,507
-She's not here either.
-She isn't here either.

207
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,108
She got off without her umbrella.

208
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,318
What?

209
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,362
But it was snowing the whole time.

210
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,072
She got off without her umbrella.

211
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,762
My goodness.

212
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,223
I love you.

213
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,308
Goodness.

214
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,852
You always kiss people
when you get drunk! Stop!

215
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,662
Hey, did you get
Ddaeng-chil's anal sac treated today?

216
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,086
Don't come near me.

217
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,463
Don't come near me.

218
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,256
Keep that finger away from me!

219
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,383
No!

220
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,261
Cheon Sang-hyuk!

221
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,057
You humiliated me.

222
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,643
You jerk.

223
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,104
Why did you get it treated?

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,316
He's already heartbroken over Mi-ja.

225
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,901
She swore at the poor guy.

226
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,320
It will burst
if it's not treated every so often.

227
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,072
-Would you do it instead?
-No.

228
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,013
You don't even have a scratch on you.

229
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,974
There is a scratch.

230
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,272
Thank you so much!

231
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,863
My goodness. It's him!

232
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,949
He must be the one!

233
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,284
He's the one I'm destined to be with!

234
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,919
Six more times to go.

235
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,592
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,760
Please forgive me.

237
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,928
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,179
Please forgive me.

239
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,476
I'll tell you my ideal type
because D-day is coming up.

240
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,147
His name is Cheon Sang-hyuk.

241
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,024
Cheon Sang-hyuk!

242
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,738
This is how he looks.

243
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,409
He looks like a fairy.

244
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,543
I should bring a photo of him.

245
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,628
So that there's no confusion.

246
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,257
His photo.

247
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,513
My goodness.

248
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,641
Gosh, how could the place
burn down like this?

249
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,186
-I know.
-Goodness.

250
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,064
She couldn't have made it.

251
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,906
Excuse me. What happened?

252
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,783
Oh, there was a fire last night.

253
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,577
-The owner of this place died.
-What?

254
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,204
How did that happen?

255
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,040
She fell asleep while cooking
Korean pancakes on the stove.

256
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,666
Don't you think it's strange?

257
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,420
She's been selling pancakes for 30 years.
How could she make such a mistake?

258
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,090
-Her children are--
-Oh, no.

259
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,765
I know.

260
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,482
Didn't she say she was going to
install a security camera?

261
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,529
Right. But I don't see it.

262
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,456
She suffocated due to the fire.

263
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,583
OVERDOSE OF SLEEPING PILLS
DETECTED

264
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,545
She either passed out from an overdose.

265
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,088
Or someone drugged her.

266
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,344
DETECTIVE KO

267
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,307
-Detective Ko.
-Sir.

268
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,768
I looked up the number of the
installation technician

269
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,186
who was assigned that day.

270
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,980
It's a burner phone.

271
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,314
-Is it?
-Yes.

272
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,359
He must've contacted someone.
I'll trace his calls.

273
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,570
All right. Keep it up.

274
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,156
I got the sales status of the umbrellas
with the flower patterns.

275
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,158
There are 15 purchases from that area.

276
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,286
Any accidents reported from that area?

277
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,121
None so far.

278
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,500
Let's go and find the flower pattern lady.

279
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,096
-You have this umbrella, right?
-Yes, I do.

280
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,766
You were at Inwangsan Mountain
on December 21st, right?

281
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,934
No.

282
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:49,439
PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED
A FLOWER-PATTERNED UMBRELLA

283
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
SEOUL JONGSEO POLICE STATION

284
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,487
You've done a good job.

285
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,323
-How about a cigarette?
-All right.

286
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,538
By the way, did they find
the other person?

287
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,167
They said it's hard to find him
because there aren't many clues.

288
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,294
Let's wait. They're making progress.

289
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,138
I don't have a photo of him.

290
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,435
Come in.

291
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,896
This is the reservation list for today.

292
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,316
Why don't we have photos of the guardians?

293
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,028
What? Why would we need those?

294
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,577
Well, it's to…

295
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,374
precisely match the pet
with their guardian.

296
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,793
A lot of people will complain
about taking photos.

297
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,170
They won't want to disclose
their personal information.

298
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,380
-Is that so?
-Yes.

299
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,969
I'm going to call Alex's guardian later.

300
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,013
It looks like
he's really going to adopt her.

301
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,142
It's tough for people
when their dogs are sick.

302
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,230
Of course. They have to come
to the hospital a lot too.

303
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,485
You go to the hospital when you're sick.

304
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,378
Hello.

305
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,507
-Hello. It's Oh Baek-ryeon.
-Oh Baek-nyeon?

306
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,884
It's Oh Baek-ryeon.

307
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,428
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

308
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,138
Oh, it's you. Dr. Oh Baek-ryeon.

309
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,597
How can I help you?

310
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,474
Well,

311
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,020
how's Ddaeng-chil doing
after his anal sac was treated?

312
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,063
His anal sac?

313
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,524
Is this the best you got?

314
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,986
I think he'll bite me if I check it now.

315
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,532
It's a sensitive area.
It might get infected.

316
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,616
Yes, it's sensitive.

317
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,869
Did you call just to check on that?

318
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,540
It's just that I checked
Ddaeng-chil's medical records.

319
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,501
There's one thing I'm worried about.

320
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,005
He's overweight.

321
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,758
Ddaeng-chil is overweight. He's obese.

322
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,384
Obese?

323
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,141
He likes to eat meat.

324
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,143
He should cut down on meat.

325
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,480
It's all your fault
that the dog is gaining weight.

326
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,567
-Why is that my fault?
-He only eats because you give him food.

327
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,362
-I only give it to him because he asks.
-A dog can't speak.

328
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,656
My dog can talk.

329
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,993
No way.

330
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,704
That's funnier than when
people insist their dogs don't bite.

331
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,373
No, my dog bites.

332
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,628
-He bites me if I don't give him food.
-Speaking of which, could you drop by?

333
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,254
-Drop by the hospital?
-Yes.

334
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,049
He should get a medical checkup.

335
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,344
Obesity is the root of all disease
for people and dogs.

336
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,513
I need to check on him now and then.

337
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,140
Drop by the hospital
when you have the time.

338
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,642
Oh, this was it.

339
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,394
-You want him to get a physical exam.
-What?

340
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,979
I visited only once.

341
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,942
You called me the next morning
to get him a medical checkup.

342
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,569
No, you don't understand.

343
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,238
I'll think about it. I'm hanging up now.

344
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,531
He has to have breakfast.

345
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,409
Mr. Superman.
That's not why I called. Hello?

346
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,954
Hey, come eat!

347
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,706
Come eat!

348
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:46,259
He thinks I'm a vet
who makes early morning sales calls.

349
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,222
My goodness!

350
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,933
He's going to gossip about me
over breakfast.

351
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,603
My goodness. What do I do?

352
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,773
Are you teasing him or what?

353
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,943
Yesterday, you got his anal sac treated
and today you're feeding it to him?

354
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,571
What are you imagining? It's just food.

355
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,865
But this looks just like that.

356
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,867
We are fairies, remember?

357
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,661
-We don't eat things like this.
-Hey.

358
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,830
You look like someone
who'd love things like this.

359
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,666
Beef tripe for breakfast?
What's gotten into you?

360
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,044
What's that on your forehead?

361
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,505
Did you fight with somebody?

362
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,798
It's nothing. I just fell.

363
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,511
What?

364
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,222
This tastes so good.

365
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,183
This is seriously good.

366
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,768
-It's really delicious!
-It is, right?

367
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,896
They sold it at that restaurant.

368
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,235
Ddaeng-chil,
we're going to the hospital after this.

369
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,905
-Again? Why?
-They said you're obese.

370
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,449
Me?

371
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,296
Hello. This is Seo Jae-hee
of Homicide Unit One.

372
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,424
Hello. I'm calling from
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

373
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,551
Am I speaking to Alexandra's guardian?

374
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,802
What? Who?

375
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,558
Right. I'm Alexandra's guardian.

376
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,394
-Yes.
-Alexandra?

377
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:26,234
-He was so happy to hear from us.
-She met a good guardian, right?

378
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,819
It'll be hard to take care of her though.

379
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,331
Didn't you go to school today?

380
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,499
It's a day off.

381
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,584
-Foundation day?
-No.

382
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,044
There are just days I skip school.

383
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,675
It happens for everyone.

384
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,760
By the way, it looks like

385
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:58,224
that dog gained some weight.

386
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,561
I'm taking him to the hospital now.

387
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,896
Have a good day.

388
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,028
"Before I called his name,

389
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,865
he was only a gesture.

390
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,827
When I called his name,

391
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,539
he came to me and became a flower."

392
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,964
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

393
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,768
-I think I've seen you somewhere before.
-I've never seen you before.

394
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,437
No. You're familiar.

395
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:49,442
People often say that I look like
that elf in The Lord of the Rings.

396
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,611
I don't think so. That's not you.

397
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:56,407
Which one are you?
Theft, assault, scam or blackmail?

398
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,159
I'm in charge of murder cases.

399
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,705
Murder cases?

400
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,666
I guess you're an expert.
Even in this lifetime.

401
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,335
What did you say?

402
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,837
Mr. Seo. You can come in.

403
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,255
Okay.

404
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,382
See you later.

405
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,885
I'm sure I'll remember
when I see you again.

406
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,511
Wait.

407
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,265
What's your number?
Let me see your wait number.

408
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,683
I didn't get one.

409
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,643
-What?
-Who does he think he is?

410
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:25,811
We all have numbers.

411
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:29,815
WAIT NUMBER 17

412
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,280
It's required here.

413
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,950
So go over there,
take a number and wait in line.

414
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,914
I made an appointment.

415
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:45,998
An appointment?

416
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,460
You can make appointments here?

417
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,798
If we can do that,
why are we waiting around like idiots?

418
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,299
This is how it works.

419
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,259
You see the vet in the order you arrive.

420
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,304
If your dog is admitted
for a major operation,

421
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,765
then we take appointments.

422
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,269
My dog is recovering from a major surgery.

423
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,481
How's my Alexandra doing today?

424
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,566
-Let's go in.
-Let's go.

425
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,320
A major surgery?

426
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,616
What are you looking at?

427
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,077
Come in.

428
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,703
-Here.
-Okay.

429
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,706
-Thank you.
-You're here.

430
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,874
Yes.

431
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,670
I told you that I'd drop by every day.

432
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,300
Look at them.

433
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,261
-What's going on?
-What's with them?

434
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,054
-What's going on?
-What is it?

435
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,014
-What's happening?
-Are they having a fling?

436
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,142
Goodness, look at him.

437
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,102
Don't tell me they're dating.

438
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,104
Now's the honeymoon stage.

439
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,691
Hey, these dogs are telling me

440
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,902
that those two are going to go out soon.

441
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,742
-Based on what?
-These guys are professionals.

442
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,412
It's not the first time
they've seen their owners dating.

443
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,999
These guys have witnessed so much.

444
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,962
And they can tell that those two
are going to become a couple soon.

445
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,231
I'll be back tomorrow.

446
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,859
Don't push yourself too hard.
Come back when you can.

447
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:37,985
Okay.

448
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,281
What?

449
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,034
You're here.

450
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,503
Ddaeng-chil can come in.

451
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,550
-Let's go. Come on. Let's go.
-I'm not going.

452
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,636
-I said I'm not going. No!
-Come on.

453
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,391
What makes you think that he's obese?

454
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,185
Well,

455
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:16,690
the average weight for Labrador Retrievers
is 27 to 36 kilograms.

456
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,902
But Ddaeng-chil is 38 kilograms.

457
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,948
He has to start losing weight.
You need to walk him more.

458
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,078
Cut down on meat.

459
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,872
Control his weight now

460
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,417
if you want to live
a long and happy life with him.

461
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,801
Wait. That scratch.

462
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,428
It's from yesterday, right?

463
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,931
-Let me see.
-No, I'm fine.

464
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,104
Hold on.

465
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,447
Can you come closer?

466
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,783
-I--
-Come here.

467
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,809
I'm glad, though.

468
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,437
You don't need to go to the hospital.

469
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,495
By the way…

470
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,210
do you want to have dinner with me?

471
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,766
I'm finally going to have dinner
with my crush.

472
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,809
How do I make him mine?

473
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:18,562
You are going to have dinner
with your crush.

474
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,898
How do you make him yours?

475
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,485
Just remember these three things.

476
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:45,047
LOVE ROOM

477
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,055
Hello.

478
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,767
-May I know the name for your reservation?
-It's Oh Baek-ryeon.

479
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,018
It's Room One.

480
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,691
HISTORY OF THE LOVE ROOM

481
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,858
This way.

482
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,036
This is the room.

483
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,205
MATCHED IN THE LOVE ROOM

484
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,757
It's very nice.

485
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,759
How do you know about this place?

486
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,512
I come here to eat a lot.

487
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:38,350
First, you pay for the meal today.

488
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,981
Men like girls who pay for the meals.

489
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,737
LOVE ROOM MENU

490
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,864
Why is it so expensive?

491
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,080
Welcome.

492
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,165
Thank you.

493
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,374
Well--

494
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,878
You can order whatever you want.
Order as usual.

495
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:10,883
-Don't worry about the prices.
-All right, then.

496
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,347
I'll have grilled abalones
and shrimp tartar.

497
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,185
And steamed jumbo shrimp with five-colored
garnish, fried scallops, and japchae.

498
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,936
Don't be too intimidated by the price.

499
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,273
-It's just one meal.
-Lemon juice on top.

500
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,234
She's right. It's just one meal.

501
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,612
I can have ramyeon for the entire month
after having this.

502
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,072
Okay, we'll prepare it for you.

503
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,367
Okay. Thank you.

504
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,377
Oh?

505
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,174
The scratch on your forehead
got all better.

506
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,719
That's because I put on ointment
for you earlier, right?

507
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,224
Wow.

508
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,644
My hand is a healing hand
for you, Mr. Superman.

509
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,648
How can it disappear so quickly
just because of the ointment?

510
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,526
I think we're really meant to be.

511
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,905
Is it your first time here, Baek-ryeon?

512
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,449
-This is a very popular place.
-It is?

513
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,534
Popular for what?

514
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:22,037
It's where lonely people like you
come for blind dates.

515
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,330
And they leave as couples.

516
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,959
I guess it's a famous place
for blind dates.

517
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,258
Does that mean
that we will leave as a couple today?

518
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,635
We aren't here for a blind date.

519
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,679
Geez, you are pushing me away again.

520
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:42,808
I saw a lot of wedding photos on the wall.

521
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,686
I guess they got married
after having a blind date here.

522
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,146
Now you know. You should make a wish.

523
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,649
Who knows if Cupid will shoot you
with his arrow?

524
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,828
How much is all this?

525
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,418
I ordered what I usually eat. Is it okay?

526
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,591
Two. Show him that you are listening.

527
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,925
Put on a big smile.

528
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,720
These all look delicious.

529
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:25,726
He'll imagine what it would be like to be
with you as he sees how positive you are.

530
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,438
Oh, my. This tastes

531
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,190
like heaven.

532
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,527
Goodness.

533
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,571
The food here is so good.

534
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,325
Is it that good?

535
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,785
-Baek-ryeon.
-Yes.

536
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,830
Is there anyone you like among the men
who come to your hospital?

537
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:47,915
Someone I like?

538
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,418
How about the rich-looking man

539
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,670
who always brings you flowers?

540
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,839
You mean Andre's guardian?

541
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,299
He's not my type.

542
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,304
How about that muscular man
who wears a tank top during winter?

543
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,307
-You mean Bbu-ggu's guardian?
-How about him?

544
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,642
Women like men with muscles.

545
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,310
Men with lean muscles are better.

546
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,520
How about that man
who graduated from that elite college?

547
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,022
You two would have lots to talk about.

548
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,815
We don't. All he did was study.

549
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,860
-How about that tall man?
-Bbo-bbo's guardian?

550
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,071
He's too tall.

551
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,364
He's just too tall.

552
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,993
How about that guy who isn't that tall,
but he has big eyes and facial features?

553
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,370
You mean Pete's guardian.

554
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:32,751
I don't like men with big eyes,
a high nose, and thick lips.

555
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,795
Baek-ryeon.

556
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,172
There's a reason
you've been single for so long.

557
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,092
Are you sure you want to date someone
from this world?

558
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,260
Your standards are too high!
I can't set it up for you.

559
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,930
Set up what for me?

560
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,351
Well--

561
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,729
You did say that this is
a famous blind date spot.

562
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:56,483
Do they give a free blind-date coupon
if we eat here?

563
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,443
-No.
-Set up what for me then?

564
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,445
I'm just asking.

565
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:06,743
So, you don't like any of the men
who come to the hospital?

566
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,289
Three. Show your heart.

567
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,960
That's how you move on to the next step.

568
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,964
I don't form bonds with people.

569
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,174
Especially with women.

570
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,806
Why do you refuse
to form bonds with people?

571
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,851
Don't you want to be in love?

572
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,273
-I don't.
-Why not?

573
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,984
Are you scared that you will get hurt?

574
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,948
Would you still refuse love even if
the right woman comes to you like fate?

575
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,242
-I would refuse.
-Are you sure?

576
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,952
I will never do it.

577
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,370
I doubt it.

578
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,750
Don't say "never."
You don't know what will happen.

579
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,256
If you meet someone you love so much,
she might change your thoughts.

580
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,342
You'll jump into a fiery pit,
forgetting whatever happened earlier.

581
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,635
That's what humans do.

582
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,388
How would you know that?
You said you've never been in love.

583
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,062
I've seen it in TV shows.

584
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,522
There are a lot of people like that
in those shows.

585
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,816
They swear they won't fall in love again.

586
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,612
But they forget about everything
and fall madly in love again.

587
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,155
They give up their lives for their love.

588
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,824
TV shows ruin so many people.

589
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:32,829
You have no idea.
It gives you a vicarious thrill.

590
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,750
No wonder you're so picky.
There's a reason behind this.

591
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,475
You can just go.

592
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,227
The bill is paid.

593
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,394
All paid?

594
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:57,729
When? Who?

595
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,816
-He paid in advance.
-What?

596
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,490
Goodbye.

597
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,206
Why did you pay?

598
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,041
I was supposed to treat you.

599
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,460
I saw you trembling
when you were drinking water.

600
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,920
That's because--

601
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,466
I was really thirsty.

602
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,554
I was so happy to see the water.
You think I can't pay for this?

603
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,222
I have a lot of money.

604
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,350
Give me your account number.
I'll transfer you the money.

605
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,810
No, it's all right.

606
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,478
I don't have such a thing.

607
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,063
You don't have such a thing?

608
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,565
Do you have bad credit?

609
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,526
Even if you do,
you should still have a bank account.

610
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,905
You eat here all the time. I can't believe
you don't have a bank account.

611
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,368
You don't want to tell me
your account number.

612
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,871
-What?
-Why don't you want to tell me?

613
00:40:55,954 --> 00:41:00,083
You think I'll ask you out again
because you got the meal?

614
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,919
You don't want a second date with me,
so you paid for the bill.

615
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,299
You're very thorough, aren't you?

616
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,259
You refuse to give me an opening.

617
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:12,012
-That's not what I meant.
-Whatever.

618
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,389
Why don't we split today's bill?

619
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,309
I feel very uncomfortable
when you treat me to dinner like this.

620
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,936
I'll pay you half via an app.
I don't need your account number.

621
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,062
Bye, then.

622
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,982
What?

623
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,880
But there's one important thing
you need to keep in mind.

624
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:52,093
First, you pay. Second, you show
that you listen and smile.

625
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,012
Third, show him how you feel.

626
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,014
These three things only work

627
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,143
when the man is interested in you.

628
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,354
If he's not interested in you,

629
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,565
then it won't work at all.

630
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,861
Come to think of it,

631
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,156
he kept asking if I liked any other guys
while we were eating.

632
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,159
He was pushing me away.

633
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:21,456
He wanted me to look for other guys
instead of liking him.

634
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,671
A way to end your crush?

635
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,381
There is no way.

636
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,562
Why did she get mad at me
when I treated her to an expensive meal?

637
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,357
I'm not going to shoot an arrow for her.

638
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:53,238
I don't care if you're lonely
or you don't have the red thread of fate.

639
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,781
I won't shoot for you! Ever!

640
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,492
Geez. Damn it!

641
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,745
You have to just let it run its course.

642
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,331
-Damn it!
-Geez!

643
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,335
When you just let it run its course,

644
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:11,798
there will come a moment when you realize

645
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,217
that you're doing something stupid.

646
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,344
There will be a moment
when you come to your senses.

647
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,222
But until then, no matter how hard
people try to stop you

648
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,392
or try to talk sense into you,
you won't listen. You can't.

649
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,936
You just do it again
even when people tell you not to.

650
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,397
You do it again like an idiot.
It drives you crazy.

651
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,608
You can't stop.
You have to just let it run its course.

652
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,031
What? You're never going to love?

653
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,080
What if I ask the gods
to make you my destiny?

654
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,042
I prayed a thousand times
on top of a cliff

655
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,752
to make my wish come true!

656
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,177
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

657
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,346
It was my fault. Please forgive me.

658
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,103
Four more times.

659
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:10,940
Right! His photo.

660
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,776
When can I take his photo?

661
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,114
I have to show the photo soon
to prevent confusion.

662
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,630
A woman?

663
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,216
He went out to have a meal with a woman?

664
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,509
Who was she?

665
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,220
-A vet at the animal hospital.
-What?

666
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,347
Doctor Hwa-ja?

667
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,684
-Of course not.
-But you go to that hospital.

668
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,187
-We switched to another one.
-Where?

669
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,732
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital. It's
right across from Poppy Animal Clinic.

670
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:57,904
I'm not even obese, but he took me
to the hospital early in the morning.

671
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:01,366
-Because of the vet?
-Yes. Her name is Oh Baek-ryeon.

672
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:03,827
That female vet…

673
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,582
she applied ointment
on Sang-hyuk's forehead.

674
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,085
What? Ointment?

675
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,089
Like this.

676
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,051
Like this?

677
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,930
-Something is going on.
-Definitely.

678
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:25,765
What is it?

679
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,143
What could it be?

680
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:31,438
I don't know anything.

681
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:36,317
There was one thing that puzzled me
the most about humans.

682
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,953
-It was inequality.
-Young Master.

683
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:50,331
How do you make the story sound so fun?

684
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:54,461
-Is there anything you're bad at?
-I'm just naturally gifted.

685
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,634
It's my turn now.

686
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:04,804
Do you know what it's called
when a king is in the palace?

687
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,598
"I don't want to go," right?

688
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,016
I can't wait to hear it.

689
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,311
It's called "grumbling."

690
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,358
-Gosh.
-I'm tearing up.

691
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,364
It's my turn now.

692
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,288
Do you know what you say

693
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,873
when a chili smiles?

694
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,459
Gosh, what's with him?

695
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,085
Why chili, though?

696
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,921
It's just a green chili.

697
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,507
Should I have the soldiers take him away?

698
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,135
Here, have a drink.

699
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,429
All right. Let's have a drink.

700
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,223
Bottoms up.

701
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,605
Doesn't it taste nice?

702
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,524
It's nice. You are nice too.

703
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,153
I thought I made a joke too.

704
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,990
I didn't understand why the ladies laughed
only at Dong-chil and Dong-pal's jokes,

705
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:10,620
while they never bothered
to even smile at me.

706
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,667
You're pretty even when you're eating.

707
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,170
I really did not get it.

708
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,588
It's because you're pretty.

709
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,133
You can't tell the difference?

710
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:25,426
I can't.

711
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,930
You don't look like them.

712
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,932
You look very different from them.

713
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,142
-Is that the difference?
-Yes, that's it.

714
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,272
Why do women laugh so hard
at their lame jokes?

715
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,943
It's because they're good-looking.

716
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,361
-Is that it?
-That is all.

717
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,157
I was truly shocked.

718
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,537
I couldn't believe looks were
all that mattered to women here.

719
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,059
Hey.

720
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,103
-What are you looking at?
-Sorry?

721
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,563
What are you looking at?

722
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,316
-Why do you keep looking at me?
-I looked at you?

723
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,401
I wasn't looking at you.

724
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,069
You were looking at me.

725
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,363
You've been staring at me.

726
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,616
-I'm telling the truth.
-Don't look at me.

727
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,159
You are getting on my nerves.

728
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,748
Sometimes, I get mad too.

729
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,048
-Excuse me.
-You scared me.

730
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,716
Why are you following me?

731
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,886
You were offended
that I was looking at you?

732
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,014
Yes, I was offended.
I don't feel good at all.

733
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,600
You don't feel good?

734
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,562
You messed with the wrong person.

735
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:03,024
You're going to regret what you just said.

736
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:06,110
You're going to fall in love with me!

737
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,993
Are you giving me
the middle finger right now?

738
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,082
What a jerk.

739
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,754
I don't get it.

740
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,049
I really don't get it.

741
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,309
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:40,728
I couldn't find anything…

743
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,315
that could be a clue.

744
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,820
My daughter came back after 29 years.

745
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,823
But we can't even figure out
who killed her.

746
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,789
Jeong-ah…

747
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,065
I deeply regret it.

748
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,238
I regret that I have to leave
without catching the culprit.

749
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,036
Cheon Sang-hyuk.

750
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,455
Cheon Sang-hyuk of Gugi-dong.

751
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,542
How can I describe the way he looks?

752
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,919
He looks like…

753
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,089
He looks just like that, like a fairy.

754
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:36,636
What?

755
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:46,979
What's going on?

756
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,067
Mr. Superman!

757
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,861
Superman? Who? Where?

758
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,279
Is he wearing the suit?

759
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,491
What brings you here, Mr. Superman?

760
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,742
What brings you here?

761
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,620
I come here a lot. This is my 997th time.

762
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,289
What? How many times?

763
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:08,501
I was just thinking about you.

764
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,255
Right, I need your photo.

765
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:15,758
Before I forget.

766
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,178
-What?
-Smile.

767
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,348
I told you to smile. Smile.

768
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,684
Okay.

769
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,065
This one looks better. I got it.

770
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,608
What are you doing?

771
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,193
Can't you see? I'm taking a photo.

772
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,072
So, why are you taking a photo of me?

773
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,535
Well…

774
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,206
-I need it for something.
-You need it for something?

775
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,917
-For what?
-Don't worry.

776
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,837
-It's for something nice.
-I'm not fine with that.

777
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,505
-Delete the photo.
-Goodness.

778
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:59,552
-I said it's for something nice.
-I'm not okay with it. Delete the photo.

779
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,429
Don't worry.

780
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,472
I'm not posting it on some porn site.

781
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,640
Porn site?

782
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,893
You are unbelievable. Give it to me.

783
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,645
Delete the photo now.

784
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,439
Delete it now.

785
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,108
I'm taking your phone for real.

786
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,985
I mean it.

787
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,153
Just give it to me.

788
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,864
I said give it to me.

789
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,883
Goodness.

790
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,803
You should have just given it to me
when I asked for it.

791
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,805
Excuse me.

792
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,769
Mr. Superman.

793
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,605
Do you want to go for some makgeolli?

794
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:07,036
The people on this list are the only ones
who had flower-patterned umbrellas.

795
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,373
Why isn't she here?

796
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,919
Why isn't
the flower-patterned lady coming?

797
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,464
Please hurry up and come.

798
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,595
I used to go there a lot,

799
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:26,931
but as you can see.

800
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,517
Was there a fire?

801
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,686
Yes.

802
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:33,771
I heard the owner of that place

803
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,481
died.

804
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,820
You mean the lady from that night?

805
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,908
She was a good woman.

806
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,298
You couldn't sleep again last night?
Was it the same dream?

807
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,967
Yes, the same one.

808
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,678
Why don't you get treated?

809
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,096
How about a brain wave test?

810
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,767
I don't think it will help.
I see things covered in blood every day.

811
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,771
It will get better if I quit being a cop.

812
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,441
-Let's go.
-Okay.

813
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,030
When did it start?

814
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,491
I don't really remember.
It started when I was really young.

815
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,786
Then it has nothing to do with your job.

816
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,080
Right.

817
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,543
It's getting clearer lately.

818
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,509
I can almost make out the faces.

819
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,802
What faces?

820
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,388
Based on how they're dressed…

821
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,725
it's the Joseon Dynasty.

822
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,480
Maybe you're seeing your past life
or something.

823
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,775
-My past life?
-Yes.

824
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,526
You don't believe in that?

825
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:04,278
I do.

826
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,448
You were probably my enemy
in my past life.

827
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,116
That can't be true.

828
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,078
If we were enemies in our past lives,

829
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,121
we would probably be a couple.

830
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,956
Don't even start.

831
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,626
-I hate even the thought of it.
-I hate it too.

832
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,795
-Just go back to eating.
-Okay.

833
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,339
Past life?

834
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,927
I don't know what I did so wrong
in my past life.

835
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,390
They said I'm not meant to be with anyone.

836
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,312
They said that because of what I did,

837
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,232
I'm not meant to be with anyone.

838
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:45,236
I guess that's why everyone
who tried to get close to me…

839
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,909
They all got hurt.

840
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,791
But I was told that

841
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,212
if I go up this mountain
and hike up to the top of a cliff,

842
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,881
and apologize for what I did

843
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,175
and beg for forgiveness,

844
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:10,970
then all will be well.
So that's what I've been doing.

845
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,430
You just need to

846
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,015
beg for forgiveness?

847
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,100
Yes.

848
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,894
They said he will come to me…

849
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,565
if I ask for forgiveness a thousand times.

850
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,194
-The one I'm destined to be with.
-The one you're destined to be with?

851
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,321
The man of my destiny.

852
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,116
In order to meet him,

853
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,162
I went up the mountain again and again.

854
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,332
Whether it was raining, snowing, or windy.

855
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,334
As of today…

856
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:48,549
I've gone up there 997 times.

857
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,426
Why are you so desperate

858
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,345
to be in love?

859
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,056
Why don't you want to be?

860
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,975
It's not that I don't want to.

861
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,563
I just shouldn't.

862
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,898
I don't deserve it.

863
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,317
Who gives you the right?

864
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,569
There are people

865
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,821
who are like that.

866
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,204
-Are you a mama's boy?
-What?

867
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:21,207
You only date girls
that your mom approves of?

868
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,083
That's not it.

869
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,340
Nobody has the right to approve of anyone.

870
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,592
I make my own destiny.

871
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,219
At one point in time

872
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,305
I used to believe that too.

873
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,265
I was arrogant.

874
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,518
Then what happened?

875
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:42,853
Then,

876
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,317
I got a cold warning.

877
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,818
They told me not to see her.

878
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:52,613
So,

879
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,324
did you just give up?

880
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,039
I ignored the warning…

881
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,335
and got hurt badly.

882
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,026
Hello.

883
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,612
I'm at the public parking lot
near Inwangsan Mountain.

884
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,615
You will see me when you get here.

885
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,701
Yes.

886
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:39,952
Okay.

887
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:03,600
Sir! There's one more person who bought
that flower-patterned umbrella.

888
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,271
LIMITED EDITION
FLOWER-PATTERNED UMBRELLA

889
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,442
Did you wait a long time?

890
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,028
-No, it's fine.
-Hello.

891
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,821
-Here's the key.
-Thank you.

892
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,448
You can get in the car.

893
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,585
You're that guy
from that night, aren't you?

894
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,503
You're that stalker
from Gugi-dong Food Alley.

895
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:36,175
I saw this scar on your hand that night.

896
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,330
