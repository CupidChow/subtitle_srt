1
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,221
When did you prepare all this?

2
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,806
Someone helped me.

3
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:57,600
It's pretty.

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,273
Do you remember this place?

5
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,240
It's that park I was supposed to meet you
at 10 p.m. after my class.

6
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,163
I'll wait for you at the park
at 10:00 p.m. after school.

7
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:25,878
What if…

8
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,924
I had come earlier that day?

9
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,302
If I had come earlier…

10
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,138
You're here with me now.

11
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
I should've looked at you
sweetly one more time.

12
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,527
I should've talked to you
sweetly one more time.

13
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:54,406
I should've smiled at you one more time.

14
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,411
I should've given you another warm hug.

15
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,165
I regretted it every moment.

16
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,341
Because I met you,

17
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,013
my mornings were exciting
because the flowers bloomed.

18
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,309
My afternoons were nice and cool
because it was breezy.

19
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,898
And my nights were dazzling
because it snowed.

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,988
That's why I was happy every moment.

21
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,750
It's my turn to be brave.

22
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,213
I'm not going to go through metamorphosis.

23
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,257
Is it possible?

24
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,718
I figured out how to say no.

25
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,094
Is there such a thing?

26
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,639
I told you there must be
something like that.

27
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,558
So there was a way.

28
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,976
You figured it out.

29
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,023
Does that mean
we can stay together forever?

30
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,441
Well…

31
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,068
Give me a second.

32
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,724
It fits you well.

33
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,314
I love you.

34
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,441
Baek-ryeon.

35
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,007
I love you too.

36
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,300
Hello?

37
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,469
What are you doing?

38
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,263
I was thinking of someone.

39
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,976
Me too.

40
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
Thank you, Sang-hyuk.

41
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,984
That was random.

42
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,739
Every day feels so astonishing,
thanks to you.

43
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:27,036
And every day feels warm
because I met my family, thanks to you.

44
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:33,959
I'm learning more about myself
every day, thanks to you.

45
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,628
So thank you.

46
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,717
I'm grateful too.

47
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,010
Thank you for saying that.

48
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,847
I'll become a great person

49
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,558
so that I won't let you down.

50
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,811
It's my turn now.

51
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,939
I won't let you down.

52
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,279
That's why I'm going to gather up
my courage one more time.

53
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,841
It's when this becomes transparent.

54
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,935
The chances of missing are 99.999%.

55
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,686
-You can do it.
-I won't do it.

56
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,647
I can't.

57
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,900
I will regret it too.

58
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,984
I won't regret

59
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,153
that I trusted you.

60
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,241
-Sang-hyuk.
-Please. My friend, Dong-chil.

61
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,497
Shoot it now!

62
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,796
You can shoot him again.

63
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,880
Properly.

64
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:21,817
EP16. MY MAN IS.

65
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,699
Dong-pal.

66
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,326
I have to shoot this arrow.

67
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,744
What?

68
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,747
-You're going to shoot it?
-This lead arrow has to be shot.

69
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,125
Properly.

70
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,645
Wow!

71
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,572
Goodness!

72
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,199
What was that?

73
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,285
You're the best marksman here.

74
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,953
You're amazing.

75
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Park, make your shop bigger.
The target is too close.

76
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,669
This is child's play.

77
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,089
Dong-gu. Do you think

78
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,466
you can show us that?

79
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,259
What is it? Tell me.

80
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,677
I can do anything with the arrows.

81
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,596
Robin Hood Arrow.

82
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,264
Robin Hood Arrow?

83
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,100
It's splitting an arrow in half

84
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,103
by shooting another arrow.

85
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,357
Oh, that! I find it really cool.

86
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,776
You can do that?

87
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,153
I'd love to see it.

88
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,407
Why did Robin Hood do such things?

89
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,953
There is a 99.999% chance
that you will fail.

90
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,791
It's not like there is
no chance of shooting it right.

91
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,252
That's the last shot.

92
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,006
That's why…

93
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,343
we exist.

94
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:39,288
In 1993, the Polka Dot High School Girls
case shocked the whole country…

95
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,124
The witnesses who testified
about the girls' whereabouts

96
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,792
all died for unknown reasons.

97
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,129
The last witness who testified that he saw
a suspicious man at a rice paddy field

98
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,797
where Yoo Jeong-ah's clothes were found…

99
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,064
I think my shop is big enough.

100
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,278
You did a good job.

101
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,404
One more time.

102
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,869
Everyone gets two chances.

103
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,393
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

104
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,812
You're not my husband!
You're here to ruin my life!

105
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,775
What did I do so wrong in my past life
to end up like this, married to you?

106
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,901
You should die!

107
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,445
You should die.

108
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,073
Die! Please go die!

109
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,741
Kill her.

110
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,869
Kill her.

111
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:08,293
That's the karma that the court lady
and you need to reverse.

112
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,388
I'm sure this was all his doing.

113
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,847
Who?

114
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,434
Does he not exist in your memories?

115
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,645
Let go!

116
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,105
Let go of me.

117
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,606
Why are you acting like this here?

118
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,899
Let go!

119
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,878
Only then will your thread
of fate begin again.

120
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,469
Thank you.

121
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,096
Sure.

122
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,269
The court lady has
her own red thread of fate.

123
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,105
It's tonight.

124
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:15,277
What wasn't fulfilled that night.

125
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,159
The court lady should have died…

126
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,745
for the prince that night.

127
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,048
MY MAN

128
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,137
-Yes, Sang-hyuk.
-Where are you?

129
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,181
Well, I am…

130
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,348
Where are you?

131
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm at the police station.

132
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,562
I was going to tell you,
but I didn't want you to worry.

133
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,731
Get out of there right now.

134
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,026
I came out to go home now.

135
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,653
-I'm in Detective Seo's car.
-Whose car?

136
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,113
Sir.

137
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,698
I found him.

138
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,328
DISEASE - SONG JIN-AH

139
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,288
THEFT - SONG DA-HEE
GOSSIP - HONG AE-KYEONG

140
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,298
Who is it?

141
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,550
It's Song Yeong-cheol.

142
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,096
Get out of the car.

143
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,223
Get out!

144
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,391
Hello?

145
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,643
Hello, Sang-hyuk?

146
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,192
Sang-hyuk.

147
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,196
Why aren't you answering?
Can't you hear me?

148
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,097
I won't regret

149
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,558
that I trusted you.

150
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,729
Please. My friend, Dong-chil.

151
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,076
Don't hide behind your excuses.

152
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,913
God will give you one more chance.

153
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,207
Sang-hyuk.

154
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,994
Is he…

155
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,059
Baek-ryeon!

156
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,101
Stay right here.

157
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,565
-Sang-hyuk!
-Ms. Oh.

158
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,942
His wings are weird.

159
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,986
They're not the same wings I saw before.

160
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,747
Sir, I see something
at Jongseo Police Station.

161
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,093
Hurry up and track
the vehicles in the area.

162
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,178
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

163
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,818
We found the getaway car.

164
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,154
We found the getaway car.

165
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,406
It's heading towards Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.

166
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,752
Detective, we got his location.

167
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,880
It's 175 Miseong-gun, Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.
An abandoned building.

168
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,165
What was that?

169
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,543
I'm sure I was just seeing things.

170
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,215
No.

171
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,009
I'm not crazy.

172
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,471
You are a murderer.

173
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,057
A monster.

174
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,979
-You're a demon.
-Who is this?

175
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,731
-Why did you kill me?
-What did I do wrong?

176
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,524
I didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,401
You shouldn't have been born.

178
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,237
-How does it feel to be treated like us?
-I'll never forgive you.

179
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,239
Why did you kill me?

180
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,867
-See you in hell.
-I did nothing wrong.

181
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,694
Who are you?

182
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,034
What exactly are you?

183
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,952
What do you want from me?

184
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,371
You.

185
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,341
You monster.

186
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,179
Song Yeong-cheol.

187
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,229
You also had two chances.

188
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,233
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

189
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,532
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

190
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,745
You had the chance to forgive.

191
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,003
-Honey, stop it.
-Stay still.

192
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,505
You had the chance to stop.

193
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,427
But you started it all again.

194
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,766
I'm sorry.

195
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,351
You're lying.

196
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,443
You will be born as the worst
in the afterlife.

197
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,364
It's all from the bad karma
you accumulated.

198
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,285
It's a karma you have to work out
with the people you killed.

199
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,454
You can count on it.

200
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,135
A murderer.

201
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,346
A monster.

202
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:19,930
I didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,767
I'll never forgive you.

204
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,978
I didn't do anything wrong.

205
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,647
I won't forgive you.

206
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,399
Sang-hyuk!

207
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,828
Sang-hyuk!

208
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,476
You can't go like this.

209
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,439
Don't go. Don't leave.

210
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,524
Do-ra. Hold it here.

211
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:21,570
Okay. Use two fingers
to pull it back like this.

212
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,821
Pull it all the way back.

213
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,115
Stretch all the way. That's right.

214
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,055
I had a great day today.

215
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,684
Goodbye, Do-ra.

216
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,853
Dong-gu.

217
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,857
Bye, bye.

218
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,368
SEVENS SINS
CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT

219
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,955
Murderer Song Yeong-cheol.

220
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:59,043
The first woman in his life was
his mom who abandoned him.

221
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,546
The second woman was the director
of the orphanage who used to beat him.

222
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,299
The third woman was the landlord
who he couldn't help but resent

223
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,302
because she reminded him of his mother.

224
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,888
After subduing three women one by one,

225
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,890
he gained confidence in his strength.

226
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,852
He started to target
random women after that.

227
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,690
The first victim was Ms. Song Da-hee
who went missing in 1993.

228
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,276
Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah, who was wearing
the same polka dot jacket that day,

229
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,820
went missing as well.

230
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,785
He showed how brutal he was
as he killed all the witnesses.

231
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,538
While continuing his murder spree for
one of the Seven Sins for Women, disease,

232
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,792
he got into an accident
while fleeing from the police.

233
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,712
The person who saved him then was
his wife, Go Eun-seo.

234
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,423
After marrying her,
he stopped his murder spree.

235
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,802
But after 28 years,
he found out about his wife's affairs

236
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,845
and he started to spiral
out of control again.

237
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,266
He targeted his wife
and her lover, Kim Myeong-sik

238
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,311
as well as people around him.

239
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:03,440
So his wife was the reason
why he stopped for 28 years

240
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,109
and started committing crimes.

241
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,694
That's right.

242
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:10,030
But murder is an unforgivable crime.

243
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:14,993
Song Yeong-cheol is just a murderer
who doesn't need any understanding.

244
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,153
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

245
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,447
Guardian number 37. You can come in now.

246
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,363
You just smiled, didn't you?

247
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,656
You smiled just now.

248
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,076
Maybe Cupid shot an arrow for you.

249
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,538
I can't believe you met so dramatically.

250
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,667
When will Cupid shoot me an arrow?

251
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,961
I want one too.

252
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:59,259
I want to know what it feels like
to fall in love at first sight.

253
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,137
Give it to me.

254
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,848
Detective Myung has a girlfriend.
Isn't she pretty?

255
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,268
Hey, didn't you say you were
lonely at the last team dinner?

256
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:11,647
That night, I was walking home
after I said goodbye to you.

257
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,898
At the crosswalk…

258
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,611
Are you all right?

259
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,863
I immediately fell

260
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,531
for Strawberry.

261
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,244
-Strawberry?
-Is that what you call your girlfriend?

262
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:29,373
You know my favorite fruit is strawberry.

263
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,333
Then what does she call you?

264
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,626
Apple.

265
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,755
My goodness! Apple? That's lame!

266
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,341
-Strawberry likes apples.
-Come on.

267
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,842
I should make you into fruit jam.

268
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,013
It was incredible though.

269
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:49,101
I've never fallen in love
at first sight in my life.

270
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,646
-But I guess it happens.
-Cupid shot an arrow for you.

271
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,481
I'm sure.

272
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,402
Hello.

273
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,530
Is Ms. Oh still the same?

274
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,451
She won't come out of her room.

275
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,911
Here.

276
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:51,788
Goodness.

277
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,082
Please help her so she eats it
and feels better.

278
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,959
I will.

279
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,378
I'll come again next time.

280
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,146
I'm fine now.

281
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,816
So don't bother coming.

282
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,323
Thank you.

283
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,202
You believed in me.

284
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,045
That's all I needed.

285
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,383
Let's…

286
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,471
never see each other again,

287
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,975
whether it's this life or the next.

288
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,875
I'm sorry.

289
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,845
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

290
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,055
-Hye-sun!
-Yes.

291
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,724
-Please clean up the table now.
-Okay!

292
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,829
Thank you.

293
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,791
-One soju, please.
-Okay. Please wait.

294
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,591
What do you think
that lady needs right now?

295
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,682
Have it with the soup.

296
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,767
It will warm you up.

297
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,903
In the end, it's all about sincerity.

298
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,781
What's the use of skills?

299
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,117
All you need is sincerity.

300
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,536
I had a great day today.

301
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,247
Bye, bye.

302
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:20,390
Hey.

303
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,184
You can't just leave like this.
You need to pay.

304
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,312
Pay?

305
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,731
Yes, the cost of the whole place tonight.

306
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,067
Didn't he pay? I heard he was a regular.

307
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:34,446
When he called to book,
he said he would pay later.

308
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,072
He said he would pay when he was done.

309
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,743
I see. How much is it?

310
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,745
Here.

311
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,832
SPACE RENTAL: 2,500,000 WON
EVENT FEE: 1,356,000 WON

312
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,417
TOTAL: 3,856,000 WON

313
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:52,172
It's really expensive
because he rented the whole space.

314
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,299
It also includes the event.

315
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,719
Do-ra, this is it.

316
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,977
I'm sure someone out there
will notice your sincerity.

317
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,089
This is not something you just look at.

318
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,840
It's something you eat.

319
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,970
I want to turn back time.

320
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,599
To when I was climbing up the mountain.

321
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,063
I had him back then.

322
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,833
What do you like so much about Baek-ryeon?

323
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,421
I don't like her. I don't like her at all.
I swear I don't like her at all.

324
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,290
I don't care
if he says he doesn't like me.

325
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:56,421
I just wish he was here.
I want him right here by my side.

326
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,635
I miss him.

327
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,602
I miss him so much.

328
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,325
Everything will be okay with time.

329
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,078
Everything will be okay.

330
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,053
Tomorrow is the Day of Spring Awakening.

331
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,639
It's when frogs wake up from their sleep
due to seasonal changes.

332
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,434
Plum blossoms have already
started blooming in the south.

333
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:55,063
Temperatures will rise as the season
changes, making it even more cozy.

334
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,399
-The highest temperature of the day is--
-I will be back.

335
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,109
Okay. See you later.

336
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,478
-It's the 977th time.
-What are you going to pray for this time?

337
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,605
-A miracle.
-A miracle?

338
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:39,983
What kind of miracle?

339
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,271
Good job. It's clean now.

340
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:31,576
-You can't eat this.
-There, there.

341
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,661
I know it hurts.

342
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,205
It's done. You can't eat it.

343
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,541
Hey, you're right.

344
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,294
That's really funny.

345
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,717
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

346
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,136
Goodness.

347
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,389
-Me too.
-Gosh, it's hilarious.

348
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:01,105
Let's go.

349
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:40,645
Are you okay?

350
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,482
Yes.

351
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,443
Thank you.

352
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:48,986
Sure.

353
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,833
Just one more time to go.

354
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,010
Hey.

355
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,346
I think prayers work well
on Inwangsan Mountain.

356
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,973
What?

357
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:20,268
You said you are praying
for a miracle this time.

358
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,605
In my opinion, it's a miracle that
you are back to normal like this.

359
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,816
You're right.

360
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,860
It was the power that kept me going.

361
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,361
-That mountain did that.
-Right.

362
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:33,865
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

363
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,554
-You scared me.
-Do-ra.

364
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,514
Did you do this?

365
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,224
What are you talking about?

366
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,687
Hey, are you going there again tomorrow?

367
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:07,648
Why would you go there two days in a row?

368
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,025
You didn't write this?

369
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,612
I've been drinking with you until now.
I just came back to my room.

370
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,198
I'm sleepy.

371
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,449
Go to sleep.

372
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,329
I don't remember I did this.

373
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:23,915
What's going on?

374
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,089
You're the best, Mr. Park!

375
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,718
Thank you for coming in the snow.

376
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,055
Wow.

377
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:33,581
Please postpone
all my afternoon appointments.

378
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,042
-What? All appointments in the afternoon?
-Yes.

379
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,002
-I have to go somewhere. It's urgent.
-Doctor!

380
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,345
What are you going to pray for this time?

381
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,723
A miracle.

382
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:08,866
What did I expect?

383
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,952
A miracle like that wouldn't just happen.

384
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,322
A thousand times.

385
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:09,718
Baek-ryeon.

386
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:13,616
Is it really you?

387
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,578
You must have waited for so long.

388
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,789
Is this real? Are you really Sang-hyuk?

389
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:22,625
It's me.

390
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,668
Cheon Sang-hyuk.

391
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:28,881
What happened?

392
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,051
I died and was reborn.

393
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:37,056
Just like you did 500 years ago.

394
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,313
Cheon Sang-hyuk is a very lucky guy.

395
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,029
It's not because he's lucky.
It's me who shot it well.

396
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:35,990
You missed it.

397
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,867
I hit the right spot.

398
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,507
I think that's why he was freed
from the cocoon.

399
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,635
His wings fell off too.

400
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,473
Sang-hyuk.

401
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,353
He's a very lucky guy.

402
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:09,148
I told you it wasn't his luck.
It was my shooting skills.

403
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,653
Now he just has to be born again.

404
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,451
I think it's time.

405
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:46,829
In the end, what I had to break
was the cocoon.

406
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,541
I had to lose my wings.

407
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,426
I'm not a fairy anymore.

408
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:06,682
I don't have to go through
metamorphosis anymore.

409
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,623
I gave you both two chances.

410
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:19,505
You deserve a new fate
only when you overcome fear.

411
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:28,347
God creates a big framework of fate.

412
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,725
It's humans who act accordingly.

413
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,937
It's also humans who go against it.

414
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:39,650
It takes only one thing
to change the game.

415
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,903
COURAGE

416
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:45,697
Be brave.

417
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,701
If he says no, it's embarrassing.
That's it. What's more to lose?

418
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,204
You face those embarrassing moments
in your life.

419
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,916
What's the point of being proud
to your loved one?

420
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:01,255
I'm telling you,
you can't do anything if you're scared.

421
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:04,967
But if you overcome fear and be brave,

422
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,845
a whole new world is waiting for you.

423
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,856
DAD - ME - MOM

424
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:24,069
The prince and princess
lived happily ever after.

425
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,286
She's finally asleep.

426
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,165
Goodness, it's always the same old
prince-and-princess story.

427
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:41,003
Don't they have a story
about a male servant and a mistress?

428
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:44,798
-Is that an erotic version of Cinderella?
-What's wrong with that?

429
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,550
Don't look down on the love between them.

430
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,845
When I was shooting my arrows
500 years ago--

431
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:54,141
-Okay.
-Let's go.

432
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,033
When I was her age, would I have guessed

433
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,952
that my man is Cupid?

434
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,537
I'm not anymore.

435
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,041
I'm a human. That's how she was born.

436
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:30,177
Yeon-ah is going to be lonely
if she's the only kid.

437
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,054
Should we try for a second child?

438
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:34,765
Come on.

439
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,478
Being the only child is definitely lonely.

440
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,562
Let's go.

441
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,534
LOVE ROOM

442
01:05:58,747 --> 01:05:59,748
Thank you.

443
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,546
Hello.

444
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,552
We're here.

445
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,304
Take out your arms.

446
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,772
Yeon-ah, hold Daddy's hand. Give it to me.

447
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:25,357
Slowly.

448
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:32,197
-Grandma! Grandpa!
-My goodness!

449
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,324
-Yeon-ah! You're here.
-Yeon-ah, you're here.

450
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:35,659
Hello.

451
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,869
-How have you been?
-I missed you.

452
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,579
-You missed us?
-How cute.

453
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,290
Say hello to them, Yeon-ah.

454
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:45,335
-How have you been?
-My cute granddaughter.

455
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,087
Here, try this too.

456
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:06,314
MATCHED IN THE LOVE ROOM

457
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,639
To me, it's a miracle
that when I open my eyes,

458
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,433
you are right in front of me.

459
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:46,646
To me, it's a miracle
that I'm spending this day with you.

460
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,053
So our love is…

461
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,181
a miracle every day.

462
