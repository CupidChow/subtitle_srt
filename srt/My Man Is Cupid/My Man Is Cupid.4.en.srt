1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038
Hello.

2
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,708
I'm at the public parking lot
near Inwangsan Mountain.

3
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,502
You will see me once you get here.

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,172
Yes. Okay.

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,634
They're on their way.

6
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,284
Did you wait a long time?

7
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,702
-No, it's fine.
-Hello.

8
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,996
-Here's the key.
-Thank you.

9
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,707
You can get in the car.

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,715
You're the guy from that night.

11
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,550
You're that stalker
from Gugi-dong Food Alley.

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,093
Stalker?

13
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,721
Stalker? What are you talking about?

14
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,307
You were going to attack her. Weren't you?

15
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,809
No, I wasn't.

16
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,143
You got the wrong guy.

17
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,274
I saw this scar on your hand that night.

18
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,277
You got it wrong.

19
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,036
Right. I'll call the cops.

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,204
I'll tell you.

21
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,041
I'll tell you everything.
Please don't turn me in.

22
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,545
Well,

23
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,838
the thing is…

24
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,633
I was crazy for a second.

25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,803
Ever since Ms. Oh joined
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital,

26
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,766
sales at my hospital dropped.
I was out of my mind.

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,394
You tried to kill a person
because of your sales?

28
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,229
Kill a person? It's not like that.

29
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,440
Kill? No. I would never kill a person.

30
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,901
I just wanted to scare her.

31
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,613
I wanted to scare her
so she'd leave this neighborhood.

32
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,407
That's all.

33
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,701
I'm a part-timer.
I was hired for this job.

34
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,078
I only took the job
because she was paying me a lot.

35
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,455
I beg for your forgiveness.

36
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,917
Please forgive me. I won't do it again.

37
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,003
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,755
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,882
Please forgive me.

40
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,093
Forgive my sins. Please forgive me.

41
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,974
I really felt like I was
on the edge of a cliff.

42
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,395
The hospital's rent
and the employees' salaries.

43
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,648
You would understand
if your sales dropped.

44
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,068
It makes you go insane.

45
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,242
Get up. I'm taking you
to the police station.

46
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,621
Ms. Oh. Please forgive me just this once.

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,081
-I beg you!
-What are you doing? Get up.

48
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,896
How can you forgive her so easily?

49
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,940
She said she just wanted to scare me.

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,233
And as you can see, I didn't get hurt.

51
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:57,488
You think she wasn't going to hurt you?
Do you actually believe what she said?

52
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,574
Just once,
I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.

53
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,452
She's begging for forgiveness.

54
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,751
Tell your family what happened today.

55
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,463
For the time being,
ask your dad to pick you up after work.

56
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,881
I don't have a dad.

57
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,134
How about your mom?

58
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,678
I don't have a mom either.

59
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,182
Then do you have…

60
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,560
I don't have an older brother
or an older sister.

61
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,064
I have no siblings or relatives.

62
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,191
I'm all alone.

63
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,818
An orphan.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,451
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

65
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,086
It was my birthday.

66
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,180
There wasn't even a note
about when I was born or what my name was.

67
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,018
There was nothing left with me.

68
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,689
My goodness.

69
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,864
Let's name you Baek-ryeon.

70
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,661
Go, Baek-ryeon!

71
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,416
Enjoy your lunch.

72
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,667
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

73
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,085
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

74
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,557
I think that's when it started.

75
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,020
I wasn't allowed to form bonds
with people.

76
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,193
But I don't give up.

77
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,863
I'm going to climb
the mountain a thousand times.

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,246
I'm going to meet the man
I'm destined to be with, no matter what.

79
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:05,717
I deserve to have at least
some warm memories…

80
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,848
with someone special.

81
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,454
Thank you for taking me home.

82
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,958
You saved me again today.

83
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,043
Thank you for that too.

84
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,462
Get home safely.

85
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,256
Bye.

86
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,507
Okay.

87
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,404
I have a story.

88
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,199
A reason I don't have a boyfriend.

89
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,409
I guess that's why everyone
who got close to me…

90
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,245
They all got hurt.

91
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,123
A fortune teller said he will come to me

92
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,960
if I ask for forgiveness a thousand times.

93
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,838
The one I'm destined to be with.

94
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:29,843
I deserve to have at least
some warm memories…

95
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,848
with someone special.

96
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,643
Goodness.

97
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:51,323
EP4. WHEN LOTUS FLOWERS BLOOM

98
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,632
To make a romance bloom,

99
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,301
you must pass the stage of "time."

100
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,265
"Time" means a very long time.

101
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,078
That's how relationships get started.

102
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,626
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

103
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,714
After 500 times,
they brush past each other.

104
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,551
After 5,000 times, they meet as neighbors.

105
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,553
I'm from downstairs.
You make so much noise.

106
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,638
-I'm going crazy.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,765
It takes 7,000 times

108
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,476
to be born in the same house as a family.

109
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,403
And finally after 8,000 times,

110
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,615
you are destined to be together
as a married couple.

111
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,246
In short,

112
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,666
you have to wait a very long time
to end up with your destined one.

113
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,792
You are a genius.

114
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm a genius who can understand things
even if they're not explained well.

115
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,550
You'd be perfect if you were more humble.

116
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,845
By the way,

117
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,766
you know what you said doesn't suit
the culture these days, right?

118
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,225
What do you mean?

119
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,937
My parents are divorced.

120
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,776
That special connection between a couple.
It's nothing these days.

121
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,112
One out of three couples gets divorced.

122
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,697
DESTINY

123
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,284
But it's still
a very important connection.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,622
It takes 8,000 times to make that happen.

125
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,999
What's the point though? They divorced.

126
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,418
Kids are the only ones who suffer.

127
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,420
I have to split my time
between my parents.

128
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,923
But isn't it very boring

129
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,552
if the one you're destined to be with
is already set in stone?

130
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,262
Very boring?

131
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,974
It means you end up
with your destined one no matter what.

132
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,435
You end up with her, even without trying.

133
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,315
No, it doesn't blossom to just anyone.

134
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,028
It's up to them to bloom the flower.

135
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,659
They say, "There is a time for coming,
there is a time for going."

136
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,910
What does that mean?

137
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,122
It refers to a special lover you meet

138
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,250
when you bloom flowers in this lifetime.

139
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,255
But in the end,
it's up to us to make our love bloom.

140
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,967
We need to recognize each other.

141
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,746
The answer to that question is number two.

142
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,373
This is my answer.

143
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,003
The answer is number two,
but my answer is number one.

144
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,299
That's how I think as a child.
This is my assignment.

145
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,227
He reminds me of someone I know.

146
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,987
I'm already engaged.

147
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,073
You shouldn't do this.

148
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,824
It's okay. You can trust me.

149
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,535
Did you shoot at them?

150
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,871
No. Did you?

151
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,457
No.

152
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,377
I shot at them.

153
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,337
You shouldn't…

154
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,048
You shouldn't…

155
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,599
Hey, she said she's engaged.
Why did you shoot at her?

156
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,310
She looked so worried
about getting married.

157
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,938
Besides, they're in love with each other.

158
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:19,109
Everyone should have a memory
of being with someone special.

159
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,027
My goodness.

160
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,583
Memories of love happen by the water mill.

161
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,085
Why a water mill?

162
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,546
Don't tell me you don't know.

163
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,465
Why would people who are in love
come here all the time?

164
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,509
Why would they?

165
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,138
This is why yours are the smallest.

166
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,932
What's the point of shooting?
You shoot at the wrong people.

167
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,101
Do these wings even work?

168
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,771
You know nothing.

169
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,150
Although my wings are the smallest,
they work the best.

170
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,359
Did you see that?

171
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,952
It's always cool to see.

172
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,539
What did you do to get these cool wings?

173
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,791
By the water mill.

174
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,502
In the rice fields and field ridges.
Under the mulberry tree.

175
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,255
I created billions
of masterpieces of love.

176
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,009
You heard of Master Lee and Chunhyang?
They're the talk of the town.

177
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,595
I'm the one who set them up.

178
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,097
Some people even wrote a novel about it.

179
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,769
Love should always move people.

180
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,647
I guess that's the secret.

181
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,150
Let's hang out together, my friend.

182
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,319
-Yes, my friend.
-I'm your friend now?

183
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,446
Watch out.

184
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,699
What if her fiancé
is the red thread of fate

185
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,535
that the god, Samsin,
worked on for thousands of years?

186
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,379
Goodness, it looks delicious.

187
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,047
You little punks!

188
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,757
Who ate this? Who ate this?

189
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,926
-We didn't touch it.
-Was it you?

190
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,053
The red thread of fate? The destined one?

191
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,305
It took them 8,000 times.

192
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,517
Samsin, the god of fate,
puts the most effort into that thread.

193
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,852
A couple that's married without love.

194
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,397
It's like honey-filled rice cakes
without honey.

195
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,858
Why did that old god leave out love
for the married couple?

196
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,111
Isn't it torture to live
with someone like that?

197
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,445
It's different.

198
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,740
Threads of fate are divided
into times and karma.

199
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,160
Some people had a good thread in the past.
They become a good couple now.

200
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,288
Some people have ill-fated threads
from their past lives.

201
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,084
A married couple without
the thread of fate is an ill-fated one.

202
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,049
Cheers.

203
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,808
Regardless of who you're meant to be with,
you need the thrill of life at least once.

204
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,477
That's why humans need us.

205
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,689
A heart filled with passion for someone.

206
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,151
I think that's more important than fate.

207
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,446
More important than a couple's fate.

208
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,040
Just don't cross the line when you shoot.

209
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,876
-If you make Samsin mad--
-Don't worry.

210
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,753
Our arrows have a temporary effect.

211
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,963
It's over in the blink of an eye.

212
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,178
The couple's thread
that the old god put so much effort into.

213
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,929
It can't be cut.

214
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,389
You think so?

215
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,269
It's a pain in the neck
if the wrongly-matched ones meet.

216
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,189
If you meet a strong-willed guy…

217
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,743
If the first child couldn't become
the Crown Prince,

218
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,370
shouldn't Prince Lee Seon
ascend the throne as the second child?

219
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,040
So why is the youngest one next
in line to the throne?

220
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,043
They say it's because
His Majesty adores Her Majesty the Queen.

221
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,004
It's only right for Prince Lee Seon
to continue the reign.

222
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,839
That's what all of us wanted.

223
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,508
Hey, watch what you say.

224
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,677
You could get into big trouble
by saying things like that.

225
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,350
Who's going to have my heart?

226
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,394
Should I just give up this life?

227
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,021
Why would you give up?

228
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,774
I'll meet him no matter what.

229
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,193
-My love.
-Your love?

230
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,361
You mean him?

231
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm half way there.

232
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,496
Please let me meet him.

233
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,834
Please allow me to meet him.

234
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,341
That was a thousand times.

235
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,888
Now the flowers just need to bloom.

236
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,144
So-hee.

237
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,647
Your Highness.

238
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,983
What are you doing here?

239
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,486
I was just…

240
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,203
If you make a wish a thousand times,
you meet your love?

241
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:28,293
Do you know what the ladies
in the palace say?

242
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,338
-What do they say?
-Everyone is disappointed

243
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,549
that you couldn't become the Crown Prince.

244
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,218
Why would the ladies be disappointed?

245
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,845
You are good-looking.

246
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,348
Of course we want you to become King.

247
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,393
Do you want me to become King too?

248
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,061
What?

249
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,482
I think…

250
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,510
If you meet someone with a strong will…

251
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,313
Why is this so hard?

252
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,024
Please, just one.

253
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,943
Please.

254
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,674
I'll meet the love of my life
if I catch a plum blossom petal

255
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,842
on my index finger
and hold it for three seconds.

256
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,804
Tonight, I'll check if this is true.

257
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,931
Just one would do.

258
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,395
Meet the love of your life? With this?

259
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,355
Why is this so hard?

260
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,275
I can't even dream of love
because I'm a palace maid?

261
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,445
What's the point of getting a petal?
She needs a man.

262
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,781
Just one…

263
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,951
Please.

264
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,846
I'm sorry, but fate has no man
other than His Highness in store for you.

265
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,931
That's why I have to step in.

266
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,447
One.

267
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,198
Two.

268
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,284
Three.

269
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,915
What? Did she just smile at me?

270
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,167
I got it!

271
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,252
I got my love.

272
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,367
Your Highness.

273
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,621
So-hee, long time no see.

274
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,916
Are you here
because you're worried about the King?

275
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,376
Yes.

276
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,961
But I couldn't meet him.

277
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,338
I was about to go back.

278
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,044
Your Majesty, please come back!

279
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,257
-Your Majesty, please come back!
-Your Majesty!

280
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,468
-Your Majesty, please come back!
-Your Majesty, please come back!

281
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,929
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

282
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,764
Your Majesty!

283
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,018
Your Majesty.

284
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,770
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

285
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,438
It will only end if one of you dies.

286
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,482
We will make our move.

287
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,693
Your Highness, please make a decision.

288
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,256
We must end it once and for all.

289
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,886
Get rid of Prince Lee Seon at once,

290
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,637
for my little prince.

291
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,765
Don't worry, Your Highness.

292
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:38,352
Prince Lee Seon is as good as dead.

293
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,697
I have to tell him.

294
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,200
I have to tell His Highness about this.

295
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,247
It's the Queen's order!
Don't let her get away.

296
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,416
Follow her! Get her.

297
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,171
Get the maid!

298
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,923
Get her!

299
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,184
Over here!

300
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,373
Are you okay?

301
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,589
Are you all right?

302
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,054
Why am I here?

303
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,391
How did I end up here?

304
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,149
I remember falling off the cliff.

305
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,443
What happened?

306
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
What's going on?

307
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,576
Who did this?

308
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,827
It's me.

309
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,412
I saved you.

310
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,998
Prince Lee Seon.

311
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,627
His Highness!

312
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:53,589
I saved your life, but you're looking
for another man right away.

313
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,633
Jeez.

314
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,137
The wound isn't healed yet.

315
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,556
Stay out of this.

316
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,643
That maid and Prince Lee Seon.

317
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,146
They're meant to be a couple
in the afterlife.

318
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:02,575
That is why she was meant to have fallen
off the cliff that night

319
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,578
and died for Prince Lee Seon.

320
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,760
Humans and fairies are not meant
to be together.

321
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:27,766
Those wings show that you
and that woman live in different worlds.

322
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,854
So stop messing

323
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,565
with the threads of fate I've been making.

324
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,451
What's wrong with him?

325
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,453
Is he crazy?

326
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,955
No way.

327
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,085
-He got shot.
-With what?

328
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:52,703
Sir!

329
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,790
There's another person who bought
the flower-patterned umbrella.

330
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,668
LIMITED EDITION
FLOWER-PATTERNED UMBRELLA

331
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,130
On December 21st,
there was heavy snowfall.

332
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:07,259
The whereabouts of a woman in her 40s
who went missing in the public parking lot

333
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,679
near Inwangsan Mountain
on the same day still remain unknown.

334
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:14,141
Detectives at Jongseo Police Station,
investigating the case, are searching

335
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,394
for the woman who drank makgeolli
with her that night.

336
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,314
According to Ms. Ham,
the owner of the makgeolli restaurant,

337
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,816
the two ladies met
for the first time that night.

338
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,860
They shared the table on the spot.

339
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,696
What can I do to increase
the views of my video?

340
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,531
Then they parted ways after that.

341
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,616
Gosh.

342
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,494
This is the last page.

343
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,829
They forgot to send this one.

344
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,290
This lady is the one who meets
all the conditions.

345
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,800
-I'll be back.
-To find out…

346
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,259
-Bye.
-…if she was the last one

347
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:54,139
to see the missing woman,
the police are narrowing down the identity

348
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,517
based on a specific brand's
flower-patterned umbrella

349
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,686
that the woman was seen using that night.

350
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,032
Who is it?

351
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,617
This is the police.

352
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,704
Who is it, again?

353
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,205
I'm a police officer.

354
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,210
A police officer? How can I help you?

355
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,183
You bought that umbrella, right?

356
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,270
It was launched by
the spa brand, Seven Minute.

357
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,147
It's a limited edition flower pattern.

358
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,524
Yes. It's right over there.

359
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,449
You went to Inwangsan Mountain
on December 21st, right?

360
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,492
-Inwangsan Mountain?
-Yes. You came down.

361
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,453
Then you had makgeolli
and jeon at Yeon-ja's.

362
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,996
Yeon-ja's?

363
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,914
Where is that?

364
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,958
And I don't like the mountains.

365
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,544
Why would I hike? It makes my legs big.

366
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,550
By any chance,

367
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,428
do you remember what you did
on December 21st?

368
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,305
I'm not sure.

369
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,931
It's been so long.

370
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,267
There was a heavy snow fall.

371
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,562
That night it snowed a lot?

372
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,939
I worked late that night.

373
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,402
-You worked late?
-Yes.

374
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:33,781
When I got off work at 11 p.m.
and came home,

375
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,575
it was past midnight.

376
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,092
Baek-ryeon.

377
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,430
Mr. Superman.

378
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,643
What brings you here so early
in the morning?

379
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,355
Baek-ryeon.

380
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:12,236
Do you have to love?

381
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,114
-Excuse me?
-Do you want to fall in love?

382
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,161
Yes.

383
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,510
Then trust me.

384
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,932
I'm the man

385
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,018
you've been waiting for.

386
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:48,897
What?

387
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,763
So you're the one
I've been waiting for all this time?

388
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,640
-That's right.
-Really?

389
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,767
Trust me.

390
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,561
-I trust you.
-I--

391
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,187
Yes, you.

392
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,731
I will set you up with a guy.

393
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,408
I am that fairy, Cupid.

394
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,786
What?

395
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,667
I'm that man you've been waiting for.

396
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,669
No, not that. What did you say after that?

397
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,338
After that?

398
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,215
-"I'll set you up with a guy"?
-Yes, that.

399
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,968
Set me up with a guy?

400
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,888
Yes. I'll set you up with a decent guy.

401
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,568
How will you set me up?

402
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,028
Well…

403
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,573
Tell me your ideal type.
I'll find someone who meets--

404
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,450
Someone young and good-looking.

405
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,206
Were you waiting for me to ask?
That was fast.

406
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,749
It's my ideal type.

407
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,503
You should give it more thought
before telling me.

408
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,672
What's there to think? It's obvious.

409
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:38,799
Obvious?

410
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,301
Men like young women who are pretty.

411
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,262
It's the same for women.
We like good-looking young men.

412
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,768
Women like men who are young
and good-looking too?

413
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,645
Oh, my.

414
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,898
-Do you mean it?
-Why wouldn't I?

415
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,734
Why didn't I know about this?

416
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:01,279
Women don't show it like men do.
But women are the same.

417
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,742
Women like new men more than
the same men they've already met.

418
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,036
New men? What?

419
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,623
What can you do? That's my ideal type.

420
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,251
Do you think you can set me up?

421
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,799
Then can't you just choose one?

422
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:26,722
It's going to take some time for me
to find someone young and handsome.

423
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,140
I don't have enough time for that.

424
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,434
It can't be an ideal type
if I only choose one trait.

425
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,477
That would mean compromising with reality.

426
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,815
But it doesn't seem right.

427
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,191
What do you mean?

428
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,818
I mean…

429
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,989
That's not what I was thinking at all.

430
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,741
Tell me your ideal type.

431
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,826
My ideal type?

432
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,954
Thank you so much! What's my ideal type?

433
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,710
Baek-ryeon,

434
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,922
I'm very flustered.

435
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,924
I feel very flustered too.

436
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,427
Why would you be flustered?

437
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,512
You said your ideal type
as if you were waiting for it.

438
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,724
Why don't you know how I feel
when you're the man I've been waiting for?

439
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,060
Am I supposed to be able
to read your mind or something?

440
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,645
Of course. You're the one
I've been waiting for. You should know.

441
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,981
How can I possibly read your mind?

442
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,691
You can't even read my mind.

443
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,444
You seem very incompetent.

444
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,404
What did you say?

445
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,323
Incompetent? Me?

446
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,450
I've never heard that before.

447
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,576
I'm so offended.

448
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,994
I'm very offended too.

449
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,580
I shouldn't have said that.

450
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,334
Why are you here acting like the man
I've been waiting for so early in the day?

451
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,669
I am the man you've been waiting for.

452
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,798
I'm someone very important to you.

453
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,008
You shouldn't look down on me like this.

454
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,094
I'll see about that.

455
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,846
Set me up with a young good-looking guy.

456
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,681
Then I'll acknowledge you.

457
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,642
You better set me up with my ideal guy.

458
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,439
Set me up with a guy?

459
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,858
He was saying things like this
last time too.

460
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,618
What did I do wrong?

461
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,873
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

462
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:21,044
Why did he come so early in the morning
just to spout nonsense like that?

463
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,258
You scared me!

464
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,760
Why are you so upset?

465
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,470
The plum blossom guy
isn't falling for you?

466
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,472
-How did you know?
-I told you.

467
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,599
You're in love with the guy.

468
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,269
Ddaeng-chil's guardian, right?

469
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,396
How do you do that?

470
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,273
I saw everything.

471
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,362
Welcome.

472
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,613
Come here.

473
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,494
Let's check on it.

474
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,875
You're very quick-witted.

475
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,421
Well, I dated a lot of men
before I got married.

476
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,675
So tell me, what's the problem?

477
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,099
Well.

478
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,229
I bumped into him a lot recently.

479
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,065
So I've been thinking of him time to time.

480
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,610
You thought he was the man of your dreams.

481
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:30,405
Last time, he even saved me
from getting attacked.

482
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,450
-He came out of nowhere like Superman.
-Superman?

483
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,244
That's not good.

484
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,332
First of all,
that tight suit itself is very dangerous.

485
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,835
Plus, he should be saving you only.
But he saves every girl out there.

486
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,295
What a jerk.

487
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,633
He doesn't want to date anyone though.

488
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,968
He said he just doesn't.

489
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,721
-He doesn't want to?
-No.

490
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,973
And you believe that?

491
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,141
What?

492
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,977
Check his cell phone.

493
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,022
Assistant Kim, Chief Choi,
Manager Park and Mr. Han.

494
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,566
There will be many guys
with different titles on his contact list.

495
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,026
Call them.

496
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,403
It will be all women who answer the phone.

497
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:11,947
Really?

498
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,531
So, keep talking.

499
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,494
Then I developed feelings for him.

500
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,663
-But he keeps--
-He keeps what?

501
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,374
He keeps trying
to set me up with someone else.

502
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,922
He's such an amateur unlike how he looks.

503
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,049
-An amateur?
-He's testing you.

504
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,133
He's testing me?

505
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,594
Men do that a lot.

506
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:38,765
They like you, but they say
they'll introduce you to a friend.

507
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,726
So you think, "Fine. Go ahead."
And you go to see this friend.

508
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,314
They bring someone who's
uglier and less successful than them.

509
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,650
-Why do you think they do that?
-Why?

510
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,861
So they can look like the better catch.

511
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,864
It's all a part of their plan.

512
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,575
How dare he try
to pull something like that on you!

513
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,416
I have a feeling
that guy's coming again today.

514
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,418
What?

515
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,130
He'll keep using other guys
as an excuse to come.

516
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,466
I don't think he will come.

517
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,760
I got mad at him this morning.

518
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,346
Then he'll try even harder to come
to make it up to you.

519
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,056
Just wait. He'll come.

520
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,326
How young does he have to be?

521
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:41,745
Well…

522
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,954
Hi, honey.

523
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,581
Did you drink?

524
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,124
Did you drink a lot?

525
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,127
Don't just go to sleep.
Wash up and go to bed.

526
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,504
You need to brush your teeth.

527
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,507
Stop nagging?

528
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,551
You want me to hang up?

529
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,680
All right, then. Good night, my baby.

530
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,728
He's going to sleep
without even washing up. How filthy.

531
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,981
-He's no good either.
-How can you date someone so young?

532
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,110
What do you even talk about
with someone who's 12 years younger?

533
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,738
You know nothing.

534
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,948
It's harder to date someone my age.

535
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,033
Why?

536
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,078
They're not interested in us.

537
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,331
The older men get,
they want younger and prettier women.

538
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,168
-But you know what's good?
-What?

539
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,754
We don't care about them either.

540
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,006
We want men who are young
and handsome too.

541
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,969
We look forward to seeing a fresh face
instead of the usual, familiar face.

542
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:41,930
Four years younger.

543
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,516
How old are you right now?

544
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,185
-I'm 29.
-Then he has to be 25.

545
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,399
How good-looking does he have to be?

546
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,984
As handsome as
Won Bin, Hyun Bin, Zo In-sung.

547
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,449
Where can I find a man like that?

548
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,702
Four years younger and as handsome
as Won Bin, Hyun Bin and Zo In-sung?

549
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,831
Are you sure you want to date
someone from this world?

550
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,417
-You said you would help.
-I shouldn't have said that.

551
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,421
I hope it's a guy who doesn't know
that he's handsome.

552
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:17,090
Men who are aware
that they're handsome can be annoying.

553
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:21,010
A good-looking man
knows he's good-looking.

554
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,222
How can he not know?
He sees himself in the mirror every day.

555
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,600
Everywhere he goes,
women show how much they love him.

556
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:30,353
It sounds like you're speaking
from first-hand experience.

557
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,109
There's one more thing.

558
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:37,861
I don't want to listen.

559
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,946
-This is really important.
-I don't want to know.

560
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,656
It must be someone who won't get hurt.

561
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,909
Someone who will never get hurt.

562
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,998
This is the most important thing.

563
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,380
Mr. Superman, why are you trying so hard?

564
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,841
Why do you keep trying to find me a man?

565
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,386
-Tell me.
-I don't want you to be lonely.

566
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,308
Since you have been so lonely until now…

567
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,812
I want you to be with a good man,
even for just a bit,

568
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,650
and to be extremely happy.

569
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:33,541
I'll do my best to find a man
who fits your ideal type.

570
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,126
All right, then.

571
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,087
Let's go.

572
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,150
Since you've been so lonely until now,

573
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,695
I want you to be with a good man,
even for just a bit,

574
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,408
and to be extremely happy.

575
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:32,934
Hello.

576
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,771
Shall we go in?

577
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:38,273
Okay.

578
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,496
Alexandra got so much better.

579
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,873
Dogs know that you care about them.

580
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,376
I guess she knows how you feel.

581
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,671
It's all thanks to your dedication.

582
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,843
I guess she did a lot of good things
in her past life.

583
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,888
She recovered so quickly
and met such a good guardian.

584
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,604
Dr. Oh, do you believe in past lives?

585
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,439
Sorry?

586
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,443
Do you believe in past lives?

587
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,237
Well,

588
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,948
we all think like that.

589
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,203
We say you did many good things
in your past life when you're lucky.

590
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,497
We do?

591
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:43,254
What kind of relationship do you think
she and I had in our past lives?

592
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,508
I got to meet you thanks to Alexandra.

593
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,678
Who do you think we were
to each other in a past life?

594
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,231
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

595
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,941
There is such a thing.

596
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,110
Ill-fated relationships in your past life.

597
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,696
Ever since Chief Go Yeong-ja came,

598
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,242
I told you that my heart started to ache
for no reason!

599
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,536
Right, you did.
You went to see so many doctors.

600
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,288
-But they said you were fine.
-Right.

601
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:20,541
There was a reason for that.

602
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,919
Past life.

603
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,046
You missed the culprit?

604
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,256
You missed him when you almost got him?

605
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,050
Are you an idiot?

606
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,219
You're doing it again.

607
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,138
Stop it with your acting! Geez!

608
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:37,183
I was put under hypnosis
because I was the witness.

609
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,060
-I saw--
-What do you see?

610
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,436
The yard.

611
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,730
I see a huge yard.

612
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:44,899
What are you doing there?

613
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,451
I'm sweeping my yard.

614
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:56,703
What else do you see?

615
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,916
The lady of the house is smiling at me.

616
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,126
Gosh, it's hot.

617
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,752
The lady of the house?

618
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,965
Hey, Ggeok-soe.

619
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:13,219
Why don't you come up here
and have a yakbap?

620
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,430
Pardon?

621
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,640
A yakbap?

622
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,229
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,608
-It looks tasty, right?
-Since then,

624
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:31,237
she called me every night.

625
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,448
She says she wants to have yakbap with me.

626
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,576
-Ma'am, I just want this.
-Let's have a good time.

627
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,787
Ma'am!

628
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,043
I ran away that night,

629
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,588
from that passionate lady of the house.

630
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:53,050
And you ran into her again
in Homicide Unit Three?

631
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,679
That's a fateful reunion
between superior and subordinate.

632
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:59,223
Your hierarchies don't even change
in your next life.

633
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,683
Jeez!

634
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,146
Anyway, I got better
after I found out about my past life.

635
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,647
It was liberating.

636
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,275
Does it really exist?

637
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,610
Past lives.

638
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,445
It does exist.

639
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,238
I believe in it.

640
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:16,866
Sir.

641
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,868
Sir. You're here.

642
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,038
My handsome Chief Seo is here.

643
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,457
Enjoy yourselves.

644
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,169
SEOUL NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

645
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,338
CRIME INVESTIGATION
HYPNOSIS ROOM

646
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,048
Hypnosis is a science.

647
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,218
That's why we have this room
in the National Police Agency.

648
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:39,096
Detective Park's memory led
to his past life that day

649
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,681
so I got a bit flustered.

650
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,768
Past life is a type of memory.

651
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:48,022
But the memory that we adopt
is just a real-life memory.

652
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:54,070
The human brain shows brain waves called
beta waves in a state of consciousness,

653
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,156
alpha waves in a state
between consciousness and unconsciousness,

654
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,534
and theta waves
in a state of complete unconsciousness.

655
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,537
From a state of relaxation,
you become highly focused

656
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,331
and access memories stored
somewhere in your brain.

657
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,582
That's how hypnosis works.

658
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,292
What do you see?

659
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:12,463
That man got out of the car.

660
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,466
Look at the license plate.
What's the license plate number?

661
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,470
Six, two, four, nine.

662
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,852
Our job is to use those memories
to find crucial clues for the cases.

663
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,021
Could that number be wrong?

664
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:32,775
It depends on her state of mind.

665
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:35,027
But they're usually right.

666
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,163
KIM HYUNG-RAE

667
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,957
-Is he handsome?
-Yes.

668
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:52,503
He's popular with female customers.
Many women give him their numbers.

669
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,298
Then he probably knows that he's handsome.

670
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,466
No, he's humble.

671
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,678
When someone compliments him,
he'd say "No, I'm not."

672
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,598
"That's so sweet of you."
This is how he reacts.

673
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,726
Well, he's nice.

674
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:11,898
How about this man?

675
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:12,982
IM HAN-JUN

676
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:16,193
He's not as handsome as the previous one.
But he's still charming.

677
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,778
How is he charming?

678
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,946
He's funny.

679
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,533
-Funny?
-He has an excellent sense of humor.

680
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:24,744
He's good at laughing
and making people laugh.

681
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,041
But he's a bit old.

682
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:31,918
He's only 32.

683
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,337
He has to be really young.

684
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:35,838
Yes.

685
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,344
JEONG DONG-HYUN

686
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:45,264
Does he look like Won Bin,
Hyun Bin and Zo In-sung?

687
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,016
No.

688
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,817
Is this for the lady
with whom you had dinner?

689
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:04,075
Yes, I'm trying to set her up
with a good man.

690
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,745
But you can see the thread of fate.

691
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,959
Unlike the other three, it's a side effect
caused by dozens of transformations here.

692
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:18,047
You can just shoot the man who's connected
to her by the red thread of fate.

693
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,298
Why are you doing this?

694
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:23,761
She doesn't have the red thread of fate.

695
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,347
Is that possible?

696
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,850
It's my first time seeing someone
who doesn't have the red thread of fate.

697
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,782
How cute.

698
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,746
You're adorable.

699
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,623
I'm so jealous.

700
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,292
-Goodness.
-You're so cute.

701
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,256
Sir.

702
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,635
What was Sang-hyuk's first love like?

703
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,181
Why do you ask?

704
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,017
I've always been curious.

705
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,437
Who did he fall in love with
to burn his own wings

706
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,564
and spend 500 years here?

707
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:23,571
I don't know
what Sang-hyuk's first love means to him.

708
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,243
But the ending was heartbreaking,
as you can guess.

709
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,663
A terrible regret.

710
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:38,627
None of those things would've happened
if he hadn't fallen in love with her.

711
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,769
Goodness, you're sweating so much.

712
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,815
Is it the same dream again?
I feel bad for you.

713
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:03,527
Even if we sleep in the car,
we need to sleep deeply.

714
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:04,737
Goodness.

715
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,288
Are you looking for something?

716
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,623
My notebook.

717
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,084
I think I left it
at the apartment earlier.

718
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,465
Hold on a second.

719
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,967
I'm sorry.

720
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,347
I'm going to the sixth floor too.

721
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,703
-You can go first.
-Okay.

722
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,046
Who are you?

723
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,718
Are you her boyfriend?

724
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,554
No, I'm not.

725
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:13,722
I'm a police officer.

726
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:17,059
The police? What brings you here?
Did she do something wrong?

727
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,435
No, she didn't.

728
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:23,149
I came earlier to ask your daughter
something, but I forgot my stuff.

729
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,277
You did?

730
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,821
All right.

731
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,876
Maybe she isn't home.

732
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,547
Ma'am, do you not know the passcode?

733
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,136
-Please wait here for a minute.
-Okay.

734
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,142
Ye-won.

735
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:24,210
The police are investigating a case
of a woman in her 40s who went missing

736
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,588
near Inwangsan Mountain on December 21st.
There was heavy snow on that day.

737
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:31,133
The police believe
it may be more than just a missing case

738
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:34,220
due to the deaths of witnesses
as they continue to investigate.

739
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,804
Reporter Choi Ji-won
has more on the story.

740
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:40,643
The case of a woman in her 40s
who went missing remains unsolved.

741
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,020
The woman in her 20s,
whom the police investigated,

742
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,606
was found dead two days ago.

743
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,275
In addition, Ms. Ham, in her 60s,
and Mr. Kim, in his 50s,

744
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:52,154
who had been interviewed as witnesses,
died in a fire and a fall respectively.

745
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,990
The police are investigating
the possible connection

746
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,492
between the case and the deaths.
