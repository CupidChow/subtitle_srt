1
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,541
There was a man who was following her.

2
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:44,336
I thought it was her boyfriend.
She said she was meeting up with him.

3
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,098
Was it this man?

4
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,026
Isn't it this car?

5
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,694
Yes, it is.

6
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,988
ILHAN CAMPING

7
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,372
Mr. Kim Myeong-sik?

8
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,711
I can't tell.

9
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,507
All I remember is a thick, black neck.

10
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,512
Was there anything unusual
about Ms. Go Eun-seo that day?

11
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,263
Anything that crosses your mind?

12
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,974
It's been a while.

13
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,687
I was the only one who drank.

14
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,569
She looked a bit sad for some reason.

15
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,572
What do you think love is, Eun-seo?

16
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,493
Fate.

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,413
Something that always finds you.

18
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,250
I didn't do anything wrong.

19
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,129
It's not a sin.

20
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,215
She said she didn't do anything wrong.

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,384
She said it wasn't a sin.

22
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:15,970
It wasn't a sin?

23
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:39,118
May I see the call record between
the security camera technician and me?

24
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,039
We rushed here, so we don't have it.
You can wait.

25
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,666
Please call the Seoul branch.

26
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,460
You arrested me without any evidence?

27
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,671
You even asked for help
from the local police.

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,842
-No, that's not it.
-The thing is, it's all rushed here.

29
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,761
If you bring me in here like that again,

30
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,680
there will be consequences.

31
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,185
You knew Ms. Go was pregnant, didn't you?

32
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,605
You fought with her a lot lately
because of that.

33
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,359
Was the baby mine?

34
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,654
Why don't you find the body first?

35
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,616
It'll be better for both of us that way.

36
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,038
You can go now. Bye.

37
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,669
An affair. Big snowflakes. Jongseo.
All witnesses dead.

38
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,754
And…

39
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,839
the missing woman was having an affair.

40
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,467
I have a bad feeling about this.

41
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,637
Sang-hyuk, this was a crime of passion.

42
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,513
A married man and a married woman
having an affair.

43
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,351
It turns out that Go Eun-seo
was recently pregnant.

44
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,270
She said she was going to give birth.

45
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,730
She didn't have any kids.

46
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,774
So Kim Myeong-sik got really upset.

47
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,528
He beat her until her blood splattered
in the car. That's what happened.

48
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,740
It's not what you're thinking!

49
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,208
EP6. WITNESS AND SUPERMAN

50
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,712
You're eating so well.

51
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,716
How can she eat so fast?

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,802
Do you want some more?

53
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,638
Don't eat too much.

54
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,850
Let's let her decide, then.

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,313
Let's ask her if she wants to go home
with the police or a civilian.

56
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,232
That's a good idea.

57
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,324
I choose…

58
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,038
I'll go home with Sang-hyuk.

59
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,965
Thank you.

60
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,430
My gosh.

61
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,099
It's literally my first time.

62
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,937
I never had a girl I like walk out,
holding another man's hand in front of me.

63
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,363
Alexandra, it has been a while
since I felt this eager to win.

64
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,117
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

65
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,287
What brings you here so early
in the morning?

66
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,832
Were you worried about
what you said the other day?

67
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,673
Animals can't talk.

68
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,426
They can't say, "I'm in pain."

69
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,138
So treating animals feels like

70
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:51,226
I'm looking for a clue in the dark.
It's often frustrating.

71
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,021
Whenever that happens,
I look into their eyes.

72
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,359
They can't speak,
but they can speak with their bodies.

73
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,612
They speak with their eyes.

74
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:17,795
You keep denying it,
but your body keeps coming to me.

75
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,340
And your eyes are always on me.

76
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,778
Don't give a witness statement.

77
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,363
It's dangerous.

78
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,658
If my memory helps,
I think I should do it.

79
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,036
It's their job to get criminals
without the help of witnesses.

80
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,955
They will.

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,749
But it'll take time.

82
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,253
-If Eun-seo is still alive…
-She's dead.

83
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,675
I'm 99% sure that she is.

84
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,887
I'm a woman

85
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,306
who risks her life

86
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,975
for that one percent.

87
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,310
You know that.

88
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,776
You're a fearless woman, Baek-ryeon.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,070
I'm a woman without many things.

90
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,323
I don't have any ties to people.
I have no fear.

91
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,034
What else? What is it that I have?

92
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,579
All I have is grit.

93
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,710
Why did you stop laughing?

94
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,128
You look pretty when you laugh.

95
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,591
Will it kill you to have
a big smile on your face?

96
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,230
What? You're the witness of that case?

97
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,776
Hey, remember what happened
in the other building a few days ago?

98
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,570
There is a rumor that it wasn't a suicide.

99
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,365
That girl died right after the police came
to ask her questions.

100
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,369
Hey, what if he was looking for you,
but he killed her instead?

101
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,623
Hey. Don't testify, okay?

102
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,459
Pretend like you know nothing.
Forget about testifying as a witness.

103
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,627
I can't do that.

104
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,920
She might be alive.

105
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,463
He wouldn't have kept her alive!

106
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,590
He even killed all the witnesses.

107
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,306
Wait a second.

108
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,391
Wasn't today the thousandth time?

109
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:42,022
The detective of that case
came to see you on the cliff?

110
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,357
Unbelievable.

111
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,484
He's a man who knows the past life.

112
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,737
"I know where you were and what you did

113
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,198
on the night of the last heavy snowfall."

114
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,036
That tarot guy wasn't lying.

115
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,081
The man you're destined to be with
actually showed up.

116
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,166
The man I'm destined to be with?

117
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,836
Did he say that?

118
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,547
This is perfect.

119
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,466
That detective is your destiny.

120
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,593
My gosh.

121
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,065
Did we do something wrong?

122
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,566
Did Love Room drop in sales?

123
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,486
Did Mr. Park confiscate your credit card?

124
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,865
You know, breakfast should be light.

125
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,575
Go to Love Room if you don't like this.

126
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,538
Breakfast should be served
at my convenience.

127
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,581
Why would we go all the way there?

128
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,125
We have you to cook for us.

129
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,086
I'll only be cooking from now on.

130
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,214
You guys do the rest.

131
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,216
What do you mean?
You're only going to make rice?

132
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,968
You want us to make soups and side dishes?

133
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,262
Do you want to have the soup I make?

134
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,471
Is that what you want?

135
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,975
No. I'll make the food.

136
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,602
You guys do the other household chores
like laundry and cleaning.

137
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,772
We should divide up the household chores
from now on.

138
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,151
What? Divide the chores?
How is he supposed to do laundry?

139
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,610
He's right.

140
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,279
That's not what you promised us
500 years ago.

141
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,740
You said you'd do everything
because it was your fault.

142
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,826
You said you would do everything
around the house.

143
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,874
Well, I have to attend to
an outside matter for a while.

144
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,375
What? What do you mean?

145
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,961
Are you going to that hospital
to see the pretty vet?

146
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,046
Goodness.

147
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,714
-No.
-No?

148
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,758
Then are you trying to catch the culprit?

149
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
If he's started killing again,

150
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,559
we still have two more cases.

151
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,394
What do those two cases
have to do with you?

152
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,189
-Of course, it does.
-Yoo Jeong-ah is dead.

153
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,524
It's none of your business
if there are two more cases or not.

154
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,610
That's what the police have to do.

155
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,945
Sang-hyuk.

156
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,909
We get that you hold
a big grudge against the culprit.

157
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,579
But don't forget that we are not
that happy with you either.

158
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,709
When I think about how we've been stuck
here for 500 years because of you, I…

159
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,420
It's time.

160
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,674
I'll be back.

161
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,886
What? Where are you going?

162
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,514
I have something to do starting today.

163
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,766
What do you have to do now?

164
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,604
Huh? What's that?

165
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,065
What is this?

166
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,528
CASANOVA'S SECRET

167
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,698
Let me see. Casanova's…

168
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,200
It's a secret.

169
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,868
Cheon Dong-gu.

170
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,995
What in the world are you up to now?

171
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,832
Whatever I do, it's my business.

172
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,834
Come on, guys! You can't be doing this.

173
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,877
It's a chocolate.

174
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,508
This is what I'm talking about.

175
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,926
-Dong-chil!
-Dong-chil!

176
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,430
-Hey, let go of me!
-Spit it out!

177
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,889
Emergency!

178
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,643
It's an emergency!

179
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
My dog just ate chocolates.

180
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,105
He ate a chocolate?

181
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,606
Yes! Here!

182
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,567
He had this!

183
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,027
He had a lot! A whole bunch of them!

184
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,072
-This way.
-Okay.

185
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,826
You two, please wait here.

186
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,788
Please hold on.

187
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,892
Chocolates are toxic to dogs!

188
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,769
They spilled out of my bag
because you pulled it!

189
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,814
You carried them in your bag!
That's why they spilled.

190
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,900
-You have to be careful when he's a dog!
-Hey.

191
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,526
That punk always forgets he's a dog!

192
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,278
He just eats anything.

193
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,374
Ddaeng-chil is…

194
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,085
He's fine.

195
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,380
-Goodness.
-Thank you, Doctor.

196
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,049
I got him treated.

197
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,258
He'll be fine soon.

198
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,054
Thank you so much.
Thank you for saving Dong-chil.

199
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,931
Thank you.

200
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,057
Dong-chil?

201
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,517
Isn't his name Ddaeng-chil?

202
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,810
It's Ddaeng-chil.

203
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,562
His name is Ddaeng-chil.

204
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,900
-Did I call him Dong-chil?
-Yes.

205
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,278
His name is Ddaeng-chil.
It is Ddaeng-chil.

206
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,363
Yup, Ddaeng-chil.

207
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,697
Right.

208
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,326
Did you take off the bandage?

209
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,873
You were bleeding so much yesterday.
How did you recover so quickly?

210
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,542
Let me see.

211
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,293
What are you doing?

212
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,711
Don't touch me.

213
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,463
Let me see for a second.

214
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,799
It's just incredible.

215
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,883
Mr. Superman.

216
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,427
-Your body is completely okay now.
-Stop it.

217
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,179
-Let go of me.
-Goodness.

218
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,724
-You're tickling me.
-Let me see.

219
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,560
-Let go of me.
-Let me see.

220
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,357
I told you to let go of me.

221
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,532
By the way, who are these two gentlemen?

222
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,742
-We are…
-Well…

223
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,994
Well…

224
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,997
This is…

225
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,249
He is my older brother.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,084
Older brother?

227
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,210
We're older than him?

228
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,045
I know. Are we older?

229
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,048
So he's the oldest brother and
he's the second oldest brother?

230
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,842
Right.

231
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,554
Am I the oldest?

232
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,930
I can't be the oldest.

233
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,307
Yes, we are his brothers.

234
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,309
Goodness.

235
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,938
I guess Sang-hyuk is handsome
because good looks run in the family…

236
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,152
So you three are the only siblings.

237
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,238
There's one more, though.

238
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,040
Hey. Are you done with your food?

239
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,251
You'll get better only if you eat it all.
Hurry up and eat.

240
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,224
Oh, my.

241
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,277
Dong-chil!

242
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,155
-Dong-chil!
-Hey.

243
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,907
-Go back.
-Why did he walk out from there?

244
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,533
-I'm glad to see you again.
-Go back.

245
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,995
-I thought you were going to die.
-No! Go back.

246
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,790
I feel so weak. I need to go home.

247
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,792
Okay. Let's go. Let's get you home.

248
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,919
Who is he?

249
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,799
He's my older brother.

250
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,884
Dong-chil, are you okay?

251
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,891
So he's the oldest. He's next.
And he's the third oldest.

252
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,144
And you're the youngest.
The four of you are brothers.

253
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,855
-You're the youngest?
-You're the youngest?

254
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,899
Yes, I'm the youngest.

255
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,859
-I'm the youngest one in the family.
-I see.

256
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,321
-We have an emergency.
-What happened?

257
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,657
Ddaeng-chil is gone.

258
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,117
What?

259
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,037
We searched everywhere.
He's not here. I can't find him.

260
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,332
What do you mean?
I didn't see him come out.

261
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,503
I was watching the others for a second.
When I turned back, he was gone.

262
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,088
He even left this out.

263
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,506
How is that even possible?

264
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,383
He's not even a human. How did he…

265
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,509
Don't move.

266
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,304
Ddaeng-chil!

267
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,849
-Ddaeng-chil?
-Ddaeng-chil.

268
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,352
Ddaeng-chil!

269
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,021
It's Ddaeng-chil.

270
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,150
Hurry up and get out!

271
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,985
What are you doing here, Ddaeng-chil?

272
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,903
-What are you doing here?
-Sit.

273
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,321
-Ddaeng-chil.
-Is he Ddaeng-chil?

274
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,198
-I think you're mistaken.
-Ddaeng-chil.

275
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,826
Just get out. I'll take care of it here.

276
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,369
-Do we go?
-You want us to go?

277
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,871
You want us to run away?

278
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,497
Do you want to explain it to her with me?

279
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,416
-Who are you?
-You need to get a shot.

280
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,042
-It's not him.
-It's him.

281
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,878
-Ddaeng-chil is here.
-I think you're mistaken.

282
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,546
This is Ddaeng-chil.

283
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,340
Little brother,
please take care of the rest.

284
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,760
The youngest one usually handles
matters like this.

285
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,303
Ddaeng-chil!

286
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,015
-Ddaeng-chil.
-Why are you here?

287
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,312
Ddaeng-chil!

288
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,355
-You're mistaken.
-Just go!

289
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,232
-No, he's not Ddaeng-chil.
-Excuse me.

290
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,776
-It isn't him.
-It is.

291
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,068
-He's not!
-He is.

292
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,153
-He's Ddaeng-chil.
-Go!

293
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,447
-This isn't Ddaeng-chil.
-It is him.

294
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,908
-This is my dog, Elpa.
-Why can't you tell your own dog?

295
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,326
This is Elpa.

296
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,161
I know that this is your dog.

297
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,163
This is Ddaeng-chil.
You can't recognize your own dog?

298
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,582
He isn't Ddaeng-chil.
His hair and nose are different.

299
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,083
-He isn't Ddaeng-chil.
-He is!

300
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,502
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

301
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,045
In my opinion,

302
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,713
Captain Seo is losing.

303
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,173
I'm sure of it.

304
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,008
Did you say he's losing?

305
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,178
She walked out that day,
holding that man's hand.

306
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,763
Isn't this over then?

307
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,057
I can't believe that he's losing for once.

308
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,310
What's going on?
Did something happen while I was gone?

309
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,647
Do you remember that day when we found
the flower-patterned umbrella?

310
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,732
-I'll tell you later.
-Let's be honest.

311
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,235
Chief Seo is good-looking for a cop.

312
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,240
He just stands out
because he's with ugly guys like us.

313
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,826
There are so many good-looking guys
outside the station.

314
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,203
I mean, I saw the guy yesterday.

315
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,830
He was good-looking unlike us.

316
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,458
How should I put it?

317
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,045
He looks like Elsa
from The Lord of the Rings.

318
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,548
-You mean Elf.
-Right, Elf.

319
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,510
I would've walked out, holding his hand,
if I were a girl too.

320
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,729
-Why are you looking at me?
-What?

321
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,024
He only stands out
because he's with the ugly guys like us?

322
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,485
What? You think that guy's handsome
unlike us?

323
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm not angry because I'm good-looking.

324
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,073
You punk!

325
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,036
Gosh, he scared me.

327
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,139
Red notebook.

328
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,350
The culprit gave the victims
this red notebook

329
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,728
24 hours before he committed crimes.

330
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,813
As if it was a forewarning.

331
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,899
It's about this big.

332
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,901
You didn't see it when you were
at Go Eun-seo's place?

333
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,904
She said she didn't do anything wrong.

334
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,697
She said it wasn't a sin.

you have to investigate.

ADULTERY

338
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,318
Adultery?

339

340
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,620
ADULTERY

341
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,960
-It's…
-I found it at Ms. Go's place.

342
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,629
Who is it?

343
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,341
Who's the culprit that you and Sang-hyuk
have in mind?

344
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,097
We just couldn't seem to catch that guy.

345
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,641
It was as if someone was helping him.

346
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,440
WINTER, 1993

347
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,373
They both have short hair.
They're wearing polka-dot coats.

348
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,499
Have you seen them?

349
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,834
No, I haven't.

350
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,879
Have you seen two girls

351
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:41,300
I closed my shop early because there
weren't many customers that night.

352
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,678
-No, I didn't see them.
-No, I haven't.

353
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,929
Goodness, I haven't seen them.

359
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,719
-Goodness.
-Step away.

360
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,472
-It's her jacket!
-Jeong-ah…

361
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,682
-Jeong-ah, Mommy is here.
-My baby!

362
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,603

365
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,363
We couldn't find
the missing high school girls.

WITNESS FOUND HANGING
NEAR HIKING TRAIL

367
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,284
The witnesses died one by one.

368
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,287
So many people criticized the police.

369
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,538
POLICE LOST SUSPECT AGAIN?

370
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,623
Then…

371
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,250
the chief investigator took his own life.

372
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,960
So the case remained unsolved.

373
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,420
I REALLY WANTED TO GET HIM
I AM SORRY

374
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:05,176
But a year later, there was an officer
who reopened the case.

SUNGIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

380
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,232
He found out that this case had
something in common

381
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:24,403
with three other cases of missing women
that had occurred around that time.

382
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,073
And that was the red notebook.

383
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,996
He gave the red notebooks to the victims
24 hours before he committed the crimes.

384
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,541
He told them they'd die
if they didn't fill it up.

385
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:40,545
The victims assumed that he was crazy.

386
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,421
But they went missing the next day.

387
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,343
One of the missing girls, Song Da-hee,
got that notebook.

388
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,055
The word that was written
on the notebook was "Theft."

389
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,029
It looked like Yoo Jeong-ah wasn't
a part of his plan.

390
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,032
But it looks like she was killed
because she wore the same polka-dot coat.

391
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,618
She was an unexpected variable
in his plan.

392
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:16,122
-Honey, come here. I'll be sweet.
-Handsome, over here!

393
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,293
-Come over here!
-Come on!

395
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,590
He tried to kill the fifth woman
for the next sin, "disease."

396
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,717
But the police caught onto him.

397
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,294
By the time I got to the scene,

398
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,713
everyone was gone,
including the police and him.

399
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,923
Both were gone?

400
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,800
There is a person I am suspicious of.

401
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,806
But I couldn't continue to investigate
because there was no trace of him.

402
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,769
But if this is here again…

-Thank you!

415
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,780

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,324
Wait a second.

417
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,058
It won't take long. Give me a second.

418
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,858

419
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,621
Okay.

420
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,210
You can eat now.

421
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,256
Hey.

422
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:16,719
-Why are you doing this?
-You insisted on testifying as a witness.

423
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,555
Well, there's a reason why
I have to do this as well.

424
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,308
Why would you protect the witness?

425
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,227
The police are busy
trying to get the criminals.

426
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:31,192
So are you going to be Dr. Oh's bodyguard?

427
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,445
That's cool.

428
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,322
I'm so jealous, Dr. Oh.

429
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,326
You should eat.

430
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,120
You should all eat.

431
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,918
Your drinks are ready.

432
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,087
You ordered this, right?

433
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,845
Do you think you're invincible
or something?

434
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,431
Yes, I won't die.

435
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,644
You actually think you are a real superman
just because I call you that?

436
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,021
You won't die? That's nonsense.

437
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,564
Here. You can drink now.

438
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,244

441
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,339

Hello.

445

I'm taking

Hello, Mr. Cheon.

448
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,151
Yes, I need to ask you something.

449
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,029
I couldn't attend the first session
because something came up.

450
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,532
Is there a class
that I can make it up with?

451
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,867
Extra class?

452
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,786
We don't have such things.
Just don't skip it next time.

453
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:11,459
If there is no extra class,
how can we keep up?

454
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,587
You usually introduce yourselves
during the first two hours.

455
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,589
You don't have to worry
about not keeping up.

456
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,923
-Introduce ourselves?
-Yes.

457
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,385
It's a time where you talk
about your dating history.

458
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,180
My dating history?

459
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:29,185
What do people talk about
if they don't have any dating history?

460
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:34,398
Then you talk about why you couldn't
date anyone.

461
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,193
Is that so?

462
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:42,656
Then I have to share
why I didn't have any girlfriends before.

463
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,325
Yes, you have to do that.

464
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,327
Thank you.

465
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,205

It's like you're being compensated
for all the days you've been lonely.

473
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,453
I'll see you tomorrow then.

474
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,871
Bye.

475
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,248
Let's go.

476
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,500
I guess he didn't get hurt.

477
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,418
You're right.

478
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,213
They're always together too.

479
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,319
Okay, you can drink this. Here.

480
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,490
-Do you want it too?
-Sure.

481
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,463
Okay. You can have it.

482
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,509
Mr. Superman. You won't get killed?

483
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:29,096
What if you get killed
by testing all the food before her?

484
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,849
-He said he won't die.
-That's ridiculous.

485
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,227
What else do you want with this?
There's lettuce, ripened kimchi,

486
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,770
and perilla leaves.

487
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,733
-Perilla leaves.
-Perilla leaves.

488
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,901
I want this, too.

489
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:43,986
Okay.

493
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,470
You're working too hard.

494
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,930
You should eat before playing games.

00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,099
Do you want to come over for beef tripes?

496
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,894
What?

497
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,314
You want me to wire you money
so you can have dinner?

498
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,900
You jerk, are you out of your mind?

499
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,569
Hey! Do you think I'm your sugar mama?

500
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,781
This guy is going too far!

501
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,866
What's wrong? That wasn't like you.

502
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,787
My boyfriend who is 12 years younger,

503
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,705
he's playing games without eating.

504
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,791
-It's bad for his health.
-Hold on.

505
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,919
-Oh, my!
-Here. Okay.

506
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,798
-What--
-It was too close to her.

507
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,927
Goodness.

508
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,850
Oh, dear.

509
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:05,109
-Let me help you with that.
-Thank you.

510
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,662
You said you like this too.

511
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,747
Here.

512
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,673
What's wrong?

513
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,175
Why did you help her get the perilla leaf?

514
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,720
-What?
-Why did you get the perilla leaf for her?

515
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:33,846
The perilla leaf?

516
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,182
It looked like she was having
a hard time getting it.

517
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,476
My goodness.

518
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,063
You said you wanted to protect
the witness.

519
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,524
But your eyes were on another woman.

520
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,527
What if I die from the poisoned soju

521
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,904
while you're getting the perilla leaf
for her?

522
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,990
Would it be so bad for her
to get more than one leaf?

523
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,117
It's just salty. That's it.
She won't die from it.

524
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,328
-You should only look at me.
-What's wrong with you?

525
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,706
He just helped me get a perilla leaf.
That's all.

526
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:05,169
It sounds like you'd throw the table
if he made a wrap for me.

527
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,379
-It's different for perilla leaves.
-How?

528
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,797
They're different, okay?

529
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,340
How are they different?

530
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,305
Make a wrap.

531
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,057
Do it with a perilla leaf.

532
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,227
Yes, ma'am.

533
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,028
I guess it's not that hard to get it.

534
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,657
Here. Open up.

535
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,752
With ripened kimchi this time.

536
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:47,961
Ripened kimchi.

537
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:51,924
That's enough.

538
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,801
Ripened kimchi. Here.

539
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,104
You smell nice.

540
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,154
My goodness.

541
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,913
Sang-hyuk, this way.

542
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,544
Hey, Baek-ryeon.

543
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,711
-Is it here?
-Yes, over here.

544
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,338
-Come in.
-Baek-ryeon, get up.

545
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,340
Wake up. You're home.

546
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,219
-What's wrong with her?
-She usually doesn't let go.

547
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,305
Come on, get inside. My goodness. Wake up!

548
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,515
Hey, get up.

549
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,933
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

550
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,101
-Thank you.
-Close this.

551
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,562
Thank you. I'll close it.

552
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,313
Goodbye!

553
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,205
Geez!

554
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,666
Oh, my goodness!

555
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,126
Let me--

556
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,254
-Do-ra.
-What?

557
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,634
I guess he meant it when he said
he had no romantic interest in me.

558
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,804
What do you mean?

559
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,515
He's perfectly fine.

560
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,935
I like him because he's not hurt.

561
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,229
But because he's okay…

562
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:33,817
I feel sad.

563
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,447
Go to bed now.

564
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,724
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

565
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,561
The security camera technician
did call Kim Myeong-sik.

566
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,979
But he didn't pick up.

567
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,733
Whatever the reason is,
he did call Myeong-sik.

568
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,027
Then there must be something.

569
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,447
The bloodstain on the car
and how he went there that day.

570
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:23,283
He even tried to get rid of that skirt
with the bloodstain.

571
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,452
The circumstances seem to say it's him.

572
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,247
But we have no conclusive evidence.

573
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:33,669
Or,

574
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,713
it could be someone else.

575
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,985
Yes, Detective Seo.

576
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,487
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

577
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,450
CRIME INVESTIGATION
HYPNOSIS ROOM

578
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,411
We meet again.

579
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,832
I warned you not to summon
the witness here.

580
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,209
I agreed to come. Stop it.

581
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,128
You heard her.
I asked for her cooperation.

582
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
Don't ask for her cooperation next time.

583
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:24,261
If there's anything I can do to help,
I should do it.

584
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,221
What can I do for you?

585
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,724
I need to know what you remember.

586
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,767
We'll put you under hypnosis
for investigation.

587
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,519
-Hypnosis?
-Yes.

588
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:36,023
It brings back old and forgotten memories
or blurry memories.

589
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,776
Check which of these is the man in black
that you saw at the bus stop that night.

590
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,861
Okay.

591
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,003
Breathe comfortably.

592
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,599
You are heading back to 11 p.m.
on December 21st.

593
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,687
Where are you right now?

594
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,527
I'm at Yeon-ja's Mountain Valley
Restaurant.

595
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,237
What do you see?

596
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,949
Snow.

597
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,745
Large snowflakes.

598
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,957
It was nice to meet you.

599
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,543
And Eun-seo.

600
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,214
Go to the bus stop now.

601
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,259
Can you see Eun-seo?

602
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,019
The man in black is walking towards her.

603
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,608
Is the man tall?

604
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,904
He is tall.

605
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,489
How tall is he?

606
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,701
I think he's over 180cm.

607
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,290
HEIGHT: 182cm

608
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,419
What kind of black outfit is he wearing?

609
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,255
Is it a puffer jacket or a coat?

610
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:26,633
He's wearing a coat.

611
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,718
Can you get closer to him?

612
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,056
Is there any pattern on the coat?

613
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,725
Check the brand.

614
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,168
Baek-ryeon, are you okay? What's wrong?

615
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,130
Oh, no!

616
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,299
Puffer jacket.

617
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,301
Puffer jacket.

618
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,099
Ms. Oh! Leave that place now.

619
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,476
Look at the large snowflakes.

620
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,256
We are expecting heavy snowfall
tomorrow night.

621
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:35,470
We're expecting heavier snowfall than
the record-breaking one on December 21st.

622
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,060
Hold on.

623
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,419
There we go.

624
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,673
It's going to snow a lot tomorrow night.

625
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,259
It's cold, so don't come out.

626
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,681
Just hide in the house.

627
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:23,101
Promise me you won't come out.

628
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,197
This scarf smells nice.

629
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,689
MISSING HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
WERE BEST FRIENDS

630
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,281
CHO BYEONG-CHEOL

631
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,827
MOTEL

632
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,514
Kim Myeong-sik is the prime suspect.

633
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:46,226
He went to the parking lot that night.
And we found blood in his car.

634
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,561
On top of that, he tried to throw away
Go Eun-seo's skirt.

635
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,815
He had a conflict with her
because she was pregnant.

636
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,775
His motive for the murder is clear.

637
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,405
Just because a mysterious red notebook
was found in Eun-seo's house,

638
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,449
we can't just start
the investigation all over again.

639
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,995
We have to investigate to see
if Cho Byeong-cheol is the 1993 culprit.

640
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,207
He was treated for a car accident
around that time.

641
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,627
What he wore was similar
to what the police saw.

642
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,089
These two alone are not enough
to have him as the suspect.

643
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:19,092
The security camera technician seems
more like a suspect.

644
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,846
He could've set a fire at Ms. Ham's place
because she's the witness.

645
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,515
We have a call history
that he called Kim Myeong-sik.

646
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,602
Kim Myeong-sik testified
that he didn't see Eun-seo that night.

647
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:35,442
However, he got out of the car
because he knew that Eun-seo was there.

648
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,949
Why did he lie?

649
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,371
Kim Myeong-sik
and the black puffer jacket.

650
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:52,417
Kim Myeong-sik
and the security camera technician.

651
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:57,422
Is the black puffer jacket guy
the security camera guy?

652
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,471
The problem is the red notebook.

653
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:06,139
ADULTERY

654
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:10,351
We need to investigate if the technician
has anything to do with the red notebook.

655
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:36,085
The black puffer jacket guy yanked
Eun-seo's head back.

656
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,676
And there's one more person.

657
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,360
I'll die if I tell you.

658
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,279
I heard all the witnesses are dead
for that case.

659
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:08,743
-We're not sure if there's a connection.
-See? You're not sure about that either.

660
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,622
Please leave. I'm not going to cooperate.

661
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,626
Excuse me.

662
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,838
What do we do now?

663
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,059
Sir.

664
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,478
There he is.

665
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:40,024
-Makgeolli?
-Yes.

666
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,944
We should have makgeolli
and scallion jeon on a snowy day.

667
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,904
Let's go and buy some
from the convenience store.

668
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,364
Okay.

669
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:49,450
Promise me that you won't come out.

670
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,124
You should go alone.

671
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:01,462
-It's snowing. And I--
-Hey.

672
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,089
I'm scared to go alone, too.

673
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,049
Remember what happened
in the other building?

674
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,594
-Let's go together.
-Do you have to drink makgeolli?

675
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,222
You're the one who got me
hooked on makgeolli.

676
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,849
Come on.

677
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,444
MOTEL

678
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,904
-What are you doing here?
-Geez.

679
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,072
How did you--

680
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,157
Why did you rush out from there?

681
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:54,867
What are you doing here?

682
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,788
-Why are you even here?
-Why? To keep an eye on Cho Byeong-cheol!

683
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,586
Hey, what happened?
Why are you on the ground?

684
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,796
This guy came and--

685
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,756
Where are you going? My gosh.

686
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,551
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

687
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,011
-I know it doesn't hurt.
-My goodness.

688
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,188
We are here.

689
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,446
-May I assist you?
-Yes.

690
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,014
A man who knows the past will come.

691
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,923
That'll be 8,800 won.

692
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,551
Please insert your card here.

693
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,264
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

694
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,462
Baek-ryeon!

695
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,922
Where did she go?

696
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,342
Baek-ryeon!

697
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,345
Baek-ryeon.

698
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,606
Baek-ryeon! Baek-ryeon!

699
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:14,734
Baek-ryeon!

700
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,654
Baek-ryeon!

701
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,165
Sir.

702
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,709
-We lost him.
-What?

703
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:33,628
You lost him?

704
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,129
Who?

705
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,681
Baek-ryeon.

706
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,186
Baek-ryeon.

707
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,356
Seriously.

708
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,158
Hey!

709
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,452
Do-ra.

710
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,834
Oh, no.
I think he got hit with something heavy.

711
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:15,628
Oh, no.

712
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:19,298
Hey, are you okay?

713
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,024
Baek-ryeon! Baek-ryeon!

714
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,068
Mr. Cheon?

715
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,403
Mr. Superman?

716
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,281
Where is Baek-ryeon? Is she here?

717
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:48,494
She's inside. A dog got severely injured.

718
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,787
What?

719
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,541
Good.

720
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,551
I told her not to come out!

721
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,511
You did?

722
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,847
Didn't Baek-ryeon say anything?

723
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:09,557
Maybe she did.

724
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,393
I asked if we could go to
the convenience store

725
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,894
to get some makgeolli.

726
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:18,274
Why would you drink makgeolli
late at night?

727
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,403
We were going to drink
because it was snowing!

728
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,573
Do I have to ask your permission to drink?

729
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,743
Why are you getting mad at me? Geez.

730
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,786
DETECTIVE SEO JAE-HEE

731
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,164
Doctor, it's that detective.

732
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,666
-Please wrap it up for me.
-Yes.

733
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,838
Yes, Detective Seo.

734
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,717
I'm at the hospital.

735
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,263
A dog got hurt, not me.
I'm at the animal hospital.

736
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,934
I'm fine. Why?

737
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,479
All right, then.

738
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,230
Okay.

739
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,524
Is everything okay?

740
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:02,485
Yes.

741
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,532
He knows we're watching him, right?

742
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:14,246
He's meticulous.
He would know if he's the culprit.

743
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,394
Sang-hyuk.

744
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:49,115
I told you not to go out tonight.

745
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,329
Well…

746
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,479
I'm so sorry for making you worry.

747
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:24,859
I thought it would be fine
since there were two of us.

748
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:28,237
I don't care if it was just you
or with someone else.

749
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,321
I told you not to go out!

750
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:32,491
-I'll do that next time.
-And, Do-ra.

751
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,326
Come on.

752
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,665
I'll go now.

753
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,458
Okay.

754
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,086
Hey, Mr. Superman.

755
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:45,629
What now?

756
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:48,382
Come up and have some makgeolli
before you go.

757
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,051
He drove here. He can't drink.

758
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,723
He can call a driver or sleep over.

759
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,310
What did you say?

760
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,228
What do you mean?

761
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,855
Sleep over?

762
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,358
If he's worried about you every second,

763
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,153
he can stay with you then.

764
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,323
You two can stay together
and hold hands like this.

765
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,326
You can sleep under the same blanket.

766
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,621
You can stay together 24/7 like this!

767
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,043
What are you thinking? Goodness.

768
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,422
Why are you two blushing?

769
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,217
What were you imagining just now?

770
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,261
Imagine? No.

771
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,973
You look like you're blushing because
you imagined what would happen

772
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,850
if you two were under the same blanket.

773
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,060
No, I didn't imagine.

774
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:43,729
I never thought of that.

775
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,023
Baek-ryeon. You did, right?

776
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,525
She did. She imagined it.

777
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,110
Baek-ryeon!

778
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,155
What were you imagining?

779
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,283
What do you mean?

780
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,161
You're unbelievable!

781
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,622
Come in.

782
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,917
Come up and have makgeolli with us.
You can sleep over.

783
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,711
Why does she keep telling him
to sleep over?

784
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,964
She's so not conservative.

785
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,342
-Are you?
-Aren't you going to come up?

786
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:16,762
What if I drag her out at night again?

787
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,015
Gosh, it's snowing a lot.

788
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,477
It's snowing so hard.
Will it snow all night? Goodness.

789
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,104
Come on. Let's go.

790
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,746
Hey.

791
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:43,914
Yes.

792
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,124
Do you--

793
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,377
Do you want to come up?

794
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:51,500
