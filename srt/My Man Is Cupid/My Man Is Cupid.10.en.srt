1
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,473
Oh Baek-ryeon.

2
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,142
The one that should stay by your side is…

3
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,235
I'll protect her. It's what I'm good at.

4
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,253
I got it.

5
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,422
I caught a falling leaf.

6
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,220
People say your wish will come true
if you catch a falling leaf.

7
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:58,702
EP10. MY MAN IS…?

8
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,400
I saw it.

9
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,651
What?

10
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,319
You two.

11
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:33,863
You were kissing.

12
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,740
What? Kissing?

13
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,825
Two?

14
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,660
Who are you talking about?

15
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,252
Since when?

16
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,504
From when to when?

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,592
Damn it.

18
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,681
From the start…

19
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,769
to the confession.

20
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,942
I saw the highlight, too.

21
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,447
Hey.

22
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,533
Why were you watching that?

23
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,160
I thought you wanted us to watch.

24
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,371
-Isn't that why you made a scene here?
-Are you sure you're my friend?

25
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,373
You should've given us some privacy!

26
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,583
Why would I do that?

27
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,461
What's more interesting
than watching a fight or a fire

28
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,421
is watching people make out.

29
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,090
Oh, come on!

30
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,677
But you know what?

31
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,638
It's a bit strange.

32
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,432
Was it strange?

33
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,935
Which part?

34
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,812
He said, "If you open up to a woman,
it will end in a tragedy."

35
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,982
But why is the vet so fine?

36
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,861
-What do you mean?
-The two girls who were involved with you.

37
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,822
Both the court lady, Lee So-hee, and
the high school girl, Yoo Jeong-ah died.

38
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,492
Let's forget about So-hee for now.

39
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,619
Did you do anything with Jeong-ah?

40
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:07,247
She went missing the day you started
having feelings for her.

41
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,541
Then he said, "Don't open up."

42
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,044
He gave you such a harsh warning.

43
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,130
Why is the vet fine? You even kissed her.

44
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,717
-It was a deep kiss, too.
-Come on.

45
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,263
Don't tell me you kissed her
when you don't even like her.

46
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,393
-Was it like some instinct at that moment?
-Hey, I'm not a jerk. Okay?

47
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,146
I'm not a guy who kisses girls
when I don't even have feelings for them.

48
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,649
Do you know how hard
I've been struggling with my feelings?

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,778
I know it in my head
that I shouldn't do this.

50
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,279
But my heart moved.

51
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,907
I was so tempted.

52
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,201
It was driving me crazy.
She kept telling me that she was an angel.

53
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,371
She did all this cute stuff.

54
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,747
She looked…

55
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,333
so…

56
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,669
lovely.

57
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,715
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

58
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,343
Hey, that kiss…

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,180
-It was real.
-I thought so too.

60
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,309
You opened up your heart to her.
And your mouth too.

61
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,315
That's why it's so strange.

62
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:21,697
Why is she still fine?
He told you not to open up to human women.

63
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,073
But she's fine.

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,035
You know what?

65
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,328
I'm an angel.

66
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,834
-No way.
-Is she…

67
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,927
I'm sorry. I can't promise that.

68
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,891
It doesn't matter if he's an alien,
a ghost, or a monster.

69
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,020
I like that man.

70
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,748
Cheon Sang-hyuk. Who are you?

71
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,125
-It's Sang-hyuk.
-You scared me.

72
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,419
You're still here?

73
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,796
I left some stuff.

74
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,925
What's wrong with Sang-hyuk's face?

75
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,677
-It looks like it was taken long ago.
-Right.

76
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,432
It's not Sang-hyuk. It's his father.

77
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,267
Sang-hyuk's father.

78
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,520
That police officer who went missing
during an investigation?

79
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,230
Wait a second.

80
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,442
Is the man I saw that day
Sang-hyuk's great-grandfather, then?

81
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,238
What are you talking about?
Great-grandfather?

82
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,950
I saw a photo of a man who looked like
Sang-hyuk at Love Room a few days ago.

83
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,162
A popular place for blind dates?

84
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,914
Isn't this all just marketing?

85
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,999
LOVE ROOM

86
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,335
This man is…

87
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,004
-Love Room?
-You know that restaurant?

88
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,299
The security camera near the place spotted
a guy on the night Eun-seo went missing.

89
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,639
This man used a corporate credit card
of that restaurant.

90
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,224
Right.

91
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,519
That photo was taken
during the late 19th century.

92
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,688
He looked exactly like this.

93
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,190
The late 19th century?

94
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,067
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:31,368
MATCHED IN LOVE ROOM

96
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,505
The first stage of a relationship,
eye contact.

97
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,261
Eye contact is the beginning of not only
romantic relationships

98
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,388
but also various human relationships.

99
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:57,519
If you can't make eye contact properly,
you can't make people trust or like you.

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,150
But it's also a problem
if you stare at someone too much.

101
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,782
Researchers conducted a study
in the UK to determine

102
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,202
the appropriate amount of time
for eye contact.

103
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,871
They determined that three seconds
of eye contact

104
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,040
made the other person feel
most comfortable.

105
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,585
Between two to five seconds,
they feel less repelled.

106
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:28,217
It makes a person uncomfortable
if it's less than one or more than ten.

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,178
Yong-bok, let's make eye contact.

108
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,930
-Sorry?
-Why?

109
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,140
Why are you making eye contact
with Yong-bok?

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,335
You're up next, Dong-gu.

111
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,128
Hold on.

112
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,673
Are you sure
you're not going to regret this?

113
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,634
-Regret?
-You'll fall for me

114
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,844
if you look into my eyes for five seconds.

115
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,474
There is no way out
once you fall for my eyes.

116
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,893
Why? It's because I have a fairy's eyes.

117
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,938
I have to deal with an angel
during the day and a fairy at night.

118
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,523
They're both ridiculous.

119
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,150
Have you ever made eye contact
with a fairy before?

120
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,277
I'll get to do it now.

121
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,041
Is five seconds this fast?

122
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,545
Il-yong.

123
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,131
Your eyes are very blank.

124
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,134
Embrace your soul in your eyes.

125
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,260
Yong-bok.

126
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,014
You looked somewhere else nine times
during our five-second eye contact.

127
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,475
-Don't look away and make eye contact.
-Okay.

128
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,772
Dong-gu, you're too hostile.

129
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,691
I am hostile?

130
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,610
-My eyes are hostile?
-You're still very hostile.

131
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,291
-Who is this man?
-I don't know who he is either.

132
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,337
From now on,
try to have your eyes look like his.

133
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,589
A gentle look, like this.

134
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,507
A gentle look.

135
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,968
-A gentle look.
-A gentle look.

136
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,430
All right. Repeat after me.

137
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,392
"My eyes are pretty.
My eyes are charming."

138
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:49,232
After making your eyes look beautiful,
look at ten people for three seconds.

139
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,111
Record their reactions.

140
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,654
That is this week's homework.

141
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,532
-I have to look at ten people?
-Yes, ten people.

142
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,160
Watching them for three seconds
won't get you in trouble.

143
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,623
It got me in trouble.
It did get me in trouble.

144
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,375
-What are you looking at?
-Why are you staring?

145
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,502
-Don't look at me!
-Let me go.

146
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,586
Let go of me!

147
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,254
Let go! I said, let go!

148
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,715
Is it wrong for me to just look? Is it?

149
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,260
What are you doing? Stop!

150
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,141
Look at people with these eyes.

151
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,684
Not those eyes.

152
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,189
That's all for today.

153
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,954
I have a story.

154
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,998
I have a reason why
I don't have a boyfriend.

155
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,793
Humans and fairies are not meant
to be together.

156
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,878
You know what? I'm an angel.

157
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,588
Don't fall for me.

158
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,049
You'll get hurt if you fall for me.

159
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,096
Is she really an angel?

160
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,889
What nonsense is this?

161
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,516
What kind of nonsense is this?

162
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,684
The vet is an angel?

163
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,811
She said it herself.

164
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,396
She said that she's an angel.

165
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,900
Well, then I'm Samsin, god of childbirth.

166
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,735
Really?

167
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,739
Of course not! I don't look like Samsin.

168
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,949
I can't be Samsin.

169
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,619
But that vet looks like an angel.

170
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,206
-Goodness, come on!
-She's fine.

171
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,334
He used to kill off girls
when Sang-hyuk opened up for a bit.

172
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,421
-Stop.
-He opened up and even kissed her.

173
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,589
But she's still fine.

174
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,799
I'm sure she's an angel.

175
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,011
She's from another world just like us.

176
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,888
I get it now.

177
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,640
So two individuals from
two different worlds met

178
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,018
and they will live
happily ever after, huh?

179
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,312
Why don't they have a wedding
while they are at it?

180
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,439
It will be the romance of the century.

181
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,901
What would their kid look like
if they're married?

182
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:25,388
-My gosh, I'm so happy!
-Me too!

183
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,632
Wait. I need at least two years

184
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,761
to have a child
and live happily ever after.

185
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,559
Then I shouldn't leave too fast.

186
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,354
There must be a world of angels
that we don't know about.

187
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,023
Humans don't know about fairies either.

188
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,276
Angels are from a different world.

189
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,069
It could be even more dangerous.

190
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,154
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

191
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,115
Why would you compare it to that?

192
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,534
Don't compare it like that.

193
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,537
Let's just stay safe.
Then we can leave this place in peace.

194
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,332
A month is more than enough
for us to work hard and wrap it up.

195
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,762
There's not much time left.

196
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,623
Nice to meet you.

197
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,832
Good to see you.

198
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,797
-Sang-ho.
-Yes?

199
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,132
Let's drink.

200
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,009
Hey!

201
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,469
You jerk!

202
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,195
Wait. Why do I suddenly feel so heavy?

203
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,158
Hey, wait. Me too.
I feel like I gained 0.1 kilograms.

204
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,042
-Damn it. It's Dong-gu!
-It's Dong-gu!

205
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,261
What should I name my kid?

206
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,514
Cheon Dong-seok?

207
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,557
Cheon Dong-sik?

208
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,643
No. What if it's a girl?

209
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,897
What if it's a pretty girl
who looks like Do-ra?

210
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,066
Cheon Dong-mi?

211
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,401
Cheon Dong-soon?

From now on,
stay away from Cheon Sang-hyuk.

215
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,383
It's me, Go Eun-seo.

216
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,441
Come to think of it, she's very pretty.

217
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,152
She's unrealistically pretty just like me.

218
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,459
She came down from the sky.

219
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,222
What the heck?

220
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,527
From now on, you're not allowed
to step even a foot outside your room

221
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,111
unless you have to use the bathroom.

222
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,988
Actually,

223
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,866
-we can put a chamber pot in his room.
-A chamber pot?

224
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,494
-No one uses those now!
-Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

225
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,204
We'll serve three meals a day
here in your room.

226
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,790
Eat that and stay quiet until we leave.

227
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,671
Is Sang-hyuk home?

228
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,062
What? Where is he?

229
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,397
He's not home yet?

230
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,410
I smell gas.

231
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,501
We'll all die if you lay a finger on me.

232
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,088
I'm not like Dong-gu. I'm a lunatic.

233
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,174
So don't do anything stupid.

234
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,552
Or I'll blow up this place!

235
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,139
Don't forget that he burned his own wings.

236
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,475
Damn it.

00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,750
Baek-ryeon, are you asleep?

239
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,299
Baek-ryeon. I have a question.

240
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,723
Are you an angel?

241
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,733
What if she's a real angel?

242
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,242
That's so strange.

243
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,369
I saw it right here.

244
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:50,917
-I'm sure it was somewhere here.
-Are you sure you saw his picture?

245
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,170
I really saw his picture here.

246
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,217
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

247
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,972
Did you remove the picture that looked
like it was taken in the 19th century?

248
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,100
-A picture taken in the 19th century?
-Yes.

249
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,644
I don't know.
I didn't look at the pictures carefully.

250
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,271
We're the police.

251
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,067
Can we meet your boss?

252
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,861
He's on vacation.

253
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,364
-He is?
-Yes.

254
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:24,951

"Are you an angel?"

00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,217
"If you don't mind,
can I check if you have wings?"

259

-Sir, the police were here at Love Room.

263
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,606
What?

264
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,276
Why did they go there?

265
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,488
-My picture?
-I got rid of it right before they came.

266
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:03,948
But they looked unconvinced.

00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,410

Why are you asking?

It's nothing. Thank you.

Gosh.

00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,390
How could you set me up
with a woman like her?

292
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,309
Did I do something to upset you?

293
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,479
Also, she picked a very expensive place
for the blind date.

I asked her to split the bill.

But she said she was going to the restroom
and then she disappeared.

296

I had to pay for the whole meal.

-We're under investigation.
-Is the last witness dead?

353
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,976
-What's the condition of the witness?
-We want to know--

354
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,561
Where's Baek-ryeon?

355
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,067
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

356
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,624
-Is the name of the patient Oh Baek-ryeon?
-Yes.

357
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,044
We'll begin the skull fracture surgery.
Hand me the scalpel.

358
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,348
I'm sorry.
I missed her while I was on the phone.

359
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,031
Burr.

360
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,816
I like that man.

361
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,818
I got it.

362
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,152
I got it!

363
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,403
I got my love.

364
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,293
Oh, no!

365
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,442
I will meet him

366
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,861
no matter what.

367
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,969
Her blood pressure is dropping.

368
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,058
Suction.

369
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,355
-Prepare blood and replenish the fluid.
-Okay.

370
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,664
Gauze.

371
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,291
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

372
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,601
Ms. Oh.

373
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,269
Ms. Oh.

374
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,063
Ms. Oh.

375
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,107
Ms. Oh.

376
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,156
-Hey.
-She's up.

377
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,033
Hey, are you okay?

378
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,662
Where am I?

379
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
Ms. Oh.

380
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,373
You hurt your head.

381
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:16,044
We performed a surgery
to repair a skull fracture.

382
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,176
Do you remember what happened?

383
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,265
Do you remember where it happened?

384
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,143
Where was it?

385
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,190
It was by a water mill.

386
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,567
What?

387
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,446
By a water mill?

388
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,490
Do they still have water mills these days?

389
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,367
Do they?

390
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,168
Was it by a water mill?
What were you doing there?

391
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,427
My wedding night.

392
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,057
I spent my wedding night there.

393
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,727
With an angel with wings.

394
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,271
-An angel?
-An angel?

395
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,652
What's wrong with you?

396
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,491
That night, the moon was so bright.

397
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,285
I went inside the water mill.

398
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,456
His lips slowly approached mine…

399
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,042
and he kissed me.

400
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,756
Then he undressed me.

401
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,051
-Then we--
-Stop.

402
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,302
That's enough.

403
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,889
Sweat.

404
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,307
The sound of our breaths.

405
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,103
The sound of the water mill turning.

406
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,863
I was about to see his face.

407
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,575
I was going to see the face
of the man I loved.

408
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,702
Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh.

409
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,704
It all had to stop
because someone called me.

410
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,209
Well…

411
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,880
Who was it?
Who called my name at that moment?

412
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,257
Was it you?

413
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,424
-No.
-Wait.

414
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,884
It was a man's voice.

415
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,679
Was it you?

416
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,058
-Was it you?
-It wasn't…

417
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,811
Who called my name?

418
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,772
We were in the middle of making rounds.

419
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,440
-Right, sir.
-Let's go to the next room.

420
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,817
-Let's go.
-Okay.

421
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,529
I only saw the body of the angel
who spent the night with me.

422
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,295
I think she may have glimpsed
the afterlife for a moment.

423
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,338
The afterlife?

424
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,718
She said she saw an angel.

425
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,886
Oh, that's…

426
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,184
There were some dangerous moments
during the operation.

427
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,937
That's probably when the angel came.

428
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,987
I guess he comforted her
passionately then.

429
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,989
That must be the case.

430
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:38,038
Yes, I think you're right.

431
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,540
Afterlife.

432
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,375
Angel.

433
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,212
Why did he wake me up at that moment?

434
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,215
You should rest now.

435
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,136
Will I see him again
if I fall back asleep?

436
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,096
Why am I not sleepy?

437
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,849
Geez.

438
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,079
Dong-chil.

439
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:23,291
What do you think you need the most
when you are in love?

440
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,752
I'm not sure.

441
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,005
What you need the most…

442
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,174
It's courage.

443
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,888
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

444
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,728
Eun-seo.

445
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,151
Eun-seo.

446
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:02,914
She was found in an abandoned factory
in Oseong, Gyeonggi-do.

447
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,375
Why is her body so swollen?

448
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,379
She was abandoned
in a barrel full of water.

449
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,096
The decomposition is quite advanced.

450
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,599
But do you agree to do the autopsy?

451
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,520
Sir, we heard the body was abandoned
in a barrel. Is that correct?

452
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,063
Why did the witness go there?

453
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,941
Oseong.

454
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,821
It's where the clothes of Yoo Jeong-ah
who went missing in 1993 were found.

455
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,905
Right?

456
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:37,907
-Oseong?
-Oseong?

457
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:40,327
MISSING WOMAN FOUND DEAD
IN OSEONG, GYEONGGI-DO

458
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,156
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary or strange?

459
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,284
I don't think so.
It was the same as usual.

460
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,579
How many businesses are tenants
in this building?

461
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,039
There are a total of three companies.

462
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,499
-Three companies?
-Yes.

463
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,667
Also, please send me
the security camera footage

464
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,586
from that side
and the one on the other side.

465
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,381
KOREA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

466
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,357
-Ms. Oh, are you asleep?
-Who is it?

467
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,069
It's me, Seo Jae-hee.

468
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,071
I'm closing my eyes because I'm sleeping.

469
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,323
-So, why are you asking me if I'm asleep?
-Huh?

470
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:02,992
I…

471
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:11,292
Sir, you should stay away
from her for the time being too.

472
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,670
We're scared of her too right now.

473
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,850
I really thought the text
was from Eun-seo,

474
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,185
because I gave her my number.

475
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,187
Do you remember anything from that night?

476
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,494
It was too dark.

477
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,205
Right. Don't push yourself.

478
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,541
You should recover first.

479
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,339
It's time for the patient to eat.

480
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,175
Okay, thank you.

481
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,342
Enjoy.

482
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,928
-You should eat.
-No. I want to sleep.

483
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,265
Eat. You need to eat to get better.
Why do you keep sleeping?

484
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,602
I just want to sleep.
Hospital food isn't even good.

485
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,563
Hey, you don't eat hospital food
for the taste. You eat it to get better.

486
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,772
Eat it right now.

487
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:19,277
Or if there's anything you want to eat,
I can make it for you.

488
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,822
Sang-hyuk, do you even know how to cook?

489
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,533
Yes.

490
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,549
It's been a while since I saw you cook.

491
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,135
You finally came to your senses.

492
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,722
-Remove the anchovy guts.
-Me?

493
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,016
Who else? My hands are full.

494
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,976
Remove them right now!

495
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,176
Shouldn't Dong-gu eat with us?

496
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,723
You can bring him down.

497
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,351
Yeah, that's a good idea.

498
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,437
It's been a while since the four of us
ate a meal together.

499
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,148
Dong-gu! Dong-gu!

500
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,750
Dong-gu!

501
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,753
Cheon Dong-gu! Dong-gu! Let's eat.

502
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,048
Hey!

503
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,024
Hey, get Dong-gu!

504
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,568
-Stop right there.
-Is that Dong-gu?

505
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,283
Goodness, what's wrong with him?

506
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,829
Hey!

507
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,042
Hey, hurry!

508
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,266
-Where did he go?
-I can't believe we missed Dong-gu.

509
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,978
Hey, his scent. See if you can smell him.

510
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,063
-Smell?
-Yes.

511
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,817
I don't smell anything.

512
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,155
Damn it. Where on earth did he go?

513
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,323
It's so obvious.

514
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,201
It's that dating agency that said
he'll find a girl in three months.

515
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,787
-Shall we go there?
-Forget it. It's three months.

516
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,331
We just need to leave before that.

517
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,751
Let's go.

518
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,824
Did you run here? My goodness.

519
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,867
Wipe your sweat with this.

520
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,331
GETTING TO KNOW MYSELF

521
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,502
Thank you.

522
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,550
I should marry her.

523
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,991
Wasn't there a lot of food here earlier?

524
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,827
Gosh, these punks.

525
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,223
Baek-ryeon. Baek-ryeon.

526
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,308
Baek-ryeon!

527
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,649
Ta-da! Get up. You should eat.

528
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:13,529
I said I don't want to eat!
Why do you keep waking me up?

529
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,790
Damn it.

530
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,502
-Do you want to eat?
-Well…

531
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,297
I'd rather eat in peace.

532
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,633
-I'll eat on my own.
-I think there's more than enough.

533
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,551
-She said she doesn't want to eat.
-No. I'm good.

534
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:37,512
Geez.

535
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,015
Damn it.

536
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,142
I was so close to seeing his face.

537
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,314
Would you like some yeonpo-tang instead?

538
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,199
Let me go back to sleep.

539
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:05,581
We found some bleaching ingredients
like hypochlorous acid in the barrel.

540
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,250
Bleaching ingredients?

541
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,043
Fingerprints and DNA.

542
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,294
They're all gone.

543
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:16,342
I'm a little suspicious about the swelling
of the body though.

544
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,264
I don't think he abandoned the body
in the barrel right after the murder.

545
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:25,226
I'll have to look into it more,
but I think she was dead

546
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,396
five days at most
before her body was found.

547
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:41,284
Why do you want to know
what your angel boyfriend looks like?

548
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:45,079
I married him and we spent our wedding
night together in the past life.

549
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,541
-Of course I want to see his face.
-He's in the past.

550
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,127
-The man from the past.
-It was so intense.

551
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,336
That wedding night…

552
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,629
Hey, Baek-ryeon.

553
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:57,174
Your current man is right here.
He brought food for you.

554
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,428
Gosh, what am I doing here?

555
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,806
I went grocery shopping
and brought all this food

556
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,559
for a woman who can't forget
her ex-boyfriend.

557
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,103
Just to make sure she gets better
so that she remembers her wedding night?

558
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,981
What is it with women?

559
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,524
You're different day and night.

560
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,234
You're different
on your wedding night too.

561
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,614
No. It's my fault.

562
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,575
You said you would fight against
your destiny.

563
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,911
I got swayed by your words. I'm the idiot.

564
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,829
Did you get swayed by my words?

565
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,626
I did?

566
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:33,961
You're being swayed right now too.

567
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,506
I am not. Hurry up and eat.

568
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,391
Don't forget to take your medicine
after your meal.

569
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:52,229
Can I wash my hair? It itches so much.

570
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:53,856
Let me take a look.

571
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,861
It's almost closed up.
You can gently wash your hair.

572
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,280
Try not to touch the wound with water.

573
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:04,200
-Someone has to help her.
-I'll help her.

574
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,245
How long have you not washed your hair?

575
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,582
I'll help her.
It looks like you hurt your finger.

576
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,670
I'm fine. This is nothing.

577
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,767
You're at the hospital 24 hours a day.

578
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,604
You made my higher-ups
work on the investigation

579
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,648
and joined my team to get the culprit.

580
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,567
What's more important
is Baek-ryeon's safety.

581
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:43,072
Hey. Do you think
the homicide unit is a joke?

582
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,324
You just come and go as you please. Geez.

583
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,076
I have to be by her side.

584
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:55,543
Wait.

585
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,588
You just had a scratch. Where did it go?

586
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,011
I saw it.

587
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,638
It was right there.

588
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,142
-It's not this finger.
-No, I saw it.

589
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,810
It was this side by your index finger.

590
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,229
It's not.

591
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,065
What…

592
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,622
Do you want me to tell you
how to meet the man of your destiny?

593
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,343
It's really good.

594
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:13,180
-Is he really going to…
-It will take about three months.

595
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,770
-That's right.
-Really?

596
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,064
That was hilarious.

597
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:51,760
On the day this tree blooms with flowers,

598
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:55,514
catch a falling flower petal
with your index finger

599
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,099
and hold it for just three seconds.

600
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,769
Then you'll see your love.

601
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,863
Please allow me to meet him.

602
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,408
Please allow me to meet him.

603
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,955
One, two, three.

604
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,771
I got it. I got my love.

605
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,491
It was you.

606
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,556
You're my man.

607
