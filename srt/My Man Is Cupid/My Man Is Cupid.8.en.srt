It's cold.

00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:44,754
Oh, my!

4
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,422
Who are you?

00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,926
DISEASE

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,764
What's this?

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,783
SEVEN SINS FOR WOMEN

00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,538

All the missing women
received red notebooks.

12
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,178
Gossip. Disobedience.

13
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,555
Inability to bear a male heir. Theft.

00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,645

00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,775
Gosh, it's snowing a lot.

16
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,987
You're looking at it again?
You'll be in trouble if you get caught.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,491
This case is why I became a cop.

18
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,411
Do you really think
it's Seven Sins for Women?

19
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,289
If it is, that means
there are three more cases.

20
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,458
The next one is…

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,798
Baby, drop by. I'll be nice.

22
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,842
-Baby, bye.
-Hey, come play with me.

23
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,594
-Hello.
-It's been long.

24
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,680
-I'll be nice.
-Let go of me.

00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,600
DISEASE

26
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,269
What does he want me to reflect on?

27
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,688
-Baby, come on.
-Hey, baby.

28
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,524
Take out your physical checkup reports
from today's health center visit.

29
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,151
Take the cards out.

30
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,405
Hey.

00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,826
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE

32
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,666
Yes, we're at 3-19.

00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,626
Hey, drop by.

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,879
All right, please come before you leave.

35
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:50,963
What is that?

36
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,676
Some crazy guy wanted me to reflect
on what I did in this red notebook.

37
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,969
Self-reflection notes?

38
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,722
He told me to fill the whole notebook.

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,267
Does he think he's my teacher? How dare
he tell me to reflect on what I did!

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,144
-I never listened to my teachers…
-Hey, wait.

41
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,437
-I was a rebel.
-What is it?

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,855
How dare…

43
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,109
-Hey, this is…
-Goodness.

44
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,737
Hey, handsome. Are you coming in?

45
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,823
You're totally my type.

46
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,992
Who gave this to you?

47
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:21,994
This?

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,542
-Why do you ask?
-Who gave it to you?

49
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,636
Damn it.

50
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,515
Come to Chowon Market right now! Hurry!

51
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:01,593
That's when I started
my 28th metamorphosis.

52
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,431
And I couldn't get the culprit in the end.

53
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,482
Sang-hyuk. Sang-hyuk.

54
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,475
But

55
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,602
Cheon Sang-hyuk is 29 years old.

56
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,521
How does he know about a case
that happened 29 years ago?

57
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,065
Of course, he knows it well.

58
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,112
That police officer who went missing
while investigating the case…

59
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,157
He was my father.

60
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,204
And…

61
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,789
SUSPECT SKETCH

62
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,290
…that's probably not what he looks like

63
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,752
if what I saw was right.

00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,229

JONGSEO POLICE STATION

66
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,899
I don't know.

67
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,193
Come on, Detective Park.

68
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,904
How come there is no update
on the missing case of Go Eun-seo?

69
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,364
Why can't you find her?

70
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,075
How would I know that?
It's Homicide Unit One's case.

71
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,745
All the witnesses are dead.

72
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,832
It must be related to the 1993
Polka Dot High School Girls case.

73
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,627
We didn't have to get help from him
if you had caught the culprit already.

74
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,588
Hey, Chief.

75
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,301
Chief.

76
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,511
Bye.

77
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,596
My goodness.

78
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,683
My gosh.

79
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,024
We found that damn red notebook.

80
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,112
But we can't share the status
of our investigation with a civilian

81
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,031
-whose identity is uncertain.
-His identity is not uncertain.

82
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,950
Can't you see that
he and I are very close?

83
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,160
My gosh.

84
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,496
If this is the same culprit
of the case in 1993,

85
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,998
we are all dead then.

86
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,084
You saw Reporter Song, right?
She's after that these days.

87
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,673
So focus on catching him
if you have time to complain.

88
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,659
You must've studied the 1993 case even
before you learned how to talk. A witness?

89
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,457
It's my father's case.
My missing father left me that.

90
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,421
I grew up reading this notebook.

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,551
I read this notebook endlessly
to know more about my father.

92
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,553
I also got to know who the culprit is.

93
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,765
"Why did he target those women?"

94
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,934
"Why that place? Why that day?"

95
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,101
"But why…"

96
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,520
"Why did he stop?"

97
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,858
When you keep following
a culprit's train of thought,

98
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,610
you feel like

99
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,946
you've become the culprit at one point.

100
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,662
I felt him then.

101
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,872
The day Baek-ryeon, the witness,

102
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,124
climbed up Inwangsan Mountain.

103
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,629
He was there on that day. However…

104
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,561
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,404
It wasn't human skin.

106
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,535
What do you mean it wasn't human skin?

107
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,995
Special effects makeup.

108
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,497
I think he has started to put on makeup.

109
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,435
-Excuse me.
-No!

110
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,478
Wait! Hold on!

111
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,856
I'm Detective Lee Ho-jin
from Jongseo Police Station!

112
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,733
-Goodness!
-I'm Detective Lee Ho-jin

113
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,026
from Jongseo Police Station!

114
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,449
What was that? Why were you following me?

115
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,159
He told me to follow you.

116
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,036
Who? Why?

117
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,872
Captain Seo told me to.
Why do you think? Come on.

118
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
My goodness.

119
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,463
You don't have to follow me.

120
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,965
-I have a bodyguard.
-I don't think so.

121
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,302
-You know him?
-Isn't it Mr. Cheon Sang-hyuk?

122
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,430
He's at the police station right now.

123
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,515
At the police station? Why?

124
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,394
He's helping with the investigation?

125
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,611
Why did you get so scared?

126
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,870
Come on!

127
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,627
Do-ra. Do men wear makeup too?

128
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,089
They do. A lot of men put on makeup
these days.

129
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,549
There are many guys who put on
better makeup than women.

130
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,469
It was very heavy.

131
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,389
His skin was very thick
as if he was wearing a mask.

132
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,182
-It was weird.
-Who?

133
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,018
-Well, that's…
-I get it.

134
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,311
His body is a man's.

135
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,106
But his soul is a woman's.
Maybe he's like that.

136
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,651
-Or he was a woman in his past life.
-A woman in his past life?

137
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,112
Maybe only half of it changed
when he was born again.

138
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,698
-Do you believe in the past life?
-I will believe in it only if I see mine.

139
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,285
I've seen it.

140
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,414
I saw my past life.

141
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,457
Okay. Breathe comfortably.

142
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,752
Let's take a look back at your memories.

143
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,930
In my past life

144
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,558
I was an angel.

145
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,811
-What on earth are you talking about?
-An angel?

146
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,658
A human born again with the same face.

147
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,706
What doesn't change
even if you're born again is…

148
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,833
your nature.

149
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,379
There is a reason why you're born again
with the same face.

150
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,090
-The reason is…
-This doesn't make sense.

151
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,093
You want us to work with him just
because he studied his father's notebook

152
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,845
who was a cop in 1994?

153
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,849
The culprit is just using the red notebook
because he knows about the case.

154
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,434
He's trying to confuse the police.

155
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,521
Shouldn't we investigate him first?

156
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,065
Now that I think about it,
there are many strange things about him.

157
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,402
He just shows up one day
and talks about Seven Sins for Women.

158
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,614
And he's always
with Baek-ryeon, the witness.

159
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,325
-Even his look is weird.
-His look? What about it?

160
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,827
He looks…

161
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,084
like a fairy.

162
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:20,342
A man's face can't be that small
unless he's a fairy. Is he a fairy?

163
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,642
That's enough. Let's stop now.

164
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,282
I'm going to speak casually
to you from now on.

165
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,369
If you're lying about this,
I'm going to make you pay.

166
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,497
It's all because of that red notebook
and the self-reflection note.

167
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,375
We'll find out soon if it's true or not.

168
00:13:55,377 --> 00:14:00,340
We'll see why you and I have
to work together like this.

169
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,346
-What?
-I was an angel in my past life.

170
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,267
An angel? You?

171
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,977
-I was.
-I don't think so.

172
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,436
-I'm quite sure.
-Why? How?

173
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,231
Wings. I saw my wings.

174
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,613
They were really big and shiny.

175
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,409
-Were you flying with your wings?
-No.

176
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,453
You weren't flying?
Then why do you think you were an angel?

177
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,997
There's a story behind this.

178
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,415
A story.

179
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,584
What kind of ridiculous story?

180
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,461
I was an angel who lost my wings
in my past life.

181
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,257
What I saw were my friend's wings.

182
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:48,013
For some reason, I almost died falling
because my wings were gone.

183
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,139
Right then,

184
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,641
my friend saved me.

185
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,650
After I got saved,
I wandered around Earth.

186
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,991
Then I fell in love with a king.

187
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,703
Even the Little Mermaid fell in love
with the prince

188
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,413
as soon as she got her legs.

189
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,333
-Right.
-So what if her voice was gone?

190
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,084
She was still pretty.

191
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,504
So what if my wings were gone?
I was still pretty like an angel.

192
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,258
And then

193
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,387
I got married to the king.

194
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,182
There was a bloodbath on my wedding day.

195
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,355
-Gosh, on such a good day?
-You still don't get it?

196
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,856
I don't.

197
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,858
"This wedding can't happen."

198
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,362
A prince from a neighboring country came.

199
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,365
Gosh, a love triangle.

200
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,034
-With a prince from a neighboring country.
-Right.

201
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,663
There was only one reason
the two countries fought.

202
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,247
What was the reason?

203
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,043
I was just too pretty.

204
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,838
So outdated.

205
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,049
Enough with your nonsense.

206
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:12,138
I must be so lonely right now
because of the karma from my past life.

207
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,688
Goodness. Hey, let's eat.

208
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,940
Should I heat up cheonggukjang?

209
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,109
An angel doesn't eat stuff
like cheonggukjang.

210
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,070
-An angel eats it.
-An angel eats cheonggukjang?

211
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,405
You love it so much.

212
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,950
You had three bowls of rice
with that and radish kimchi this morning.

213
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,243
You said you were an angel.

214
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,706
I'm going to be picky with my food
from now on.

215
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,333
An angel and cheonggukjang
don't go together.

216
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,210
Then what goes together?

217
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,336
DEW SOJU

218
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,589
Dew.

219
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,718
Now that I learned how sad and beautiful
my past life was,

220
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,302
I need a drink

221
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,638
with a drop of my tear.

222
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,683
Do you want to mix it
with something else too?

223
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,395
-I'll miss you if I go back up to the sky.
-Any food with that?

224
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,397
-Beef tripes?
-I'll really miss you.

225
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,649
-How about jokbal?
-I love you, Do-ra.

226
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,317
-Spicy jokbal, yes?
-Yes.

227
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,181
By the way,

228
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,391
there is this one strange thing.

229
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,352
You think it's just strange?

230
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,813
-Everything is so strange.
-It was definitely

231
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,859
heart-fluttering and exciting.

232
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,612
I was so happy too.

233
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,823
But on my wedding day

234
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,743
I was sad.

235
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,037
I was hurt.

236
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,747
Of course.

237
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:07,045
Based on what you said,
an angel fell in love with her first love

238
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,506
as soon as she was stuck here.

239
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,052
So, you must have thought that
it was unfair. You must've been scared.

240
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,138
Since you were stuck here anyway,

241
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,267
you should have dated at least 3,000 men

242
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:27,190
to realize that life on earth is fun
and that you fully enjoyed life.

243
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,486
But if the king was the only man
in your life,

244
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,112
then it must've been a total bummer.

245
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,573
You were scared because
you felt like you were missing out.

246
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,576
Right.

247
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,287
That was why.

248
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,791
-Right.
-That's why I was sad.

249
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,131
He stopped committing crimes for 28 years.

250
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,219
But why did he start doing it again?

251
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,438
It seemed like you two have gotten closer.
You even hugged each other.

252
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,692
Are you following me?

253
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,986
Are you ashamed that you got caught?

254
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,370
Thank you. Goodbye!

255
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,163
Bye, then.

256
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,751
URGENTLY LOOKING
FOR DATING ACADEMY INSTRUCTOR

257
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,796
Who are all these poor souls

258
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,801
who spend money on this crap?

259
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,761
This is all marketing.

260
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,638
What are you doing?

261
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,143
It'll be good content.

262
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,896
I should take a look around.

263
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,691
I should work part-time here
to do some research.

264
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,444
-It's delicious.
-Hey.

265
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:59,407
How did it go with the man you're destined
to be with? Are you still seeing him?

266
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,621
The man I'm destined to be with?
Was there such a thing?

267
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,206
You worked hard to meet him
for several years.

268
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,126
Why are you suddenly pretending
like you don't know who I'm talking about?

269
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,712
Do-ra.

270
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,257
Actually

271
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,470
that king from my past life…

272
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,600
Never mind.

273
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,478
-Finish your sentence.
-Do-ra.

274
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,481
I decided to fight against my fate.

275
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,066
I have

276
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,236
a boyfriend now!

277
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,494
Maybe you forgot.

278
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,289
You're about to leave. You will be gone.

279
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,916
I know.

280
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,293
Then what are you doing with the vet?

281
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,378
What do you mean?

282
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,674
-She saw the culprit.
-You want to get the culprit,

283
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,342
and have fun with your girlfriend too?

284
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,553
What if that vet falls for you?

285
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,223
Thanks for your concern,
but I can take care of myself.

286
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,601
You already know the answer to that.

287
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,812
That thing you have.

288
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,648
One shot of that will do.

289
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,900
There's only one reason you can't,
even though you know you should.

290
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,236
Should I do it?

291
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,912
-Superman is your boyfriend?
-Yes.

292
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:33,626
Mr. Superman hugged me last night.

293
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,800
He hugged me tightly.

294
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,594
It was totally manly.

295
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,722
Like this.

296
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,473
Did he ask you out?

297
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,601
He didn't ask me out.
But it's the same thing.

298
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,107
Don't you remember
what Superman said here last time?

299
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,234
I don't like her. I don't like her at all.

300
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,028
I swear I don't like her at all.

301
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,030
I remember.

302
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,197
All right.

303
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,992
On my "Dear Ahn Do-ra" segment
where I give life advice,

304
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,328
there's something people come to me the
most for my advice. You know what it is?

305
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,040
"We held hands. But he won't ask me out."

306
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,666
"We hugged. But he won't ask me out."

307
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,003
"We even kissed. But he won't ask me out."

308
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,796
"We even slept together.

309
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,050
But this jerk refuses to ask out."

310
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,803
"What do you think is going on?"
What do you think?

311
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,681
He got caught up in the mood
and the feelings at that moment

312
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,224
so he held your hand and hugged you.

313
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,727
He kissed you and even slept with you.

314
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,479
But when he gets up the next day,
he thinks,

315
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,980
"Goodness, why did I do this?"

316
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,524
And he regrets everything.

317
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,027
That's why he refuses to ask you out.

318
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,946
He hugged you last night?

319
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,698
-Did he call you that night?
-No.

320
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,075
-How about last night?
-Nothing.

321
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,326
What about tonight?

322
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,037
Let me check.

323
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,542
CALL HISTORY

324
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,255
He didn't call me today either.

325
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,351
You already know the answer to that.

326
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,228
That thing you have.

327
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,105
One shot of that will do.

328
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,249
"What are you doing?"

329
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,508
Why aren't you calling me?

330
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,933
That night, we…

331
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:07,196
The police told me to drop by tomorrow.

332
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,031
You'll come pick me up, right?

333
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,833
JONGSEO POLICE STATION

334
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,047
HOMICIDE UNIT ONE

335
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,177
Did you ask Baek-ryeon
to drop by the police station today?

336
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,346
-Did you?
-No, sir.

337
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,851
-I didn't call her.
-She already gave her statement.

338
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,153
Is Mr. Lee Ho-jin reliable
as a witness protector?

339
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,949
He'll do better than you. Don't worry.

340
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,451
He's been trained for years.

341
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,953
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

342
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,924
What's with her?

343
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,450
It's one of the two.

344
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,328
Either he's taken or married.

345
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,163
I guess he's taken.

346
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,543
That's why he wanted to set you up
with your ideal type.

347
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,921
He came up with all those excuses
to come and see you.

348
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,423
And you fell for his tricks.

349
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,843
End things with him
before your feelings grow deeper.

350
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,053
End it with him?

351
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,556
What other choice do you have?
Will you steal him away?

352
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,809
No.

353
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,561
Maybe he's not taken.

354
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,729
Keep calling him.

355
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:08,943
If he keeps avoiding your calls,
it means he's with his wife for sure.

356
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,574
The first victim of "Gossip".

357
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,202
Ms. Hong Ae-kyeong, 51-year-old,
from Changsin-dong.

358
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,830
She was the director at Angel Orphanage
in Changsin-dong, Jongseo-gu

359
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,998
when she went missing.

360
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,874
All right, let's take a photo.

361
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,086
Her sponsors trusted her
because she was eloquent.

362
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,088
She frequently appeared on media.

363
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,216
She went missing
when there was a fire at the orphanage.

364
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,053
But all her belongings were still there.

365
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,472
GOSSIP

366
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,141
The second victim of "Disobedience".

367
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,643
Ms. Jang Mi-ok, 37-year-old,
of Dongsung-dong.

368
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,188
You call this clean?

369
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,815
What have you been doing?

370
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:52,278
You drive me crazy. Goodness.

371
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,866
How filthy.

372
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,368
Her mother-in-law treated her very badly.

373
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,162
But when her mother-in-law couldn't walk,

374
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,372
she got back at her
in many different ways.

375
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,751
The third victim of
"Inability to bear a male heir".

376
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,252
Ms. Park So-yeong, 35-year-old,
of Cheongun-dong.

377
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,504
She was a team leader
at a large corporation.

378
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,799
She had conflicts with her husband
regarding her pregnancy.

379
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,103
Likewise, after receiving
the red notebook, she ignored it.

380
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,980
And she went missing the next day.

381
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,944
MS. OH BAEK-RYEON

382
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,200
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

383
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,160
Please leave a message after the beep.

384
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,745
Why doesn't he pick up?

385
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,706
No way…

386
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,834
There is no way…

387
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,837
The fourth victims of "Theft".

388
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,257
You all know them well,
18-year-olds Ms. Song Da-hee

389
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,677
and Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah of Sungin-dong.
And the fifth victim.

390
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,763
She's under "Adultery".

391
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,599
Ms. Go Eun-seo, 47-year-old,
from Sungin-dong.

392
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,185
That's strange.

393
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,314
He hasn't done anything for 28 years.
Why start it again now?

394
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,274
That would be the key to the reason

395
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,403
why he stopped it for 28 years
after the attempted case of "Disease".

396
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,493
I'm guessing "Disease" and "Jealousy"
will be pushed to next year.

397
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,746
I don't think it will be snowing
for a while.

398
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,081
No, it's different this time.

399
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,001
There was an unexpected variable.

400
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,628
And that is…

401
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,882
Baek-ryeon, the witness who's still alive.

402
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,558
OH BAEK-RYEON
LAST PERSON SEEN WITH GO EUN-SEO

403
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,643
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

404
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,445
HOPE, LOVE, HAPPINESS, FAITH

405
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,447
It all burned down in a fire.

406
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,074
-That's all we have for records from 1993.
-I see.

407
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,410
1993 ANGEL ORPHANAGE
FAMILY RECORDS

408
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,666
Excuse me.

409
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,627
Haven't we met before?

410
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,630
No. It's my first time seeing you.

411
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,259
I think it was

412
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,760
maybe about a year after the fire.

413
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,347
You look a lot like the police officer
who came here then.

414
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,184
You must remember things well.

415
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,644
How can you remember someone
you saw 28 years ago?

416
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,688
He came here a lot.

417
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,191
He was very memorable too.

418
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,571
How was her relationship with the kids?

419
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,533
The way she treated kids was
quite aggressive.

420
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,511
Your fling isn't asking you out?

421
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:07,431
You held hands and kissed.
You did everything together.

422
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,892
He doesn't get back to you right away.
Of course, you feel anxious.

423
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,519
You think he's playing around.

424
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,230
It drives you crazy. You're going nuts.

425
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,733
But if you want things to work out
with your fling, you have to stop there.

426
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,704
You have to stop right there.

427
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,874
You're about to go out of control.
Don't be like that. Just stop.

428
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,310
Speaking of which,
I'll give you three tips

429
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,772
on what not to do and say with your fling.

430
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,191
She gave her witness statement.
Why is she here again?

431
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,735
She said she had to witness a guy here.

432
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,070
If she had to witness--

433
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,248
Ms. Oh?

434
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,753
What? What's wrong with you?

435
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,801
-You don't look happy to see me.
-Well…

436
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,096
I heard that you come here every day.

437
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,056
I came here to see you.

438
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,227
Can we have a word? Follow me.

439
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,113
What's going on?

440
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:48,866
Detective Seo Jae-hee.

441
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,452
-Yes, I'm here.
-Detective Seo.

442
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,370
You have a delivery.

443
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,247
Thank you.

444
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,376
BULLET DELIVERY SERVICE

445
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:07,968
TO: DETECTIVE SEO JAE-HEE
FROM: GO JEONG-HO

446
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,895
So you're alive.

447
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:22,066
You didn't text me back or get my calls.
I thought you were dead.

448
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,276
Cheon Sang-hyuk.

449
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,195
Are you married?

450
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,363
What?

451
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,657
-No.
-Are you sure?

452
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,909
Yes, I'm sure.

453
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,745
Then do you have a girlfriend?

454
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,330
-No.
-No girlfriend too?

455
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,457
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

456
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,168
Then…

457
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:45,005
When you're having a fling,
please don't do this. I beg you.

458
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,465
Please don't say this.

459
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,262
What are we?

460
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,432
"What are we?"

461
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,142
I TOTALLY AGREE
THAT'S THE WORST

462
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,979
So, you held hands. You kissed.

463
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,941
Then you want to be clear
with where you two stand.

464
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,859
That will just make the guy hide.

465
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,986
I asked, what are we?

466
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:12,116
What if she falls for you?

467
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,499
Sang-hyuk.

468
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,210
I really didn't want to say this.

469
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,507
But you hugged me the other night.
It wasn't a goodbye hug.

470
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,427
You hugged me really tightly.

471
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,807
The way you hugged me, doesn't that mean
there's something going on between us?

472
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,184
Is it just me or has the world changed?

473
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,439
And you tell him,
"You have to own up to what you did."

474
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,566
Own up to what you did!

475
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,192
SO EMBARRASSING

476
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,360
TOTALLY AGREE

477
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,905
Why aren't you saying something?
"I hugged you that night because of this."

478
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,699
-Tell me.
-A motorcycle.

479
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,493
It was heading at you from the back.
It looked dangerous.

480
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,709
You hugged me because of a motorcycle?

481
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,380
Why didn't you just push me?

482
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,291
Haven't we met before?

483
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,169
I think it was maybe about
a year after the fire.

484
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,713
You look a lot like the police officer
who visited then.

485
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:57,971
What's with him?

486
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,187
So you are saying…

487
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,149
There is nothing going on between us.

488
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,444
Baek-ryeon.

489
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,997
Also, don't do this
when you're having a fling.

490
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,041
Don't try to make the guy jealous.

491
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,502
I guess I should go home
with the police tonight.

492
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,131
-You will take me home, right?
-What?

493
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:37,177
I won't get hit by a motorcycle and die
if I'm with a police officer.

494
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,429
Let's go.

495
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,766
Go? Where?

496
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,229
I have a fantasy about police cars.

497
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,481
What's the inside like?

498
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,402
Do you want to know?

499
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,490
Get in the car.
I'll show you everything tonight.

500
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,368
I'm so excited.

501
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,683
Excited?

502
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,643
Excited about what?

503
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,606
I have a fantasy about handcuffs, too.

504
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,860
My dream came true,
thanks to you, Detective Seo.

505
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:36,570
Did it?

506
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,739
I should have worn my uniform too.

507
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,282
Goodness, your uniform?

508
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,367
It's perfect.

509
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,454
It's perfect.

510
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,470
Did you first meet Sang-hyuk
at the animal hospital?

511
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:03,805
Pardon?

512
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,975
Do you know him well?

513
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,274
I don't know.

514
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,610
I really don't.

515
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,864
I thought I knew him well.
But I realized I don't.

516
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:38,382
You can use me whenever you want
if you need to stay distant from him.

517
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,054
-But promise me one thing.
-Promise?

518
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,931
Don't give your heart to him just yet.

519
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,933
Save it for now.

520
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,517
-What?
-Good night, Baek-ryeon.

521
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,396
The third thing you shouldn't do
when you're having a fling is…

522
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,648
play hard to get through texts.

523
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,693
SUPERMAN

524
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,688
You already saw his texts on the pop-up.
But if you reply him late…

525
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,283
SUPERMAN

526
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,035
Good night to you too, Sang-hyuk.

527
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,667
AFTER 30 MINUTES

528
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,462
AFTER ONE HOUR

529
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,341
AFTER TWO HOURS

530
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,929
AFTER THREE HOURS

531
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,392
Well, it could be six or 12 hours.
A day or two.

532
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,729
ALARM

533
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,066
Then you just two grow apart like that.

534
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,150
Forever.

535
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,318
THAT'S WHY IT'S A FLING

536
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,322
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?- UNREAD

537
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,077
24 HOURS LATER

538
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,622
Hey, let's not date guys like him.

539
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,041
So he doesn't have a girlfriend.

540
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,418
He's not married either.
But he's acting like this?

541
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,505
Just ignore him. What is he thinking?

542
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,632
He's unbelievable!

543
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,759
But I'm attracted to him.

544
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:30,804
I know.

545
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,639
It's stupid.

546
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,815
-What else do you want to have it with?
-Perilla leaf?

547
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,278
But…

548
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,198
no matter how hard I work…

549
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,285
-Enjoy your meal.
-Take your time.

550
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,579
-What was it again?
-Is it what you told me?

551
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,622
-What?
-Even when I'm eating…

552
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,293
-Even when I'm standing…
-Oh, gosh.

553
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,211
Oh, my.

554
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,922
That place looks so good.

555
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,799
Even when I'm sitting…

556
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,094
I can't stop thinking about him.

557
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:17,684
I know, in my head, that this isn't right.
Logically, it's not right.

558
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,565
UNREAD

559
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,775
I wish I could control my feelings.

560
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:27,903
I'm…

561
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,156
the man you've been waiting for.

562
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,284
Does this mean that I like him?

563
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,121
Even if he was an alien,

564
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,623
a ghost…

565
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,376
a monster

566
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,255
or a terrible criminal,
I think I'll still like him.

567
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:51,301
Goodness, what am I going to do with you?

568
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,305
I feel bad for you, Baek-ryeon.

569
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,863
-Hello.
-Am I speaking to Ms. Ahn Do-ra?

570
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,658
This is Bang Myeong-soo Dating Academy.

571
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,992
Where?

572
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:20,372
I should work part-time here
to do some research.

573
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,540
Oh, right.

574
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,752
I did apply for the job.

575
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,755
Today?

576
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,676
We rushed to post the job opening because
the director got into a car accident.

577
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,094
There could be some complaints

578
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,096
about changing the instructor
without prior notice.

579
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,681
I'll take care of it.

580
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,933
AMATEUR WHEN YOU ENTER
EXPERT WHEN YOU LEAVE

581
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,688
-So are they the poor souls?
-Yes.

582
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:49,609
It's funny how 27 students
out of 30 suddenly have girlfriends.

583
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:53,071
I know that the director's lecture
is excellent.

584
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,073
But they got girlfriends
after just two lectures.

585
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,119
Then those remaining three…

586
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,624
CASANOVA'S SECRET

587
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,012
If you were a woman,
would you date a guy like you?

588
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,722
What?

589
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,057
Well…

590
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,142
I think…

591
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,352
I'm not sure.

592
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,896
I don't know.

593
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,231
Right.

594
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,234
-What about you?
-Sorry?

595
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,944
Me?

596
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,530
No.

597
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,287
What about you?

598
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,375
I think I'd definitely date a guy like me.

599
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,712
-Why is that?
-It's because I'm cool.

600
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,508
-Which part?
-I got big eyes.

601
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,635
My nose and mouth are big too.

602
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,306
You think it's cool if everything is big?

603
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,058
Isn't that a good thing?

604
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,018
The bigger the better.

605
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,354
THE BIGGER THE BETTER

606
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,190
Yes, in some cases.

607
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:14,569
I really don't understand female humans.

608
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,948
-Female humans?
-The world I came from wasn't like this.

609
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,410
What do you mean by that?

610
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,581
We don't judge people by their looks.

611
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,707
People only cared…

612
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,419
about their feelings there.

613
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,090
We see the sky, the moon, and the stars

614
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,468
as well as flowers, trees, animals, and
plants even the fish through your heart.

615
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,846
Even the fireflies
are considered beautiful there.

616
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,349
It's full of rainbow drops.

617
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,769
Over the hill, you have hope and dreams.

618
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,854
And love too!

619
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,815
You know what I was there?

620
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,698
I was a fairy.

621
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,290
-A fairy?
-That's right.

622
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,544
I wasn't Cheon Dong-gu.

623
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,629
I was Fairy 127.

624
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,881
Where is that place you're talking about?

625
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,141
What's with this man?

626
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,476
Is he a lunatic?

627
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,770
I am from up there.

628
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,648
What? Is it a trend these days?

629
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:37,944
There is a female human

630
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:41,823
whom I think will connect
very well with you.

631
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,491
She calls herself an angel too.

632
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,577
-An angel?
-An angel?

633
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,831
She said she came from up there too.
She said she lost her wings.

634
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,541
An angel?

635
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:56,546
You mean there is an angel in this world?

636
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:01,092
I just learned today
that fairies exist in this world.

637
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,637
An angel?

638
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,865
I want to see it with him.

639
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,965
Why are you drinking by yourself?
It's boring to drink alone.

640
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,765
Here.

641
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,608
That's nice.

642
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,819
You're supposed to choke
when you drink that.

643
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,364
What? What are you talking about?

644
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,453
All the guys who approached me
were like that.

645
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,499
One choked while drinking cold water.

646
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,292
Another got randomly struck by lightning.

647
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,878
And one nearly died
from excessive bleeding

648
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:22,131
because he fell on his back
and broke his nose.

649
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,551
But then…

650
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,643
Are we really destined to be together?

651
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,743
Destined?

652
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,481
-Thank you.
-Sure.

653
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,359
-Soju and beer?
-Soju and beer.

654
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,904
You already know the answer to that.

655
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,955
Watch.

656
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:37,957
Pour me some.

657
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,845
Happy birthday.

658
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:02,815
It's a good mix.

659
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:11,658
-What?
-Goodness.

660
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,159
-Hello.
-Hi. Oh, my gosh.

661
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,120
My goodness.

662
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,705
What happened?

663
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,624
-My gosh, this girl.
-Goodness.

664
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,378
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

665
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,712
What's going on?

666
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,882
Did she drink a lot?

667
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,134
She drank five bottles of soju and beer.

668
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,680
You mean five bottles of soju
and five bottles of beer?

669
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:34,972
Ten bottles in total?

670
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,558
I should have stopped her. I'm sorry.

671
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,185
Goodness, no.

672
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,646
Didn't she do anything to you?

673
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,939
To me?

674
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,233
So she didn't. All right.

675
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,319
Thank you so much for bringing her home.

676
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,948
-Okay, I'll get going.
-Bye.

677
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,368
Unbelievable.

678
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,120
-Goodness. Thank you.
-Sure, bye.

679
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,454
Bye.

680
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,189
Hey!

681
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,651
My goodness!

682
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:37,410
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached. Please leave a message…

683
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:43,332
Hey, Superman. I'm outside right now.

684
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,710
It's late, and I'm all alone.

685
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,755
Oh, no. The culprit might be watching me.

686
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,215
Tell me your address right now.

687
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,596
If you don't, I'll just stay here
so the culprit can take me.

688
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:01,768
The cherry blossoms are falling like snow.
I wouldn't know if he'd come now.

689
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,648
Taxi! Good timing.

690
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,577
Damn it!

691
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,594
Oh, man.

692
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:23,850
Geez.

693
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,978
Do-ra!

694
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,983
I feel sick.

695
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,860
Please give me hangover soup.

696
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,614
Drink this all first.

697
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,131
Shall we talk
about what happened last night?

698
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,009
Last night? What?

699
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,929
I clearly remember that
at 11:55 p.m. last night,

700
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,849
Detective Seo brought you home.

701
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,438
-I'll get going then.
-Bye.

702
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,983
But an hour later, at 12:55 a.m…

703
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,652
-Goodness.
-Hello.

704
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:17,862
-Hi.
-I'm here, again.

705
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,197
Another man handed you over.

706
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,534
Another man? What are you talking about?

707
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,203
Superman brought you home.

708
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,164
You mean Sang-hyuk?

709
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,250
What are you talking about?
I drank with Detective Seo last night.

710
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,587
Superman's face was all pale.

711
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,673
-What did you do to him?
-I didn't do anything.

712
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,095
Mr. Superman!

713
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,848
You know what?

714
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:47,642
I'm an angel.

715
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,936
Here.

716
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,688
I had wings on my back.

717
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,191
Here as well.

718
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,196
Baek-ryeon.

719
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,497
How many times do I have to tell you
to be careful when you drink?

720
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,502
You show your affection to just anyone
when you drink more than five bottles.

721
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,838
What?

722
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,299
Don't tell me…

723
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,887
You should be honored.

724
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:27,640
This is from an angel…

725
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,186
Oh, no!

726
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,191
Did you do it? You kissed him?

727
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,110
Which one was it?

728
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,987
Was it the detective or Superman?

729
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:42,697
Ms. Oh Baek-ryeon!

730
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,367
Why did you do that?
Why did you kiss him without permission?

731
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,119
I'm so sorry.

732
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,954
Don't think that men and women
are different.

733
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,165
You thought I'd be honored
if a pretty girl kisses me like that?

734
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:58,337
What you did to me last night
is clearly a molestation.

735
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,716
I have no excuse. I'm really sorry.

736
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:02,967
But please don't sue me.

737
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,051
No.

738
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,220
Please indict her
so she learns her lesson.

739
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,973
Let's do that. I'm so disappointed.
I can't believe I liked her.

00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,574
When will we get the results?

744
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,910
We're a little backlogged.

745
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,873
I'll call you as soon as I can.

746
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:35,624
Okay.

747
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,010
Ms. Oh.

748
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:51,265
We'll go back to 12 a.m. last night.

749
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,143
You're very drunk! Get down right now.

750
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,644
In my past life,

751
00:55:56,395 --> 00:56:02,276
a war broke out
because two men were fighting over me.

752
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,404
-That's who I am.
-Right.

753
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,822
A war, okay. Get down.

754
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,949
Come on.

755
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,160
Okay.

756
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,883
You should be honored.

757
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,680
This is a kiss from an angel.

758
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,889
Detective! Goodness!

759
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:15,808
-Gosh!
-Hold on!

760
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,476
All right, get inside.

761
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,686
Detective, I'm the victim!

762
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,982
They were having an affair!

763
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,942
Have a seat first. Come on!

764
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,444
Geez!

765
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,988
All right.

766
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,448
-Please keep it down.
-Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

767
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,870
How could you do this to me?

768
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,498
Don't just beg him to love you.

769
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,625
You should lose some weight instead.

770
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,170
Do you think he'd want
to hug a body like that?

771
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,504
You bitch!

772
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:46,630
Damn you!

773
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,472
-Move, Detective! Please, Detective!
-Ma'am!

774
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,686
-Detective!
-Stop, stop!

775
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,574
Please move, Detective!
I told you that I'm the victim!

776
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,535
-Wait! Detective!
-It's okay.

Come here!

779
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,056
Honey, I love you.

780
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,185
I was out of my mind.

781
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:25,854
I love your fat belly and your plump arms.

782
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:27,898
I love you so much.

783
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,359
These young women don't have this.
It's the symbol of hard work.

784
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,533
Honey, you finally came back
to your senses!

785
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,536
You're finally--

786
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,207
-Honey, it hurts over here.
-It hurts there.

787
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,961
-It hurts here too.
-Are you crazy?

788
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,587
Have you lost your mind?

789
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,267
Don't move.

790
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:36,842
Why did I see that?

791
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,472
Why did I see this place?

792
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,435
You…

793
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,646
Who are you?

794
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,293
You're very drunk. Get down right now.
Come on.

795
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,544
In my past life,

796
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:18,258
a war broke out
because two men were fighting over me.

797
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:21,178
That's who I am.

798
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,222
Right, a war. Get down.

799
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,015
Come on.

800
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,032
You should be honored.

801
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,161
This is a kiss from an angel.

802
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,617
My dear friend.

803
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,329
You are in love.

804
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,873
You are suffering

805
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:14,875
from a new pain.

806
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:18,962
It's getting darker in your head.

807
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:23,217
But it's getting brighter in your heart.

808
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,761
My dear friend.

809
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,598
You are in love.

810
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:34,186
You may not acknowledge your feelings,

811
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,731
but I can already see

812
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,735
under your vest

813
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,071
that your heart's on fire.
