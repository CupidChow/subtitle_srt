1
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,015
Just like that,

2
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,059
as wild grass,

3
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,770
a wild flower,

4
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,439
a bug

5
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,275
and a butterfly…

6
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,071
you were on your way to me.

7
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,241
Without resting.

8
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,911
With everything you have.

9
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,381
You can refuse me 100 times.
I'll just confess 101 times.

10
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,049
-You smell nice.
-You smell nice.

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,052
-Buy me the wheat flour tteokbokki I like.
-Bought me wheat tteokbokki.

12
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,180
-An angel with wings.
-I saw him when I counted to three.

13
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,111
Who was that? Was it Dong-gu again?

14
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,139
Detective Seo?

15
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,769
Listen to me carefully.

16
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,480
I know it's hard to believe,
but you have to.

17
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,275
-What's wrong? You're scaring me.
-Oh Baek-ryeon.

18
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,945
I have to protect you.

19
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,122
WITNESS TESTIMONY
(OH BAEK-RYEON)

20
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,424
SAW THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL

21
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,141
What are you looking at?

22
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,560
What? Is it Sang-hyuk's diary?

23
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,527
What is this?

24
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,529
Sang-hyuk is not human.

25
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,492
-This man is--
-He said that was his father.

26
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,498
EVIDENCE NUMBER ONE

27
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,460
I didn't believe it at first,
but I saw it with my own eyes.

28
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,840
The deep scar on his finger disappeared
in just a few minutes.

29
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,426
And his hands turned transparent.

30
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,555
It was a split second, but I saw it.

31
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,019
If he's not human…

32
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,063
I'll find out what he really is.

33
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,190
So until then…

34
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,442
You're here.

35
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,114
I put this month's bills
and rent on your desk.

36
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,199
Okay.

37
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,286
What's wrong with her?

38
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,380
Then, what I saw that day was real?

39
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,761
If he's not human, then…

40
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,305
Mr. Superman.
You don't even have a scratch on you.

41
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,182
You didn't even bleed a drop.

42
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,519
Then the reason
he hasn't gotten hurt so far…

43
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,688
Why are you so desperate to be in love?

44
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,565
Why don't you want to be?

45
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,734
It's not that I don't want to.

46
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,193
I just shouldn't.

47
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,112
I don't deserve it.

48
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,156
…is because he's not human?

49
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,658
I put the bills up there.

50
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,077
There.

51
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,163
Okay.

52
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,769
This is my 997th time.

53
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,480
Excuse me.

54
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,572
I didn't go all the way up that day.

55
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,325
I'm short by one.

56
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,122
So from now on, keep your distance.

57
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,000
-When Sang-hyuk comes--
-What are you talking about?

58
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,252
I have no idea what you're talking about.

59
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,964
I don't think I should keep listening
to you. I'm going back in.

60
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,133
Do you think I'm joking?

61
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,763
Keep your distance
until we figure out what he is!

62
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,348
He could be dangerous!

63
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,476
Did he hurt me?

64
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,438
He's been protecting me all along.

65
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,932
-Where is Oh Baek-ryeon?
-Baek-ryeon went out.

66
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
Where did she go? Damn it.

67
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,240
One thousand.

68
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,828
Baek-ryeon!

69
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,214
Baek-ryeon!

70
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,656
How did you find me?

71
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,202
I heard today was the thousandth time.

72
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,624
Thank you

73
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,626
for showing up.

74
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,839
So you're the one who interfered
with the threads of fate I set up.

75
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,387
You're the one they call courage.

76
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,190
That court lady is destined
to be with someone else.

77
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,610
She's linked to another
by a red thread of fate I set up.

78
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,781
Today is her thousandth, right?

79
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,207
You played a cute prank.

80
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,211
But they can't be together.

81
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,882
A fairy can't be with a human

82
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,387
because I won't let it happen.

83
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,140
The time that court lady and the fairy
accumulated themselves…

84
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,519
A thousand times.

85
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,687
500 years.

86
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,276
And the biggest variable,
that even you can't change,

87
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,654
a fairy who isn't a human.

88
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,948
It's Cheon Sang-hyuk.

89
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,120
Isn't the only reason
you instilled fear in the fairy

90
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,748
for thousands of years
because of that fate?

91
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,462
He will soon enter into metamorphosis.

92
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:57,968
He cannot settle in the world of humans.

93
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,137
Sir.

94
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,724
These lotus flowers also took root
in a very unsavory piece of land.

95
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,810
Beautifully.

96
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,240
EP12. THE REASON YOU ARE
IN FRONT OF ME NOW

97
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:45,390
That vet was the court lady, Lee So-hee,
and the high school student, Yoo Jeong-ah?

98
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,563
So the reason she was fine until now
is because they are meant to be together?

99
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,106
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,983
-Sang-hyuk isn't human.
-Then what is he?

101
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,153
How else would you explain
why they met like this?

102
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,449
The last metamorphosis will begin soon.

103
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,328
It doesn't matter if they're meant to
be together. They don't have time.

104
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,874
Why did it have to happen now
right before the end?

105
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,752
-There's one thing Sang-hyuk doesn't know.
-What is it?

106
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,464
I'll never tell him

107
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,634
because he's reckless.

108
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,473
We met too late.

109
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,227
We haven't known each other for 500 years.

110
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,687
Why didn't we meet sooner?

111
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,399
Could there be a more tragic encounter?

112
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,363
They always reduce it
when I make it bigger. Damn it.

113
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,791
Because I don't need any other reason.

114
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,918
You're the only one I see.

115
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,169
But why?

116
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,295
Gentle gaze.

117
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,382
How come? For what reason?

118
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,803
This is so uncomfortable.
It's really awkward.

119
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,139
Why is my student into me of all people?

120
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,892
People who have never dated
fall in love so randomly

121
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,185
for no good reason.

122
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,937
How many lessons do I have left?

123
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,899
TEACH AT ACADEMY

124
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,276
Gentle gaze.

125
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,694
Oh, my gosh!

126
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,965
-You should go inside.
-Okay.

127
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,843
You should really go in now.

128
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,304
Okay. I'll really go in now.

129
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
Wait.

130
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,893
-I want to make sure of something.
-About what?

131
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,689
We're on the same page, right?

132
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,652
What do you mean?

133
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,781
I mean, we can call each other
"honey" now, right?

134
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,078
Well…

135
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,290
Yes, that's right.

136
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,210
Well, there was no motorcycle
at the cliff.

137
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,837
You ran all the way there.

138
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,299
If you change your mind the next day,
that would make you a jerk.

139
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,179
All right. Fine.

140
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,930
Don't worry, and go home.

141
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,850
Honey.

142
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,770
All right, honey.

143
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,024
-Good night.
-One more thing.

144
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,903
-You're not an alien, are you?
-Alien?

145
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,490
You're not a ghost
or anything like that either, right?

146
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,578
-What are you talking about?
-I mean, Detective Seo said

147
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,330
he saw something.

148
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,249
He said your hands turned transparent.

149
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,294
Actually, I saw it too.

150
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,255
-You did?
-When I was in the hospital.

151
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,675
I had just woken up and opened my eyes.

152
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,970
And I saw this turn transparent.

153
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,643
I must've been seeing things
due to my head injury.

154
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,062
Did Detective Seo hurt his head too?

155
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,816
He must've gotten hurt
fighting the criminal

156
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,734
in that abandoned factory, just like me.

157
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,030
Right. That must be it.

158
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,492
But he was really serious.

159
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,078
I think…

160
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,375
he likes me a lot.

161
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,883
-How did you reach that conclusion?
-Does he want to separate us that badly?

162
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,095
Even so, how can he call you an alien?

163
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,181
Now I get why Do-ra reacted that way
when I insisted I was an angel.

164
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,726
But don't worry.

165
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,394
No matter what anyone says…

166
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,689
my heart belongs here.

167
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,733
In my honey's heart.

168
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,658
Go on in.

169
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,019
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

170
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,104
WITNESS TESTIMONY REPORT
GIVEN UNDER HYPNOSIS

171
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,080
-You want to know who I am?
-It's a matter of time until I find out.

172
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,083
If you confess,
I may take it into consideration.

173
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,836
I'll tell you one thing.

174
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,506
That person…

175
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,677
It is me.

176
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,763
CHEON SANG-HYUK

177
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,307
An alien, a monster, a ghost.

178
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,519
I wonder which one would apply to me.

179
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,319
-Are you messing with--
-I like Baek-ryeon.

180
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,654
Geez.

181
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,450
You're picking a fight with me.

182
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,834
I also want to know who you are
and why we met again.

183
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,465
I saw a guy
who looks like Prince Lee Seon.

184
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,676
At the vet clinic.

185
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,183
Find them. Search every corner of Joseon
if you have to.

186
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,196
My love!

187
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,031
My love!

188
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,707
Stay here for a second.

189
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,438
Prince Lee Seon who was tenaciously after
the court lady and Sang-hyuk.

190
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,296
The vet clinic?

191
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,383
-Where the vet Oh Baek-ryeon works?
-Yes.

192
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,096
I feel uneasy.

193
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,017
What happens
if the last metamorphosis goes wrong?

194
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,519
You know, don't you?

195
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,405
What is it?

196
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,823
What happens?

197
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,211
WITNESS TESTIMONY
(OH BAEK-RYEON)

198
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,384
She came to me.

199
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:04,055
-And now she's right in front of me.
-So?

200
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,599
You want to catch up with her
for the times you missed?

201
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,351
You don't have time for that!

202
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,811
I'm going to stay by her side.

203
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,146
And

204
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,148
I'll protect her.

205
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,110
You'll be going through
the last metamorphosis soon.

206
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,362
I know that.

207
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:24,117
I'm going to stay with her
until the day I disappear.

208
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,328
If that's what she wants.

209
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,044
We don't have time.

210
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,393
I don't have much time either.

211
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:59,485
Do you think humans are
the only intelligent life form?

212
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,156
The US military claims there are no UFOs,

213
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,366
but the evidence is pouring in.

214
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,453
What do you all think?

215
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,378
Hey, Detective Myung.

216
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,673
-I need your help.
-What is it?

217
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,473
-Do I look crazy?
-No, sir.

218
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,357
I was the only one to witness it,
so it's driving me crazy.

219
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,443
That's why I need one more person.

220
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,654
You know I adore you a lot, right?

221
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,366
But why do you want to reveal
who he really is?

222
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,578
Hey. What if he's a really harmful alien
to humans?

223
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,622
Who's going to protect humans?

224
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,499
The police.

225
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,711
That punk is staying close to Ms. Oh.

226
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,131
I understand what you mean.

227
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,509
You know that
I care a lot about you, right?

228
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,678
-Yes, thank you.
-Yeah.

229
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,431
I'm sure he'll transform at one point.

230
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,558
-We must capture the moment.
-Yes, sir.

231
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,228
Right.

232
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,736
Hello, Detective Seo.

233
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,739
You must've been startled earlier.

234
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,660
I was a bit flustered, but I'm okay.

235
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,454
I'm worried about you, Ms. Oh.

236
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,333
I'm worried,

237
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,002
and I feel uneasy.

238
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,885
I don't think it's anything
to worry about.

239
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:52,974
Still…

240
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,227
I'll worry about you.

241
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,314
That's up to me, isn't it?

242
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,028
-You're an amazing person, but--
-Can you not finish that sentence?

243
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,492
Let me worry about you, at least.

244
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:12,994
You could, right?

245
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,436
This must be the place.

246
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,398
CHEON SANG-HYUK

247
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,781
I slept well.

248
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,954
Am I a dog again?

249
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,833
What's going on?

250
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,462
What? Why am I leashed?

251
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,630
What's going on?

252
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,352
What on earth? Why are these on my hands?

253
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,645
My back…

254
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,360
Who's there? Who are you?

255
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:43,918
Starting today, I'll give you
breakfast, lunch and dinner only.

256
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:48,422
-What?
-Just eat your meals and stay in here.

257
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,341
Have you lost it? What are you doing?

258
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,550
What do you mean?

259
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,637
I'm paying you back
for what you did to me.

260
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,723
I'll do exactly what you did to me.

261
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:02,520
Go through the humiliation
of relieving yourself there.

262
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,440
Hey. Cheon Dong-gu.

263
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,025
Cheon Dong-gu!

264
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,740
Geez.

265
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,704
Gosh.

266
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,623
What's with all this noise?

267
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,878
Hey, Sang-hyuk. Get this thing off of me.
Get it off.

268
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,964
-Cheon Dong-gu!
-What's wrong with him?

269
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,301
Sang-hyuk.

270
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,055
Can you unlock these for me?

271
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,932
What's with those chains?

272
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:47,023
I thought you and I had an understanding.

273
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,107
What?

274
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,152
Right.

275
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,779
No.

276
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,826
I'm sorry.

277
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,912
Hey, hey.

278
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,664
Sang-hyuk!

279
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,792
Sang-hyuk! Dong-gu!

280
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,420
Whose dog is that?

281
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,983
That's why they should've been nice.

282
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,701
Please just make sure
they don't make too much noise.

283
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,080
-I trust you, my friend.
-See you later.

284
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,864
17 - JEONG-AH'S BIRTHDAY
21 - VERNAL EQUINOX

285
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,047
Who told you to dress up so nicely?
What if everyone falls in love with you?

286
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,968
Next time, don't dress up so nicely.

287
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,305
Everyone is staring at you.
They'll bore a hole in your face.

288
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,348
My goodness. We don't want that to happen.

289
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,019
-Should I not put on makeup tomorrow?
-You'd be even more beautiful then.

290
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,438
This won't do. Get in the car.

291
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,316
I should hide you
so no one else can see you.

292
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,569
There.

293
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,248
So what if he's an alien

294
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,541
when I like him so much?

295
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,710
When was your birthday again?

296
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,337
My birthday?

297
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,672
The day you entered the orphanage?

298
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,258
When was it?

299
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,386
The day it snowed. December 29.

300
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,556
I see. It's still far away.

301
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,433
Where is the orphanage?

302
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,853
Where did you grow up
to look so beautiful?

303
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,147
Do you want to go there?

304
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,774
Really?

305
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,708
Thank you. Drive safe.

306
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,086
I'll come pick you up when you're done.

307
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,420
See you later. Go on in.

308
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,674
I'm so jealous.

309
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,092
I'm lonely.

310
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:47,930
You must be happy.

311
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,308
It's nice to have a boyfriend.

312
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,649
-Doctor!
-Doctor!

313
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,360
-Our Soon-yi…
-Soon-yi…

314
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,583
We removed her tumor
through surgery last time,

315
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,168
but it was too malignant

316
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,170
and it had already spread to her organs.

317
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,756
She's been holding out through chemo.

318
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,301
But now, she can only take painkillers.

319
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:29,179
I suggested that she stay here
because she couldn't breathe well.

320
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,141
They'll just have to come here every day.

321
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,772
She's 19, so she's like their daughter.

322
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,926
Hello.

323
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,220
How can I help you?

324
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,855
This way, please.

325
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,068
Would you like to go through
the adoption process?

326
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,746
They didn't forget again.

327
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,623
Who could it be?

328
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,962
Is someone I've been waiting for
going to come today?

329
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,849
My goodness.

330
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,894
Oh, my. Who are you? Why are you here?

331
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,896
Goodness. Come here.

332
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,272
Goodness.

333
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,524
It's okay.

334
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,317
Whose dog is this?

335
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,488
It's okay.

336
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,948
Goodness.

337
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,200
Is the owner not around?

338
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,453
My goodness.

339
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,956
Let's go inside.

340
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:43,981
How many years will I serve
if I say that I killed her?

341
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,816
Did you?

342
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,401
What if I say I did?

343
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,777
What do you mean?

344
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:51,947
I…

345
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,534
I went there that day.

346
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:33,113
I met Ms. Song that day.

347
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,169
What do you do?

348
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,296
I'm a desk consultant at an academy.

349
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,423
-Do you have siblings?
-I have a younger brother.

350
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,549
What are your hobbies?

351
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,052
-Spacing out at home.
-Who's your favorite celebrity?

352
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,931
My favorite celebrity?

353
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,599
I like Jennie.

354
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,310
Jennie.

355
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:15,906
Should I go?

356
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,366
No.

357
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,494
Il-yong.

358
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,206
Don't just keep asking questions.

359
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,042
Listen to her answer
and find topics to talk about.

360
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,336
Topics to continue the conversation.

361
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,090
You need to find things in common

362
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,634
to become curious about each other.

363
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,304
Yong-bok, ask some questions.

364
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,432
Next. Dong-gu.

365
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,111
I think it's the person who called
about a consultation earlier.

366
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,113
I'll get going then.

367
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,282
Good job.

368
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,625
Dong-gu, what's your hobby?

369
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,710
You, Do-ra.

370
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,803
-Your hobby is me?
-I want to get to know you.

371
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,516
Because you are interesting, Do-ra.

372
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,987
You're the worst of the three.

373
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,322
I'm the worst?

374
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,451
If you tell your blind date
she's your hobby when you just met her,

375
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,202
you think it'd make her heart race?

376
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,579
Not at all.

377
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,998
It's scary. It's creepy.

378
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,334
How can your hobby be her?
You'd only just met her.

379
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,336
I have a question.

380
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,130
What if Zo In-sung said the same thing?

381
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,967
Let's say the blind date was Zo In-sung.

382
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:03,764
What if he says his hobby is you, Do-ra?

383
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,311
That'd make my heart flutter.

384
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,274
But you're not Zo In-sung.

385
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,693
I'm flabbergasted.

386
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,363
-I'm totally flabbergasted.
-I'm totally flabbergasted.

387
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,574
What does Zo In-sung have that I don't?

388
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,869
I'm just like Zo In-sung.

389
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,788
I'm handsome with strong features.

390
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:32,834
Anyway, you're definitely not Zo In-sung.

391
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,587
Guys, I'm not Kim Tae-hee either.

392
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:41,343
We're not an exception who can be
forgiven for whatever we say.

393
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,721
We need to have a conversation
that suits the situation and the mood.

394
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,889
That way--

395
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,559
-Yes, Dong-gu?
-Ms. Ahn.

396
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,397
You're prettier than Kim Tae-hee.

397
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,024
To me, that is.

398
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:01,321
What is up with this man?
He keeps coming on to me.

399
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,288
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

400
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,839
-You're here.
-Hi. It's been so long.

401
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,175
-There.
-How have you been?

402
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,385
You look great.

403
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,887
You've become even prettier.

404
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,597
Hello.

405
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,474
Wait, he is…

406
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,686
Do you know each other?

407
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,604
I came here once with Detective Seo.

408
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,649
With Detective Seo? What for?

409
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,359
Well…

410
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:42,320
-Baek-ryeon!
-Baek-ryeon!

411
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:46,700
-Baek-ryeon!
-Baek-ryeon!

412
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,410
Hi!

413
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,203
-How have you been?
-Baek-ryeon!

414
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,623
-Did you bring gifts?
-Baek-ryeon!

415
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,584
-The gifts!
-Did you bring them?

416
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,128
You didn't even greet me,
and you're asking for gifts.

417
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,212
I'm hurt.

418
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,342
But I still brought gifts.

419
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,510
Follow me.

420
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,930
-Yes!
-Let's see.

421
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,683
Step back. Watch out.

422
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,938
Take it one by one.

423
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,023
Be careful.

424
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,239
Take them one by one in order.

425
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,330
Red light, green light.

426
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,874
You should come here.
The one with their hands up.

427
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,293
Red light, green light.

428
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,920
Red light, green--

429
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,254
Run!

430
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,563
What is this? No.

431
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,066
-I got it! Soccer!
-That's right!

432
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,410
Aren't your feet cold?

433
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,204
I'm good. What about you?

434
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,705
I'm good too.

435
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,087
Do a better job.

436
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,259
We shouldn't play around. We should hurry.

437
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,802
Should I try to do it faster?

438
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,901
CAPTAIN SEO JAE-HEE

439
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,155
Yes, Captain Seo.

440
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,449
I'm looking at them now.

441
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,869
But do I have to keep looking?

442
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,162
Why? Is something wrong?

443
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,045
I can't bear to watch them.

444
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,695
-I'm sure it's from here.
-Are you sure?

445
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,946
I'm sure it's this place.

446
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,158
The dog barks are coming
from your unit, right?

447
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:34,868
No, it's not us.

448
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,369
-I'm sure it's them.
-Yes.

449
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,454
I clearly heard it.

450
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,123
-It's them.
-Why are you lying?

451
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,586
Yes, you're right. It is our dog.

452
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,172
If you can't manage, then don't raise one.

453
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,633
I don't want to raise him either.

454
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,134
Would you like to take him?

455
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,802
What kind of nonsense is that?

456
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,095
You're so rude.

457
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,306
Stop with your nonsense.

458
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,601
Sorry. I'll be careful.

459
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,810
How ridiculous.

460
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:01,895
Seriously.

461
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,070
Dong-chil.

462
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,572
-Dong-gu. Get this off me right now.
-Dong-chil.

463
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,865
Release me. Hey.

464
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,867
Dong-chil, are you a good boy?

465
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,328
What? What's wrong?

466
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,412
Hey…

467
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:25,001
I told you to stay quiet.

468
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,134
Gosh. Darn it.

469
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,141
I told you both to stay quiet.

470
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,018
Just let me use the bathroom.

471
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,943
I relieved myself there too.

472
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,363
How can I relieve myself there?

473
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,657
If I can, then you can too!

474
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,243
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,

475
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,036
so please don't do this, my friend.

476
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,579
My friend.

477
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,790
My dear friend.

478
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,967
The moment you put a chamber pot
in my room,

479
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,261
our friendship ended.

480
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,098
Dong-gu…

481
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,309
Dong-gu.

482
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,147
Shock therapy.

483
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,774
She needs shock therapy at this stage.

484
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,484
How?

485
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,487
You should make a confession,
then forget about her.

486
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,073
Forget about her?
Then why would I confess?

487
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:42,120
She's been walking the tightrope between
a lover and a friend for ten years.

488
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,248
It means she's enjoying it.

489
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,500
Do you think she doesn't know
how you feel about her?

490
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,419
She does. She definitely does.

491
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,796
And she's making full use of it.

492
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,300
She calls you when she needs to,
but she wouldn't date you.

493
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,054
She'd give you hope,
so you wouldn't leave her.

494
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,722
Will you keep living like that?

495
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,391
Why waste your 20s like that?

496
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,601
Because I like her.

497
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,270
You've wasted ten years already.

498
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:08,897
Just tell her how you feel.

499
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,399
That leaves two options.

500
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,318
She'll either hold on to you
or let you go.

501
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,779
If she holds on to you,
then you can date her.

502
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,156
If she lets you go,
then you'll stop wasting time on her.

503
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,949
How should I confess to her?

504
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,661
From now on, I'll only look at you.

505
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,538
I won't look at other women.

506
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:26,623
That crazy jerk…

507
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,959
Sorry? Did you say I was crazy?
You told me to confess my feelings.

508
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,795
No, that's not it.

509
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:37,592
Say whatever you want
from the bottom of your heart.

510
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,719
Ms. Ahn.

511
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,972
You're prettier than Kim Tae-hee.

512
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,892
Then…

513
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,773
she'll know that you're being sincere.

514
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,823
Come to think of it,

515
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,658
it was shock therapy.

516
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,160
Dong-gu, what's your hobby?

517
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,328
You, Do-ra.

518
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,205
Dong-gu, this guy…

519
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,375
He knows how to leave a good impression.

520
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,377
Gentle gaze.

521
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,797
He pretended like
he's never dated anyone before

522
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,590
but he may actually be a player.

523
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:29,102
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

524
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,604
SEVENS SINS
CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT

525
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,815
1. NOT SAY HELLO
2. SLEEP IN

526
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,066
3. EAT LATE
4. NOT DO HOMEWORK

527
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,234
5. TALK BACK
6. NOT CLEAN

528
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,319
7. COMPLAIN

529
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,663
I killed her.

530
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,222
I thought he looked
a lot like the police officer from 1994.

531
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,057
So, he was his father.

532
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,229
I thought he was a bachelor.

533
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,813
A bachelor?

534
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:00,568
By the way,
what's your relationship with him?

535
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,195
Is he your boyfriend?

536
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,407
You must be happy.

537
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:09,160
It feels like a dream.

538
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:14,499
The fact that I can spend warm moments
with someone I like.

539
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,544
I'm sure it will be even warmer than now.

540
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,004
You'll be even happier.

541
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,339
Thank you.

542
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,970
About this…

543
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,190
ANGEL ORPHANAGE

544
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,734
OUR HOME FULL OF LOVE AND HOPE

545
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:44,153
Director Hong Ae-kyeong made it herself.

546
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,322
The director who went missing in 1993?

547
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:47,657
Yes, that's right.

548
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,285
She disappeared on the night
a fire broke out.

549
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:56,541
Director Hong hit the kids.

550
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,836
Quite a lot.

551
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,715
She hit them
for getting up five minutes late.

552
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,967
She hit them for
leaving a bit of food behind.

553
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,387
She even hit them for not smiling nicely.

554
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:13,016
Did she make them write
self-reflection essays too?

555
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,642
In a red notebook?

556
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,820
We tried reporting her in secret,
but nothing changed.

557
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,947
And she took that anger out on the kids.

558
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,790
I don't think it was 1993.

559
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,085
He probably wasn't a little kid back then.

560
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,510
At what age do kids
usually leave the orphanage?

561
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,012
19 years old.

562
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,930
When we turn 19 years old.

563
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,727
What about the kids
who left the orphanage?

564
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,980
Due to the fire in 1993,
the previous records were all burned.

565
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,613
ANGEL ORPHANAGE CHARITY EVENT

566
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,735
I had some business around here.

567
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,236
Is Kim Myeong-sik an orphan?

568
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,696
Kim Myeong-sik?

569
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,491
No, his parents live
in the same apartment complex.

570
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:36,951
Why would he be an orphan?

571
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,162
What is it?

572
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,956
Let's go to the detention center
where he is. Right now.

573
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,887
SEVEN SINS
CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT

574
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,695
Mr. Kim.

575
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,822
Mr. Kim!

576
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,950
Did you really kill Ms. Go Eun-seo?

577
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,330
If you confessed you did when you didn't,

578
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,207
you're committing a grave sin.

579
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,795
You're allowing the real culprit
to roam around freely.

580
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,883
-It's a puppy!
-A puppy!

581
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,802
How old is it?

582
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:36,928
How old is it?

583
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,179
-It's so cute.
-So cute.

584
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,015
-Let's go, kids.
-No, I don't want to!

585
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,308
It's time to go.

586
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,601
Let's go.

587
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,646
How adorable.

588
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,821
There's still one more case.

589
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:55,947
Jealousy.

590
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:09,669
That last case won't happen.

591
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,675
Because I'm in here.

592
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,344
What did you say?

593
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:35,778
Huh?

594
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:37,989
This place is…

595
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:40,449
So this is where they lived?

596
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,911
Yoo Jeong-ah and Song Da-hee,
the fourth victims, used to live here?

597
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:44,996
Yes.

598
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:49,000
This is where
Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah used to live.

599
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,294
My goodness.

600
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,420
-My gosh.
-Here.

601
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,923
I called a cab, so it'll be here soon.

602
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,675
My goodness. I hope it comes soon.

603
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:04,515
SERVICE AND INFORMATION CENTER

604
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,195
He was a short guy.

605
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,780
So why did he…

606
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:24,911
That last case won't happen.

607
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,289
Because I'm in here.

608
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,207
He knows about the Seven Sins for Women.

609
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,251
What could he have meant?

610
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,503
An accomplice.

611
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:42,887
He's the accomplice. The short guy
Ms. Oh saw at the parking lot.

612
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,352
That jerk who was seen
at the convenience store.

613
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:54,899
He's an accomplice,
but Kim Myeong-sik made a confession.

614
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,695
Is he trying to take all the blame?

615
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:01,822
So why?

616
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,664
DISEASE
JEALOUSY

617
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,748
Jealousy.

618
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,585
If it's for that last one…

619
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,296
OH BAEK-RYEON

620
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,382
For the last one remaining…

621
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,844
I'll get going first.

622
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:24,929
Where are you going?

623
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:28,849
-I'm here.
-Hey.

624
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:30,893
Hello.

625
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,895
Dr. Lee, thank you for your hard work.

626
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:33,980
Thank you.

627
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,821
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

628
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:47,410
Dr. Oh.

629
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,955
Dr. Oh, what should we have for a snack?
What do you want to eat?

630
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,249
Do you crave anything?

631
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,042
I'm craving pizza.

632
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,294
But we had it yesterday.

633
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,423
Welcome.

634
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,008
Is it your first time here?

635
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:17,940
Good job.

636
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,827
Potato's guardian?

637
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,005
MY MAN

638
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,054
The number you have dialed…

639
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,104
Ah-rom.

640
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,231
Hang in there. My goodness.

641
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:00,900
My poor baby.

642
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,110
-It will be okay.
-There, there.

643
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,444
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae?

644
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,464
-My goodness!
-Jeong-ah!

645
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:07,216
Jeong-ah!

646
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,637
My daughter! My poor girl! My poor baby!

647
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,779
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
APPOINTMENT AS POLICE OFFICERS

648
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,035
I'll…

649
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,787
I'll catch him no matter what.
