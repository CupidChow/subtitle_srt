1
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,750
Don't move.

2
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,118
Why did I see that?

3
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,621
Why

4
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,040
did I see this place?

5
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,591
Why is my heart beating so fast?

6
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,809
You.

7
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,728
Who are you?

8
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,956
Who's the man in the photo?

9
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,795
I told you last time.

10
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,964
He's my father.

11
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,098
This is the report
from the Digital Analysis Division at NFS.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,559
Based on their eyes,
corners of their mouths,

13
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,645
ear lobes, forehead shapes
and the eyebrow shapes,

14
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,272
they're the same person.

15
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,941
The man in the photo is you.
Step away from the rifle.

16
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,319
I said step away from the rifle!

17
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,285
What do you want me to say?

18
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,455
Don't tell me you think I'm a ghost,
a monster or an alien.

19
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,207
Do you think I'm all that?

20
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,959
You're smiling?

21
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,753
How can you smile
after seeing this report?

22
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,425
If I were you, I would have first checked
who sent this photo.

23
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,137
-What?
-Have you checked who sent this?

24
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,893
This happened in the past too.

25
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,021
The police doubted each other
and pointed fingers at each other.

26
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,024
-They fought among themselves.
-That is none of your concern.

27
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,109
You.

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,485
Where did you get the rifle?

29
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,071
You have a sniper rifle
in the middle of the city.

30
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,781
Come and look if you're curious.

31
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,075
See what kind of rifle it is.

32
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,167
YOO JEONG-HO

33
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,977
Who are you?

34
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,146
Well…

35
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,525
Your house is so pretty.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,361
The wall is very pretty.

37
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,487
Thank you.

38
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,155
Are you from around here?

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,741
No.

40
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,535
I was just passing by.

41
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,873
Thank you.

42
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,000
Goodbye.

43
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,045
What is this?

44
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,255
Goodness.

45
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,807
My gosh! That scared me.

46
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,934
You punk! Are you a pervert?

47
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,228
A pervert? What are you talking about?

48
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,439
Look at them. Those two.

49
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,567
That.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,452
You're watching that kind of stuff
through a rifle on a rooftop?

51
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,204
No, that's not what I was doing.

52
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,081
What's wrong with you? What a pervert!

53
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,002
I think there's been
a huge misunderstanding.

54
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,378
This isn't that kind of rifle.

55
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,505
I'm not a pervert!

56
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,382
You are a pervert.

57
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,137
Goodness!

EP 9. THINGS THAT DO NOT CHANGE
EVEN IF YOU ARE REINCARNATED

59
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,613
Sir. I checked it.

60
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,574
The person at this address
said they never sent this.

61
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,538
And the courier number
on the entry log doesn't exist.

62
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,415
-It doesn't exist?
-No.

63
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,086
Detective Seo. You have a delivery.

65
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,384
Sir.

66
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,844
And

67
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,137
you have a guest.

68
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,068
If she's alive,
you should know where she is.

69
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,324
If she's dead, you should have found
her dead body by now.

70
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,661
I am sorry.

71
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,788
We're doing our best to find her.

72
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,252
My wife cheated on me with Kim Myeong-sik.

73
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,881
Everything about him is very suspicious.
Why haven't you been able to arrest him?

74
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,551
There are definitely several things
about him that make him look suspicious,

75
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,178
but it's only circumstantial evidence.

76
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,847
But you found blood in his car.

77
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,933
Those bloodstains
cannot serve as direct evidence

78
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,227
that he killed her.

79
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,980
So you're saying…

80
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,525
that you need to find her body.

81
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,152
If she is dead…

82
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,488
yes.

83
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,743
The world is so unfair.

84
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,913
It already breaks my heart

85
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,334
to know that my missing wife
has been cheating on me for years,

86
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,129
but you can't charge the man
who has been cheating with my wife

87
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,214
when there are so many
suspicious things about him.

88
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,343
I don't know if this is more unfair
for my dead wife

89
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,763
or me for having trusted my wife

90
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,016
and tried my best for my family
for decades.

91
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,353
It's very unfair

92
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,858
that the person left behind has to be
the one to experience this heartbreak.

93
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,319
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,323
The media mentioned a witness.

95
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,241
Would it be possible for me to meet her?

96
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,911
The witness?

97
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm sorry, but you can't.

98
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,501
We can't pressure the witness.

99
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,589
The culprit targets people around him.

100
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,508
He targets women he has been watching

101
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,470

-Sir.
-Ms. Song.

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,067
Are you sick?

114
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,111
I feel like I'm coming down with a cold.

115
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,195
You are?

116
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,282
You have to treat it at an early stage.

117
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,159
Take your medicine.

118
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,162
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,454
Hey, can't you just walk next to me?

121
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,880
Captain Seo told me to watch you
from a distance.

122
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,385
Wouldn't it be safer
for you to watch me right next to me?

123
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,928
You are right.

124
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,056
-By the way…
-Yes.

125
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,893
…is Sang-hyuk still coming
to the police station these days?

126
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,146
Yes. He's working on some stuff
with Detective Seo, as a team.

127
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,903
Does he seem a little different to you?

128
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,364
-Different?
-Yes.

129
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,449
For instance…

130
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,496
does he seem restless?

131
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,332
There is one thing
that's different about him.

132
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,000
What is it?

133
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,253
He seemed a bit irritated.

134
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,672
He-- He seemed irritated? Why?

135
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,091
-Someone must have upset him.
-Who?

136
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,016
What? Me? What did I do?

137
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,852
Gosh, you scared me.

138
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,104
Why are you getting mad at me?
I was just thinking.

139
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:10,814
Geez.

140
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,898
Wait.

141
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,191
Geez.

142
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,276
What did I do?

143
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,128
I'll be with you again tomorrow.

144
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,380
Thank you. Bye.

145
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:36,965
Bye.

146
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,783
Then trust me.

147
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,411
I trust you.

148
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,996
From now on,

149
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,457
I'm going to fight against my destiny.

150
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,922
My dear friend.

151
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,715
You are in love.

152
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,052
I can already see

153
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,013
under your vest

154
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,182
that your heart's on fire.

155
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,725
Have you ever seen it?

156
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,146
Have you seen what happens
if you resist the last metamorphosis?

157
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,024
You'll lose your last chance.

158
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,653
-Have you checked?
-You scared me!

159
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,283
-Did you find out what you did that night?
-What did I do?

160
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,867
You're flustered.

161
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,037
You didn't just give him a peck.
You actually kissed him.

162
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,456
How did you know? Did you see me?

163
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,667
Which one is it?

164
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,044
Is it the detective or Superman?

165
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,925
So it's Superman.

166
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,262
You pretended like you knew nothing,

167
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,473
but you kissed the guy
while you were drunk.

168
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,642
I know what you did with him

169
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,269
I know what you did with him

170
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,313
I know what you did

171
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,148
So, how was it?

172
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,734
That edgy first kiss of yours.

173
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,569
Edgy?

174
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,238
I can't even remember it.
I can't remember the entire thing.

175
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,742
This is not how I wanted
my first kiss to happen.

176
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,537
What kind of first kiss did you want?

177
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,920
I told you to go slow.

178
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,007
Geez!

179
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,800
Goodness.

180
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,345
You are a naughty girl.

181
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:37,354
You stare at each other,
wanting each other.

182
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,689
It doesn't matter who goes first.

183
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,567
You step closer to each other
to see how you feel about one another.

184
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,994
A romantic kiss
where you would hear bells ring.

185
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,165
But I forced myself on him.

186
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,416
I forced him.

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,835
I kissed him by force!

188
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,756
Goodness, Do-ra.

189
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,925
He keeps avoiding me.

190
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,051
Maybe he was offended.

191
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,388
You forced yourself on him, so I guess
he didn't hear any bells ringing.

192
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,681
I guess he felt violated.

193
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,726
Do-ra.

194
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,603
How was your first kiss?

195
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,064
Me? Didn't I tell you?

196
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,190
It happened so fast.

197
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,780
A guy I had absolutely no feelings for
suddenly kissed me and ran away.

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,784
Goodness, I wonder where
and what that jerk is doing now.

199
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,495
He ran away after stealing my first kiss.

200
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,915
I'll break his legs if I see him again.

201
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,793
That was my first kiss.

202
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,721
APPEAL

203
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:02,522
When you spent 3,500,000 won
for an intensive three-month course,

204
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,359
I'm sure you wanted to learn
some amazing skills.

205
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,027
Am I right?

206
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,780
How do you get a girl's phone number?

207
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,075
How do you date a girl?

208
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,287
How do you
have physical intimacy with a girl?

209
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,669
But I have no intention
of teaching you any skills.

210
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,629
Wh-- What do you mean?

211
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:31,760
Then how are guys like us supposed to
date a girl when we know nothing?

212
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:36,931
You can learn the skills
and probably take a girl out on a date.

213
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,225
If you're lucky,
you might end up as a couple.

214
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,479
But there's no guarantee of next time.

215
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,025
It's different when you share
your true feelings with someone.

216
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,822
My lecture isn't about those skills.

217
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,074
It's about finding
your own personal appeal.

218
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,534
What makes me attractive?

219
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,871
How will I discover and showcase
my personal appeal?

220
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,333
Once you become appealing,
girls will naturally come after you.

221
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,377
It shouldn't be about someone else.
It should be about you.

222
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,089
You get into a relationship
so that you become happy.

223
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,386
All right.

224
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,765
Stand up.

225
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,517
Let's get changed first.

226
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,186
Aren't you going to get up?

227
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,522
Why do I have to get changed?

228
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,023
This is a designer brand.

229
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,566
I thought it was fake.

230
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,903
I thought it was fake too.

231
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,489
Fake?

232
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,660
The whole suit cost me 6,270,000 won!

233
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,704
It's a designer brand
that costs 6,270,000 won.

234
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,625
But the problem is that
your styling makes it look fake.

235
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,253
Do you know why?

236
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,547
-Why?
-It doesn't suit you.

237
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,550
Let's go out to find what suits you.

238
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,304
I don't like women who approach me just
because I'm wearing expensive clothes.

239
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,766
That means
they like the expensive clothes, not me.

240
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,602
Basically, they like men who are rich.

241
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,230
Okay.

242
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,942
Your appearance, the school you went to,
your family, your salary.

243
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:17,198
How would a girl like you
without asking you all that?

244
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,491
Why would a girl like you?

245
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,329
Your appearance shows that
you take good care of yourself.

246
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,581
It's evidence of your diligence.

247
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,499
Your school?

248
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,502
It show that you studied hard and went to
a good college when others partied.

249
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,379
So it means you're hardworking.

250
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,463
Your family?

251
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,383
I'll pass
since I'm not covering it in my lecture.

252
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,467
Your salary.

253
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,221
It proves that you got good results
from competing against others.

254
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,473
It shows that you try hard all the time.

255
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,268
If you don't fall under any of these,

256
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,730
how would a girl like you?

257
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,814
Is it your personality?

258
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,858
Are you sure yours is good?

259
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,696
An emotionally guarded man
isn't attractive.

260
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,451
Clothes are the most basic means
of respecting yourself.

261
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,205
When you wear something that suits you,
you feel good, to start with.

262
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,209
So let's go out
to find something nice to wear.

263
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,297
Let's go out!

264
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,530
I don't think this suits you.

265
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,741
-It doesn't?
-You should try another one.

266
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,330
You should never wear this.

267
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,457
Dong-gu.

268
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,509
What if we leave this one open?

269
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,635
Yes, it's much better.

270
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,803
You look great.

271
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,806
Goodness, it looks nice on you.

272
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,766
So you tucked in the shirt.

273
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,814
Nice.

274
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,358
You look good. Come here.

275
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,947
The sleeves are too long.
Let's fold them a little.

276
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,449
This side too.

277
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,535
Let's put them on.

278
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,703
You're set.

279
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,371
You look great.

280
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,331
Hold on.

281
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,918
Let's tuck the collar in.

282
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,758
It's my first time

283
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,177
feeling a human woman's touch.

284
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,018
Goodness.

285
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,894
Thumbs up.

286
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,688
It's my first time

287
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,482
having a human woman smile at me.

288
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,974
How is it?

289
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,393
It looks cleaner and more refined.

290
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,189
You're getting to know more
about yourself.

291
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,441
You're discovering new things
about yourself.

292
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,902
I told you, it's nice.

293
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,780
I'm glad you like it.

294
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,989
Yes, I love it.

295
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,786
-Excuse me--
-Ah-ram!

296
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,472
That surprised me.

297
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,199
What's wrong with him?

298
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,016
Oh, my gosh.

299
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,811
I kissed a girl.

300
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,943
Then promise me you won't ever lie again.

301
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,236
Of course.

302
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,374
Is that a kiss?

303
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,626
Is that what you call a kiss?

304
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,924
MYEONGIN HOSPITAL

305
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,259
Hold on.

306
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,512
Oh, it's here.

307
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:37,643
Mr. Kim Myeong-sik got physical therapy
from March 2019 to July 2021.

308
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,353
The nurse in charge was Ms. Go Eun-seo.

309
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,864
Kim Myeong-sik seduced Go Eun-seo.

310
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,532
Then, he condemned her for adultery.

311
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:55,077
None of the people
related to the five victims overlap.

312
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,288
There has to be one though.

313
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,924
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

314
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,136
Let's eat first.

315
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,430
LEE HO-JIN

316
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,769
Yes?

317
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,314
What about Ms. Oh? Did she eat?
What did she have?

318
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,108
She had something horrible.

319
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,361
Tell her to have something delicious
from now on.

320
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,865
All right. Take good care of her.
Make sure she gets home safe after work.

321
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:33,950
Okay.

322
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,582
Why do you like Baek-ryeon?

323
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,004
-She's pretty.
-That's all?

324
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,756
Well, isn't there…

325
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,050
-You should think some more.
-Do I need to?

326
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,679
The only reason you like her
is because she's pretty?

327
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,560
When a woman asks you,
"Why do you like me?"

328
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,771
If a man answers,

329
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,358
"You are a good and diligent individual
who is respectful to your elders,

330
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,986
you have a house, a car and a pension,"

331
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,779
the girl will break up with him
right away.

332
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,991
Why?
He hasn't said the most important thing.

333
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,493
He didn't say it's because she's pretty.

334
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,537
It's simple.

335
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,664
"You are pretty." That's all it takes.

336
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,042
"You're the most beautiful woman to me."

337
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,962
You tell her, "You are prettier
than Yuna Kim, Jennie or aespa."

338
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,381
Even though she knows she's not,
she'll be very happy.

339
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,347
I started liking her
because she was pretty.

340
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,308
But…

341
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,732
I realized that she was cool as well.

342
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,985
Witnesses of murder cases

343
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,280
don't really cooperate
because they're scared.

344
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,782
It's especially true
for this missing person case

345
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,077
because the witnesses died
in suspicious accidents.

346
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,912
She must have been
more scared than anyone,

347
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,789
but she did her best until the end.

348
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,334
I found it very brave.

349
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,211
She's pretty and cool.

350
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,256
How can you not fall for her?

351
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,091
So,

352
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,301
what can you do for her?

353
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,553
I'll protect her. It's what I'm good at.

354
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,516
And you?

355
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,518
Do you like her?

356
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,064
That's the difference between you and me.

357
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,692
I'm not a coward who hides his feelings.

358
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,245
She's gotten much better.

359
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,372
I'm glad.

360
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,878
Don't forget to use the eyedrops.

361
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,468
What should I do?

362
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,303
I made a big mistake, right?

363
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,555
He didn't call you after that?

364
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,141
-He didn't come to see you? Not even once?
-No.

365
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,272
Snacks. What did you eat
with the drinks that night?

366
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,775
-Snacks?
-Come on. Think.

367
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,819
What did you eat
with your drinks that night?

368
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,447
One moon snail salad, please!

369
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,782
-Moon snail.
-Okay!

370
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,458
-One bossam, please!
-Okay.

371
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,630
It's spicy.

372
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,383
One dried squid, please.

373
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,009
Okay.

374
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,600
Can it all fit into your mouth?

375
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,271
-Squid.
-Goodness.

376
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,274
Dried squid and grilled squid.

377
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,152
You are good.

378
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,070
Look, it's shrinking.

379
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,614
Don't I look like a grilled squid?

380
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,582
So that's what it was.

381
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,379
Dr. Oh, just give up.

382
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,091
What do I do?

383
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,977
Why do people kiss?

384
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,356
Did you see?

385
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,525
-See? See what?
-What?

386
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,112
-I mean--
-I saw something just now.

387
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,365
-Was that a kiss?
-What did he see?

388
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,410
It looked disgusting.

389
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,037
Why would you do that?

390
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,206
A light peck on lips.

391
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,042
That's more pure and romantic.

392
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,712
That way, you can see
how you feel about one another.

393
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,088
You do that then.

394
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,216
-Did you see?
-See what?

395
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,051
-Don't tell me.
-No way.

396
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,344
Did you?

397
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,428
No.

398
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,599
Why would people
want to use their tongues?

399
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,017
It's disgusting.

400
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,977
What if she had cheonggukjang?

401
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,355
What if she chewed on a squid?

402
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,233
Then just don't kiss her.

403
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,902
Why would you get upset over that?

404
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,654
I'll kiss someone someday.

405
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,113
-Someday?
-You?

406
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,033
Just you wait and see.

407
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,328
In three months, I'll be in love too.

408
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,163
-Who cares if you do?
-Or if you don't.

409
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,878
When a man and a woman fall in love,

410
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,131
do they really need to kiss?

411
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,717
They can't help but want to kiss?

412
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,516
If you don't like that,
you can just be platonic.

413
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,059
Be platonic?

414
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,519
You don't want to be erotic.

415
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,981
You would want to touch, hug and kiss her.

416
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,774
Then you would want each other's bodies.

417
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,818
Want each other's bodies?

418
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,572
-Do people do that when they're in love?
-It all starts with a kiss.

419
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,284
It starts with a kiss?

420
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,369
How?

421
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,666
You should try. Then you will know.

422
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,423
Hey, why is your face so red?

423
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,176
Is it?

424
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,388
Gosh, hey.

425
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,682
This gochujang jjigae is so spicy.

426
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,731
You're right. I guess I made it
a bit spicy today. I'm sorry.

427
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,982
Hey, drink some water.

428
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,066
Okay.

429
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,043
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

430
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,320
Why is he here?

431
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,786
I'm Eun-seo's husband.

432
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,343
To be honest,

433
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,262
I saw you at the police station.

434
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:05,234
The police said no when I asked
if I could meet you. So I'm here.

435
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,652
I'm sorry I had to come like this.

436
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,530
It's all right. You can talk.

437
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,282
I heard

438
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,120
that you were with my wife that night.

439
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,039
What did my wife say?

440
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,584
What do you think love is, Eun-seo?

441
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,794
Fate.

442
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,173
Something that always finds you.

443
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,925
I didn't do anything wrong.

444
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,260
It's not a sin.

445
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,011
INWANGSAN MOUNTAIN
MISSING WOMAN

446
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,557
MISSING WOMAN
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

447
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,774
I met my wife 29 years ago.

448
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,569
I was injured badly and she treated me.

449
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,449
She was an angel who became a nurse…

450
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,869
just to save me.

451
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,539
Before her, the world felt icy cold.

452
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,042
She was the first woman
who taught me what it's like to be warm.

453
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,837
I've been living my life for her
since then.

454
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:12,551
I was working in the countryside
the night she went missing.

455
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,434
WIFE

456
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,232
That night…

457
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,361
when you talked with her…

458
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,282
was I the last person she spoke about…

459
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,286
or was it the man
she was having an affair with?

460
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,212
I understand.

461
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,512
I told you to walk beside me.

462
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:48,397
What's going on? Where did Lee Ho-jin go?

463
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,691
I sent him home.

464
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,486
That man is Seong Hyun-cheol.
Ms. Go Eun-seo's husband, right?

465
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,322
You saw him?

466
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,409
How long have you been watching me?

467
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,121
-I saw you when I was just passing by.
-You saw me while you were passing by?

468
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,748
Your place isn't this way.

469
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,584
I had something to do here.

470
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,920
Anyway, why was he here?

471
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,630
What did he say to you?

472
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,799
Did he pressure you? Or corner you?

473
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,594
Did he threaten you by any chance?

474
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,015
He didn't threaten me.

475
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,435
He just wanted to know
what his wife was like

476
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,437
before she went missing.

477
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,733
However,

478
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,527
I didn't say anything.

479
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,531
No, I couldn't.

480
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,120
This is why
the police wouldn't let him speak to you.

481
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,122
Why did he burden you with that?

482
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,001
They spent so much time together
but, ultimately, their love didn't last.

483
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,213
I feel bad for Eun-seo who's missing.

484
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,885
But I also feel bad for her husband
because he's been left alone.

485
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,222
He can't get as sad as he wants.

486
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,517
He can't hate her as much as he wants.

487
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,732
I hate you!

488
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,991
I'm sorry.

489
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,611
We should make a detour.

490
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,114
Baek-ryeon.

491
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:12,082
If she hates him, why is she kissing him?

492
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,209
I'm sorry.

493
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
What?

494
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,255
I didn't mean to startle you
the other night.

495
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,259
The other night?

496
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,343
Right.

497
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,140
I'm sorry. I drank a lot that night.

498
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,435
But it wasn't a mistake
just because I drank a lot.

499
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,148
I wouldn't just do that to any guy
because I was drunk.

500
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,319
Okay. Let me be honest.

501
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,700
I kissed you because I wasn't brave enough
to do it sober.

502
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,037
What I mean is…

503
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,086
I meant it.

504
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,474
It wasn't a mistake.

505
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,144
So…

506
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,526
is it okay if I don't apologize…

507
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,529
for what happened?

508
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,536
It was my first time

509
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,414
having physical contact with a woman.

510
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,624
All I used to get was a slap.

511
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,669
How dare you touch me!

512
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,381
She's the woman who reached out to me.

513
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,509
Until now,
every women has looked at me with…

514
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,804
Gosh, what the hell?

515
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,264
…annoyance and disdain.

516
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,141
-What are you looking at?
-Sorry?

517
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,810
All I used to get
was disgust and wry smiles.

518
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:21,271
Let's put them on. Goodness.

519
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,064
Thumbs up.

520
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,525
She gave me a genuine smile.

521
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,278
It's my first time.

522
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,864
I kept my lips pure

523
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,782
for the past 500 years.

524
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,411
My lips…

525
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,708
What did she do to your lips?

526
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,253
I don't know.

527
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,443
Something's going on.

528
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,528
Why do people kiss?

529
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,658
-Did you see?
-He crossed the line for sure.

530
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,118
But

531
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,163
-with who, though?
-Who do you think?

532
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,958
-It's that vet at the animal hospital.
-The vet?

533
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,253
I was talking about Dong-gu.

534
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,255
Dong-gu?

535
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,340
-What about him?
-He has a girl.

536
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,509
What? A girl? Dong-gu?

537
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,718
That's ridiculous.

538
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,888
I think he got a girlfriend
through that weird dating academy.

539
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,434
He said she reached out to him.

540
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,813
He said she smiled at him.

541
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,981
And his lips…

542
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,441
What about his lips?

543
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,735
I didn't hear the rest of the story.

544
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,239
Who cares what he does with his lips?

545
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,574
He's not the problem right now.

546
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,660
It's Sang-hyuk.

547
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,289
I think he's seriously crossing the line.

548
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,834
It isn't Sang-hyuk.
Dong-gu is in a more serious condition.

549
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,003
If he's in love right now,
it's his first love.

550
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,547
It's his first love in 500 years.

551
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,009
Don't you remember?

552
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,845
You know how our first love ended.

553
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,686
I've never heard of such lame excuses
in my entire life!

554
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,980
You want to break up with me
because you're a dog now.

555
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,481
Break up because you're a dog?

556
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,901
Well, I become a dog when I get drunk too!

557
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,195
Come out, you coward!

558
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,934
Remember how they held such mean grudges?

559
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,402
I hope he doesn't burn anything too.

560
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,696
Come on. He'll never do that.

561
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,490
He's such a coward.

562
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,159
He didn't want to touch
the arrow back then.

563
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,745
But he forced himself
to touch the corner of it.

564
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,081
Then he got stuck with us by accident.

565
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,125
Yes, you're right.

566
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,462
Sang-hyuk crossed the line.

567
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,713
If my gut is right…

568
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,759
But don't you think it's strange?

569
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,469
What is?

570
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,931
He said it would be a tragedy
once he opened up his heart.

571
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,228
He definitely opened up to her.

572
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,354
So, why is he safe?

573
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,025
RELIABLE POLICE - SAFE COUNTRY

574
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,403
-What is this?
-Which one?

575
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,327
Hey, don't overreact.

576
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,498
So, what can you do for her?

577
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,917
I'll protect her. It's what I'm good at.

578
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,272
Hey, you two.

579
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,487
Was she talking to us?

580
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,530
I don't think I know her.

581
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,491
Hey, you two.

582
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,827
She wants you to follow her.

583
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,133
Are you two scared?

584
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,929
Good. I dressed up to scare you.

585
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,056
How is it?

586
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,433
If anyone touches me, they'll die.
Don't you think?

587
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,060
Your…

588
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,522
This ring on your nose,

589
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,024
it has nothing to do
with attacking anyone.

590
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,610
But this is the whole point.

591
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,071
Having it makes a huge difference.

592
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,697
Look.

593
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,618
This is me with it and then without it.

594
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:10,954
-I look different.
-Well,

595
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,706
let's remove this.

596
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,417
Be honest. You're both scared, right?

597
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,923
I'll remove this then. Let's go.

598
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,968
Where?

599
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,137
Let's go.
We have somewhere to go together.

600
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,390
-Where?
-Wherever I tell you.

601
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,556
You think the missing woman from
the convenience store was killed here?

602
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,269
-But she lives in Gugi-dong.
-No.

603
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,937
It's here.

604
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,815
I think something happened here.

605
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,945
I don't know how it happened.

606
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:28,448
But she keeps showing up in my dreams.

607
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,367
She shows me this place in my dreams.

608
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,954
This is where…

609
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,753
the culprit attacked her.

610
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,672
And…

611
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,637
he buried her

612
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,930
in the mountain.

613
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,769
In the mountain?

614
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:04,484
I don't know which mountain it was
but I'm sure it was a mountain.

615
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,277
He buried her in the mountain.

616
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,571
Ms. Oh.

617
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,991
Did you watch a horror movie last night?

618
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,160
Was it about kidnapping
and burying someone in the mountain?

619
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:18,122
Why would that missing woman
from the convenience store

620
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,291
show up in your dream?

621
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,877
It's because I'm helping her.

622
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,337
I got hypnotized for her.

623
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,675
I try to remember things for a long time,
so she thinks I'm on her side.

624
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,593
That's why she's in my dreams.

625
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,346
She wants me to come to this place.

626
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:38,559
And the neighborhood felt different
from how it feels now.

627
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,688
There's one more person.

628
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:45,900
-She looked like a high school student.
-Let's go.

629
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,653
We can't waste our time here.

630
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,658
You think I'm doing this
because I have time?

631
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,868
I'm busy too.

632
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,454
-I'm busy but we need to find the culprit.
-This is the place.

633
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,500
This is where
the fourth missing person lived.

634
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,877
The people who went missing,
Ms. Song Da-hee

635
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,339
and Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah
used to live in this neighborhood.

636
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:09,924
What?

637
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,968
Who?

638
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,678
The fourth victims?

639
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,181
There are four victims? Not two?

640
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,311
Let me explain.

641
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,313
I mean…

642
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,698
Hey, girls.

643
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,991
-Yes.
-Yes?

644
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:43,708
Hey!

645
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,888
-What the heck?
-Where do you think you're going?

646
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,514
Let me go!

647
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,018
-Die! You pervert.
-I'm sorry.

648
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,102
You psycho!

649
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,189
-You're a jerk!
-I won't flash people again!

650
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,523
I have a bad habit.

651
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,192
I'm sorry.

652
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,238
I'm sorry. I won't ever strip naked again.

653
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,907
So this is where they lived?

654
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,243
Yoo Jeong-ah and Song Da-hee,
the fourth victims, used to live here?

655
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,162
Yes.

656
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,665
This is where
Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah used to live.

657
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,261
Goodness, my little girl.

658
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,513
Have fun at school!

659
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,348
All right. I'll have fun at school.

660
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,016
Don't go anywhere else.

661
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,875
It's a plum tree.

662
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,795
It's 45 years old.

663
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:12,588
How do you know?

664
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:17,426
This used to be my place.

665
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,525
Who are you?

666
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,735
Nobody lives here.

667
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,279
I'm a police officer.

668
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,073
I'm just looking around.
Do you know this neighborhood?

669
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,369
I've been living here for 40 years,
I know pretty much everything.

670
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:48,207
A child went missing in that house
a long time ago.

671
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,001
No one lives here now.

672
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,669
They moved.

673
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,421
It's been over 20 years.

674
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:58,759
Four good-looking guys
used to live in that house.

675
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:00,720
No, it was three.

676
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,388
One of them wasn't good-looking.

677
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:05,433
Anyway, they looked like fairies.

678
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,143
-Fairies?
-Yes.

679
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,936
They looked like fairies.

680
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,647
My girl was after one of the guys.

681
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,774
She gave me such a hard time.

682
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,318
She wasn't the only one.

683
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:19,280
There were so many high school girls
who were after them.

684
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,698
Right! I have photos.

685
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,033
-You want to see them?
-Yes.

686
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,200
I'll bring them out.

687
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,686
Oh, aren't these frogs?

688
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,814
He's just like me.

689
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,821
I guess we both like frogs.

690
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,918
My daughter had a huge crush
on this young man.

691
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,504
Was he single? He wasn't married?

692
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,173
What are you talking about?

693
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,051
My daughter
wouldn't have gone after a married guy.

694
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,719
All three were single.

695
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,263
-I'm sure.
-Single?

696
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,142
Wait! This dog is--

697
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,603
This dog? This was their dog.

698
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,771
What was his name?

699
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,230
Right.

700
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,440
It was Ddaeng-chil.

701
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,193
Ddaeng-chil.

702
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,406
-Let's go.
-Who's the man in the photo?

703
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,408
I told you before.

704
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,285
He's my father.

705
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,796
I guess your father used to fold
origami frogs too. I do that too.

706
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:27,093
I do origami
when I feel upset or insecure.

707
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:31,388
I feel at peace
when I fold about 20 frogs.

708
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,754
Isn't it funny?

709
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,218
Smile.

710
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,345
Come on. Smile.

711
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,639
Could you smile?

712
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,599
Give me a smile.

713
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,643
Look at me and smile.

714
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,188
No, I…

715
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:30,447
I just wanted you to smile.

716
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,590
What's going on?

717
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,181
Ms. Oh.

718
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,726
From now on,
stay away from Cheon Sang-hyuk.

719
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,227
What? What do you mean?

720
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,688
-Why?
-Let me get you home first.

721
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:04,732
But…

722
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,783
I guess we both like frogs.

723
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,493
I guess we both like frogs.

724
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,247
-Why did you stop laughing?
-Why did you stop laughing?

725
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,916
You look pretty when you laugh.

726
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,168
Remember.

727
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,795
The moment you open up your heart
to a lady,

728
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,840
it will end in tragedy.

729
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,389
You already know the answer to that.

730
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,976
That thing you have.
One shot of that will do.

731
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,020
Why?

732
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,397
I'll explain later.

733
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,524
I'll explain everything next time.

734
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,694
Just trust me for now.
Let's get out of here right now.

735
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,488
What? It's a flowerpot.

736
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,076
It seems like they're not cared for
but they're still alive.

737
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,584
Those aren't important right now.

738
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,503
What are you doing?

739
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,338
The wall is pretty.

740
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,132
It's sweet and romantic.

741
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:13,842
Come on.

742
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,804
The breeze feels nice.

743
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,348
Do you want to come up too?

744
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,809
Come up.

745
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,520
Come up and cool down.

746
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,380
Oh Baek-ryeon.

747
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,882
The one that should stay by your side is…

748
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,097
I'll protect her. It's what I'm good at.
