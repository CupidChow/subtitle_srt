1
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,792
I heard this is a famous spot
for blind dates.

2
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,961
My friend went on a blind date here
and got married in the fall.

3
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,505
I'll call you back.

4
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,507
What's the name on your reservation?

5
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,512
It was nice meeting you today.

6
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,431
Yes, you too.

7
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,059
-Good night then…
-Yes, goodbye.

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,426
Mi-seon!

9
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:15,970
Yes?

10
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,471
You wait right there too.

11
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,528
Do you want to watch a movie
with me this weekend?

12
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,238
I fell for you at first sight.

13
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,663
Give me your phone.

14
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,168
This is my number.

15
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,130
And this is my answer.

16
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,264
-Did you confirm my reservation yet?
-You'll be in Room Two.

17
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,099
-This way, please.
-Yes.

18
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,186
LOVE ROOM

19
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:19,366
EP1. I AM A FAIRY

20
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,445
-Hey.
-There we go!

21
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,576
Yes, that's it!

22
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,662
After love swept through…

23
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,833
500 years of desolation.

24
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,837
Welcome back.

25
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,475
I asked you to at least put the dishes
in water after you eat.

26
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,018
How many times do I have to tell you?

27
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,520
That's right!

28
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,688
Oh, man.

29
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,036
Ddaeng-chil, I told you
to go potty on the pad.

30
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,830
I bought you an extra large one!

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,957
Why do you always
do your business on the side?

32
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,886
Hey, Sang-hyuk!

33
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,806
We're leaving in an hour,
so get our food ready.

34
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,735
Man, that was good.

35
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,697
Tonight's meal wasn't half bad,
Chef Sang-hyuk.

36
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,407
Let's go work now.

37
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,995
When will all this hard labor
come to an end?

38
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,414
What kind of hard labor
have you ever done?

39
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,915
He and I've been doing everything.

40
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,292
-What have you done?
-That's right.

41
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,837
It's not like I was partying.
I did a lot too.

42
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,256
I came home at midnight yesterday.

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,051
So you were the one who was doing
a lousy job of shooting?

44
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,054
When I came home from work last night,

45
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,431
I'm sure there was only
a mark missing from there.

46
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,987
Damn Dong-gu.

47
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,114
When I shorten it, you make it longer.

48
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,949
This keeps happening over and over.

49
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,118
Are you working or getting in the way?

50
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,038
Don't you want to leave this world?
Shall we just live here forever?

51
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,664
Where the heck did you go yesterday?

52
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,166
The Golden Horse building.

53
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,877
I fired shots at the men and women
who were working late there. So what?

54
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,340
Didn't it ever occur to you that
some of them might be married?

55
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,259
I forgot about them.

56
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,096
Just stay at home today.

57
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,723
When he turns back into Dong-chil,
I'll work with him.

58
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,767
Don't do anything.

59
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,185
-Not a thing.
-Hey!

60
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,438
I have the right to go wherever I want.

61
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,732
You're not helping at all.

62
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,485
What have you done that's so great?

63
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,611
What have I done?

64
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,866
Are you serious?

65
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,203
The arrow is like that because
I worked my butt off.

66
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,665
Most of that arrow turned to gold
because of me.

67
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,543
Do you even know how I feel?

68
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,087
I have to work with a guy
who keeps turning into a dog

69
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,297
and another guy who's always screwing up.

70
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,634
Do you know how hard it is for me
to work with the two of you?

71
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,387
It's like doing a group project
with two people no one else wants!

72
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,471
I have to do everything!

73
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,640
Hey! It's unfair to me too.

74
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,601
I tried to stop you back then.
Don't you remember?

75
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,146
I said we shouldn't touch that.

76
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,148
So why did you? Why?

77
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,482
Why do you think?

78
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,236
It's all your fault, Sang-hyuk.

79
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,158
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,105
This is all because of you.

81
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,191
We're in this mess

82
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,067
because we were trying to save you.

83
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,861
You know…

84
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,364
You've been telling me that
for the past 500 years.

85
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
No!

86
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,344
My body felt so heavy at the beginning.

87
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,930
We've been stuck in these forms
for the past 500 years!

88
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,308
He was turned into a dog
because he was the one who shot the arrow.

89
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,269
For God's sake, look at his face!

90
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,899
Even as a dog, he looks sad
because he's stuck like this.

91
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,736
I'm sorry. I really am.

93
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,448
Come on. We're almost there.

94
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,659
We just need to work a little more.

95
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,536
We're really almost there now.

96
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,929
Walk time!

97
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,107
Not that one.

98
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,832
Hey, you're really feisty today!

99
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,727
Do you think she was reborn?

100
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,565
I'm talking about the court lady
who made us like this.

101
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,110
Why are you suddenly bringing her up?

102
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,528
No special reason.

103
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,281
I'm just curious.

104
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,201
Maybe it's because we're leaving soon.

105
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,832
She was probably reborn.

106
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,500
Many times.

107
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,002
In different forms.

108
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,226
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

109
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,104
Hello, this is the 24-hour
Gugi-dong Animal Hospital.

110
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,529
POPPY ANIMAL CLINIC

111
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,910
-What was her name again?
-Oh Baek-ryeon.

112
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,120
"Oh Baek-ryeon"?

113
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,790
Her name sounds like a swear word.

114
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,751
They have similar pronunciation,
but her name means "pitiful."

115
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,631
And she's known as
the "Gwyneth Paltrow of Gugi-dong."

116
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,842
I heard that men call her a goddess.

117
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,804
Gwyneth Paltrow? Don't be ridiculous.

118
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,475
Ever since that damn woman came here,
our clinic has been doing terribly.

119
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,645
I need to do something.

120
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,365
Did even Andre change over to her?

121
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,202
You say he's not eating or drinking?

122
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,495
He looks okay though…

123
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,293
The results from the last physical exam
look good too.

124
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,795
I don't see any problem.

125
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,296
There is a problem.

126
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,924
I don't have an appetite for food
nor for water.

127
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,303
Because on my first day here,
an angel came down from heaven

128
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:04,516
and shot me in the heart.

129
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,777
Will you accept it?

130
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,279
My goddess.

131
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm so jealous of her.

132
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,119
I envy her.

133
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,706
What's the point?
It's a useless confession.

134
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,208
Huh? What do you mean?

135
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,502
Why is it useless?

136
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,838
There's no point in being a beauty
who can enchant hundreds of men

137
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,257
when the men get hurt
the day you start dating them.

138
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,010
-Yeah.
-What? They get hurt?

139
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,557
OH BAEK-RYEON, NINE YEARS OLD
FIRST BOYFRIEND, NINE YEARS OLD

140
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,410
FIRST BOYFRIEND'S MISFORTUNE,
BROKEN FINGER

141
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,375
OH BAEK-RYEON, 17 YEARS OLD
SECOND BOYFRIEND, 17 YEARS OLD

142
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,926
SECOND BOYFRIEND'S MISFORTUNE,
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING

143
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,723
THIRD BOYFRIEND - OH BAEK-RYEON

144
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,725
From today, Oh Baek-ryeon is my girl!

145
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,148
THIRD BOYFRIEND'S MISFORTUNE,
BLOOD LOSS

146
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,733
Oh, no! Oh, my gosh!

147
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,068
FOURTH BOYFRIEND - OH BAEK-RYEON

148
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,237
Here's to the first day of our love.

149
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,673
Oh, my gosh! You're choking!

150
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,092
I heard they all got into
some kind of accident.

151
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,552
-They nearly died.
-Help!

152
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,804
FOURTH BOYFRIEND'S MISFORTUNE,
CHOKED ON A RING

153
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,932
So after going through all that,
she doesn't want to endanger another man.

154
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,934
She said that's why
she became a veterinarian.

155
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,728
Because animals don't get hurt
even if she loves them.

156
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,439
Her family must be upset.

157
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,984
Their daughter can't see anyone.

158
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:25,615
Dr. Oh is an orphan.
She doesn't have any family.

159
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,325
Really?

160
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,953
She's never been loved by her parents.

161
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,538
Plus, she can't even meet a man?

162
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,875
My gosh. She must be so lonely.

163
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,297
But she really can't date men?

164
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,507
-I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
-Who knows?

165
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,426
-Maybe heaven will forgive her.
-I'm sorry.

166
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,635
Please forgive me.

167
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,803
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,138
I beg you. Please forgive me.

169
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,682
Please forgive me.

171
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,642
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,768
Please forgive me.

173
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,853
I'm really sorry.

174
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,021
Please forgive me.

175
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,857
Why do these things happen to me?

176
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,776
Why does every man I meet
get into some kind of accident?

177
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,408
THREE YEARS AGO

178
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,202
You committed a grave sin
in your past life.

179
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,039
Huh? A grave sin?

180
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,336
You coveted something you shouldn't have.

181
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,089
Because of that, you've been reborn
and living lonely lives for 500 years.

182
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,675
What exactly did I covet to be punished
for 500 years?

183
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,970
But…

184
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,139
this time, I see one person.

185
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,307
One person?

186
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,809
The man of your destiny.

187
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,151
Climb to the top of Inwangsan Mountain
and face the east side.

188
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,612
You'll see a cliff in that direction.

189
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,990
Go there and beg
with all your heart for forgiveness.

190
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,116
Say that you're sorry.

191
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,078
On the day of the thousandth time
you go up to ask for forgiveness,

192
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,789
someone will appear.

193
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:58,833
Someone will appear?

194
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,127
A man who knows the past will come to you.

195
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,257
Sir.

196
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,884
That's enough.

197
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,220
We just came here to get
a tarot card reading for fun.

198
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,806
But you're saying
all these ridiculous things.

199
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,434
Why can't you just tell her that
those things won't happen from now on

200
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,770
and give her some hope?

201
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:24,442
You want her to hike up Inwangsan Mountain
a thousand times? Can you do that?

202
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,444
It's not like jumping rope
a thousand times.

203
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,198
Why are you so serious?

204
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,574
Get up. Let's go.

205
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,288
7452 9431.

206
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,042
I see three severely injured and one dead.

207
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,130
What is he talking about?
That's enough, mister.

208
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,924
Let's just go.

209
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,763
I guess he says weird things like that
on purpose.

210
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,988
Where's the owner who was here?

211
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,365
The owner? I'm the owner here.

212
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,492
What's the matter?

213
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,703
It was a man. He was sitting right here
reading tarot cards.

214
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,038
What are you talking about?

215
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,664
I'm the owner here.

216
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,916
What man is she talking about?

217
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,668
Then who was that man from earlier?

218
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,077
Why would there be a man here
at this hour?

219
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,458
That man is even prettier than me.

220
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,586
Is he a fairy or something?

221
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,308
What is love?

222
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,019
Do you like someone?

223
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,187
No.

224
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,855
-Did someone ask you out?
-No.

225
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,482
Then why do you ask?

226
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,026
I think I will have to love someone soon.

227
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,613
Well…

228
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,032
I think…

229
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,036
Love is a curse.

230
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,122
So do it when you are older.

231
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,200
Mr. Right?

232
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,660
Of course, he exists.

233
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,125
How do you know
if he's the man of your dreams?

234
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,336
-Do you want to know how?
-Yes. Tell us.

235
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,631
You wear a white dress
with a knife in your mouth.

236
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:43,636
Face the east and bow down 12 times.
Do that for one whole month.

237
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,140
The night you see the first full moon
on the 30th day,

238
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,436
a silhouette will appear on the knife
as you put it down.

239
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,645
A man's silhouette.

240
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:57,316
-He will be the man of your dreams.
-It sounds fun.

241
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,860
-Is there such a thing?
-It's nonsense.

242
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,653
What's this? I'm disappointed.

243
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,905
Right?

244
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,324
Us freaks are very rational.

245
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,868
We don't fall for such things.

246
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,703
What kind of idiot does?

247
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,954
What are you talking about?

248
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,456
She's not stupid.

249
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,418
But there's someone in my house
who believes in things like that.

250
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,883
Seven more times.

251
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,349
I'm done.

252
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,601
What's all this?

253
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,727
When did you get here?

254
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,063
When you started talking
about the man of your dreams.

255
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,108
Gosh.

256
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,989
I feel like I'm drinking with two people.

257
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,159
Who do you want to drink with?

258
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,536
The left side or the right side?

259
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,455
Let's all just drink together.

260
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,961
Hey, did you go again today?

261
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,507
Including today, that's about 990--

262
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,008
993 times.

263
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,718
That's amazing.

264
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,929
How can you go hiking 993 times?

265
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,181
You're really something.

266
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,684
Is this why you're going?

267
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,521
-To enjoy a drink after hiking.
-This is the only joy I have.

268
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,481
-It's lonely up there.
-Hey.

269
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,359
Take me with you on your thousandth hike.

270
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,653
I want to see this man of your destiny

271
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,614
that made you hike up
a mountain 1,000 times.

272
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,993
I did all the hard work.
Why would I bring you with me at the end?

273
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,372
-You want a love triangle?
-If he's worth it…

274
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,374
This is delicious.

275
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,796
I was just kidding. It was a joke.

276
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,881
Just eat your food. It's delicious.

277
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,049
This place makes good food.

278
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,845
Don't say stuff like that.
It will bring bad luck.

279
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,850
LOVE ROOM

280
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,937
Ddaeng-chil!

281
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,190
You punk. Hey, Ddaeng-chil.

282
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,359
-My goodness, that dog.
-Ddaeng-chil.

283
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,071
-Ddaeng-chil.
-Hey, Ddaeng-chil.

284
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,992
Don't hug him too hard. He's a man too.

285
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,953
What are you talking about?
He's not a man. He's just a dog.

286
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,040
-A cute dog.
-You could be wrong.

287
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,501
Welcome. I've prepared it as you asked.

288
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,253
Let's go in.

289
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,380
Hey, come on.

290
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,175
-Hurry up and bring Ddaeng-chil in.
-No, he's so cute.

291
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,343
Let's go, Ddaeng-chil. Come on.

292
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,429
They seem to come every other day.

293
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,265
They're the VIPs at the Love Room.

294
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,767
It seems like they're close to the boss.

295
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,144
We don't know much about them.

296
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,812
It's expensive here though.

297
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,939
They must be very rich.

298
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,942
I got your credit card reissued.

299
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,611
I'm so glad to have a card again.

300
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,905
I had a hard time
without it for the past few days.

301
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,450
In this world,
I'm just a beggar without this.

302
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,287
Use it all you want. I raised the limit.

303
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,875
Really? You're the best, Mr. Park.

304
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,047
Why is your card the only one
that always has a problem?

305
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,132
How much do you even spend?

306
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,302
Hey, I only spend money
at convenience stores.

307
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,639
Dong-pal only goes to expensive
department stores and hotels with women.

308
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,850
You should go, too. Oh, wait.

309
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,685
You don't have a girl to go with.

310
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,692
Hey, it's not like they like you.

311
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,694
They like this.

312
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,447
Then why can't you get girls with that?

313
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,657
My goodness.

314
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,954
I really don't get women.

315
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,206
Why do they like this pale punk?

316
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,540
He isn't cool at all.

317
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,417
I think I know why.

318
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,419
Me too.

319
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,048
Enjoy your meals.

320
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,408
What?

321
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,951
Fairies?

322
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,453
And one of them turns
into a dog all the time?

323
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,457
It all started from the time
of our ancestors.

324
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:31,674
Their finger techniques
made the Love Room what it is today.

325
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:37,096
We are all wealthy thanks to them.

326
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:42,393
So from now on, you have to take
good care of them behind the scenes.

327
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,478
Okay?

328
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,356
Grandpa.

329
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,441
You're teasing me, right?

330
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:58,200
A fairy? He must be messing with me.

331
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,793
Who are you?

332
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,338
Why are you standing there?

333
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,882
-Get out of my way.
-I am that fairy.

334
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,011
You have a crush on someone.

335
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,930
How did you know that?

336
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:23,100
You want me to make her like you?

337
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,324
There are times like that in life.

338
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,450
This is so pretty.

339
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,371
Come take a look around, ma'am.

340
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,832
You start to have feelings
without realizing it.

341
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,586
This is for you. Have it. Take this too.

342
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,962
Take this, okay?

343
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:03,182
Out of the blue, someone starts
to look beautiful to you.

344
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,102
I fell in love with you at first sight.

345
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,527
They look charming.

346
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,487
You feel so in love with them.

347
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,123
Sometimes, it's cheeky.
Sometimes, it's goofy.

348
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,717
We're the ones who made that happen.

349
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,227
That's how we've lived
among humans for 500 years.

350
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,649
As the cupids of love.

351
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,337
-The ears are clean.
-I see.

352
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,181
It's over. We're over.

353
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,392
Please reconsider. I'll be better.

354
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,977
Just go!

355
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,688
Yoon-sol! Please.

356
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,107
Yoon-sol…

357
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,652
Yoon-sol…

358
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,155
Yoon-sol…

359
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,658
Get up.

360
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:54,627
The woman in there is not the one for you.

361
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,128
What do you mean?

362
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,965
Your destiny is very close
to you right now.

363
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,261
So go home.
Have some soju and just forget about her.

364
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,223
Soon, you'll be with someone
with a good heart.

365
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,058
How do you know that?

366
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,851
Who are you?

367
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,645
Who am I?

368
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,738
Hang in there.

369
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,789
What the heck? What does he mean
my destiny is close to me?

370
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm in the mountains.

371
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,890
You're in the mountains again?

372
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,976
It's time for us to eat.
Why are you there?

373
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,435
What about our dinner?

374
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,937
Come home and make our food now.

375
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,690
Can't you eat by yourselves?

376
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,109
You can find rice and side dishes
in the containers.

377
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,653
You're supposed to set it all up for me.

378
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,822
What did you say when we got stuck here?

379
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,615
What did you say?

380
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,076
You said you won't make me work at all.

381
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,121
Rice will stick to my hands
if I take it out from the rice cooker.

382
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,874
And my hands will get messy
if I take out the side dishes!

383
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,918
Why are you going back on your word?

384
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,336
Okay, okay.

385
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,338
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

386
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,009
Jeez.

387
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,179
What?

388
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,151
They didn't even leave their phone number.

389
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,240
4782.

390
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,452
YEON-JA'S MOUNTAIN VALLEY
RESTAURANT

391
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,543
License plate 4782.
Is the owner of that car here?

392
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,420
What, 4782?

393
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,521
Is the owner of that car not here?

394
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,239
Is your license plate 4782?

395
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:30,824
Please move your car.

396
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,046
Honey.

397
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,007
Oh, my goodness!

398
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,552
My gosh! She passed out.

399
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,430
What are you waiting for? Help her up.

400
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:54,932
You want me to help her up?

401
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,268
I heard her calling you "honey" just now.

402
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,897
I'm sorry, but I'm not her boyfriend.

403
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,649
I am her boyfriend.

404
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:08,028
-Don't be ridiculous. I am her boyfriend.
-I'm her boyfriend. My name is Kim Honey!

405
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,323
Jeez!

406
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,909
What are you waiting for?

407
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,121
Are you going to leave your girlfriend
in the care of complete strangers?

408
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,872
I'm a stranger to her too.

409
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:23,752
So you want to see these sly men
take her away?

410
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,630
You may resent her for drinking a lot

411
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,133
but you shouldn't leave her like this.

412
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,802
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and carry her.

413
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,095
What? Carry this lady?

414
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,930
You're her "honey."
Who else is supposed to?

415
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,605
Excuse me.

416
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,276
Wake up. Excuse me!

417
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,446
Hey, don't ask. Just carry her.

418
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,072
Could you help me out here?

419
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,624
That punk is really her boyfriend?
Didn't he say he wasn't earlier?

420
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,920
All right.

421
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,594
-You need to pay the bill.
-What?

422
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,597
How much is it?

423
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,433
Seven bottles of rice wine
and six scallion jeon. It's 102,000 won.

424
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,810
It's a total of 102,000 won.

425
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,314
Are you sure she came by herself?
How did she finish all that on her own?

426
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:30,694
She had it all by herself. Your girlfriend
eats so well. She really does.

427
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,531
-Don't forget to take her bag too.
-Her bag?

428
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:35,616
Yes.

429
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,287
-4782!
-Yes, it's me.

430
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,830
-Is your plate 4782?
-Yes, it's 4782.

431
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,374
-Move your car right now.
-I'm so sorry.

432
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,254
You smell good.

433
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:05,896
Please let go now. Let go. Your arms!

434
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,863
Hey. Where do you live?

435
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,576
Wake up. Where do you live?

436
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,041
Excuse me. Please give me
one more bottle of makgeolli.

437
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,127
Are you serious?

438
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,773
Ddol!

439
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,984
Ddol! Where are you?

440
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,027
Ddol!

441
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,073
I've been looking for you!
What are you doing over there?

442
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,492
Did you find something?

443
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,626
Yes. I think it's them.

444
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,674
-There's a bag here.
-I'll call you later.

445
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,431
406,490 WON

446
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,557
There's one more bag.

447
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,397
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

448
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,691
-I'm exhausted today.
-Detective Park.

449
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,984
You scared me.

450
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,321
I heard the skeletons are the girls
from the Polka Dot High School Girls case.

451
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,907
I need to see the DNA results
to confirm it.

452
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,661
I'll talk to you later. I'm busy.

453
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,665
Known as the "Missing Polka Dot
High School Girls" case…

454
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,167
YOO JEONG-AH

455
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,297
…Yoo Jeong-ah's and Song Da-hee's remains
were recently found at Inwangsan Mountain.

456
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,132
Reporter Lee Ju-won is covering the story.

457
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,344
The 1993 case drew attention
when people found out that

458
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,139
both of the missing girls were wearing
the same polka-dot coats.

459
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,683
Numerous investigative forces
were dispatched.

460
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,312
But they couldn't catch the culprit,
so it remains unsolved.

461
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,279
Did you have a good sleep?

462
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,744
-Why am I here?
-A man dropped you off here last night.

463
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,498
-He said he found you on the streets.
-What? I was sleeping on the street?

464
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,379
But…

465
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,464
who was it?

466
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,189
How was the meal?

467
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,358
It was all right.

468
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,529
Ever since we got a new chef,
things seemed to be unstable for a while.

469
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,281
But now they seem to be settling down.

470
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,909
I'm glad you liked the food.

471
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,953
I'll do my best to serve you
until you leave.

472
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,332
Finally, I'm left
with the last metamorphosis.

473
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,754
May I watch over that last one for you?

474
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,258
A metamorphosis is not something
that people watch.

475
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,343
I will go quietly.

476
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,805
I understand, sir.

477
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,433
This is for you.

478
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,274
I went there with my family on the weekend
and thought of you.

479
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,403
Do you think people know…

480
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,072
that you're so close to us?

Everything that can be used
as evidence has decomposed.

490
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,914
There is also nothing special
about her belongings.

491
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,885
I like you.

492
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:56,770
I'll wait for you at the park
at 10:00 p.m. after school.

493
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,025
I'll wait there forever.
You better show up.

494
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,320
See you later.

495
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:15,997
It's going to snow for the first time
this year today. It's going to snow a lot.

496
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,122
Excuse me.

497
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,249
Please find my girl.

498
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,587
Please help me find my daughter.

499
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:28,862
I…

500
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,951
I climbed up this mountain
countless times.

501
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,916
I can't believe she was here
this whole time.

502
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,592
She must have been so scared.

503
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,262
She must've been…

504
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,099
so cold.

505
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:31,091
There is a heavy snow warning
in the metropolitan area.

506
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,511
Starting today, we expect heavy snow
in the metropolitan area.

507
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,640
-What? He wasn't your boyfriend?
-No.

508
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,352
If I had a boyfriend,

509
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,938
I wouldn't have climbed up that mountain.

510
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,150
Then why did you pass out on that guy
after calling him "honey" that day?

511
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,111
Who is that young man?

512
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,321
They told me about him
at the police station too.

513
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:57,409
My goodness. I guess you can't remember.

514
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,661
-So you want makgeolli and scallion jeon?
-Yes.

515
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,418
Who on earth is he?

516
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,086
I called him "honey"?

517
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,006
The rest of the country
except for the east coast

518
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,799
will have one to five centimeters of snow.

519
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,563
Come to think of it,
I think he smelled nice.

520
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,608
Don't drink too much by yourself.
You should drink together.

521
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,861
She came alone too.

522
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,908
You should drink with her.
It's more fun to drink with others.

523
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,881
Get home safely.

524
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,508
You get home safely too.

525
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,928
Wait.

526
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,376
What's going on?

527
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,711
Damn it.

528
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,651
Is he out of his mind?

529
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,741
What the hell? Is he crazy?

530
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,262
What's wrong with him?
Why is he doing this?

531
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,564
Hey! Go away!

532
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,108
Go!

533
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,943
I said go away! Damn it!

534
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,250
Why are you doing this?

535
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:37,253
A man who abandons his child has given up
on being a human.

536
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,799
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.

537
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,345
I hope you're reborn as a good person.

538
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,889
Hold on. I'm sorry.

539
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,849
I said I'm sorry!

540
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,628
Where were you?

541
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:23,466
You must've been so cold.

542
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,639
Baek-ryeon.

543
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,727
What do you think love is?

544
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,189
I don't know. I've never been in love.

545
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,110
What? You've never been in love?

546
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,988
But you're a gorgeous woman.
What happened?

547
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:51,995
Well, I heard I committed a big sin
in my past life.

548
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,706
That's why I can't date a man.

549
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,751
What? That's nonsense.
There's no such thing.

550
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,254
I didn't want to believe it either,

551
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,257
but I had no choice but to believe it.

552
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,469
What do you think love is, Eun-seo?

553
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,433
Fate.

554
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:18,438
Something that always finds you.

555
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,320
Fate? Something that always finds you.

556
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,697
I didn't do anything wrong.

557
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,660
It's not a sin.

558
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:41,252
This too is fate.
Why don't we exchange numbers?

559
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,549
Sure, why not? Hold on.

560
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,928
I think I forgot to bring my phone.

561
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:56,184
I'll just call your number.
Save it when you get home.

562
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,602
Tell me your number.

563
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,313
Okay. It's 010…

564
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,399
-07--
-Give me a second.

565
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,861
Hello?

566
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,614
You are here?

567
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,991
Okay. I'll be right there.

568
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,580
Was that the man of your dreams?

569
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,629
Your battery is out.

570
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,384
You forgot to bring your phone.

571
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,303
And my battery is out.
What's wrong with us?

572
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,015
Does fate not want us to meet again?

573
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,233
I'm a woman who defies fate.

574
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:53,533
Here.

575
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,327
I hope we see each other again.

576
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,663
I'll call you.

577
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,168
No, I'll pay for it.

578
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:09,674
You can get the bill next time we meet.

579
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,929
Sure. Thank you for the meal.

580
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,013
Sure.

581
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,167
It was nice meeting you.

582
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,546
Let's meet again soon.

583
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,275
GUGI-DONG ANIMAL HOSPITAL

584
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:19,702
Dr. Oh, you should go and see this.

585
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,995
What is this?

586
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,540
"God of Love"? "Cupid Special Exhibition"?

587
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,210
I thought you might need some help
from the God of Love.

588
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,796
-You heard my story?
-Yes.

589
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,005
Who knows?

590
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,467
Cupid might aim his bow at you.

591
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:38,471
Then you'll fall in love at the gallery.

592
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,516
They better not show up in front of me.

593
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,770
I have a lot of complaints to make.

594
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:49,690
GOD OF LOVE
CUPID SPECIAL EXHIBIT INVITATION

595
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,747
GOD OF LOVE

596
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:29,438
There will be no love in your life.

597
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:37,947
I won't set you up with anyone.

598
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,127
SPECIAL EXHIBITION: GOD OF LOVE
"THE LEGENDARY CUPID"

599
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:17,278
This is a painting of
a girl fighting against Cupid.

600
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:21,490
Cupid tries to stick his arrow.
But the girl refuses it.

601
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:26,287
If you look closely, it looks like
she actually wants the arrow.

602
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,291
So it may be that she's not pushing the
arrow away, rather pulling it towards her.

603
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:35,296
Isn't love something that you're afraid of
but you really want to experience?

604
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,509
Eros first appeared in art around 570 BC.

605
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:44,388
He is also the son of Aphrodite and…

606
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,828
What kind of a god is Cupid?

607
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:11,582
-What did you say?
-What kind of god is he?

608
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,756
-What kind of god? He is…
-He's a jerk.

609
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,055
He's a mean bastard
who never shoots an arrow at me.

610
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,600
Otherwise, why would I be so lonely?

611
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:34,897
Does she know me?

612
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,363
Hold on. Isn't she…

613
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,408
Honey.

614
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,451
The drunk woman?

615
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,210
-Teacher!
-What's wrong?

616
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,296
-She said Cupid is a bastard.
-What?

617
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:02,133
What?

618
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,594
Why would she swear at a kid?

619
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,472
Did you just call me a bastard?

620
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:10,683
Are you Cupid?

621
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,687
-Well, no.
-I called Cupid a bastard.

622
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,440
Why did you look at me when you said that?

623
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,943
People will judge me if I look at the boy.

624
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,992
I'm sorry.

625
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:31,787
I didn't know he would go
and tell his teacher.

626
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,085
He's running away
after a one-night stand. What a jerk.

627
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,089
What? Do you mean this guy?

628
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,425
This is such a noble painting.

629
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,594
How could you have such a barbaric idea?

630
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,304
You think this is noble?

631
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:52,808
He's running away.
He's running away while she's sleeping.

632
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:56,020
-That's what a thug would do.
-A thug?

633
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,565
It reminds me of the thug who left me
at the police station a few days ago.

634
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,321
-A thug.
-Why did he even leave me there?

635
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,327
Wait.

636
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,666
You…

637
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,381
Honey.

638
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,716
Honey?

639
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,511
Pardon?

640
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,890
I am right. You are that guy
I called "honey."

641
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,977
-No, I'm not your "honey."
-What on earth did you do to me?

642
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,062
What did I do?

643
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,231
I was having a glass of makgeolli
at the restaurant.

644
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,983
-Why did you leave me at a police station?
-Just a glass of makgeolli?

645
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,486
You had seven bottles of makgeolli
and six scallion jeon.

646
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,405
It was a total of 102,000 won.
You had all that.

647
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,782
And I paid the bill.

648
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,493
-Why did you pay?
-The restaurant owner told me to.

649
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,579
-Why did she do that?
-Because you called me "honey."

650
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:58,374
-You could've refused.
-I did,

651
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,835
and she accused me of being a jerk.

652
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,337
She said even if I resent my girlfriend
for drinking too much,

653
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,674
I can't abandon her among
men with bad intentions.

654
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,843
And that day, you got on my back.

655
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,429
Is that why you abandoned me
at the police station?

656
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:17,143
You were so drunk that you didn't reply
when I asked where you lived.

657
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:22,148
Well, you did say, "Please give me
one more bottle of makgeolli."

658
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:31,490
You could have left me at a warm place.
Motels aren't that expensive.

659
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:36,245
I didn't want you to call me
a thug the next day.

660
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,175
Thank you.

661
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,683
After hearing all that, it seems you're
quite the gentleman. What's your name?

662
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,727
-It's fine.
-Is that your name?

663
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,478
I don't think we need to exchange names.

664
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,189
How about just a nickname?

665
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,858
I'm Gwyneth of Gugi-dong.

666
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,403
-Gwyneth?
-Gwyneth Paltrow.

667
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,741
-You don't know who she is?
-Of course I do.

668
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,576
I know.

669
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:17,536
Are you drinking again?

670
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,541
It's not me. Men call me that.

671
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:26,754
They say I look like Gwyneth Paltrow.
They think I'm delicate like a flower.

672
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,840
I see.

673
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,929
Do you have a nickname?

674
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,264
-I don't.
-Then should I come up with one?

675
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:41,101
-I don't think that's necessary.
-You can be Superman.

676
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,356
-Superman?
-You said you saved me.

677
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,399
You saved me from the men
with bad intentions.

678
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,987
I'll call you "Mr. Superman"
if we meet each other again.

679
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,407
Do you think we'll meet again?

680
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,076
You never know.

681
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,244
Who knows?

682
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:00,871
Maybe the next time we meet,
we'll be each other's flowers.

683
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:06,627
"When I called out his name,
he came to me and became a flower."

684
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,671
You know "Flower" by Kim Chun-soo, right?

685
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:09,880
You know what?

686
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,508
I don't form bonds with people.

687
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,095
-What?
-Especially with women.

688
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,680
You don't?

689
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,268
I want to though.

690
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:33,988
I really want to form bonds with people.

691
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,286
I have a story.

692
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,622
I have a reason
why I don't have a boyfriend.

693
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,126
So I want to ask them if I have a chance.

694
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,837
I want to ask them,
"Why are you so mean to me only?"

695
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,799
Just one arrow.

696
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,760
I just want one shot at love.

697
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,686
I should have a heartwarming memory
of being with someone.

698
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,275
What's up with this woman?

699
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:21,285
Look at his wild biceps.

700
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:24,246
He's totally sexy.

701
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,752
She has no one she's destined to be with?

702
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:57,738
What in the world?

703
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,449
She really has no red thread of fate.

704
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,855
You pretended like you were not,
but you're so predictable.

705
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,067
-Predictable?
-Is that how you've been looking at me?

706
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,944
With such passion in your eyes?

707
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,154
I was looking at the painting near you.

708
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,740
-That one.
-I'm as beautiful as the painting, right?

709
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:47,663
-What?
-I have eyes in the back of my head.

710
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,416
It's because men stare so much
at me from behind.

711
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,042
So I have eyes here now.

712
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,592
Don't fall for me.

713
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,888
You'll get hurt if you fall for me.

714
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,855
I'm saving you too.

715
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,607
Don't fall for me
if you don't want to get hurt.

716
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,609
I don't think you need to worry.

717
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:19,069
Don't be so sure.

718
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,155
You'll fall for me
if you let your guard down.

719
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,332
By the way, what is this smell?

720
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,014
-What are you doing?
-Hold on. I smell something.

721
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,184
What smell?

722
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:30,052
