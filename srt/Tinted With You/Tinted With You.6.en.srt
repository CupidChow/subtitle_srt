1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,500
Why did you not say anything and let him hit you?

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,170
Look at your face.

3
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,790
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,900
Since I know how he feels.

5
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,330
I know what it's like to worry about you.

6
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,360
I also felt bad, so I couldn't say anything.

7
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,680
Tinted With You
Episode 6: Posthumous Work

8
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,020
You're going to wear out the sword doing that every day.

9
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,550
- About yesterday ...
- Never mind.

10
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,050
I'm sorry about that.

11
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,930
There's no need to apologize.

12
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,970
I don't know whether you feel the same about

13
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,070
the grand prince as I do,

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,480
but it's true that I worried you.

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,680
I would have done the same thing if I were in your shoes.

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,540
In any case, how long are you going to stay here?

17
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,650
I don't know either.

18
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,650
I wonder if I'll ever be able to go back.

19
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,000
I only asked out of worry. It seems like it's been well over 15 days since you came here.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,970
You won't go to the palace and you keep staying on here.

21
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,680
Your parents and friends must be worried about you.

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,590
I'm sure.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,010
I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable, though.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,780
I saying it because,

25
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,770
in one sense, I'm glad to have you around.

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,670
What do you mean?

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,430
Since His Highness was exiled here,

28
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,000
he's never smiled once.

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,950
He's started smiling a lot ever since you came, so I'm relieved.

30
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,360
I envy you.

31
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:27,010
When he was alone with me, I never saw the kind of expression he has when he's smiling with you.

32
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,180
Hold on.

33
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,270
One day, two days,

34
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,130
three days?

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,900
That's crazy.

36
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,890
Next week is my final exam.

37
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,530
Hold on, what do I do?

38
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,540
Mom and Dad must be worried sick, too, right now.

39
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,390
I do need to go back, but what do I do? I'm in trouble.

40
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,640
But how am I supposed to get back there?! Seriously.

41
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,810
That's right!

42
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,460
That picture. The picture!

43
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,960
I just need to find it!

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,740
Where did I put it?

45
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,420
Oh, it's here.

46
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,360
It's here!

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,030
It's here!

48
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,670
Hey, hey!

49
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,380
What is it?

50
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,540
By chance, have you seen this painting before?

51
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,660
Not sure. I've never seen it before.

52
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,350
- Take a close look.
- I said, I don't know.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,350
Oh, the background does look like this village.

54
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,030
What do I do?

55
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,590
Oh, right!

56
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,990
Heon might know.

57
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,720
His Highness is a prince after all.

58
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,050
Right.

59
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,090
Your Highness, Your Highness! Where are you?

60
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,470
Look at this.

61
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,560
Have you seen this painting before?

62
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,850
No, I haven't

63
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,770
Huh?

64
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,570
Really?

65
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,030
Take a good look.

66
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,810
What...

67
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,100
What is this item?

68
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,240
♫ In the silent, dark, lonely time  ♫

69
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,130
♫ In the silent, dark, lonely time  ♫

70
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,370
This is a printout of a painting.

71
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,340
♫  When the feeling of yearning intensifies  ♫

72
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,720
By chance,

73
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,160
Do you perhaps know who Prince Eun An is?

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
♫  The sight of you approaching crosses time and comes to me  ♫

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,930
If you look,

76
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,450
If you look, it has that person's... Yoo...

77
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,430
♫  Can't our eyes meet while holding you in my embrace like then? ♫

78
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,300
But...

79
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,610
I felt this since before.

80
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,540
Doesn't it look similar to your painting?

81
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,660
♫  Don't leave as though you are running away  ♫

82
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,990
♫ Please stay here for me ♫

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,100
♫  Forgive me for foolishly not being able to hold you back  ♫

84
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,420
♫  Return to me  ♫

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,950
I think this place is suitable.

86
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,830
Who painted this?

87
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,490
♫  The one who smiles brightly at me  ♫

88
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,230
♫  I can see you there  ♫

89
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:00,230
♫  A dream which wandered in the pouring rain  ♫

90
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,120
♫  If I wake up, will I miss you? ♫

91
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,840
♫  Even If I hasten my footsteps  ♫

92
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:21,510
♫  and almost reach you, you disappear  ♫

93
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:33,300
♫  Can't our eyes meet while holding you in my embrace like then?  ♫

94
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,540
♫  Don't leave as though you are running away ♫

95
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,780
♫ Please stay here for me. ♫

96
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,300
♫ Forgive me for foolishly not being able to hold you back  ♫

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,650
The sun is at high noon.

98
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,170
Are you still sleeping?

99
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,170
♫  Return to me ♫

100
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,940
♫ Someday we will meet ♫

101
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,790
♫  Even if I stay up crying all night  ♫

102
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,200
I have something to tell you.

103
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,880
♫  I am full of unforgettable memories  ♫

104
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,540
What is it?

105
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,970
♫ You'll be in my arms  ♫

106
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,680
It's probably hard for you to believe,

107
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,200
but far in the future from now... I mean ...

108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,300
♫ I love you. I miss you.  ♫

109
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,580
I came from the year 2021.

110
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,290
Tinted With You

111
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,540
The painting I showed you yesterday, let's complete it together.

112
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,930
- Why...
- It's my favorite painting.

113
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,370
♫  I will regret while looking  ♫

114
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,330
I came to realize that people are warm

115
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,120
thanks to you.

116
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,500
I thank you, too,

117
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,360
for protecting me.

118
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,490
Why did you all hide it from me?!

119
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,570
Come with me.

120
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,780
Tinted With You
