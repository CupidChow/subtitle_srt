1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,930
Will you really be alright?

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,990
Yes, I assure you. So do not worry.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,770
Listen! His Highness told you he will be fine!

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,460
People who are creative like us

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,080
need our souls to be free.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,370
While being under your surveillance

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,370
it won't be possible to set alight the artistic spirit!

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,640
Why you...

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,110
It's okay.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,310
The villagers don't know who we are anyway.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,080
So there won't be much danger.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,030
I understand.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,680
If something happens to His Highness,

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,710
you will die by my hands.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,670
I got it, I got it. So rigid.

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,590
Let's go then, Your Highness.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,890
Tinted With You
Episode 5: Harmony

18
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,190
Your Highness!

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,280
Hurry on up and take a look!

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,800
I think this place is suitable.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,350
I think so, too.

22
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,230
There.

23
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,400
You're good.

24
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,110
Give me your hand for a moment.

25
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,210
Let me fold your sleeves.

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,660
You once asked

27
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,140
if there was someone I loved.

28
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,300
Do you remember?

29
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,900
For me, staying alive and not dying was all there was to my life.

30
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,430
And at my age,

31
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,410
I've never even thought about love.

32
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,260
To be honest,

33
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,300
how could I even love?

34
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,150
When I couldn't even marry the person

35
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,990
they chose for me?

36
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,590
You were thinking about my sleeves and only got your clothes dirty.

38
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,520
No, it's okay.

39
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,530
♫  Don't leave as though you are running away  ♫

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,900
♫ Please stay here with me ♫

41
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:09,000
♫ Forgive me for foolishly not being able to hold you back ♫

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,270
♫  Return to me.  ♫

43
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,550
What's wrong with it?

44
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,550
Over here...

45
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,700
♫ You once smiled brightly at me ♫

46
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,380
I think you can keep painting.
♫ The one who smiles brightly at me ♫

47
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,690
It's really good. Who painted it again?
♫ I can see you there  ♫

48
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,000
I did.
♫ I can see you there  ♫

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,100
♫ A dream which wandered in the pouring rain ♫

50
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,930
♫ If I wake up, will I miss you?  ♫

51
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,570
♫ Even If I hasten my footsteps ♫

52
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:19,200
♫ and almost reach you, you disappear ♫

53
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:31,100
♫ Can't our eyes meet while holding you in my embrace like then? ♫

54
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,310
♫  Don't leave as though you are running away  ♫

55
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,640
♫ Please stay here for me ♫

56
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:51,700
♫  Forgive me for foolishly not being able to hold you back  ♫

57
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,180
♫  Return to me  ♫

58
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,580
♫  Someday we will meet  ♫

59
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,330
♫  Even if I stay up crying all night  ♫

60
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,610
♫  I am full of unforgettable memories  ♫

61
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,420
♫  You'll be in my arms  ♫

62
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,860
♫ and whisper like a star like then  ♫

63
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,130
♫  I love you. I miss you.  ♫

64
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,380
♫  Let's return  ♫

65
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:53,450
♫ I will regret while looking at the petals scattered like the wind ♫

66
00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:00,780
♫  Return to me  ♫

67
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,330
Your Highness!

68
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,020
Sorry, we're late.

69
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,440
Did you get hurt anywhere?

70
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,190
What happened to your face?

71
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,950
I'm fine.

72
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,040
You bastard!

73
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,240
Do you know what time it is?! The sun has set already!

74
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,210
Geum.

75
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,290
Why are you being so rude?!

76
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,750
If His Highness gets hurt because of you...

77
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,960
That's enough!

78
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,310
I swore I would give up my life in order to protect you.

79
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,900
But...

80
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,520
- Your Highness—
- I'm sorry.

81
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,060
♫ Can you see me? ♫

82
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,640
I knew you'd be worried,

83
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,750
♫ I look at you ♫

84
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,040
but because the sunset was so beautiful, I...

85
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,620
♫ again today.

86
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,710
♫ A day passes ♫

87
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,720
Still, must you beat him up like this?

88
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,740
I dared to

89
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,720
push it too far.

90
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,110
♫ someday maybe ♫

91
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,940
♫ won't you ♫

92
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,410
I apologize, Your Highness.

93
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,000
It's alright.

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,110
I'll go in first then.

95
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,890
♫ I'm imagining to myself ♫

96
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,410
♫ I'm holding on ♫

97
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,550
♫ Don't go without saying anything. ♫

98
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,110
♫ Don't leave me ♫

99
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,120
Tinted With You

100
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,690
♫ Don't go ♫

101
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,140
I know how you feel. I know you're worried for me.

102
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,050
How long are you going to stay here?

103
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,650
Next week is the final exam!

104
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,570
By chance, have you seen this painting before?

105
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,020
What is this item?

106
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,960
Do you know who Prince Eun An is?

107
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,880
♫ Once more again ♫

108
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
I have to tell you something.

109
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,840
I met a lady at a gallery.

110
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,320
If you did indeed come from the future...

111
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,690
What can I do?

112
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,180
Only you can save His Highness.

113
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,410
Tinted With You
