00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,660
Tinted With You
Episode 4: Same feelings

2
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,590
Let go. Let go!

3
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,390
What are you doing now to a friend!

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,030
Be careful Eun Ho!
- Sir!

5
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,190
Eun Ho!

6
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,660
Hey, what are you doing now?

7
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,650
Why did you try to harm Crown Prince?

8
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,610
I came here by order of the queen.

9
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,270
This was the only way to protect myself and my family.

10
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,950
Do you call those words, that you speak?

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,990
If you come any closer, this person dies as well.

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,360
I have family in Hanyang.

13
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,420
I have to go to Hanyang.

14
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,770
So please, just spare my life.

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,010
Or I will die with this fellow.

16
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,480
He wasn't...

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Seo Jin.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,020
Geum.

19
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,960
I will not kill you.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,410
So help Eun Ho.

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,890
In return, send this letter to the king.

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,090
Thank you.

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,130
Are you alright?

24
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,760
Your Highness, even after seeing this situation, how could you not...

25
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,870
Because if you, His Highness was about to be put in danger.

26
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,270
I'm sorry about that.

27
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,890
That's why we're lying together like this.

28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,340
Must we lie down together like this in this small room?

29
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,440
It's dangerous tonight, so it's best that we sleep here like this.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,630
"It's dangerous tonight, so it's best that we sleep here like this," he said.

31
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,860
Hurry and sleep. It'll be morning soon.

32
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,810
He says it'll be morning soon, so let's hurry up and go to sleep.

33
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:48,370
To have the two of you protect me, I feel so safe.

34
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,770
What was with all that fuss yesterday?

35
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,080
I really wonder if I'll be able to go back.

36
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,580
You, thanks to the generous grace of Crown Prince, you were spared twice.

37
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,310
I know too.

38
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,760
Then what about you?

39
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,660
Since I didn't anticipate the situation yesterday, I'm no different.

40
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,680
I notice this every time I look up, but the sky here is so clear.

41
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,840
Of course.

42
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,490
Actually, I am curious about something.

43
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,390
Well, Heon... No, His Highness the Crown Prince.

44
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,450
Why did he get exiled?

45
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm sure he didn't commit treason.

46
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,290
No matter how much I think about it, he doesn't seem like the type to commit sins.

47
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,260
Well.

48
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,760
If we are to talk about His Highness the Crown Prince's wrongdoings,

49
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,540
it would be that the king held him dear.

50
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,270
And...

51
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,500
that he was beloved by everyone.

52
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,130
What is it? Why are you coming out of that room?

53
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,290
You were sleeping so deeply, I was worried I'd disturb your sleep.

54
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,350
Did you sleep well?

55
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,340
By the way...

56
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,300
are you perhaps a painter?

57
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,220
Painter?

58
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,880
In simple terms, you're correct since I'm an East Asian painting major.

59
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,650
I don't know what that means.

60
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,070
It's similar to a painter.

61
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,850
But why are you asking that so suddenly?

62
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,720
The thing is...

63
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,750
What is it? Tell me.

64
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,220
After I came here,

65
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,610
well, I felt lonely,

66
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,210
so I used to paint sometimes.

67
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,270
I can't say that I made a great effort

68
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,810
but painted them roughly.

69
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,060
Take a look and tell me how they are.

70
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,950
You painted them so well.

71
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,710
Is it true you painted them just as a hobby?

72
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,910
Do you mean it?

73
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,090
Of course!

74
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,980
Your style is distinctive and alive,

75
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,970
and it's good enough for you to have a dedicated exhibition.

76
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,320
Well, I never learned to paint but I did try my best in my own way.

77
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,590
Whoa, that's awesome.

78
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,280
Oh? Wh-What is this?

79
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,010
Your cheeks. Why are your cheeks red?

80
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,120
- Why are your cheeks getting redder?
- No, they're not.

81
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,770
Do you know you're subtly cute?

82
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,570
I don't know what you're saying. Are they lacking in any way?

83
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,510
Why are you asking if they're lacking?

84
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,600
It's a painting full of only strong points.

85
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,070
You're not used to compliments?

86
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,750
My father and his ministers also,

87
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,140
even the teachers were all harsh.

88
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,350
Geum also.

89
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,870
But I don't compliment easily.

90
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,100
This is an amazing painting with nothing to pick at.

91
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,910
I'm the same.

92
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,000
I've never shown my paintings to anyone.

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Eun Ho, you're the first.

94
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,640
♫  Looking at you today,  ♫

95
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,800
Since you say I'm the first, I feel a little special.

96
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,040
♫  Don't go without saying anything.  ♫

97
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,970
Wow.

98
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,030
♫  Don't leave me  ♫

99
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,000
♫  I'm always waiting  ♫

100

Tinted With You

101
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,340
To those of us who are artists,

102
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,540
our souls have to be free.

103
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,130
♫  Step by step, step by step  ♫

104
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,660
♫  I want to approach you  ♫

105
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,820
Do you think I could dare to love?

106
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,240
♫  But you are so ♫

107
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,100
♫  far away.  ♫

108
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
♫  Will I be able to go?  ♫

109
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,390
Tinted With You
