He's not from here.

What do you mean?

You already know.

We're not from this village, and he's not from here either.

Even if he fails to deliver my letter,

he says he has a place to return to, so we must let him go.

Your Highness, please don't say such things.

I will protect you forever.

What am I supposed to do then?

28
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,050
I have spare clothes in my room.

I met him by chance while on my way.

Then how are you going to deliver that letter?

103
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,550
Since he's here with me, I'll look for a way to return home first.

104
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,620
I'll make sure to deliver this.

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,710
miss early admissions?

125
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,080
Seo Jin, you should have told me.

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,260
It's okay. It's fine.
