1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,820
Were you sent here by the king?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,740
I've been telling you, I don't even know where I am.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,880
Impudent!

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,370
Doesn't his appearance seem really suspicious?

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,080
It's just my school uniform.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm a high school student.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,330
I'll be on my way, so please let me just make one phone call.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,730
Guys like you have shown up here dozens of times.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,030
Of course, not a single one of you survived.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,040
Wait.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,930
Seo Jin planned this, didn't he?

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,900
To fool me.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,460
Oh, I'm right.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,560
This is Folk Village, right?

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,570
No, is it a movie set or something?

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,040
Are you maybe actors?

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,120
The clothes seem that way, too.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,560
Tinted With You
Episode 2: Mission

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,460
That must be it.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,790
This, what is it?

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,720
It's an eraser.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
Be respectful!

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,160
Then what's this?

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,690
It is like a brush but stronger.

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,190
Thin and dark.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,460
What are you doing?

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,620
Here. This is how you use it.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,770
Then what is this?

29
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,900
Did you shave down seashells to make it?

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,430
That's...

31
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,960
Hey! What are you doing, really!

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,500
I will spare your life, so return to the palace with a letter for my brother, His Majesty.

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,300
Your Highness, what are you saying? He is a dangerous person.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,570
Excuse me.

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,410
Why should I have to do that?

36
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,500
There are many things I have to go and do.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm going to go home, not to the palace.

38
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,180
Do you choose to die here

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,030
or will you deliver the letter?

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,560
Why should I die here, seriously?

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,370
If you don't accept His Highness' command, your life ends, here and now.

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,050
Geum.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,020
I only have to deliver the letter, right?

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,750
Yes.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,810
I'll do it.

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,820
Why do you leave him alive?

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,780
He will end up threatening you, too, Your Highness.

48
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,710
Geum.

49
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,020
Don't call me Your Highness anymore.

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,990
I don't want to live,

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,390
but doesn't that person wish to live?

52
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,750
They must all be idiots. Why can't they understand anything?

53
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,620
You need to give this to His Highness.

54
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,510
Is this all?

55
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,200
To deliver it—

56
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,030
I have to know something in order to deliver it, so can I ask a question?

57
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,070
Don't ask any useless questions.

58
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,110
I'm not saying I won't go.

59
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,190
I will go, but I need to know to whom I'm delivering the letter.

60
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,910
The name or address.

61
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,460
Don't you have a picture or something?

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,290
There are social networks too.

63
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,680
You can send a TM (text message).

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,190
T-T-T...

65
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,390
It's His Majesty.

66
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,040
This is so frustrating, really. What are you talking about since earlier?

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,350
The king of this land.

68
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,820
The king?

69
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Oh. It's the king, is it?

70
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,030
So you're saying His Majesty is really His Majesty?

71
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,430
And that audacious person in that room is really the crown prince?

72
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,510
- Seriously, you—
- Be careful what you say!

73
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,340
This isn't the Republic of Korea, is it?

74
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,430
While speaking the Joseon language, how can you not know what country you live in?

75
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,160
Is this really Joseon?

76
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,220
Fine. Well, if it's inside of a painting

77
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,320
this could happen.

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,110
Why can't it?

79
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,880
Why can't...

80
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,910
But I'm not going to go to be tortured

81
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,660
or be put in danger by going, right?

82
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,030
If you're suspicious go ahead and read it first.

83
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,810
You must be illiterate.

84
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,840
I really have come to the Joseon age.

85
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,870
Shall I read it for you?

86
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,770
It's fine. I can mostly get the gist of it by looking.

87
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,460
Go ahead and kill the person who brings this right away...

88
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,900
Your Majesty, this guy is a traitor or barbarian. It's nothing like that, right?

89
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,670
Right?

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,430
I didn't read the letter so I don't know the details of it.

91
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,840
Leave tomorrow as soon as there's daylight.

92
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,650
Whatever.

93
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,640
How am I going to get home?

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,270
What are you doing?

95
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,310
Why are you so shocked? It makes me feel bad.

96
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,110
I think it's because for the past few days,

97
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,580
I keep meeting people who want to kill me.

98
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,340
Why are you not sleeping and out here?

99
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,940
Why do you think?

100
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,460
Just because, like you,

101
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,630
I have a lot of worries.

102
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,960
"Like you."

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,560
It's the first time I've been addressed so casually.

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,770
Like me, I know that you're also

105
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,360
not from here.

106
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,550
Now you believe me?

107
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,980
It must be that I recognize a stranger in a strange place.

108
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,540
You don't need to deliver the letter so leave tomorrow.

109
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,300
What? Really?

110
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,920
Geum will definitely kill you to protect me,

111
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,640
so there's no way to send you away except for this.

112
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,010
Thank you. Thank you.

113
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,520
But I did look at the letter.

114
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,510
I couldn't understand what it said.

115
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,720
Could I ask what you wrote?

116
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm embarrassed, but the reason I've been made out to be a traitor

117
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,320
is because I was framed.

118
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,160
To forgive me and not hate me.

119
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,640
That because of my brother's benevolence, I've come to

120
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,530
this beautiful place, and that I will live here until I die.

121
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:47,510
For him to forget this brother and live comfortably.

122
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,510
That's what I wrote.

123
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,930
You wrote something like that but I don't have to deliver it?

124
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,250
Don't worry.

125
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm going to live my life. Don't you have to live your life also?

126
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,850
What is your name?

127
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,080
Heon. Lee Heon.

128
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,550
♫ Don't go. Please stay here for me. ♫

129
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,190
♫  Forgive me for foolishly not being able  ♫

130
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,350
Tinted With You
♫  to hold you back ♫

131
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,370
He is not from here.

132
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,810
You have to dress neatly.

133
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,340
♫ Someday we will meet ♫

134
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,550

♫ Someday we will meet ♫

135
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,830
♫ Even if I stay up crying all night ♫

136
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,220
Tinted With You
