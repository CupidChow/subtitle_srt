1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,240
You may not believe it,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,810
but I am from the future. So ...

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,900
I am from 2021.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,630
I met a lady at an art gallery and

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,010
at that time, I saw a strange painting.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,850
When I woke up,

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,760
I had come to the same place as in the painting.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,220
And the lady said
 Excuse me!

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,960
You will be able to return only when you've finished your task.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,360
She said that I could only return once I completed the painting.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,230
So, that painting ... can return me to where I belong,

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,050
but only once the painting has been completed.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,520
If what you say is correct ...

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,350
If you're indeed from the future,

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,810
His Highness, in the end...

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,570
by the poison...

17
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,640
What should I do?

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,050
Eun Ho, if you can,

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,190
take His Highness the Grand Prince to where you came from.

20
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,210
You are the only one who can save him.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,010
Pardon?

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,480
Then, what about you?

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,340
If His Highness can survive,

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,050
even if I can never see him again,

25
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,270
even if I die today,

26
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,750
I am fine. So

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,220
save His Highness the Grand Prince.

28
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,680
Tinted With You
 Episode 7: Conquer

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,220
When will he arrive?

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,120
Always late.

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,070
Did you forget your promise to paint with me today?

32
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,050
Of course not.

33
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,090
If so, what happened?

34
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,220
I overslept.

35
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,810
I'm sorry, Heon.

36
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,570
Never mind.

37
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,350
You're upset, aren't you?

38
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,980
As if.

39
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,480
Heon. No,

40
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,330
Your Royal Highness.

41
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,900
I have a favor to ask of you.

42
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,860
Will you grant me that favor?

43
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,220
Let's hear it first.

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,100
This. The painting I showed you yesterday,

45
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,580
let's complete it together.

46
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,140
This painting?

47
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,120
Why do you...

48
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,950
J-Just because

49
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,370
it's my favorite painting.

50
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,540
So I wanted to paint it with you.

51
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,590
I want us to complete it together.

52
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,590
Because...

53
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,120
it's your favorite painting?

54
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,910
♫ Step by step, step by step ♫

55
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,600
♫ I want to approach you. ♫

56
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,390
All right.

57
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,640
Fine.

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,470
♫ But you're far away.  ♫

59
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,740
♫Will I be able to go? ♫

60
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,960
♫ I love you. ♫

61
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,950
♫ My feeling has grown so large. ♫

62
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,850
♫ I'm worried that you'll get caught. ♫

63
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,070
♫  My love, you. ♫

64
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,500
- Eun Ho.
- Hmm?

65
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,200
♫ I love you. ♫

66
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,490
Thanks.

67
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,480
Thanks to you, I learned that

68
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,080
people are this warm.

69
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,600
I thank you too. For protecting me.

70
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,920
♫ I'm worried that you'll get caught. ♫

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,670
♫ My love, you.  ♫

72
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,960
Your Royal Highness.

73
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,420
Be quiet.

74
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,400
- Where are you going?
- To the city streets.

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,510
Why there?

76
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,600
Eun Ho teaches me how to paint every day.

77
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,920
Even if it is with something small, I would like to repay him.

78
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,030
I'll accompany you.

79
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,500
It's fine.

80
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,110
How nervous would Eun Ho be by himself if we both are missing?

81
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,220
Are you certain you will be all right by yourself?

82
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,020
I will be fine. Don't worry.

83
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,030
The king has ordered poison

84
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,890
for the prince who was plotting treason.

85
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,410
- Poison?
- Oh, the poison?

86
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,890
What the?

87
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,470
Where have you been?

88
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,650
Did you know?!

89
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,380
- Your Highness, what do you mean?
- That Hyungnim—!

90
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,070
That the king has ordered my death by poison.

91
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,540
Since you aren't surprised, you must have known.

92
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,400
Your Highness ...

93
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,880
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

94
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,500
Heon.

95
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,470
Did you also know?

96
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,330
Why have you both hidden it from me?!

97
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,380
What wrong have I done that

98
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,990
I am hated this much?!

99
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,140
It's all right.

100
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,510
Come with me.

101
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,730
To where I live.

102
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's go together.

103
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,220
♫ When was it? I don't remember. ♫

104
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,100
Tinted With You Preview
♫ The warmth that I felt because of you ♫

105
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,560
It was beautiful to be with you

106
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,740
at the end of my life.

107
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,900
That's a positive sign today.

108
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,240
You must escape, Your Highness. Hurry.

109
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,640
Take His Highness and leave.

110
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,410
No, Geum. No.

111
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,800
I have something to do and will remain here.

112
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,280
Tinted With You.
