00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,280
Hey, dude! Did you decide to do whatever you want to now that you've been accepted in rolling admissions?

3
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,180
Hold on, hold on.

4
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,440
You're ruining the learning atmosphere.

5
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,730
Seriously, please!

6
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,880
Did I get in through luck? You know I studied for that test night and day.

7
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,700
But,

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,720
I have felt this way for a long time about this picture.

9
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
Isn't it similar to your drawing?

10
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,920
The thickness of this line. The tone is very similar.

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,550
Hey, Seo Jin. I have felt this way for a long time.

12
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,070
All ink wash paintings look the same to you, don't they?

13
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,900
What are you saying?!

14
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,920
Don't you know I have a sharp eye?

15
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,620
I don't.

16
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,450
I would like to know. Tell me.

17
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,700
You're so frustrating!

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,830
Never mind.

19
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,940
Bye.

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,020
What are you doing?

21
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,300
Because my buddy is saying I'm ruining the learning atmosphere,

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,880
I'm leaving early.

23
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,040
Are you a punk or what? Why are you leaving?

24
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,020
Work hard.

25
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,470
Huh?

26
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,950
I've seen this somewhere.

27
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,500
Who are you?

28
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,710
I finally found the painter's owner.

29
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,390
What?

30
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,540
Tell me the truth and I will spare your life.

31
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,020
Who sent you?

32
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,260
Your Highness.

33
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,420
Tell me.

34
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,420
Didn't I ask if Hyungnim sent you?

35
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,180
Your Highness.

36
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,700
Now that my father has passed,

37
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,180
it wasn't enough to just kick me out of the palace,

38
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,010
but here I am in exile.

39
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,510
And if that wasn't enough,

40
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,620
they are looking for every opportunity to murder me.

41
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,960
I don't want to live any longer.

42
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,940
Don't say such a thing, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

43
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,660
I will protect you

44
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,360
until the end.

45
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,680
This ... is a scene I saw in a dream.

46
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,920
Who are you?!

47
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm sorry but can you tell me where this is?

48
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,660
I think I'm lost.

49
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,080
What is that? Is that a sword?

50
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,290
Why are you like that out of the blue? We just met.

51
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,630
Wait a moment. W-Wait a moment.

52
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,730
Hey, behind you.

53
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,860
What is this?

54
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,330
Am I not awake yet from my dream?

55
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,540
That woman earlier, too. What is this? I'm scared.

56
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,160
This is crazy,

57
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,230
Am I hurt badly?

58
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,240
What's this?

59
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,330
I mean, what is this?

60
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,920
This isn't even The Truman Show.

61
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,850
Wait a minute. This is probably a dream. No, it is probably a dream.

62
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,920
Eun Ho, you must wake up.

63
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,730
Eun Ho!

64
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,210
I doubt it's a dream.

65
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,670
Ajumeoni! The gallery ...

66
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,070
You're that same person, right?

67
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,420
I am somewhere outside the picture.

68
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,070
You can't come here.

69
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,060
What are you talking about now?

70
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,840
Drawings have to be done on drawing paper, right?

71
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,290
You have to complete your work. Then you can return.

72
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

73
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,410
Ajumeoni, Ajumeoni!

74
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,320
Ajumeoni! Ajumma!

75
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,070
Where did you go?

76
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,670
I got into college, so I need to have fun now!

77
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,550
You should at least tell me where I am before you go!

78
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,670
What is this? Now I am really doomed.

79
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,140
Found you, you scoundrel.

Tinted With You Preview

81
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,580
I will live as though dead

82
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,140
without dreaming anything.

83
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,960
Hyungnim, also, do not harbor any hatred toward me.

84
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,630
The king of this country.

85
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,950
And that audacious person in that room really is the crown prince?

86
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,230
♫ I don't know since when ♫

87
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,700
Wouldn't it be more painful to a hateful heart?

88
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,240
What is your name?

89
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,150
Heon.

90
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,940
It is Lee Heon.
