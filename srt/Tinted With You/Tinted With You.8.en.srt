1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,110
Thank you to the entire Color My World Team

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,110
Thank you to Channel Manager Joysprite

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,070
Thank you to segmenters: Pilar_velasquez, bbf_260, and cgwm808

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,330
Thank you to Korean to English subtitlers: abythe, cgwm808, and sophie2you

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,960
Thank you to editors: cgwm808 (Chief), joysprite and abythe (Translation)

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,180
Are you saying that if we complete this painting,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,890
I can go

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,050
to where you live?

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,120
You can go.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,210
Together, with me.

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,040
Even if it's not true,

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,760
it's all right.

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,020
Even if it is a lie,

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,400
it's beautiful to be with you

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,300
at the end of my life.

16
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,270
I was a little afraid.

17
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,650
Now I am not at all afraid.

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,670
Because I can do my last piece of art with you,

19
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,900
I am not afraid of anything.

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,370
Tinted with You
Episode 8 Let's Return Together

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
It's at noon today.

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Once noon has passed, the king's servants will come.

23
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,690
This painting has to lead us to the future.

24
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,880
What's wrong with this?

25
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,900
This can't be. No way.

26
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,440
Wait a minute.

27
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,550
I found it.

28
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,660
It was Heon, Geum and me.

29
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,380
I just need to complete the three of us.

30
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,560
We're fine now. We can leave.

31
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,680
You must escape, Your Highness. Hurry.

32
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,140
Eun Ho!

33
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
We'll all get caught at this rate.

34
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,690
I will buy some time, so take Grand Prince and leave.

35
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,760
Geum, what are you saying?

36
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,450
Please take good care of Grand Prince.

37
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,690
You must... survive.

38
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,320
Hurry and go! Hurry!

39
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,160
No, Geum. No!

40
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,330
How can I leave you behind?

41
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,760
Let Grand Prince and Eun Ho go.

42
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,160
Who are you?

43
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,830
I am the one who sent the suspicious person here.

44
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,780
Geum, you stay here as there is something else you must do.

45
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,480
If the painting of Grand Prince had been buried deep in the mountain,

46
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,870
Eun Ho of the future wouldn't have been able to discover it.

47
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,370
If that had happened, he wouldn't have come here.

48
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,920
Then...

49
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,310
Shouldn't we save Grand Prince?

50
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,110
What can I do?

51
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,750
Geum, take the completed painting

52
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,690
and bury it under the wall of Hanyang Palace.

53
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,150
After that, the time and space will be left open in the future.

54
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,560
The poison was given to Grand Prince,

55
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,840
and I was in despair because there was nothing I could do.

56
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,820
However, since I have been given an opportunity, also,

57
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,590
I will gladly go.

58
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,140
Alright.

59
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,080
But, can I ask why you are making this much effort for this?

60
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,250
Royal Prince Eun An

61
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,520
has one of the nicest personalities I have seen.

62
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,010
But his life has been negatively affected due to bad luck.

63
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,980
Even in the distant future where Eun Ho came from,

64
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,610
all the people feel pity for his unfortunate life.

65
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm trying to comfort those feelings and make things right.

66
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank you.

67
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,200
You will also reconnect if you're destined to do so.

68
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,370
Your Highness.

69
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,200
I have a duty to carry out while remaining here.

70
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,410
I'll see you again in the distant future,

71
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,830
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

72
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,000
I will never let anyone reach His Highness!

73
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,060
Let's do it.

74
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,610
2 years later

75
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,740
Route 102

76
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,210
This is so hard. Seriously.

77
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,280
When is the exam again?

78
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,380
Next week.

79
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,620
I'm still a sophomore. How does that make sense?

80
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,090
I have to be doing this for two more years.

81
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,720
I can't.

82
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,620
Actually, well, the History of Joseon Art is still A+.

83
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm at the top of that class at least.

84
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,770
When I was a senior in high school, I wondered why I was learning that.

85
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,150
Since you've directly lived it,

86
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,680
you understand it with your heart.

87
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,410
That's true.

88
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,100
2022 History of Joseon Art
Landscape Exhibition and Planning Project

89
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,600
Is this good enough?

90
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,980
Let's see.

91
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,940
Oh, you are really ...

92
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,660
In my opinion, at your level,

93
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,330
you're practically guaranteed to win the national exhibition support project.

94
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,870
Just as I thought, you're so good.

95
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,820
- Eun Ho?
- Huh?

96
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,850
Tinted with you

97
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,020
What's your name?

98
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,240
Heon.

99
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,180
It's Yi Heon.

100
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,740
♫ I don't remember. ♫

101
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,580
♫ The warmth that I felt because of you ♫

102
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:35,130
♫ Come closer to me, who's been hiding while looking at you ♫

103
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,630
♫ I can't hide it anymore fallin' for you ♫

104
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,100
♫ I know, as time goes by, my feeling will grow bigger and bigger ♫

105
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,670
♫ Even when I close my eyes, I'm thinking about you ♫

106
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,220
♫ It's here. It's you. Who wants to hold my hand? ♫

107
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,020
I also thank you.

108
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,240
for protecting me.

109
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,160
♫ Can I hide myself for you ♫

110
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,750
♫ Since when? My feeling has grown bigger ♫

111
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,700
♫ I'm attracted to you so much that even I don't know ♫

112
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,060
Tinted With You.
