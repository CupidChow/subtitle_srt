1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,440
May I suggest some restraint?

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,440
Restraint? You mean
don't throw him down the stairs?

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,240
One of these days, I'll get you drunk,
and you'll tell me about your old job.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,640
I don't drink.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,520
Sam Haig.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,120
He's with the Scottish Telegraph.
Attended the Finch trial.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,720
-Every day.
-No, don't know him.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,880
He and Merritt spent
Thursday afternoons in a hotel room.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Mm, she didn't introduce us.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
Even close as you said you were?

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,520
We didn't discuss
her personal life, remember?

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,760
Well, we believe they were working
on a corruption case together.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,040
What sort of corruption? And where?

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,880
Something that connected
Graham Finch and Kirsty Atkins.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,080
-Kirsty Atkins?
-Potential witness.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,560
You wouldn't allow her
to testify in the case.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,800
And why wouldn't I?

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,080
We were hoping you'd tell us.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,800
I have no recollection
of this… Kirsty Atkins

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,400
or what she may
or may not have to say in the case.

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,720
I suggest you ask Liam Taylor.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,520
We did. He said to ask you.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,400
We know that Kirsty told Merritt
that she'd testify

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,680
that she'd met Finch's wife
a year before in a woman's refuge.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
The wife being there on account of Finch
beating the shit out of her.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,520
So this will have been not particularly
helpful information… for Finch.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
Then why wasn't she brought in?

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
Kirsty was a, uh, prolific offender
and long-term resident of Saughton Prison.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
So not necessarily credible.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,480
It's our understanding
Merritt thought differently.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Soon after their conversation,

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,080
Kirsty was jumped.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,800
So someone thought
she was credible enough.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,320
So again, our question would be,

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
why wasn't she called?

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,760
I have no recollection of this individual.
I can only comment generally.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
And with an individual like that,

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
a jury sees someone
who wants to get out of prison.

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,000
In a few weeks, she'll be
fresh out of prison, missing an eye,

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,840
with several dozen scars from a shanking
while in protective custody.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,040
-Does he ever speak?
-Not if I can help it.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,920
This attack would've been around the time
you told Merritt she couldn't use Kirsty.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,720
I have to take your word,

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,640
because once more,
I have no recollection of any of this.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,240
But you agree, to make this happen,

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Finch would've needed
friends on the inside.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,640
Morck, you are truly, as advertised,
out of your fucking mind.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,920
Why would I ever help out
someone like Graham Finch?

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
He wasn't a random husband

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,280
who threw his half-pissed wife
down the concrete stairs.

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,800
He had money. He had juice.

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Finch was a long-time wrong guy
with his own long-time connections.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
He had no need for any of my help.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,480
Merritt would've come to you
if she wanted to call Kirsty.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,160
Is there a record
of Merritt wanting to call Kirsty?

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,520
-Why are you so certain of all this?
-I believe Kirsty.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,920
The serial drug offender
who wants out of prison.

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
What about the, uh… journalist
that Merritt was supposedly working with?

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,320
He's dead.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,320
Had a bad fall
the day before Merritt disappeared,

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,960
which, if you're keeping score,

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,520
means that's one dead,
one alive, one disappeared

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,600
within a week after Merritt came to you
with a witness who could put away Finch.

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Okay, Morck.

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
You got me.

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm owned by Graham Finch.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,280
I assume he pays me
in gold coins or something.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
No, sir.

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,080
We think you were threatened by him,
indirectly.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,480
Your daughter, Julia,

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,000
she was run off the road during the trial.

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,440
She, in turn, struck and seriously injured
another man. It was all very messy.

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,960
A father never stops thinking
of all the ways

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,400
that harm can touch what he cares about.

75
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,000
For any man, this is a weakness.

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,440
May I ask, sir, how do you know
that Kirsty Atkins is a drug offender?

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,800
Well, you said so.

78
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,000
No. D.C.I. Morck said
she was a prolific offender. That's all.

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,880
Well, it seems the only person
who can help us prove any of this

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
is dead.

81
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,560
Well, we are not certain
that Merritt is dead.

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,280
You'd better hope she is.

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,800
Thank you for your time.

84
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,840
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

85
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
La, la, la

86
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,560
La, la, la

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,960
La, la, la

88
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
You're the only one I can talk to.

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
What about Alison? Mia, Jenna? That lot?

90
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,120
They're too fuckin' high and mighty.

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,960
"High and mighty."
You sound like my fuckin' mum.

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
Stop it.

93
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,200
They're the right words, all right?

94
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,960
Yeah, they'll talk to William,
but I'm too scary.

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,200
You are… …very fucking scary.

96
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,880
Aye, fucking right I am.

97
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
I like talking to you though.

98
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,880
-I can say almost anything.
-Almost?

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
What can't you say? Give an example.

100
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
-I can't give you an example.
-Why not?

101
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Because if I could say it to you,
I'd say it.

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Good point.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
What's so funny?

104
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
Lyle. What the fuck?

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,560
Mum told me to tell you
she needs you at home.

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,480
Okay, you told me. Now fuck off.

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
She told me to drag you out of here.

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,400
Like that's gonna fucking happen.

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Smells like sex.

110
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
As if you'd know.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,840
Your da's here.

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,840
-Fuck.
-It's okay. Just leave it.

113
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,840
-Hey, Harry.
-You win?

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,960
Eh, nah, not today.
We could've used you though.

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm retired.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
-You're Lyle Jennings.
-Mr. Lingard.

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
You're not here to burn the place down?

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
Da.

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,920
No, sir. I'm just here to pick up Harry.
Our ma needs him.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,400
-She's awake, is she?
-We're just leaving.

121
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Aye.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,640
Lyle.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
See you tomorrow.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,360
What did I say about Harry Jennings
being in the house when I'm not?

125
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,120
-Ah, he's not so bad.
-I'm talking to your sister.

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
Me and Harry,

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
we like each other.

128
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,680
-Harry and I.
-In fact…

129
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,560
we love each other.

130
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
-Like Romeo and Juliet?
-Whatever.

131
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,600
-He's not gonna be back anytime soon.
-You missed your brother's game.

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,880
William doesn't care
if I go to his stupid games. Do you?

133
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,800
-Only if you want to.
-See? Doesn't care.

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,520
-That's not the point.
-What is the point then? Family?

135
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah, that's what I thought.

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
Do you mind?

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Detective Morck.

138
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,800
Didn't recognize you.

139
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,240
You're not in your shitty car
outside my office.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Be glad I'm not sitting in your office.

141
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Yet.

142
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
How you doin', Robbie?

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,240
Do we know each other?

144
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,920
I've seen you on the telly enough
to feel like we do.

145
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
I suppose I could say the same.

146
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Like all good advocates,
I assume you turn away

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,880
when your client kicks his ball
out of the rough.

148
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Are you here
to harass Mr. Finch, Detective?

149
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,280
If so, can we at least have lunch first?

150
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,680
It's all good, Robbie.

151
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
Detective Morck's just here
to apologize for a misunderstanding.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,040
It was an accident, was it, that your…

153
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,640
trained cockroach slimed
all over a 17-year-old kid?

154
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,040
It was. He was supposed
to slime all over you.

155
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm very sorry.

156
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,120
I have to say
you tooled up Fritz pretty good.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160
I got the feeling Fritz enjoyed it.

158
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,080
Aye. You made his day.

159
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
You have my apology.
Was there anything else?

160
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
Well, yeah.

161
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,520
Do you mind, Detective?
Those are very expensive clubs.

162
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,520
Here's the thing.

163
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,080
You can't be tried again
for the murder of your wife.

164
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,800
So hats off there, Advocate.

165
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,720
But what I can get you for

166
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,480
is paying for the botched hit
on Kirsty Atkins.

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,360
The botched what on who?

168
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Let's just not.

169
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
What do you say?

170
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,520
What do you say, Detective?
You leave Mr. Finch to have his lunch.

171
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,800
You have proof?

172
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,400
I have your other paid cockroach,
Ed Solomon,

173
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,400
who scraped Fritz off the fuckin' pavement
and drove him to hospital.

174
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
-Who now himself is in hospital, I'm told.
-Yeah.

175
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah, with a broken leg.

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
Well, it's a good job
he doesn't need his leg to talk.

177
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,200
Quite the conversationalist, Ed.

178
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,240
Turns out he's got a number
of texts and voicemails from you

179
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,680
that are fucking hilarious.

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,840
Hilarious if you're not you.

181
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,280
-Or your lawyer.
-Such as?

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,520
"Gabby says he can put you in touch
with a couple of dykes at Saughton

183
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,760
who can cut one of her fucking eyes out
and make her eat it."

184
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,880
As she was threatening
to testify against you,

185
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,560
that's both metaphoric and symbolic.

186
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,160
Detective, I think we can end
this little interview now.

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
Now, we assume that this Gabby

188
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,520
is a fellow traveler
in your world of fuckery,

189
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
but what we don't know

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,560
is who told you
about Kirsty in the first place.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
Detective Morck.

192
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,920
Wasn't Stephen Burns by any chance?

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Maybe right after Ed or Fritz ran

194
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,680
his daughter's car
off the fucking motorway.

195
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,240
If you want to talk
to Mr. Finch like this,

196
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,840
you can either make a formal charge
or you can go.

197
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,280
-This is a private golf--
-Fore!

198
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,400
You might wanna go and pick that up.

199
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
I beg your fucking pardon?

200
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,120
You can beg all you like.

201
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,360
On you go, Robbie.

202
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,680
Promise not to admit to anything
while you're away.

203
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,600
Kirsty gets out next month.

204
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll send her a muffin basket.

205
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,280
You'll forget she ever existed.

206
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,560
Why would I do that?

207
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Because if anything happens to her,

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
if she so much as stubs her fucking toe,

209
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,280
I'm gonna assume it was your fault
and come knocking.

210
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,200
Is that all?

211
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm guessing it was the genetic fuckups

212
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,120
who visited Jasper and Kirsty
who also had a go at Fergus Dunbar,

213
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,280
the cop who caught
the Lingard case the first time around.

214
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,440
Might have been.
They do have a lot of free time.

215
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
Did you have anything to do
with Merritt's disappearance?

216
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,840
-Found that funny?
-Hilarious.

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,880
Why would I go after a prosecutor
after I was acquitted?

218
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,880
You were acquitted of murder.
She was looking into corruption.

219
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,400
With a reporter, Sam Haig,
who happened to die

220
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
the day before she disappeared.

221
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,120
She could've gotten you another way.

222
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,960
Now, that is very suspicious.

223
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,200
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that?

224
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,160
No. Then, I'm not
in the habit of killing reporters.

225
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Just your wife?

226
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Fritz did say
you appeared to be a lunatic.

227
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,080
Oh, coming from Fritz,
that's high praise indeed. Look.

228
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,280
-Haig was at your trial.
-If you say so.

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,080
Aye, he was.

230
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,640
He was also the one
who told me about Kirsty Atkins.

231
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
When?

232
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,200
One day at trial.

233
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,840
He came up to me during a break
and told me she was going to testify

234
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,880
and that it would be quite damning.

235
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,320
-He just offered it up?
-He did.

236
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,640
Which made the information suspect.

237
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,400
I informed Graham that were it true,

238
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,000
I would file
an immediate motion against it.

239
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,760
It was my feeling that,
given the woman's history,

240
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,400
the ruling was likely to be in our favor.

241
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,680
In the end…… I did nothing.

242
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
I didn't have to.

243
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,520
And Graham was fine
with waiting to file a motion?

244
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,240
I was not party
to any further conversation in the matter.

245
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,600
And if Graham had wanted to pursue
a more aggressive approach,

246
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,560
I would, of course, have reminded him

247
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,920
that we had a very strong case
without resorting to… intimidation.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,320
Any idea why Haig gave you
such a gift in the first place?

249
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
-No.
-No quid pro quo?

250
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
None.

251
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,360
I assume that neither of you have
the slightest inkling

252
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,320
of what happened to Haig
after he delivered

253
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
his fortuitous piece of intelligence, hmm?

254
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,800
In my experience, Detective,

255
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,760
if you wanna stop a reporter
from looking at you,

256
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,720
the absolute worst thing you could do
would be to harm that reporter.

257
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,840
Same goes for the cops.

258
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Once you go after one of theirs,

259
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
they will never leave you alone.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,080
It's not worth it.

261
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
A lot of gray area there, Mr. Finch.

262
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,080
The thing with the golf club
was very amusing.

263
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Thank you.

264
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,760
Though I have to say I was most relieved
when you didn't hit him with it.

265
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,520
Ugh, Jesus.
All this talk about me losing control.

266
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You're the one who's crushing windpipes
and chucking people down the stairs.

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes, except when I do these things,

268
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm never out of control.

269
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
I'm very much in control.

270
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,960
What the fuck did you do
back in Syria? Come on.

271
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,520
Are you going to answer that?

272
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Morck.

273
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,240
-Someone's fucking with you.
-Who is this?

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,720
Your favorite reporter, Dennis Piper.

275
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,120
Don't hang up. I'm about to help you.

276
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,240
That's very generous,
but I think you're a fucking rodent.

277
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,880
I'm texting you something.
Take a look at it.

278
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,480
If you wanna talk after,
I'll be at the Golden Rule for an hour.

279
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

280
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
Shall we watch?

281
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,520
Fuck!

282
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
Hey.

283
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,120
My tooth is infected.

284
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,240
I need antibiotics.

285
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,280
Better yet, a fucking dentist.

286
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Look.

287
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
Oh, okay, fine.
I'll just die from fucking sepsis.

288
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Rob you of the pleasure of doing it.

289
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,240
Seems a bit anticlimactic
after all this time.

290
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,040
He was never gonna leave me alone.

291
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,960
Every time I'd turn around,
there he'd be, staring at me.

292
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,320
-Staring at you?
-Yeah.

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
I'd be eating
or working out in the weight room.

294
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,640
I'd be reading in the library,
and he'd come and sit across from me.

295
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
I even caught him
watching me sleep one time.

296
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
I couldn't take that anymore.

297
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,960
You messed him up pretty good.
He may lose that eye.

298
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,160
Sam, did you hear what I said?

299
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
He might lose his eye.

300
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,400
Do you feel anything when I tell you that?

301
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,880
-Yeah, I feel good.
-You feel good?

302
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,040
He wasn't ever gonna leave me alone.

303
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Sam?

304
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm not his fucking brother.
Had to get that into his head somehow.

305
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Pound it into his head, you mean?

306
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,320
Are you sure
there wasn't something more to it?

307
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,560
Like more what?

308
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
Like more complicated?

309
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,040
Nah. Nah, I'm done talking.

310
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Sam.

311
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
I said, I'm done talking.

312
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,360
This concludes the post-offence
interview with Samuel Haig, age 17.

313
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
10th March, 2013,

314
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
at 11:09 a.m.

315
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,760
With myself, Terry Dundee,

316
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,320
corrections counselor at Godhaven HMYOI.

317
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,920
I knew Haig, better than most,
which isn't saying much.

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,520
Haig was fucking precious
about everything.

319
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,320
He wouldn't share sources.

320
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,760
Wouldn't talk to anyone at the office,
when he bothered to show up.

321
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,440
But, still, everyone thought
he was so clever.

322
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,680
-But not you.
-I fucking knew the guy.

323
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,080
I knew the reason he got on so well
with people who crossed the line.

324
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
He was one of them.

325
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
-How'd you get the video?
-It was on his computer.

326
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,640
-Oh, you hacked Haig's computer?
-After he died.

327
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,960
Like it doesn't make a difference.
How did Haig get the video?

328
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,800
Someone at Godhaven
must have gave it to him.

329
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,480
He'd been going back to the place
in the last few months before he died.

330
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,520
-Why?
-He was working on a story.

331
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
-Can we read it?
-I've still got some standards.

332
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Fuck off. You're a journalist.
You'd do your own mother from behind.

333
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,640
How does this help in our investigation?

334
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,480
It helps in your investigation
into who killed Sam Haig.

335
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,440
We're not investigating Haig's death.

336
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,440
Well, maybe you should be.

337
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Sam found this kid.
The one he was talking about in the video.

338
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,080
The one he practically skelped to death.

339
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,720
What is this kid's name?

340
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,000
He called him "X" to protect his identity.

341
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,680
And how does Mr. X relate
to Merritt Lingard?

342
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
Oh, wait. It doesn't.

343
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,000
Unless Haig got her screwed
into whatever was happening

344
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
with this kid from his past.

345
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,440
Sounds like something a crackerjack journo
like you should look into.

346
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,600
Talk to Terry Dundee,

347
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,200
the other voice on the tape,
the one talking to Sam.

348
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,160
He's still at Godhaven.

349
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,520
I've reached out,
but he gave me the big fuck off

350
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,920
about how records are sealed.

351
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
This has been fascinating.

352
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,040
Well, if you find anything, Morck,
you be sure to remember me.

353
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
-Hey.
-All right?

354
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,000
-What are you watching?
-Oh, just some shite.

355
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Perfect.

356
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,640
You had this look on your face.

357
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I've never seen it,
even when you're super pissed off at me.

358
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,320
When you went after that guy,
you were like…

359
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
this guy I didn't even know.

360
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah.

361
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,920
Okay.

362
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm two people.

363
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,920
Yeah? I have to be.

364
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
I see things most days
no one person can see,

365
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,440
that no one person… can handle,
or should ever have to see, to be honest.

366
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,720
Like what?
What's the worst thing you've seen?

367
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,360
I'm not gonna do that to you.

368
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,400
Not gonna put
what's in my head into yours.

369
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,240
I didn't to your mum.
I'm not gonna to you.

370
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,680
-Why not?
-You live in a different world.

371
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah? There's no need for you to know
the specifics of the other world

372
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,720
beyond that it exists
and once in a blue moon,

373
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
something from over there
crosses into here.

374
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
So the guy in the ice cream shop,
he knows that.

375
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,200
He wants to scare you
by showing you the other world.

376
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,480
He wants to… make you so afraid
that he fucking owns you.

377
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,800
You can't go through what you did
without it… stirring things up.

378
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
What, like…

379
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
do you mean I'm gonna have…
have nightmares and shit?

380
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Who knows what it'll be,

381
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,000
but if you think you're gonna die
or you're around death,

382
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,440
all of a sudden there's this…
menu of various and sundry shit

383
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,600
that's just waiting to sneak up on you.

384
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,240
-Are you trying to scare me?
-You're already scared.

385
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,480
That's the whole point.

386
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
You now know that things can change…

387
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
in an instant.

388
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,120
-We're members of the same club.
-Well, I don't wanna be in that club.

389
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,160
Well, no one joins voluntarily, fella.

390
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,080
People spend their whole lives
trying to avoid that kind of… calamity.

391
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,760
But you have to go to the meetings,
speak to the other members of the club

392
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,160
so you know you're not the only one
who's thinking and feeling the…

393
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,760
shit

394
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,000
that you're thinking and feeling.

395
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,760
What, so like…

396
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,720
you and Hardy?

397
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Yeah.

398
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,880
Like me and Hardy.

399
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,800
And now me and you.

400
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Wait, you…

401
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
you wanna talk about it?

402
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah.

403
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,600
When you need to, sure.

404
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,760
About… what… what happened?

405
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
About what's happening.

406
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,600
Maybe we should start
with how thoroughly pissed off you are

407
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,560
at me ruining things with your mum.

408
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,600
And then abandoning you when I was shot.

409
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,400
I mean, that's… that's not your fault.
You… You couldn't help it.

410
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,640
No.

411
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,080
But you can still be mad.

412
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,120
That's okay.
You're allowed to be fucking mad.

413
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,920
Maybe let's have
our first meeting about that.

414
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,200
I am here.

415
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,280
I'm listening.

416
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Promise.

417
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Morning.

418
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,920
Not much of a file, is it?

419
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,280
Police took one look at that cliff
and made the call right there.

420
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,080
I'd likely have done the same myself.

421
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,640
Injuries consistent
with traumatic fall from a great height.

422
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
As if there's a fall from a great height
that's not traumatic.

423
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,320
Okay, so what's your problem?

424
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,320
Outside of the timeline and cause of death
being very fucking dodgy.

425
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,920
-Mm, the guy who found Haig, Paul Evans.
-Yeah, yeah, the climbing instructor.

426
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah.

427
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,240
He says he was
with his wife the night before

428
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,600
and found Haig's body in the morning
when he went to take pictures.

429
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,840
But the day he found Haig's body,
it was pouring rain.

430
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,800
It's Scotland.

431
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,600
Could've been rain when he woke up,

432
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,240
sun when he got there,
a fuckin' blizzard when he went home.

433
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,360
He also sent about a dozen messages
to Haig's burner phone that night.

434
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,480
-A few examples.
-Go on.

435
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,040
"No more secrets."

436
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,680
"I think you need to get
everything out in the open."

437
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,720
"This isn't about my wife."
"I want you to know that I see you."

438
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,920
"Are you back at the hotel?"

439
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
"Is she still there?"

440
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,160
-Hold on. Who's "she"?
-It's gotta be Merritt.

441
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,240
And there was no response
until the last message, which said,

442
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,640
"I'm going for a climb, S."

443
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,160
And no one followed up on any of it.

444
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,320
It was irrelevant to Haig's death
once it was deemed accidental.

445
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
It's not irrelevant to Merritt.

446
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,200
Haig and Merritt had been meeting up
at the Prince's Garden Hotel,

447
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,160
and Haig's editor said
he had a burner phone for security.

448
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,840
So Evans was talking to Haig
about all that stuff, secrets,

449
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,400
and "I see you" and all that.

450
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,920
-You and Carl don't talk like that?
-I don't talk to my wife like that.

451
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,600
Maybe you should.

452
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
-Hello, Rose.
-Hiya, Donna.

453
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,480
-You want breakfast, Mr. Grumpy Arse?
-I'm not hungry.

454
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,280
Wanna face the wee angel of darkness
on an empty stomach?

455
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,040
-I'm not hungry.
-Suit yourself.

456
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Fuck sake.

457
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,680
Rose, you want anything? Cup of tea?

458
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,120
Uh, no, thanks.
I've had too many cups already.

459
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,680
-Did you tell Ritesh to mow the lawn?
-Yeah, why?

460
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
He's your carer, not your gardener.

461
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,440
The garden needs more care than I do.
Looks like shite.

462
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,000
He's better off out there
than fucking hovering around all the time.

463
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Angel of darkness?

464
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,720
Physiologist who's either gonna get me
walking again or locked up for murder.

465
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
Okay, so…

466
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
tell me.

467
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,040
If Carl already shook
the tree of Paul Evans,

468
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,200
then why are we having this conversation?

469
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,800
-Evans's story's full of holes.
-It's leaky as fuck.

470
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,440
Probably doesn't want anyone to know
about his special friendship with Haig.

471
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,320
Or he knows more than he's saying.
About Merritt.

472
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,920
If you think that, then go back
and pester him again. Ask him.

473
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,840
-Ask him…?
-What he's hiding.

474
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
Just come right out and ask him?

475
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Why not? That's what you wanna know.

476
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,040
Paul Evans is not gonna tell me
if he's hiding something.

477
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,840
There's ways to ask and ways not to ask,
if you know what I mean.

478
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,160
Depends on how big your balls are.

479
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
I don't even have…

480
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,360
-Well, they're not that big.
-Wrong answer.

481
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,040
I'm serious, Rose. If that's true,
what the fuck are you doing here?

482
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,440
Try again.

483
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,120
I have very big balls.

484
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,280
There you go. That was easy.

485
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,640
Let's me and you figure out
how you're gonna fuck with Paul Evans.

486
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,440
God, that effing, fucking safety hatch.

487
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,600
Argh!

488
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
Hurry up!

489
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,280
I told that bastarding boy
he needs to fix that.

490
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,440
Fucking arsehole.

491
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm here for my appointment.

492
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,200
Oh, could you not?

493
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Thank you.

494
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,080
I take it you found my address
by inappropriate means?

495
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,320
Which is fair enough,
given your abandonment of me.

496
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,960
Gotta say, it's a nice place.
I mean, a bit weird.

497
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
But cute.

498
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,760
Cute?

499
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,920
Mm, like 20-year-old you lived here
with your student mates.

500
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,680
20-year-old me did live here
with my student mates.

501
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,160
-What's your place like?
-Like my ex-wife.

502
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,680
So we both live
steeped in our own sad histories.

503
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,720
I'll bet you had a lot more fun here.

504
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,760
Not really. I was severely underweight
and deeply depressed.

505
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,000
My twenties were spent
weighing carrots and doing star jumps.

506
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,680
Sounds better than my marriage.

507
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,840
I'd rather have gotten
my suffering out in my twenties.

508
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,120
-You know suffering, do you?
-Fifteen years on the murder squad.

509
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
I meant your own.

510
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,000
So this is where
you accuse me of self-pity. Great.

511
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,120
I don't accuse.

512
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,080
I just… observe.

513
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,560
-Have you met Dr. Sonnenberg?
-I have.

514
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,160
And what did you think?

515
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,440
She reminds me of my aunt Enid.

516
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,200
The kind that likes to potter
round the garden,

517
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,360
making sure all the pansies are healthy

518
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
on top of all the bodies
buried underneath.

519
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,800
Anyway, I'm giving up on therapy.

520
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,120
You can hardly give up
on something you haven't tried.

521
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,640
Martin, my lodger, says
I should pay more attention to my dreams.

522
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
Honestly can't remember
the last one I had.

523
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,440
You're supposed to write them down
as soon as you wake up before you forget.

524
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
No, I meant I don't have them.

525
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,280
You don't dream?

526
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,640
I don't sleep.

527
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,080
And you don't need therapy?

528
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,320
-I need sleep.
-Well, they have pills and things now.

529
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,320
Mm. They scare me.

530
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
You read about people all the time,
waking up after a sleeping pill

531
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,000
and they've eaten
everything in the fridge,

532
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,800
or the front door's open
and the dog's got its lead on,

533
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,720
or you wake up naked
next to their ex in the bathroom.

534
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Why are you here, Carl?

535
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,200
I don't know.

536
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,160
I thought I did.

537
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,400
But now I don't.

538
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,160
When you figure it out,
you can come back and tell me.

539
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,040
I think that's us for today.

540
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,680
Fuck's sake.

541
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
Yes.

542
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,600
You know, I tried rock climbing once.

543
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,520
I do Zumba now.
Prefer to keep my feet on the ground.

544
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,440
Right. What is it
that brings you here then?

545
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Oh.

546
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,880
D.C. Dixon. I'm looking for Chloe Evans?

547
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,280
-Chloe?
-That's right.

548
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,920
You just missed her.

549
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,160
-Are you sure? We had an appointment.
-I'm very sure. I'm her husband.

550
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,240
She's gone to see her midwife.

551
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Ah.

552
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,720
So you're Paul?

553
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
Okay.

554
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Um…

555
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,280
Is there something I can help with?

556
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,000
No, no, I don't think so,

557
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,360
as this is a follow-up appointment

558
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,160
to a conversation
I had with Chloe the other day, so…

559
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,720
What conversation?

560
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,040
Sorry, I can't share any information
brought to our attention.

561
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,240
But I'm her husband.

562
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,640
Again, I'm sorry.

563
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,160
If you let her know I was here
and have her give me a call on this number

564
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,200
as soon as she can.

565
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,080
Lovely to meet you, Paul.

566
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,240
She told you, didn't she?

567
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,440
Who told me what, Paul?

568
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,360
Ah. You're good right there.

569
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,800
Is that Mace?

570
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Pepper spray.

571
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,320
I've also got a pair of brass knuckles
and a wee Taser.

572
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,880
You think I wanna hurt you?

573
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,120
I know you don't want to get sprayed.

574
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Are you even a real cop?

575
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,720
I often ask myself the same question.

576
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,880
But can I ask you about Sam Haig?

577
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,520
Right, so Chloe did tell you about us?

578
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,160
No, but you just did.

579
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,240
The word "us" that did it.
And it's totally fine, by the way.

580
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,040
For fuck's sake, I'm not even gay.

581
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,400
No. Course you're not.
Maybe you just wanted to experiment.

582
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,120
I wasn't involved with Sam
in any kind of sexual way.

583
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,760
How were you involved with Sam?

584
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,200
When you climb, you become close.

585
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,920
Trust is everything.

586
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,600
I was the one person
Sam felt he could say anything to.

587
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,000
-Such as?
-You name it.

588
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,760
We'd get up on a cliff or a crag, and…

589
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,280
…we'd just talk.

590
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,000
So climbing was like therapy.

591
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,880
Sam trusted you with the rope
and his deep, dark secrets.

592
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,120
Yeah, that's about it.

593
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,880
You were lying then
when you told the other detectives

594
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,120
you didn't know
about Sam and Merritt Lingard?

595
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,760
-Of course he would've told you.
-I wasn't lying. Sam never mentioned her.

596
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
Come on.

597
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,480
With all that sharing going on,
she'd have came up.

598
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,920
She didn't. I didn't think
Sam was involved with anyone back then.

599
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,720
What about the dozen or so texts
you sent two days before?

600
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,960
The ones with the bits like,
"We can't leave it like this."

601
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,480
"I see you." Blah, blah, blah.

602
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,720
We'd all been drinking that night,

603
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,320
and Sam was going on
about his latest piece,

604
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,880
saying he thought
it was gonna change his life.

605
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,120
Of course, Chloe, who never liked Sam,
she was always annoyed with his secrecy,

606
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,960
she said something
along the lines of, well, that's good

607
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,080
because he needed to make
some big fucking changes in his life

608
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,800
or he was definitely gonna die
and take me with him.

609
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,640
-They had a big row and Sam left.
-He went to the hotel?

610
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,960
The one you mentioned in your texts.

611
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,320
"Are you at the hotel?
Is she still there?"

612
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,560
I'm assuming that the "she"
you were referring to was Merritt.

613
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,720
Why assume that?

614
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,200
Sam and Merritt
had been meeting up at a hotel.

615
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,960
Like I've told you several times now,
he never mentioned her.

616
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,200
Don't suppose you know the hotel?

617
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,160
Course I do.
It's up the road from us. The Spivey Inn.

618
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,320
-The Spivey Inn?
-Aye.

619
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,160
Really? And you're sure
that's where he was?

620
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,240
Yeah, very sure.

621
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,400
And he wasn't with a woman?

622
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
I didn't say that.

623
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,840
"It's not about Chloe.
Is she still there?"

624
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,040
Oh, fuck me.

625
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,280
I sent her back to apologize.

626
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,800
Chloe went to see Sam?

627
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,440
-Aye.
-Alone?

628
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,440
Well, I was too pissed to go anywhere.

629
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,320
And did she? Apologize?

630
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,720
In a manner of speaking.

631
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,320
What manner would that be?

632
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,840
Like I said, we'd all been drinking.

633
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh.

634
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
But… I thought you said
that she didn't even like him?

635
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,080
Sometimes it makes it better.

636
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Why didn't you tell the police back then?

637
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,280
-It was a one-time thing.
-Are you sure?

638
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,200
-I didn't kill Sam Haig.
-No one said you did, but…

639
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,920
-Come on, did you kill Sam Haig?
-Course not.

640
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,200
-He shagged your wife.
-Yeah, thank you.

641
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,760
I didn't know about that. I was worried
because he wasn't responding to my texts.

642
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,880
At least not until the last one he sent.
The one saying he was going for a climb.

643
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,480
If you wanna speak to me or my wife again,

644
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,760
call our lawyer.

645
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Thank you.

646
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,600
Good morning, Merritt.

647
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,720
It's rubbish day.

648
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
My favorite day of the month.

649
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,560
There you go.

650
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,080
Ah, just take your own sweet time.

651
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,680
You wanna live in your own shit
for another month, that's fine by me,

652
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,840
ya' manky bitch.

653
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,880
Emergency. Which service?
