1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,040
-Caroline Kerr?
-Yes.

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,600
D.C.I. Morck.

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,800
-I can't help you.
-It's okay. I'm here to help you.

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,560
Don't look at him. Look at me.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
-He's not gonna hurt you.
-Please.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,680
So my partner and I, James Hardy,
we both got shot at exactly the same time.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,520
First bullet, through his spine,
traveled in here, out here.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,200
Second one damaged his radial nerve.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,400
So he can't walk.
He's partially paralyzed.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,120
-I'm very sorry.
-I only lost a tooth. Look.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,920
But I remember you,
with your baby, that day.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,560
I remember you walking past
as Hardy and I got out of the car.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,200
I don't remember you… or your partner.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,040
His name's James Hardy, and you're lying,
but I'm not here to talk about him.

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm here to talk about P.C. Anderson,
the third cop, who died at the scene.

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,840
-What about him?
-Did you know him?

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,360
-Why would I?
-He grew up in Leith Park like you.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,280
I bet he still had mates there,
popped in for a visit now and again,

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,680
possibly not in uniform.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
I didn't see anything.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,240
A lot of crime goes on
in that place that no one sees.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I wouldn't know.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,840
All of it run by a fella
by the name of Eugene Errington.

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you know him?

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,080
-Everyone knows him.
-Not everyone has a kid with him.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
Please go.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
-Keep looking at me.
-You're gonna get me killed.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,520
You talking about the bug-faced arsehole
behind me, Charlie Bell? We know him.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,360
He's got a dozen outstanding warrants

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,800
for an impressive array
of criminal activity,

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,200
ranging from assault, spousal abuse,

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,480
possession of burglary tools, which…

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,160
Even I didn't fucking know
that was a crime until yesterday.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,000
-Charlie works for Eugene.
-Everyone works for Eugene.

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,320
-Eugene owns this shop.
-He owns everything.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,480
What about P.C. Anderson?
Did Eugene own him?

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
I wouldn't know.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
Charlie there behind me is
Eugene's muscle, is he not?

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,480
His name keeps coming up
every time I mention Leith Park.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,120
Just look at me, Caroline. That's it.

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,320
Charlie's not our shooter.
He doesn't have the same eyes.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,360
But I'll bet he was in the car,
I'll bet you saw him on the day,

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,960
and I'll also bet
that you hate that psycho,

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
that you are fucking sick and tired
of being scared shitless every day.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
In a few seconds,
I'm gonna walk out of that door.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,080
As soon as I do, I want you to get
underneath this desk and stay there.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,040
What?

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,400
Do not move until someone comes in here

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,200
and tells you
everything's gonna be all right.

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
Please do as I say, Caroline.

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Thank you.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
Hey, Charlie. Remember me, eh?

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,040
You don't remember me? Oh, come on, man.

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,880
You fuckin' wankstain, eh?

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
That's a gun. I'm sure you're familiar.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
Oh, look. There's another one.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,720
All yours.

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Charlie Bell, you are under arrest--

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,480
Hey, Detective!

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,280
How's your partner?

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,760
Is he still a fucking crip?

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh, now you've done it.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,760
Right properly
fucked yourself up the arse.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,920
Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,240
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,080
La, la, la

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,960
La, la, la

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,360
La, la, la

71
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm sorry I kicked you.

72
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,440
I gave you a painkiller
with your sedative.

73
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Probably won't help,

74
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
but you'll have a headache
when you finally wake up,

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,400
which probably won't be
for another few hours.

76
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
I think about you all the time.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,600
I think about us.

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
How things could have happened… different.

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,360
For fuck's sake.

80
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
Do what you have to do
and get out of there.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,480
She's awake.

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,480
She's all dwammy.
She's nae gonna remember any of it.

83
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
I love you so much.

84
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,600
What the fuck are you doing now?

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
Now go!

86
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Jesus.

87
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Ouch.

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Deep breath.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,960
Bird flaps its wings.

90
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
One more.

91
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,640
Now, daughter on the mountain top.

92
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Live the daughter. Be the daughter.

93
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,680
Breathe the daughter.

94
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,680
What the fuck?

95
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,320
Jasper is learning that guns and fists
are not the only solution. Pulling taffy.

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,960
And what, weird ballet is? Jesus.

97
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,320
This is not ballet.

98
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,680
This is tai chi.

99
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,320
And it's a crying shame
that more people don't practice it.

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,120
The crying shame is
that people don't fight in slow motion.

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,560
It's not f…

102
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Forget it.

103
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,280
Rolling clouds.

104
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,680
Speaking of slow,

105
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
can you get your arse in gear?

106
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,280
-When you're late, I get into trouble.
-It's fine. Gemma's giving me a lift.

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,760
-Who?
-Gemma. You met her the other day.

108
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Oh.

109
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,240
-Gemma and Jasper?
-Mm.

110
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,200
Perfect. About that…

111
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,040
No, no, no.
Please, I beg you. Not about that.

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
-Are you using protection?
-La, la, la.

113
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,680
How do you think you got here? Hey!

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,120
Trust me when I tell you
you do not want one of you at your age.

115
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,040
So bag it up. Preferably use two.

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
James Reynolds, is that it?

117
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
I don't want this stuff.

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,640
It's been a year.
We think you've earned it.

119
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
How thoughtful of you.

120
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,600
We just want you to be comfortable.

121
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,480
Fuck you and your comfort!

122
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,360
Was it John McCafferty?

123
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,920
George McGovern?

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,360
Maggie Thomas?

125
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,920
Seamus Reynolds, is that it?
Is that why I'm here?

126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
I need something to write with.

127
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,640
Dean Maclean. Kenny Flockhart.

128
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,560
Can I have another color, please?

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,080
Adam Kunnacht.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,600
Was it Shona…

131
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Brookes?

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,600
Sue Crawshaw? Brandon McLoughlin?

133
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,200
Sometimes I imagine
that I'm in a little spaceship.

134
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Maybe I'll figure out
how to fly it away somewhere.

135
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,040
Wouldn't that be nice?

136
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Thomas… Katie McCauley?

137
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Shelley O'Brian? Brooke Copson?
Craig Munroe? Mark Fraser?

138
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Saskia Gilmore? Conrad Cooper? Um…

139
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,840
Rory Byrne?

140
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
Robert O'Donoghue? Is it him?

141
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
John McDonald? Kevin O'Toole?

142
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
Thomas Laidlaw?

143
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Taylor Napier?

144
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,400
Mark Thomas? Charlotte Carter?

145
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,200
Kirsty Atkins?

146
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,080
All these people she's ruined,

147
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,680
she doesn't seem to give a shite about.

148
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,080
If she hasnae got it sorted
after four years, she isnae gonna.

149
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,800
Four years is a long time.
Maybe it's time to let her go.

150
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Let her go?

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,840
She doesn't know
who we are or where she is.

152
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
Have you lost your feckin' mind?

153
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
No.

154
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
No.

155
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Fu… no!

156
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Give it back.

157
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,920
What you talking about, dearie?

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
-My necklace.
-What about it?

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,920
You took it.

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
Must have… fallen off
when you made your wee bolt for freedom.

161
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Please.

162
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll have a look around, but…

163
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
you really shouldn't be up and about, pet.

164
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,160
Or have you forgotten
what rapid decompression does to a person?

165
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
It's been a while
since you heard the recording.

166
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,800
-Let's remind you.
-No.

167
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Symptoms of rapid
decompression include the following.

168
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
No, stop, please.

169
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,520
Fatigue, muscle and joint pain,

170
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,840
and loss of consciousness.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,520
I've accepted that her dying

172
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,440
with or without knowing why

173
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,280
will still give me the peace I deserve.

174
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,360
Stop!

175
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Carl.

176
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,280
-What are you doing here?
-We need to talk.

177
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,520
Talk? No. Now's not a good time.

178
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,720
I'll be quick. I did what you said.
I've started a dream journal.

179
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Carl, stop. How did you know I was here?

180
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,720
-I pinged your phone.
-You what?

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,160
It's not that hard
when you know the guy I know.

182
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,400
Okay, you have to leave.
I'm meeting someone.

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,160
So is this a date?

184
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,840
No one goes on a date
in the middle of the day for a coffee.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,720
-Do they?
-It's a thing now.

186
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,880
It's supposed to take the pressure off.

187
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,680
So this is a date.

188
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,760
Is that him?

189
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,880
Carl, this is borderline stalking.

190
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,840
What about him? Beardy McMan-bun.

191
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,080
Do you know what? I…
I take it back. This is actual stalking.

192
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,640
Can I just tell you
about the dream I keep having?

193
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,560
-Please tell me I'm not in it.
-What? No, no.

194
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,040
And it's not like that. No.

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,400
I keep shooting people.

196
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Shooting people. Okay.

197
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,360
They're all suspects
and perps from my past.

198
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,840
Sometimes it's the suspect in my shooting.
Sometimes it's just a guy I put away.

199
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,200
Once it was a guy
who was dead when we found him.

200
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,040
What do you think it means?

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,600
I don't have a scooby.
What do you think it means?

202
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't have a scooby.
That's why I'm asking you.

203
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,480
Can you hear the gunshots in the dream?

204
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,160
I think so.

205
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,280
Do you try to reload?

206
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,200
I might.

207
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
And can you?

208
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,800
Reload?

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,480
If I can't, what does that mean?
I can't get it up?

210
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Honestly, Carl, I could give a shit.

211
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
Martin seems to think
this could represent a good thing.

212
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,240
-Martin, your lodger?
-Mm, yeah. Like I'm finally taking action.

213
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Martin sounds smart.
Maybe you should be talking to him.

214
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
-Rachel?
-Ben?

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
My brother was just leaving.

216
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
Aye.

217
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Call you later, sis.

218
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,320
Hi.

219
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,680
I have to get out of here.

220
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,040
-So go.
-I'm serious.

221
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm not gonna survive
if I stay here another fucking second.

222
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Wee bit dramatic, don't you think?

223
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I just need some money.

224
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
How much could it take?

225
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,720
Few quid for the ferry
and a room somewhere?

226
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,600
That'll get me off the island,
but I need enough to last me until I'm 18.

227
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,920
What happens then?

228
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,960
I get something from my mum's family.

229
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,840
-How big a something?
-They're rich as fuck.

230
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
And what about William?

231
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,320
Aye, he gets something too.

232
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,800
-You don't care about leaving him?
-Why would I?

233
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,680
He can look after himself.
He's Mr. Fucking Perfect after all.

234
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,720
Not sure I could leave
my brother with my mum.

235
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320
-No one's asking you to.
-I know.

236
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm just saying
that your da might be a wee bit depressed.

237
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
A wee bit?

238
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,560
And my mum……she's fucking gyte.

239
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,880
She burned our fucking house down.

240
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
I thought that was an accident.

241
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,200
I thought Lyle was playing
with matches or something.

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
If you call flicking lit cigarettes
at my da while he's sleeping an accident.

243
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Mm.

244
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
Me and Lyle weren't even there.

245
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,760
And I thought my life was fucked up.

246
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,320
One of my mum's diamond rings could…

247
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,120
probably get me a whole new life.

248
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,760
Why hasn't your da sold any of it?

249
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,800
No, he has sold some of it.

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,960
He's pawned some of it.

251
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,000
He goes straight down the pub

252
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,160
and comes home
crying like a wee bairn every time.

253
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,520
What about that necklace?

254
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
No, I'm not selling this.

255
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,520
Then what you gonna do?

256
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,880
Harry, it's all I have of her, all right?

257
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,960
I'll figure something out.

258
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,280
Fucking have to.

259
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Well, if you wanted me to come with you…

260
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,760
…I would.

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
One diamond ring could probably pay

262
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,520
for a whole year's worth of rent.

263
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,480
And it'd be so easy too.

264
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,920
He keeps all of her things
in a drawer unlocked.

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,040
You mean steal it?

266
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
Yeah, but…

267
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
I couldn't do that though.

268
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,520
No, he'd know it was me,

269
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,920
and then he'd chase me down
until the end of fucking time.

270
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Is there a night William's not home?

271
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,200
Monday evenings.

272
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,320
William has Bible study.

273
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,720
-Bible study? Are you fucking kidding?
-Shh.

274
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
William found God.

275
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,160
More like a girl named Margot
who likes to go.

276
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
And your da? He'll be at the pub?

277
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,840
Yeah, or an AA meeting,
depending on what's happened that day.

278
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,280
No, you're not gonna do
what I think you think you're gonna do.

279
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,440
Why not? Everyone already thinks
I'm stealing from them.

280
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,560
Because it's a lame fucking idea, Harry.

281
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
You'll get caught
and make everything so much worse.

282
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,520
-I won't get caught.
-No, forget I said anything, all right?

283
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
It's just talk.

284
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,440
-It's just talk, Harry. Okay?
-Okay.

285
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,560
Oh, God.

286
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,720
William!

287
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Sam Haig was in court every day.

288
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
He was there for Merritt.

289
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,200
But he also gave information
to Finch's lawyer that would hurt Merritt.

290
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
So…

291
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,360
was Sam Haig helping her
or was he hurting her?

292
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
I don't know.

293
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,120
Which is why we're all sitting here,
staring at the fucking toilets.

294
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,240
So, see when we first met,
be honest, what did you first think of me?

295
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,600
-Thought you were obnoxious.
-Obnoxious?

296
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,040
Mm. So obnoxious.

297
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,800
And cheeky as fuck.

298
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,080
You're clearly an amateur.

299
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
"Now, get up and do as I say,

300
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,640
and don't take pics of my balls."

301
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,760
-Didn't say the last bit.
-You most certainly did.

302
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,480
I said, "glittered balls."

303
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,040
Which sadly turns out to be a lie.

304
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
I like this.

305
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,240
I remember you were wearing it at the pub.
And… in the gardens?

306
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,320
You remembered this?

307
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,040
What, am I wrong?

308
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,880
Suits you. Almost like
you were born with it, yeah.

309
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Yeah, in a way I was.

310
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,480
You never take it off?

311
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
Mm-mm.

312
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
Good luck charm then.

313
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Not at all.

314
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,280
Certainly was for me.

315
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
No, seriously,
I think it might even be cursed.

316
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,600
Why wear it, then?

317
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
'Cause…

318
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,280
it's all that's left.

319
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
Left of what?

320
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,120
Or left of who?

321
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Did you even try to look for me?

322
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,760
-I'll be gone for a while.
-Where?

323
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,360
Mhòr, for a bit.

324
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,120
But what's on Mhòr for you?

325
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,440
My father.

326
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Mm.

327
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,800
-So how long you be gone?
-Who knows.

328
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,000
Wow. "Who knows" is code for forever.

329
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Please. I'm not going home
to live with my father.

330
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,320
I need to see him. And then, uh--

331
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,520
And then what?

332
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,520
-I'll ring when I get back.
-Which is when?

333
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
I don't know. When I get back.

334
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,720
-You're a right font of information.
-Can't we just fuck without sharing?

335
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,960
Is that what we're doing now?

336
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,680
"Just fucking"?

337
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,200
What did you think this was?

338
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,160
I have to go.

339
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,720
But you can stay.
Order some room service. Make a day of it.

340
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
Hey, Merritt.

341
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Fuck you.

342
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,480
There's a 10:00 a.m. boat.

343
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,320
Come with us.

344
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,680
"Us"?

345
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,760
My brother and me.

346
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,920
I'd like you to meet him.

347
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
-I understand.
-Merritt…

348
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,120
No, really, it's fine.
I wouldn't wanna go with me either.

349
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,440
Sorry, Sam.

350
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,760
Leave her be.

351
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,480
Look, I don't know if Sam was having
a relationship with this, um…

352
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,240
-Merritt Lingard.
-Yeah, this Merritt person.

353
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
But if it was personal,
he never mentioned it.

354
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
If it was professional,
there's no way he would've told me.

355
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,800
We don't know what it was yet.

356
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,440
How does this help in our investigation?

357
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,280
It helps in your investigation
into who killed Sam Haig.

358
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,680
-We're not investigating Haig's death.
-Well, maybe you should be.

359
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,560
Well, Merritt,
looks like someone felt bad for you.

360
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
As nice as I'm sure that feels,

361
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
I think we've reached
the end of our time together.

362
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,160
But before we go,

363
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,240
I need you to help us settle
an argument we've been having.

364
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,840
Fuck you.

365
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Just…

366
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,720
just kill me.

367
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,560
See, one of us thinks

368
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,040
that you can't figure out why you're here

369
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,720
because it was so long ago.

370
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,400
And you just need some help.

371
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,160
And one of us thinks
you're just a selfish cunt

372
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,480
who can't give a flying fuck
for anyone but yourself.

373
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Merritt, please, if you want to get out,
then you need to answer the question.

374
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,240
Why are you here?

375
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,120
So…

376
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,840
was Sam Haig helping her,
or was he hurting her?

377
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,000
Maybe both.

378
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Maybe both what?

379
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Dennis Piper said
that Haig was spending time at Godhaven

380
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,360
right before he died.

381
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,520
He was writing a story
about his time there.

382
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
It doesn't matter.

383
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,360
The only thing that matters is why
was he spending so much time at Godhaven

384
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,880
slap bang in the middle
of the fucking Graham Finch trial?

385
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Come on.

386
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Merritt, come on, think.

387
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,880
I can't think. Help me.

388
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,400
Last time we saw each other, it was--
Ow, fuck off!

389
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,160
-It was at a funeral. Fuck off!
-Enough!

390
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,920
Get the fuck outta here!

391
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,760
We know that Sam Haig was
at the hotel with Merritt,

392
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,200
September 24th, two days before he died.

393
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,880
He couldn't have been. He was
at the other hotel with Paul Evans's wife.

394
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,160
And he was with
both Paul and Chloe earlier, drinking.

395
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,800
Unless Paul Evans was lying.

396
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,320
Why make up something
so potentially embarrassing?

397
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,000
So Haig was with Merritt Lingard
and Chloe Evans at the same time?

398
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,320
Or… not at the same time
but on the same day?

399
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
It was two different people.

400
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,240
So… assuming this Sam Haig
Chloe and Paul Evans knew

401
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,200
was the real Sam Haig,

402
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,600
who the fuck

403
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,120
was spending all that time
with Merritt in room 401?

404
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,560
Last time we saw each other,
it was at a funeral!

405
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
-Fuck off! Enough!
-Enough!

406
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Harry's funeral?

407
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,280
-…ruin everything, ya' bastard!
-Would you get off?

408
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,440
Are you talking about Harry's funeral?

409
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,440
You stupid bastard!

410
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,800
-I want her to say it.
-Harry Jennings?

411
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,920
Harry Jennings?

412
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Is that…

413
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,280
Am I here because of Harry Jennings?

414
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,680
What? The same…

415
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,320
Harry Jennings who got pissed
and fell off the back of a ferry?

416
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,080
Why was he on that ferry, Merritt?

417
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
He was running away.

418
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
From what?

419
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
What do you mean, "From what?"
From… From what he did.

420
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,440
You killed him.

421
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
What?

422
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
Just as you did Sam Haig.

423
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Just as you did your ane brother.

424
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,520
No, no, no. What? Is my brother dead?

425
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,520
Everything you've touched is.

426
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,440
Is my brother dead?
You're gonna kill me anyway. Just tell me.

427
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,600
In a way.

428
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,400
But you already know that
you're the reason he became what he is.

429
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,440
Just as you already know
that you're the reason Sam Haig died.

430
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,800
Just as you already know
that you're the reason

431
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,040
my beautiful boy was taken from me.

432
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Your boy?

433
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,160
Harry was your boy?

434
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Ailsa.

435
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,800
Ailsa?

436
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Is that you?

437
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,480
Come on.

438
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,880
Wait, and the other one?
Who… Who's… Who's the other one?

439
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,200
Come on.

440
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
There was a brother.

441
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,840
Smells like sex.

442
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,160
Is that who you are?

443
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,480
You don't remember me.

444
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
I remember.

445
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Harry said you weren't right in the head.

446
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
Lyle.

447
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,400
Is that you?

448
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Lyle?

449
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm sorry…

450
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,560
about what happened

451
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,200
to your brother.

452
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,240
But, bitch, if you think

453
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm gonna take the blame
for the death of your idiot son

454
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,960
after what that radge bastard did
to my beautiful brother--

455
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Harry was there to do your dirty work.

456
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,760
No one asked him to!

457
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,320
He was a sweet lad,

458
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,720
but even on his best day,
Harry couldnae rub two thoughts together.

459
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,800
Lyle was always the smart one.

460
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,160
So don't you tell me--

461
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,840
I sure as fuck didn't tell him
to beat my brother into a coma!

462
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,440
All this time,
this has been about… Harry Jennings?

463
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
Harry Jennings

464
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,520
deserved to die.

465
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,520
So if that's why I'm here,

466
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,680
so you can watch me grovel over him,

467
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
it's too fucking bad

468
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,880
because I will never apologize to you

469
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
or his psychotic brother

470
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,520
for what Harry Jennings did to William.

471
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,680
Ready when you are, bitch.

472
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
Sam?

473
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,240
No, Sam!

474
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
Sam!

475
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,640
Oh, there he is.

476
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,280
My other issue,

477
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,760
the Mhòr king
of Hotel Hochmagandy himself,

478
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,760
Lyle Jennings.

479
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,000
And worry not, lass.

480
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,840
There's cures for ills
that smite the heart.

481
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Just try to focus on the task at hand.

482
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,920
As far as we're all concerned…

483
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,000
what's happening right in front of us

484
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,000
is the only thing happening.

485
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I see you, Mr. and Mrs. Polis.

486
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,280
Just hold your fucking horses.

487
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,880
It's not a very progressive thing
to say, I know,

488
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,160
but there are two kinds of kids
who come here.

489
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
The kind you can help
and the kind you cannae.

490
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
The kinds no one can.

491
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,120
Budding sociopaths
and the complete psychopaths.

492
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,480
Well, I'm the one who gets them.

493
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,560
The worst of the worst. The irredeemable.
The completely fucking hopeless.

494
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,840
What makes you so uniquely qualified?

495
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm one of them,
so I know how to reach them.

496
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,200
What? By teaching them how to knit?

497
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
And make their beds.

498
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,640
Clean the loo.

499
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Make a fucking Chinese chicken salad.

500
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
All the wee joy

501
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,360
and the… the wee mundane of life.

502
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,680
-Does it work?
-Yeah. It definitely distracts them.

503
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,200
What kind of a kid was Sam Haig?

504
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Sam was anyone he needed to be
in order to get whatever he wanted.

505
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,080
I'd call him
more sociopath than psychopath.

506
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
Why was he here?

507
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,440
He had a relationship
with one of his teachers.

508
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,000
Doesn't the teacher usually get the blame?

509
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,800
Not if the student steals
the teacher's bank cards

510
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,240
and fucks the PIN number out of her.

511
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,160
He was, uh, 15 year old for that one.

512
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,600
What, there were others?

513
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,840
Aye, quite a few.

514
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,200
Sam never had friends. He had targets.

515
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,640
One of whom
may have chucked him off a cliff.

516
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,200
There's probably a long list of people
who could've done that to him.

517
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,720
So four years ago Sam Haig turns up here,
and he wants to talk about… what?

518
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,040
He said he wanted to write a book
about his time here.

519
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,360
You didn't believe him?

520
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,480
Well, he… he seemed more interested
in talking about one of the other lads.

521
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,480
-The other lad he nearly beat to death?
-How'd you know about that?

522
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,360
There's a lovely recording
of your interview

523
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,680
with Sam talking about him.

524
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,920
I assume you're referring to the recording
Sam Haig stole during his visit.

525
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,120
I couldn't say.

526
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,960
It was sent to me by a reporter
who claims he found it on Sam's laptop.

527
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
Was he asking about Rocket?

528
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,680
Rocket?

529
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,320
The kid Sam beat up.

530
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,760
-His name was Rocket?
-This is Scottish slang for "crazy."

531
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,680
I thought "Scottish" was
Scottish slang for "crazy."

532
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Well, Sam met his match with Rocket,
that's for sure.

533
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,280
The kid was scary as fuck
when he got off the bus,

534
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,240
but after he got that fucking dead eye…

535
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
Dead eye?

536
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,280
One of his eyes was black.

537
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
But not to begin with.

538
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Not until Sam Haig kicked
the color right out of it.

539
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Does Rocket have a given name?

540
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,360
Lyle Jennings.

541
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,120
Lyle Jennings?

542
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Really? Brother of Harry Jennings.

543
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,440
Who robbed the Lingards
and attacked William.

544
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,600
So you know about Lyle?

545
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,360
No, but we'd like to.

546
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,440
State your name for the record please.

547
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
Lyle Jennings.
