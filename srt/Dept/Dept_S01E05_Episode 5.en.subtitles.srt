1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,080
Paul Evans?

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,960
Sorry, guys.
Whatever you're selling, I don't need it.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,560
-Definitely can't afford it.
-We're buying, not selling.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,200
-Sam Haig.
-What about him?

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,080
-You found him?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,680
He's a person of interest
in a case we're working on.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,760
-Sam's dead four years now.
-Yeah, September 26th.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
Woman named Merritt Lingard
went missing on the 27th.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,920
-Okay.
-They were in a relationship.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,360
What sort of relationship?

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
That's what we're trying to figure out.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,000
Is it the adrenaline?
Is that the attraction, the danger?

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,040
No, it's not really like that. Um…

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,600
Climbing takes focus.
More like meditating.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,640
Meditating by hanging on
by your fingertips?

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Yeah. Suppose you can't understand it
unless you've done it.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,960
-Any of these Haig?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,720
-Which one's Haig?
-Here.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
Ooh.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,800
Happy-go-lucky chap?

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
He was pissed off I took that picture.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,560
-Can I have that?
-Sure.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,120
Thanks. So tell us how you found him.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,800
I went up there early one morning
to take some photos for the website.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
That's when I noticed
Sam's car was in the car park.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,680
How early?

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Before the gate was open.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I had my own key,

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,160
but that meant that
Sam's car had been locked in overnight.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,920
Any idea how he fell?
Outside that he let go.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,760
I couldn't say.
Other than he broke my cardinal rule.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,160
Never climb alone.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,920
-And why would he do that?
-Don't know.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
Maybe he'd been watching
too many Alex Honnold videos

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,920
and decided to free-solo the crag.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah, like a fucking idiot.
Help yourselves.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Thank you.

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,600
So, what, he… liked to take risks?

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Sam? His whole damn life was one big risk.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,880
I think he preferred the word "adventure."

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,440
He shows up
saying he needed a distraction.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
That he was bored with his routine
investigating murderers or whatever.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,480
If you can believe that.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,440
-Didn't like him?
-I liked Sam.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,120
I just wasn't thrilled
about his friendship with Paul.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Why?

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,160
Well, he was a psycho.

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,880
-Chloe, come on.
-He was.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,800
I wasn't remotely surprised he'd fallen.
Just relieved Paul wasn't with him.

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,480
You know he knew
you didn't like having him around.

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
-Yeah, 'cause he was always around.
-He was lonely.

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
You reap what you sow.

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,920
Meaning he was responsible
for his own death?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
Meaning it was inevitable.

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,600
Look, I don't know if Sam was having
a relationship with this, um…

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,360
-Merritt Lingard.
-Yeah, this Merritt person.

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,000
But if it was personal,
he never mentioned it.

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,000
If it was professional,
there's no way he would've told me.

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,600
We don't know what it was yet.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,520
Did he ever mention anyone?
Other friends, maybe?

61
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Family? Girlfriend?

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, he was lonely.

63
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,760
When he wasn't at work,
he was here or up on the crag.

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
Yeah, with Paul.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Okay.

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
I think we've taken up
enough of your time. Thank you.

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,880
Uh, how often did Sam climb the crag?

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Once a week.

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
On any particular day, or…

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,040
Usually later on when it was less busy.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,920
And how long
does it take to get to the top?

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Uh, for Sam, 45 minutes.

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
-Longer if he was free-soloing it.
-Why longer?

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,960
You're more careful
when there isn't a rope.

75
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
-Thank you.
-Sure.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,480
So he climbed
all the way up there without any ropes.

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Doesn't exactly scream murder
so much as "What the fuck did you expect?"

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
There is at least a dozen signs stating
the hours of the park

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,120
and how the gate will be locked
and your vehicle will be unable to leave.

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,720
He ignored the signs.

81
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Sam Haig fell on a Sunday.

82
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
We know
because he wasn't found until Monday

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,680
when Paul Evans saw
his car still in the car park.

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,320
Sam climbed here once a week.

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,880
The climb takes 45 minutes,
or an hour if you're free-climbing.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
I get your point.

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
He knew he did not have time.
He knew the rules. Why did he do it?

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,560
Either he was a raving lunatic
like what's-her-name said

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,960
or someone chucked him off.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,080
Again, why?

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,800
I don't know, but the answer lies
with whatever he was doing with Merritt

92
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
as opposed to here.

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
He didn't have his car keys.

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,600
Somehow his car is locked,
with his equipment bag still inside,

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
but no keys were ever found.

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,040
Not in the lockers in the climbing center,

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,400
not on his person,
not anywhere around here where he fell.

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,880
I won't argue. It's all wrong.

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,320
It's all obviously wrong,
as it was with Merritt.

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,440
Where I come from,
when facts are being so clearly ignored,

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,680
it's never because of incompetence.

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,720
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
La, la, la

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
La, la, la

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,840
La, la, la

106
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,440
-Sam Haig. Wasn't sure you'd come.
-I'm not staying.

107
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
-Oh?
-You need to stop bothering my PA.

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,800
-Sabrine said I was bothering her.
-I'm saying it.

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
Okay.

110
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,120
Not remotely interested
in talking to a reporter about my work.

111
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,600
Understood.

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Well,

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,080
thank you for taking the time
to come by and tell me in person.

114
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
I might as well have something to eat.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,000
Hear the onion soup's amazing.

116
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
You don't do profiles.

117
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Not anymore, no.

118
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,040
-You cover organized crime.
-Yeah.

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
-Why would you want to write about me?
-I don't.

120
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
Like you said, you're not my thing.
The idea came up in a meeting.

121
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I see.

122
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,280
It was my editor.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Saw a statement you made on TV,

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,280
the one about, um,
how nobody gets away with anything,

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,200
and I thought you might be
worth looking into.

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,560
-But not you.
-I did what I do.

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,680
-Found some interesting things.
-But?

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,600
But it's maybe the stuff
I couldn't find that's more interesting.

129
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,720
Like what?

130
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Like your background.

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,560
-Mhòr in particular.
-What about Mhòr in particular?

132
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,360
You don't talk about it.

133
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,840
You talk about uni.

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
You talk about work.

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't find anything
where you talk about… you.

136
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,200
Because I'm
the least interesting part of my life.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I wonder.

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,160
Unlike most people,
I don't curate my private life.

139
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,600
-Keep it private.
-You want to remain a mystery, I get that.

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
Hey, Sam.

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
Bullshit.

142
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's cut the cute little boy act
and get to what's happening.

143
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,720
You think there's
something rotten in my department.

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,720
Something having to do with, say,
oh, I don't know, organized crime?

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,480
So that's why
you came to meet me in person.

146
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
You want to eyeball me.

147
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,320
Yeah, I'd do the same.

148
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
So is there?

149
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,800
Something rotten in Denmark?

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,960
I have no idea,

151
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
but if you're the one asking,

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
I bet you have one.

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Your dad's a fisherman, right?

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
So you know that a boat
with a weak spot in the hull is

155
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,040
the same as a boat with a leak.

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,600
And in that awesome metaphor,
am I the weak spot or the leak?

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,400
Maybe you're just on a leaky boat.

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,360
You're the mystery.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
-Am I?
-More like a phantom.

160
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,040
Byline in a bunch of headlines.
Lots of awards.

161
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
But…

162
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
no bio.

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,800
No social media.

164
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,920
No recent photos.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Camera makes me look fat.

166
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,360
Given who and what you write about,

167
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,680
I suppose
some level of caution is necessary.

168
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Only if I want to continue living.

169
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,240
I can't be my own subject.

170
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,080
And in that regard,
you and I are in the same boat,

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
so to speak.

172
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,480
Enjoy your soup, Mr. Haig.

173
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
Hello?

174
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,240
Oh, hello.

175
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
Need some help?

176
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,240
Uh, yeah, that'd be lovely. Thank you.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,040
Yeah, just…

178
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,720
-Where's it going?
-Just over there. Sorry.

179
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,000
-Jesus Christ.
-Ah, it's heavier than it looks.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
Uh… Oh, it's the other way round.

181
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Oh.

182
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Okay, here we go. I'll just grab it.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
-Oh.
-Yeah.

184
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh.

185
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,040
-You got it?
-Yep, got it.

186
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,360
Yeah, cool, thank you.

187
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
-I'm looking for--
-Hold on.

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,320
Okay.

189
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,960
I'm looking for Carl.

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,720
With regard to…

191
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, we had an appointment,
which, of course, he missed,

192
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,360
so I'm here to tell him
how I feel about that.

193
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
And you are?

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
Rachel Irving. I'm working with HR.

195
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,400
-You're the cover for Dr. Sonnenberg.
-You should be a detective.

196
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Well, I heard Carl say
you were very nice to look at, so…

197
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
Is that a urinal?

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,520
Is, um… is Sally coming back?

199
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
Uh, Dr. Sonnenberg.

200
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't think so.

201
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,560
Were you seeing her?

202
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,480
Maybe for your OCD?

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm not seeing her anymore.
I only saw her once or twice.

204
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840
Mm.

205
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,360
Maybe a bit more than that,
but, um… no, that was a while ago.

206
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,520
She was nice.

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,840
I had a bit of PTSD.

208
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
Along with the OCD.

209
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,920
And some ADHD. BED.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Wow. Walloped by the whole alphabet.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Right in the bahookie, yeah.

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,840
Did the tennis balls help?

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,120
Not really, no,
but, uh, she seemed very keen.

214
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
-So…
-Mm.

215
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
Got a firm handshake now.

216
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,480
How are you feeling now?

217
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Better.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,400
I mean, not totally better.
I get the odd flashback, but, um…

219
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
-Yeah.
-It's all right.

220
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
Don't have to talk about it.

221
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you.

222
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
-Looks like a big case.
-Aye.

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,200
Thought he was exaggerating.

224
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,640
Uh, no, Carl doesn't really lie.

225
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,960
Not about the big stuff, anyway.
Just about himself.

226
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,560
Mm. That's the human condition, isn't it?

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,480
Protecting ourselves.

228
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
I find the human condition

229
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,640
to be more indecision,
disappointment, and depression.

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,600
What's your name?

231
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
Uh, Rose.

232
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,440
Well, Rose, we've only just met,
so take this as you will,

233
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,840
but maybe sitting in a dark basement
isn't the best place for you.

234
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
I think I met her once,

235
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,280
Merritt Lingard.

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
-On the job?
-No, at a party with an ex.

237
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,920
Lawyers. All know each other.

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
-What was she like?
-Guarded.

239
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Well, I should get going.

240
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,680
If you do see Carl--

241
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,800
I was a passenger in a pursuit
when we hit a pedestrian.

242
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Ferry Road? Pensioner?

243
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm so sorry. I remember that.

244
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Me too,

245
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,160
which is the problem.

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
Uh, what was your message for Carl?

247
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,200
Doesn't matter.

248
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, why bother? He'll just ignore it.

249
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
I think he feels responsible.

250
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,480
For what?

251
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Everything.

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,680
Well, it was nice to meet you, Rose.

253
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Oh, wow.

254
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,920
You weren't kidding about that handshake.

255
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,760
It's not that unusual.

256
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Sam Haig met lots of his sources
in hotels of one sort or another.

257
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,760
Sure, but did any go missing after,
or in this case, the day after Sam died?

258
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
I obviously couldn't say.

259
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,680
Could he have been working
on a story with Merritt,

260
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
one that put her at risk as well?

261
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,120
If he was,
it'd be the first I've heard of it,

262
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
but that also isn't so unusual.

263
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,880
-But you were his editor.
-Doesn't mean I knew what he was up to.

264
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,880
Sam worked under the radar
for his own safety.

265
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
How did that work?

266
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
I spoke with him, but I rarely saw him.

267
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,000
He lived in the sticks,
used a burner phone.

268
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm not even sure
Sam Haig was his real name.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
We had what you might call
an arm's-length relationship.

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,640
Still, you must have known
what he was working on.

271
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,040
Not until he was ready to tell me.
Until then, he did his own thing.

272
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,720
-I assume he took notes?
-I'm sure he did.

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,840
But as to where he may have kept them,
I'm afraid that information died with him

274
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,520
and probably for the best.

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
-You weren't curious at all?
-I was damn curious.

276
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,960
And great effort was made
to locate any of his work product,

277
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,680
but nothing was found.

278
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,080
That itself is curious.

279
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,560
Again, not if you knew the sorts of people
Sam spent his time with.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,920
Do you think one of them
shoved him off the cliff?

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,760
This may sound surprising
coming from someone like me,

282
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,000
but not everything is a conspiracy.

283
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,240
As Freud liked to say,

284
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,160
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

285
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
And sometimes it's a big, throbbing--

286
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,680
Thank you very much for your time.

287
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Thank you.

288
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,400
Thought I'd give you a call
so you can see our new home.

289
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Yeah, that's right.

290
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
We're down in the fucking basement.

291
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,200
Lots of storage.

292
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,400
Mm. Helmets, need to remember them.

293
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,280
That's the big yin's desk,

294
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
Akram's desk,

295
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,680
and… my desk.

296
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,960
Ooh, over here, we have…
the bathroom unit.

297
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,240
Got some lovely showers,

298
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,600
a disgusting sink,

299
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,440
and some toilets
so horrendous the rats avoid them.

300
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,920
I had no idea
any of this stuff was even down here.

301
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,680
Before my time, I guess.

302
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,080
Can I have a tissue?

303
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,560
Look, I'm sorry
for falling all to pieces the other day.

304
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,480
-Thank you for setting me right.
-Is that the board?

305
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,560
Yeah. Do you want to see it?

306
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,400
No, I wanna see more urinals.
Yeah, I fuckin' wanna see it.

307
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
What's the cormorant?

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
-The what?
-The cormorant, the bird on the hat.

309
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
Oh. No, that's a boobrie.

310
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,920
Is it fuck. It's a cormorant, a real bird.

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,280
Not some fucking myth that lives
in lochs and eats otters and shit.

312
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,600
-There's a bird that eats otters?
-Not a real one. It changes shape.

313
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,440
Sometimes it's a giant insect
that sucks blood out of horses.

314
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,680
-Really?
-Really.

315
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
That's not a boobrie. It's a cormorant.

316
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
But how do you know?

317
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,440
'Cause I'm a fucking fisherman. Or I was.

318
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,120
What's it doing on the board?

319
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,520
Whatever type of bird it is,
I think maybe it ate Merritt.

320
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
What?

321
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,000
William Lingard twice saw
someone wearing that hat.

322
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,440
-Once on the boat and once at home.
-At home?

323
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,000
Apparently,
someone was prowling around the house.

324
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,040
-Why "apparently"?
-William isn't exactly communicative.

325
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,520
So he drew this one
after he escaped from Egley House

326
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,120
and this one right before she disappeared.

327
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,760
Can you do me a favor, pal?

328
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
Can you scan both sides
and send it over to me?

329
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,840
Okay.

330
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,880
Inspector. Uh, Dennis Piper.
I was at your press conference.

331
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,840
Lucky you.

332
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,480
-I wondered if you heard the news.
-What news?

333
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,000
About P.C. Anderson's fiancée.
The officer killed in Leith Park.

334
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
I know who the fuck he was.
What about his fiancée?

335
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,920
She had her baby today. A wee girl.

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Care to comment?

337
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,560
Yeah. Fuck off.

338
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,520
No message for her? How about an apology?

339
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,680
She blames you, Morck.
Says it should have been you who died.

340
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,360
Well, maybe it should.

341
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Carl.

342
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,080
Carl's not down here.

343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
I know, ma'am. He took some personal time.

344
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,760
Of course he did.
Walk me through all of this.

345
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
I should probably let D.C.I. Morck--

346
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
Just walk me through it.

347
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,680
Right.

348
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,680
Well, along with determining her movements
in the weeks before she disappeared,

349
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,320
we are trying to get a sense
of who Merritt Lingard was.

350
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,200
And who was she?

351
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,280
She was… controversial.

352
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,760
So, basically, you don't have much?

353
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,400
Not yet. We don't.

354
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
There was a…
an incident at the Lingard house.

355
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
An incident?

356
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
Apparently.

357
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,680
A young man
who was squatting there with two females

358
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,200
was admitted to hospital
with a crushed windpipe.

359
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
-Well, it sounds painful.
-Knock it off.

360
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
I didn't crush his windpipe.

361
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,680
I didn't say you did.

362
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,600
I meant I didn't crush it.
I only bruised it.

363
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,040
I could have, of course, have crushed it,

364
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
but then he wouldn't
have been able to talk.

365
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Where'd you learn such techniques?

366
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,680
I grew up in a very rough part of Syria.

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,640
Isn't it all rough there these days?

368
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Some of it is very beautiful.

369
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,520
You understand that you're not in Syria.
You're not a policeman.

370
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,200
-Yes, ma'am.
-You're here to assist Carl.

371
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,000
And… it's a real pleasure.

372
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,640
If anything should happen
while you're out there playing policeman,

373
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,120
bruising but not crushing people's necks,

374
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,960
there'd be hell to pay,

375
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
for all of us.

376
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
Of course, ma'am. I understand.

377
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,000
Good. Keep me informed.

378
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Fucking hell.

379
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't know who's doing your PR.
I'd be asking for a refund.

380
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,320
Here we go.

381
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,960
There's some good surgeons here.
One of them could sew your mouth shut.

382
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,080
Tell you what, how about instead,
"Carl, you fucking legend, thank you"?

383
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
"Thank you, thank you,

384
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,680
for my brand-spanking-new
fucking computer."

385
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,160
"Hey, anything for you, Hardy.
You're welcome."

386
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,520
It's interesting
you got Rose to deliver it.

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
She's in a funk.
You two are thick as thieves.

388
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
She's in a funk 'cause you're a cunt.

389
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,480
There's meds for that.
I'm in the right place.

390
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,760
-She just wants to impress you.
-Unlikely.

391
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,000
-Maybe fake it once in a while.
-You were always better at that.

392
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
I was better at everything.

393
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
Right, first of all…

394
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
this is a cormorant.

395
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll take your word for it.

396
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,560
-What do we make of it?
-We think it's a logo.

397
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
-No shit, Sherlock. For whom?
-Nothing's turned up.

398
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,320
For me neither.

399
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh.

400
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,960
What a relief it is to know
that you're checking on my work.

401
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,240
More like doing it.

402
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,280
I have a motive
as to why someone might have taken her.

403
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,240
-She and Haig were poking the wrong bear.
-Different motive.

404
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Hit me.

405
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,200
It's the universal motive
for all crime throughout human history.

406
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,440
-Love?
-Money.

407
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,680
Go back to your birds
because that family were broke.

408
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,320
Jamie Lingard was broke.

409
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,360
Lila Lingard, née Lila Graham, was rich.
Her family had money.

410
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,200
Money from where?

411
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,960
Centuries of dead relatives.
This is Britain, after all.

412
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,400
I gather you traced the card
that she paid for the hotel room with.

413
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,120
-You gather correctly.
-And?

414
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,000
It's linked to a trust account
in the Channel Islands Bank on Jersey,

415
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,960
where sadly the trail,

416
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,200
much like the money
of the wealthy cunts there, vanished.

417
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,520
Your brilliant motive is
someone took Merritt

418
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
in order to somehow steal her money?

419
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,920
Wicked, Watson.

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,360
-Good morning, James.
-Dr. Loo, is it Wednesday already?

421
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,200
No, but your most recent MRI
was so promising,

422
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
I thought I'd add a session.

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,320
-Shite.
-Like lying in bed all day?

424
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,480
Yeah, his favorite things happen in there.

425
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Who are you? What are you doing here
interrupting my session?

426
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,880
Carl, my ex-partner.

427
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
-Ah, didn't know you were gay.
-Police.

428
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,720
You should've said
"partner in the police," then, yes?

429
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,520
These days, you have
to help people parse these things.

430
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,280
What's the deal with the rehab?

431
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,640
The doctor said
he was as far as he's gonna get.

432
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,880
Well, aren't you
just a ray of bloody sunshine?

433
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,240
I, too, am a doctor,
and as I told James last month,

434
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,000
his other doctor doesn't know him
as well as I do,

435
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,040
and therefore doesn't know that he may,
in fact, be able to walk again.

436
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
-May.
-Depends on how James continues to heal.

437
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,320
-Which so far has been encouraging.
-So far.

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,680
-How long's this been going on?
-Not long.

439
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
I like to start within days of surgery.

440
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,600
Days? Oh, okay.

441
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,480
One waits too long
and the body forgets itself.

442
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,600
These four months of rehab
have been productive.

443
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,160
When Dr. Loo says rehab,
what she really means is

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
watching me fall over
and me cursing her every fucking day.

445
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,160
I don't laugh, and you don't curse,
or you know what happens.

446
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,720
-Hey.
-Oh, progress.

447
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
You can feel that, yeah?

448
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,840
Wee bit.

449
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,720
You can leave.

450
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Yeah.

451
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
Cheery-bye, well.

452
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,400
Feel free to beat the shit out of him.

453
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
Carl, Moira wants to see you.

454
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,160
Mm-hmm.

455
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,320
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah, and she saw me.

456
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,680
So it's very often
the most boring, insignificant detail

457
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,120
that leads to a solution.

458
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,720
The mundane or a break from the mundane.

459
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
Four years gone,
it's difficult to reconstruct

460
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,160
the details of a person's life,

461
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,560
so we gravitate towards
the events right before the crime.

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
But in this case,

463
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,160
we need to look further back…

464
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
-Fuck's sake, Carl.
-…and look at--

465
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,640
Save your lecture on criminology.
You're sending me to sleep.

466
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,440
Get to the point. Merritt's money.

467
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
It's called being a mentor.

468
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,760
Aye, you're doing a bang-up job.

469
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,200
Okay.

470
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,960
What does everyone think
about Hardy's "Merritt had money" theory?

471
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,520
We know she had a trust fund.

472
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,840
We know she was drawing money
from the trust up until she disappeared.

473
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,000
We don't know
what happens if Merritt dies.

474
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
But we can guess it all goes to William.

475
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,040
-A lot of fucking guessing.
-You're not helping.

476
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,040
And could you sit up, for Christ's sake?
You look like a fucking severed head.

477
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,920
Are you a wee bit upset
I didn't tell you about rehab?

478
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,680
-I wasn't upset.
-Looked like you were gonna cry again.

479
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,640
Fuck off. You could've said something.

480
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
Had an enema. Should I have told you that?

481
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,040
Yeah, 'cause it would have cheered me up.
The troll thinks that you can walk.

482
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,560
She thinks I can move.
There's a wee difference.

483
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Still, would've been nice to have known.

484
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,680
If William couldn't manage
the trust, then who would?

485
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,520
It would've been managed
by his legal guardian.

486
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,200
She told you she was his legal guardian.

487
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,440
-She did.
-Wait, who's "she"?

488
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,440
-In those exact words.
-In those exact words.

489
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,600
-Where are we going? Who is "she"?
-I'll tell you in the car.

490
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
Do I win?

491
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Hello?

492
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,640
Alice, come on in.

493
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,640
Make yourself comfortable.
I won't be long.

494
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,920
-You have cobwebs.
-Technically, they're not mine.

495
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,120
A spider could drop from the ceiling
onto one of your patients.

496
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Potentially.

497
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,560
I heard they're good luck
when they're crawling in your hair.

498
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,400
Ah, no. I… I don't think that's true.

499
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,760
So……I assume you've seen the paper?

500
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,400
-I tried to warn you.
-Aren't you supposed to be helping?

501
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,560
The man has to be here for me to help him.

502
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,560
-What?
-He was a no-show yesterday.

503
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,240
Jesus, Carl.

504
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,280
I'd love to rubber-stamp him
and send him on his merry way.

505
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,800
If something happens,
I'll get blamed for cutting him loose.

506
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,520
He's already loose.

507
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,680
That's on you, not me.

508
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,880
It was a goodish idea
keeping him in the basement

509
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,840
'cause letting him out in public
with all that anger…

510
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,640
He's already assaulted a journalist.

511
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,800
That was more of a shove.

512
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,960
What happens when he shoves a suspect?

513
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
Or a colleague?

514
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,960
What if he turns on himself?

515
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,760
Carl's a lot of things,
but he'd never do that.

516
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,120
Are you sure?

517
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,960
You're relying on this loophole

518
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,720
about cold cases
not being active duty, but…

519
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
it's bitten you in the bum, hasn't it?

520
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,600
Maybe it's a personality clash.

521
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,000
-How do you mean?
-Him not coming.

522
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,440
After all, not every therapist is
right for every patient.

523
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,520
That's very true.

524
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,760
So, it's possible Carl might respond
better to a different therapist.

525
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,440
He might.

526
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
I'd suggest you shop around.
See who he clicks with.

527
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,800
Knowing Carl, I'm sure he'd love to go
on that journey of discovery.

528
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,120
I'm just trying to be pragmatic.

529
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Not my circus, not my monkeys,
as they say.

530
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,960
Tell him I said tatty-bye?

531
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,400
-D.C.I. Morck to see Doc Wallace.
-I know who you are.

532
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,920
You can't go up there.

533
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,760
Let them do their job, please.
Buzz Dr. Wallace.

534
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,200
-I don't believe we have an appointment.
-We don't.

535
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,000
Might wanna close the door, Doc.

536
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,160
Are you going to tell me
what this intrusion is about?

537
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Sit down,

538
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
please.

539
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,720
Why do you allow William Lingard
to stay here gratis?

540
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
I don't allow him anything.

541
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
It's an arrangement where he gets a home

542
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,000
and I get to observe his condition
in more conducive surroundings.

543
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,240
-And by conducive, you mean comfortable?
-Certainly.

544
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,120
No one flourishes in a warehouse,
which is what most institutions are.

545
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
William?

546
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,880
Ah, you must have collated
an awful lot of data

547
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
over the four years he's been here.

548
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,880
Quite a bit, yes.

549
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,160
I hasten to add that William's condition
has improved significantly as well.

550
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,200
You said his condition was deteriorating.

551
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,720
I think you may have misheard me.

552
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,360
St. Moritz. Nice.

553
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,920
William.

554
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,920
You said you had the power
to prevent me talking to William

555
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,360
on the grounds
that you were his legal guardian.

556
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
That's true. I am.

557
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,360
What does that mean, exactly?

558
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,160
It means, simply put, I make
all the decisions that affect his life.

559
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,960
Such as how best to, um…

560
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,200
allocate his finances?

561
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm not sure I follow you.

562
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,640
And I'm sure you do.

563
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,600
-I'm not sure I like what you're implying.
-What's that?

564
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,800
That I'm somehow stealing money
from one of my patients, which is absurd.

565
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
Very nice piece.

566
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
-What's happening?
-This man is not well.

567
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,120
You need to leave now.

568
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,920
-Police. We're here to check on him.
-I don't care. Neither of you can be here.

569
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
What is wrong with him?

570
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,120
Fucking hell.

571
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,960
As legal guardian,
even with power of attorney,

572
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,360
I'm only allowed to contact the trustee.

573
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,560
I have no reason to be

574
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,280
because I provide
for every aspect of William's care.

575
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Except the trustee, in this case,
has been missing for four years.

576
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,960
Which is why the bank appointed
a lawyer to act as the trustee.

577
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,520
Yeah, the Bank of Jersey.

578
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Wherever it may be, yes.

579
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,160
-Rose, help me.
-Absolutely not.

580
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,920
-I was not asking you for permission.
-Mm.

581
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,400
Listen, my friend,
it's best you step aside.

582
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Thank you.

583
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,360
-Right.
-Let's turn him over.

584
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,560
-Okay.
-Careful.

585
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,760
Say I search this office.

586
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,280
What do you think the chances are…

587
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,640
…there might be a checkbook
or bank card in William Lingard's name?

588
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,400
Zero chance.

589
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,760
Because you're not going to search
this office, not without a warrant.

590
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
That's a funny old answer.

591
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,120
Meaning?

592
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,240
Meaning you could've just said "zero."

593
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,920
As someone with power of attorney,
I'm entitled to hold those documents.

594
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah, but you told me
you pay for William's care

595
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,080
in exchange
for the vast knowledge he's giving you.

596
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,240
I'm making a point that there are rules.

597
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,720
If I were withdrawing money
from William's trust,

598
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,720
I'd need to account for every expense.

599
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:21,160
Yeah, such as the annual service
on a 2024 Mercedes SLC 250D.

600
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,720
That would trigger an immediate audit.

601
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,840
But go ahead, have your fun.

602
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,160
With no family to complain,
not much chance of anybody noticing.

603
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,560
There's a large chance
of the bank noticing.

604
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,480
There are systems that alert them
if anyone goes over the allotted limit.

605
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,120
How many of your patients are
only children from old money?

606
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,520
Okay, you can leave now.

607
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,320
You're worse than impertinent.
You're being scurrilous.

608
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
How'd you think
it'll sound to a prosecutor

609
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,240
when they hear that not long
after Merritt Lingard disappeared,

610
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,240
you showed up, whisked her brother away,
and then started spending his money?

611
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,160
Get out.

612
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,520
And when the fine folk
in your world find out,

613
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,560
oh, fuck me…

614
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,840
…you're done.

615
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,760
-I'm done?
-Mm-hmm.

616
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,440
Do you have any idea
who I know in your world?

617
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,680
Uh, no,

618
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,120
and I don't give a shit,

619
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,160
so you can save this righteous indignation

620
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,920
for your trial, okay?

621
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,800
-They've got him drugged.
-He's fine.

622
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,240
-He's just been sedated.
-What for?

623
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,760
Sometimes if he's agitated, we give him
a small dose of Thorazine or Haldol.

624
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,280
Sometimes? Or right before we turned up?
How many other patients you got doped up?

625
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
They all are.

626
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,240
Fuck.

627
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,840
Where's William?

628
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
-Get him in the car.
-I don't think you have the author--

629
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
No.

630
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,760
No.You're in enough trouble.

631
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't think you planned it.

632
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,920
My guess is it probably just evolved
as you looked after William.

633
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,160
One of those things that once you started,
once you got a taste

634
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,040
for how easy it was to get that money,
you couldn't stop.

635
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,440
And then, like most embezzlers,

636
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,040
you sleep like a fucking baby at night
by telling yourself you earned it.

637
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,080
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

638
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,840
I cannot stress to you
how much I don't wanna regret this, okay?

639
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,760
Now, didn't pack anything,
so he's gonna need a toothbrush and a t--

640
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Jasper!

641
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
Was that Jasper I just saw?

642
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,720
It was.

643
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,600
Said he needed a few essentials,
but the only essential I saw was a bong.

644
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,840
Why didn't you ask him to wait for me?

645
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,880
You asked me repeatedly
to mind my own fucking business.

646
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Not when you can see
there's a hand grenade about to go off.

647
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,600
-Well, fear not. The flat did not explode.
-I was talking about Jasper.

648
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,400
I got the metaphor.

649
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
Bad day at the office?

650
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,760
Fuck off.

651
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,960
Go on, stick your choo-choos back on.

652
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
Wait. I live here too.

653
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,560
As if I need reminding.

654
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,120
-I'm allowed to be concerned.
-I'm allowed not to care.

655
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,440
You need to deal with some stuff.
You can't keep putting things off.

656
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,960
Says the man in his fucking eighth year
of a PhD on Wittgenstein.

657
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,160
It's Kierkegaard, you arse.
Do you never listen?

658
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,720
Maybe you should
because one of Søren's big themes

659
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,280
is why we get up in the morning.

660
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,800
A specific one, just for us.
Our own truth.

661
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,360
-Want to know mine?
-Not remotely.

662
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,160
I love my life.

663
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,600
Got my studies,

664
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,640
bit of work,

665
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,640
friends, hobbies.

666
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,760
How about you?

667
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,440
If you've got friends and hobbies,
why the fuck are you always here?

668
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
I'd love one, thanks.

669
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,040
Good throw, arsehole.

670
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,000
And for your information,
I've been going to a life drawing class.

671
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,440
Even met a lovely woman there.
Portuguese or maybe Brazilian.

672
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,080
We've been flirting.
Well, I've been flirting.

673
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,080
Her English isn't very good. Still…

674
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,120
Point is, I think you need
to find your own truth, Carl.

675
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,320
For everybody's sake, but mainly mine.

676
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Finished?

677
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,000
I think I preferred it
when you were quoting Yoko.

678
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,600
Oh, piss off, Carl.
Think about what I said.

679
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,680
Oh, Jesus.

680
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,040
Don't fall asleep on the couch.
You'll wake up more depressed.

681
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,120
-Where are you off to?
-The laundry.

682
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,160
Before it closes.

683
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,000
Do your laundry in your own fucking time.
There's actual police work to be done.

684
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,800
It's not my laundry. It's Merritt's.

685
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm doing what you told me to do.
Looking at the boring and the mundane.

686
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Meaning what?

687
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,920
You'll think it's stupid.

688
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,320
Oh, I'm sure I will.

689
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,080
But tell me anyway,
or I'll give you the boot,

690
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,080
and you can resume your prior role
as merry-andrew to the cunts upstairs.

691
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,880
Jesus, Carl.
You can't just say things like that.

692
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
What, "merry-andrew"?

693
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,040
No, "cunt."

694
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,600
Want to use it at the pub, fine,
but you can't bandy it about at work.

695
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,040
-There's rules.
-It's good enough for Chaucer.

696
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,600
Except this isn't Old England,
and you're not fucking Beowulf.

697
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
Beowulf? Chaucer wrote
The Canterbury Tale--

698
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,880
Just tell me, Wife of Bath.

699
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,320
I went again through Merritt's
receipts and credit card statements.

700
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,880
But this time, I went back for a year,
and I saw a pattern. Or a kind of one.

701
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,600
The shops she went to were
close to the Crown Offices,

702
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,600
which makes sense because there's not much
where she and William were living.

703
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,320
It made sense that, after work,

704
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,320
she'd do the shopping
or errands before she went home.

705
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,960
But it stood out to me
there was one place that she went to,

706
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,400
a laundry near the Cowgate

707
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,800
that wasn't really near the Crown Offices.

708
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,920
At first, I thought,
"That's not so weird."

709
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,680
Merritt would be particular
about where she took her clothes

710
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,160
because they were so nice.

711
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,640
She'd have her trusted place

712
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
where they know
how to look after nice things.

713
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,880
But this place wasn't that type of place.

714
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,920
She only went once, as far as I can tell,

715
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,240
whereas she went lots of times
to a posh place near the offices.

716
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,840
The statements show
she'd been going there for years.

717
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,720
What was she doing at this other place?

718
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,880
Oh, and it was only a week
before she disappeared.

719
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
Take Akram with you.

720
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
Cool.

721
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Um…

722
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,800
I'm D.C. Dixon. This is D.C. Salim.

723
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,040
Are you the proprietor?

724
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,000
Aye.

725
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,880
-Are you Shirley Atkins?
-What is this about?

726
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,800
I have a receipt from four years ago.

727
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,400
I was wondering if you might be able
to tell me about the customer.

728
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll look, but I doubt I could help.
I don't even keep records for that long.

729
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,200
What is this?

730
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,360
-You know bloody well I know who this is.
-Sorry--

731
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,080
Honestly think
I'd help you look for this bitch?

732
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,080
After what she did to my Kirsty?

733
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,560
-You knew Merritt?
-I wish I'd never fucking met her.

734
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
-She was a customer?
-She was never a customer.

735
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,400
She came here to apologize to me and Keith
but lost her fucking nerve.

736
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Danny, Kirsty's brother,
was working that day.

737
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,640
She took one look at him

738
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,040
and pretended
that her coat needed dry-cleaning

739
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,240
and got the hell out.

740
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,240
You say she left her coat with you.
Have you still got it?

741
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Are you kidding? I fucking burnt it.

742
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
-What was she apologizing for?
-Why don't you go ask my daughter?

743
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,080
Kirsty, you said her name was.
Um, where can I find her?

744
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,760
Inside Pentlands.

745
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
The prison?

746
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,640
Where they put her after Merritt Lingard
nearly got her killed in Saughton.

747
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,560
P.C. Mark Gilbey.

748
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,440
You remember him?

749
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,880
-Should I?
-My first partner.

750
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
He was on call.

751
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,200
A disturbance outside a pub.

752
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,760
It looked like nothing
until there was a knife.

753
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Then Mark was on the ground
in a pool of blood.

754
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,200
He survived, but…

755
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
he left the job.

756
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
I'm not sure
what we'd have done different,

757
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,720
but I felt guilty all the same.

758
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Still do.

759
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,560
But I've never wished it had been me.

760
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,880
I didn't say that. Not exactly.

761
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,040
You kinda did.

762
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,960
You all right, Carl?

763
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,480
Seems to be a matter of opinion.

764
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,600
Well, I had no shortage of them today.
There's a few people round here who worry.

765
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,000
-I'm fine.
-Uh, not about you.

766
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,240
-About their reputations.
-It was a…

767
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,680
journalist looking for a story.

768
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,920
I overreacted.

769
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,040
They want you stood down.

770
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,760
-I thought that was your shout.
-It is.

771
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,080
Which puts me in the firing line
for any further disasters.

772
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,720
Not letting them get to you, are you?

773
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,680
Don't presume, Carl.

774
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,280
We go back,
but right now, that's an argument

775
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,080
for listening to those opinions
rather than ignoring them.

776
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,800
You put me
in that fucking basement for a reason.

777
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,720
Yes.

778
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,040
I'd like you to do your thing quietly,
without bothering me.

779
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,880
Out of sight, out of mind,

780
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,120
while I do someone else's
dirty work, yeah?

781
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,000
What dirty work exactly is that?

782
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,280
Why did you assign Merritt Lingard's case
to Fergus Dunbar? Hm?

783
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,360
I would imagine
on the account of him being up next.

784
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,560
-Why'd you ask?
-You said yourself it was high profile.

785
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Had all the earmarks
that your betters get all tingly about.

786
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
That calls for someone good.

787
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,440
-Fergus ran a solid investigation.
-If it was so solid, why'd you pull him?

788
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,080
There were no more leads, it went cold,
and I needed him elsewhere.

789
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,880
Elsewhere. Hmm.

790
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,640
-Out of the building?
-That was his choice, not mine.

791
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
I liked Fergus.

792
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,880
Just like that,
everybody forgot about Merritt Lingard.

793
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,400
-Not everyone.
-So what, then?

794
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,960
Phone call, middle of the night?
Someone tell you to shut it down?

795
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm the first woman ever to do this job,

796
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
and that's important to me, yes,

797
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,480
but it's also important
for anyone who comes after me.

798
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,000
So you went along with it

799
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,440
so you didn't jeopardize
your important fucking position?

800
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,160
That's not what I'm saying at all.
I'm no fucking coward.

801
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,640
I push when I have to push,
and you fucking well know that too.

802
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,680
-Need I remind you…
-No, you need not.

803
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,600
…that I have saved your bacon
on more than one occasion.

804
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,080
In here, out there.

805
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,360
You made a mistake back then.
Bad call, fucking whatever.

806
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,680
Now you want me to fix it.

807
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,120
Now I would like you to solve the case

808
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,760
without being bounced
for being fucking psycho.

809
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,800
-Is that possible?
-Depends.

810
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,200
Got my back or not?

811
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,280
If you have to ask me that,
you've not been listening.

812
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,760
And for Christ's sake,
stop saying drippy rubbish

813
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,480
like "It should've been me."

814
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,320
Hi, Kirsty. Uh, take a seat.

815
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
Is this some kind of a stitch-up?
Here to fuck up my parole?

816
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,600
-No.
-'Cause I'm out in six weeks.

817
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,960
You're a model prisoner.

818
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,280
I fucking well am.

819
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,160
-Gonna go back to the laundry?
-Had enough laundry, thank you.

820
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm getting as far away as I can.

821
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,720
Start all over?

822
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,840
Disappear.

823
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,160
You're afraid.

824
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,240
Be an idiot otherwise.

825
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,360
Who attacked you at Saughton?

826
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,600
Seeing as the first thing they did
was stab me in the eye, I couldn't say.

827
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,720
Merritt Lingard disappeared
not long after.

828
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,520
Aye, I had her killed.

829
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,640
-Payback for nearly getting me killed.
-Really?

830
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,400
Hired a hitman
who followed her onto a ferry

831
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,720
and threw her over.

832
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,040
Well, that solves that.

833
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,200
You're welcome.

834
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,440
What?

835
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,480
I've found there are times

836
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,200
when people want to scare someone
to be quiet.

837
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,760
And there are times
when they skip that part

838
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,640
and make them quiet.

839
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
Okay.

840
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,960
I look at you and your injuries.
I can see you were not meant to be warned.

841
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,560
You were meant to be killed.

842
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,160
This is not new information to you.
You are sensibly afraid.

843
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,360
You know something.

844
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,360
You told Merritt
in hopes of getting an early release,

845
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,680
but something happened.

846
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Fucking yeah, something happened.

847
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,560
She fucking bailed on me.

848
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,280
What was the information?

849
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,400
There's no way I testify in court.

850
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,040
No way I admit to have seen anything.
I won't make that promise ever again.

851
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,600
I don't blame you.

852
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,640
Okay?

853
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,640
I was in a women's refuge for a while.

854
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,280
Before I got arrested.

855
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
I met this woman.

856
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,800
She wasnae there long,
but we got quite pally.

857
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,400
She said her husband tried to kill her.

858
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,640
He fucking gave her a beatdown.

859
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,720
Left her with black eyes and broken ribs.

860
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,920
He fucking broke her cheekbone.

861
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,960
She was convinced that he'd find her
at the refuge, so she left,

862
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,720
and I never saw her again
or even thought of her…

863
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,800
until her face was all over the news.

864
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,000
What for?

865
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,880
That case Lingard had.

866
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,280
The husband that killed his wife. Finch?

867
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,520
The woman was his wife.

868
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Andrea Finch.

869
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,720
Deal was I'd testify
about Andrea at the refuge

870
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,280
and get early release.

871
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,440
But last minute,
that bitch changes her mind…

872
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,960
saying that I couldn't testify

873
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,840
on account
of someone like me wasn't credible.

874
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,240
Only there's word out there
that I've been talking to her,

875
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,640
so I call her…

876
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,080
and I tell her…

877
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm not safe.

878
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,480
I'm getting threats.

879
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,240
Wait, who came for you?

880
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,840
These two bitches.
Fucking lifers, the both of them.

881
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,080
They walk in waving their shanks,
saying I pissed off somebody heavy.

882
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,080
-Who paid?
-I don't fucking know.

883
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,840
They get 500 quid on their commissary
and a name in their laundry bag.

884
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,440
But why go after you for information
that no one even knows you have?

885
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,760
There's people in here that know Finch,

886
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,120
and they know that I've talked to you,
so now you have to help me.

887
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,160
What did Merritt do?

888
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,800
-Where are you calling from?
-My cell.

889
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,280
On a smuggled phone?

890
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,000
What fucking difference does it make?
I told you.

891
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,800
I told you there's nothing I can do.

892
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,480
You fucking bitch.

893
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,320
Are you high?

894
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm fucking terrified.

895
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,760
Are you high?

896
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,000
What do you expect me to do?

897
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,480
Oh, Jesus Chr…

898
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,240
She hung up.

899
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,440
What was I supposed to do?

900
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,360
You left me hanging.
You wouldn't let me use Kirsty's evidence.

901
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,680
She was not going to help you.

902
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,640
She would've made it worse, in fact.

903
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,040
Kirsty Atkins has been stabbed.

904
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Oh, God.

905
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,960
Uh…

906
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,800
-How bad is it?
-I don't know.

907
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,080
She's, uh… alive, but she's in a coma.

908
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,120
Look, Kirsty's life has been the result
of a multitude of shitty choices,

909
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,800
none of them having
anything to do with you.

910
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,760
Well, tell that to her family.
They'll find that very comforting.

911
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,800
The first took out her eye,
the other punctured her lung,

912
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,280
along with another that missed her heart
by just a few millimeters.

913
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,960
Three wounds only. Two hit their mark,
while one of them was right close.

914
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,040
If it hadn't happened in prison,
I'd say a professional did it.

915
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,160
Where do you think
all the professionals are?

916
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,280
Sam Haig speaking.

917
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,120
-Kirsty!
-Hello?

918
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,400
Okay.

919
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,280
-Merritt?
-I'll talk to you.

920
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,120
Tell me where and when.
