1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,960
State your name for the record please.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,960
Lyle Jennings.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,360
-How's your eye?
-I've been hit way harder.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,440
Where? Here?

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,280
Here. At school. At home.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,160
-By who?
-Depended on the day really.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,840
But we always deserved it.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
"We"?

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,360
Me and my brother.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
-Why'd you say you deserve it?
-We were shites.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
They worked hard to put food on the table,
and we were ungrateful.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,920
-Those are your words?
-The words I'm using.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,520
It sounds
like something a parent would say.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,400
Well, she didn't really say anything.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040
-"She"?
-Our ma.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,520
Sometimes she'd just stop talking to us
for, like, months.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Months?

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,040
And we'd always try and figure out
what we did wrong, but…

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Mm.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,440
…it's way worse than getting hit.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
Not as bad as the hyperbar though.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,160
The hyperbar? What's that?

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,800
Hyperbaric chamber.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,400
It's what they put divers in
if they get the bends.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,960
-Like for scuba diving?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,840
You know,
sometimes the divers, they go down, and…

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,520
you know,
to check on the rigs or whatever,

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,960
and if they spend too long down there
or they come up too fast,

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
they have to go in there.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Our da bought an old one
for his business--

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Uh, and your ma would put you
inside this thing as punishment?

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Aye.

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,440
-For how long?
-It was hard to tell.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
She'd turn the lights on and off
at random hours.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
Harry would tell me
what time and day it was,

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,440
but I just knew he was making it up.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,280
He was tryna keep me calm.
I don't really like wee spaces like that.

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
Harry looked after you.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,440
Yeah, and I looked after Harry.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,040
After he died,
sometimes she'd just put us in there

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,720
and go and get pissed
and forget we were in there.

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Put "us" in there?
You mean put you in there?

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,360
You said,
"sometimes she'd put us in there,"

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,040
but you were in there alone.

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,960
But I wasn't alone.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Harry was with me.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,960
So then, this was after Harry died?

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
Aye, it was.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
So Harry was dead? He… He was gone?

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,600
Aye, he was dead, but he wasn't gone.
Harry would never leave me.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
So then, is he a ghost?

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
Think I'm a fucking pudding-head?

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Harry wasn't a ghost.

54
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
He was Harry.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
Is he here right now, then?

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Fuck off. You're just playing with me now.

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not playing with you.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,360
If you tell me to fuck off again,
I'm gonna kick you in the other eye.

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
Understood?

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Tell me about Sam Haig. What's up there?

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Tell you about who?

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
Sam. The kid that you've been bothering.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
The kid who did that to you, to your face.

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, no, that's Harry.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Your dead brother kicked you in the eye?

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
You don't believe me?

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,560
I just want to find out
why he would do something like that.

68
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
Oh, he was mad at me.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,720
-What for?
-For bugging him.

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
He didn't like it
when I followed him around.

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
Called me a little fucking bampot.

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,640
But if I didn't follow him…

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,600
he'd be dead.

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Lyle, your brother is dead.
You know that, right?

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
You… You said so yourself.
You said these exact words.

76
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,200
"After Harry died."

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Aye. Okay.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,640
The kid you've been
following around isn't your brother.

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,280
It's another kid named Sam Haig.

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
No, that's Harry.

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,680
He looks like Harry, but he's not.

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,440
Once more, he's named Sam Haig.

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I know you understand that.

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,960
If you say so.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,640
So where do we think they've got
this wee nutter parked up these days?

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
-I was looking into that.
-We know ten years ago he was out.

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,640
I found no record of Lyle Jennings

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,680
after he was transferred
to the EPD unit at Rampton.

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
-But six years--
-EPD?

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Um, Enhanced Personality Disorder.
He was there for--

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,520
-What is Rampton?
-It's a nutter bin.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,240
Carl and I were there to interview--

93
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,960
Will you all shut the fuck up

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,040
and let this poor girl finish
a sentence for once?

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Jesus.

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Just a reminder, love,
the dark angel's gonna be here soon, okay?

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,200
Oh, do I have to?

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
You go right ahead, Rose. Carry on.

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Don't let these arrogant shites be
such arrogant shites.

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,760
Thank you, Donna.

101
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
So…

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,520
six years ago, there's an L. Jennings

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,480
with an address in Longay,
which I found interesting--

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,320
-It's right across the way from--
-Let her fucking say it!

105
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Right across the way from Mhòr.

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
But L. Jennings is no longer living there.

107
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,520
What does "L" stand for?

108
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Everything I found,
the address, the lecky, the rent,

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,600
was all in L. Jennings's name.

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,720
So it could be Lyle Jennings,
or it could be Larry Jennings.

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
But there is a proximity to Mhòr.

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,520
There's that, and there's the fact
that L. Jennings worked for the ferry.

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,720
-How do you know?
-Spoke to the landlady.

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
She remembers him.
I'm waiting on a driver's license.

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Why didn't you just say that
to begin with?

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,200
-Oh, right.
-Mm.

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
-Okay, so you're done?
-I am, yes.

118
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,920
Okay, so, recap.

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,160
We know that Lyle Jennings was
at Godhaven with Sam Haig.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,000
We know that Lyle was
the brother of Harry Jennings

121
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,520
who robbed the Lingards, attacked William,
and died trying to escape.

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,840
What we don't know is
if L. Jennings is our Lyle.

123
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,960
But if he is, well,
we suddenly have a direct link to Merritt.

124
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
I do know that whatever deluded reason

125
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
this twisted little tit has
to hurt Merritt,

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
she's dead.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
La, la, la

129
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
La, la, la

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,120
La, la, la

131
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Arachnophobia,
from the Greek arachne and phobia,

132
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
is the fear of spiders

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,640
and other arachnids,
such as scorpions and ticks.

134
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,640
Individuals
with arachnophobia overestimate

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,640
the likelihood of encountering spiders.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Sufferers have
negative reactions to spiders' webs

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
and overestimate
a spider's size and girth.

138
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
This fear and overestimation
can cause physical symptoms,

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,800
such as dizziness,

140
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,840
nausea,

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
sweating, shaking,

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
trembling,

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,960
increased heart rate,
screaming, and crying.

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,640
As for when to seek treatment,
you might ask yourself

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
if your phobia impacts you
in the following ways.

146
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,840
Does it make it difficult to go outside?

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
Does it get in the way of work?

148
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
Does it impact your social life?

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,480
Does it prevent you
from spending time with your loved ones?

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Does it keep you awake?

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,840
Does it consume your thoughts
on a daily basis?

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,040
-These are a few of the questions…
-Sorry, I did knock.

153
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

154
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,080
We're still nowhere on Leith Park.

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,440
Not nowhere.

156
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,760
We have a solid connection
between the victim and P.C. Anderson.

157
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,160
How solid?

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
We believe
P.C. Anderson may have been involved.

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,520
Involved in his own death?

160
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,320
Anderson's stated reason for being
on scene has become… problematic.

161
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Problematic how?

162
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
He claimed to Hardy and Morck

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,120
the victim's daughter called in
a wellness check.

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
This proved to be untrue.

165
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
She didn't call?

166
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,120
She doesn't exist.

167
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
Why am I just hearing this now?

168
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,640
We've only just discovered it.
But it's opened up a new line of inquiry.

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,920
It… certainly has.

170
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,680
Tell me, Logan. How did you get
all of this new information?

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,800
My original question stands.

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,480
How are you gonna close this one?

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,000
We can't just leave it open.
Not when three of our own were shot.

174
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm not suggesting we leave it open.

175
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,440
Are you taking it away from me?

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,240
I don't know. Should I?

177
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
You want to give it to Morck?

178
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
I don't know. Should I?

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
He can't investigate his own shooting.

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,160
You're right. He can't. But can you?

181
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
I absolutely can.

182
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,640
Then fucking do it,
or I will give it to someone else.

183
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,080
If you answered yes to any of the above,

184
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
you may consider seeing a psychotherapist

185
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,280
or reading the children's book
Charlotte's Web.

186
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,600
Ailsa?

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Can an old woman no have a wee nap

188
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,040
without some arsehole
pounding on her door?

189
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
-I brought you this.
-You the postman now, John?

190
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Danny said
he hadn't seen you for a while, so…

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,360
It's not like I'm missing anything.

192
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,680
It's all rubbish.

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,280
This is probably just an excuse

194
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,000
for you to nip over
and see if I'm still breathing, eh?

195
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Ach, you'll still be breathing
long after the rest of us.

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
But you're right.
I'm not here to drop off the mail.

197
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,480
Oh, yeah?

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,200
You see, I… I get a record
of every 999 call made

199
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,920
from the dispatch center on the mainland.

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,640
They had one the other day
and pinged it to here.

201
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
There a problem?

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,920
Well, considering that it was cut off
a second after it connected,

203
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,360
I was hoping that you might tell me.

204
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,960
-Me?
-The call came from your mobile.

205
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,080
Well, I don't know
how that could be, John,

206
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,680
because the only thing I do
pretty much all day is

207
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,360
watch Antiques Roadshow
and, uh, the Chelsea flower program.

208
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,200
That how you got that bruise, eh?
Watching the flower show?

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
I forgot about this.

210
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,560
-Imagine it looks worse than it feels.
-How'd you do it?

211
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,640
It's stupid really.
I was carrying the rubbish out to the bin.

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,960
Lost my balance and went over.

213
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,480
See, I'm supposed to use the wheelchair
when I'm carrying something.

214
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,200
-Mm.
-But I hate it.

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
Makes me feel like an invalid.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,320
-And you called 999?
-Can't remember.

217
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,000
-Ailsa.
-I mean, uh… maybe I did.

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,360
Is he here?

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,040
You know it's not safe for you
if that boy's around.

220
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
He's not a boy.

221
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,400
More's the point. Did he do that?

222
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,560
If he did,

223
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,320
do you think
I'd call the polis on my own son

224
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
after what youse did to my other one?

225
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,880
I warned him.

226
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,840
I told him exactly what would happen
if I caught him round here again.

227
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,680
He's well aware of your warning.

228
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,440
Yeah, well, being aware isn't
the same thing as obeying, now, is it?

229
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,920
He's no here.

230
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,640
He's shacked up with
some sloppy little whore over in Longay.

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Yeah? So you're all on your own then, eh?

232
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,560
I've got my shotgun.

233
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
Otherwise,
it's just me and the bird shite.

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,360
All the same,
I'll be coming round more often.

235
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,360
That's fine, John.

236
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,160
You bring the mail,
and I'll put the kettle on, eh?

237
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,000
Emergency. Which service?

238
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,160
Emergency. Which service?

239
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
Emergency. Which service?

240
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
Why is it so hot?

241
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
The hyperbaric chamber
will begin to heat up

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
as pressure increases.

243
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,640
At five atmospheres, or 50 meters depth,

244
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,640
the temperature inside the chamber
will be around 32 Celsius,

245
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,280
or 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

246
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,640
The rule of thumb is
the deeper, the hotter.

247
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,680
Oxygen will become denser,
and it will become tougher to breathe.

248
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,280
A person may start to experience
hyperoxia, or…

249
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Help.

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,320
Help, help!

251
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
Help me!

252
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Help me, help me!

253
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Help me!

254
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,520
…and blurred vision.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm… I'm Merritt Lingard.

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,720
Please help me!

257
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,920
Boy, tell me I am not looking at
what I'm looking at.

258
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,440
Tell me that is not
Merritt fucking Lingard.

259
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,480
Tell me.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,920
Oi!

261
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
You remembered our deal?

262
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,040
That's the fucker who took me!

263
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,240
Help me! Get me out of here!

264
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
Has she been in there this entire time?

265
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
It's complicated.

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,480
Things didn't happen exactly as, um…

267
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,520
"She fell overboard, John!"

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,680
"It was an accident, John."

269
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
"Poetic justice, John."

270
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Four years. Nothing.

271
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,280
And now I've had cops
over from the mainland

272
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,800
twice in the last week, asking about her.

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,960
Help me!

274
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,240
Christ!

275
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
Back then, I thought

276
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,120
what's done is done,

277
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,600
that both families had suffered enough.

278
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
You've kept her
in this fucking oversized iron lung

279
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
for four years.

280
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,160
What am I supposed to do now?

281
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
Walk away.

282
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,680
Honestly, just get in your car
and go, and…

283
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,120
next time you come back here,
she'll be gone.

284
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,760
We'll be gone.

285
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh, I can't do that.

286
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,640
Not this time.

287
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,840
So… then we're stuck.

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
Seems so.

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,720
Does Ailsa know you've--

290
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,920
Hello, Claire, William.

291
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,520
-Thanks for coming.
-Your message was very cryptic.

292
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
So…

293
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
we want to… show you something.

294
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Please.

295
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
This is…

296
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,520
Harry Jennings.

297
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,640
Merritt liked Harry.

298
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,280
He looks like a good guy.

299
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Was he?

300
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,600
Why then do you think

301
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
he attacked you?

302
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,880
…quick ball into the…

303
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,680
Da?

304
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
Hello?

305
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
Harry?

306
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,080
The constable on Mhòr said
that Harry had a temper,

307
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,480
that Harry was always getting into fights.

308
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,920
Here's the thing, William.

309
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,120
Harry doesn't have a criminal record.

310
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
There's nothing.

311
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,200
But… Lyle Jennings has one.

312
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,800
Lyle was sent to Godhaven
right after Harry died.

313
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
Right after you were attacked.

314
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
Harry, what are you daeing?

315
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
I'm so sorry.

316
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,040
No!

317
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Lyle!

318
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
All right, stop!

319
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,240
-I think we should st…
-Stop!

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
That's enough!

321
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,280
What are you doing here?

322
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,160
I thought you were gonna leave
with the sister.

323
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,880
Go outside and get in the fucking car.

324
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,320
It's a good thing I was here,
or you'd be fuckin' dead.

325
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,520
Fuck.

326
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,120
That's enough.

327
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
I told you that
this was going to be a short interview

328
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,160
and then we were gonna go home.

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,680
So it's okay. Then we're… Oh.
Then we're going home.

330
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,160
No, it's… it's okay. Leave him. It's fine.

331
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
He's not trying to hurt me.

332
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,280
He's afraid.

333
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,760
Is that what happened
on the ferry when you hit Merritt?

334
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,680
You weren't angry. You were afraid.
Because you saw Lyle on the boat.

335
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,960
You saw this man.

336
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,320
Same person that was in your house
on the night of the burglary.

337
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,680
Harry Jennings didn't attack you.

338
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,240
Lyle Jennings did.

339
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,760
Could this also be Lyle Jennings?

340
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
What was that about?

341
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,000
William Lingard identified
Lyle Jennings as the man on the ferry.

342
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
How'd he do that?
Thought he doesn't speak.

343
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,760
-He drew him.
-Carl--

344
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,680
-You need to call the coastguard.
-What for?

345
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,840
To get us to Mhòr

346
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,720
so we can talk to Ailsa Jennings
about where her son might be.

347
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,640
-I'm not calling the fucking coastguard.
-Then get us a helicopter.

348
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,520
A heli… There's a fucking ferry.

349
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
You've been rather public
about reopening the case.

350
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,280
I've been rather public?

351
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm just saying
he has to know we're looking for him.

352
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
The sooner we get a handle
on his whereabouts, the better.

353
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
So go find him.

354
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,680
But when you do, you stand down
and call for backup. Understood?

355
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,800
What about the boat?

356
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,960
Sure, Carl. I'll put in a request
to get you the departmental speedboat.

357
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,160
There's a departmental speedboat?

358
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,160
Fuck off.

359
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Thank you.

360
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Rose cannot contact
the constable on Mhòr, Cunningham.

361
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,720
What do you mean, she can't?

362
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,400
The son is telling her

363
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,880
he hasn't heard from him
since yesterday morning.

364
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,040
So he won't know we're coming.

365
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Why do you say this?

366
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,200
The first time we're here,
you asked about Harry Jennings.

367
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,400
Yes.

368
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,920
Cunningham never mentioned Lyle,
which I find odd.

369
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,080
-Why talk about one and not the other?
-I never asked about Lyle.

370
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,680
No, but he described Harry
as the troublemaker.

371
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,400
Something about having a temper
and getting into fights.

372
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,680
I was pulling that lad off boys
in the pub at least once a week.

373
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,960
He had what I would call a foul temper.

374
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,000
But Lyle was the one
who went away to Godhaven, not Harry.

375
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,000
A bloke like Cunningham will never admit
that he chased the wrong kid to his death.

376
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
For many people,
the truth is simply what it needs to be.

377
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,000
I wanna write about Godhaven.

378
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,480
What about it?

379
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,040
-All of it. The whole experience.
-Why'd you need my permission then?

380
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't need it, but…
I'd feel better if you were okay with it.

381
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,240
-Why wouldn't I be?
-Because of what happened.

382
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,840
-I wanna apologize to you.
-For what?

383
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,160
For what I did, mate.

384
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,720
Not a day goes by where I don't think
about it and feel like shite.

385
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,280
So a part of me coming to see you is
so that I can, you know, make amends.

386
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,280
Fucking make amends?
Are you sober or something now?

387
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Sooner or later
we all have to pay for what we've done.

388
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
That's the second person
I've heard say that in a week.

389
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
Well, it's true. And it's my turn.

390
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,720
-How did you find me?
-Just…

391
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
did what I do.

392
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,400
So how do you… do what you do…
without getting caught?

393
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,840
How'd you mean?

394
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,520
How'd you get close to someone
so you can investigate them?

395
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,160
Not planning on stalking someone?

396
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,560
Not planning on stalking me again?

397
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
No. Uh…

398
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,000
Just taking the piss, mate.

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The initial approach is everything.

400
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,120
Act like you don't give a shit
if they talk.

401
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Be confident, which will be hard for you,

402
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
but you've gotta fake it.

403
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,120
I want you to have something.

404
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,240
My mobile. If you need anything, okay?

405
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Okay.

406
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,120
Us G-haven boys
gotta stick together, right?

407
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,520
Yeah, absolutely.

408
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,400
I'd best get back to work.
Thanks for swinging by.

409
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,320
Aye.

410
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,360
One of these days
you and me should go up the Cullen Crag.

411
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
Oh, yeah? What's up there?

412
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,280
My temple. I'm a climber.

413
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,800
Rock climber. You ever tried it?

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Naw, man. Afraid of heights.

415
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,600
Just taking the piss, bro.

416
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,120
Listen, uh…
thanks for being so cool about all this.

417
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,880
Yeah, sure, Sam.

418
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,720
-See you later, eh?
-Aye.

419
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,600
Okay, folks, sit down, stay still.
We're getting going.

420
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,400
The hyperbaric chamber
will begin to heat up

421
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,560
as pressure increases.

422
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,560
At five atmospheres, or 50 meters depth,

423
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,720
the temperature inside the chamber
will be around 32 Celsius,

424
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,560
or 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

425
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,760
The rule of thumb is
the deeper, the hotter.

426
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,400
Oxygen will become denser,
and it will become tougher to breathe.

427
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,440
A person may start
to experience hyperoxia,

428
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,160
or high levels of CO2 in their breathing.

429
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,800
These symptoms include
trembling, sweating, confusion,

430
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,400
headaches, and blurred vision.

431
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,320
Can I have some more water?

432
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,400
More water.

433
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
What's happening up there?

434
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm turning off everything,
except the pressure.

435
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
Hello?

436
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,920
This plastic,

437
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
it's strong, even with the crack.

438
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,560
My dad invented it.

439
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
So it'll be impossible for you to break.

440
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Why would I want to break the window?

441
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,200
To cause a sudden depressurization.

442
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,920
To kill yourself.

443
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,280
You know,
so you don't slowly suffocate to death

444
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
from the extreme high pressure.

445
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,280
Rot in hell, bitch.

446
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,760
Harry was an excellent brother.

447
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,360
I know.

448
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,840
But Harry was only ever
looking out for me.

449
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,440
And then it was my turn
to look out for Harry,

450
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
and I did.

451
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,720
What do you mean?

452
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,520
I mean that I kept your brother
from hurting my brother.

453
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,320
So… William,

454
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
that was you.

455
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,560
No, fuck, no, no.

456
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,080
No, that was you. It was you.

457
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,320
All Harry could ever think about was you.

458
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,880
If he'd never met you, then…
we wouldn't be standing here, would we?

459
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,360
So you're guilty, Merritt,
and I think you know it.

460
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,800
I think that's why you came back
for his funeral. Mm.

461
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
And no one ever truly gets away
with a crime.

462
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
Isn't that what you said?

463
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,680
Sooner or later,

464
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,720
whatever they did
always catches up with them.

465
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,040
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

466
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,840
don't ever truly get away with it.

467
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,520
Um, the court might set them free,

468
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:41,040
but be it conscience, karma,
or the universe, they are ultimately…

469
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,160
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

470
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
don't ever truly get away with it.

471
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,680
Um, the court might set them free,

472
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,240
but be it conscience, karma,
or the universe, they are ultimately…

473
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,880
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

474
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
don't ever truly get away with it.

475
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,360
-Do you have it?
-Mm.

476
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,880
You gonna tell me how you got a copy
of Lyle Jennings's YO's file?

477
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,600
Two copies. And I just asked for them.

478
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,880
They just gave you them?

479
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,680
I asked in the way
that you said to ask for anything.

480
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,040
-In the right way.
-Aye?

481
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,640
I told them I was Moira's assistant,
and she spilt coffee over her copy.

482
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320
Attagirl. Okay, let's get started.

483
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,600
Did you know the Isle of Mhòr
was once the main staging area

484
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,040
of all North Sea oil exploration?

485
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,920
I did not know that.

486
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,720
And that nearly a billion pounds
were invested here.

487
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,120
-Where'd you get that from?
-Wikipedia.

488
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,680
To have such promise taken away,

489
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,440
a life dangled in front of you, and then…

490
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,400
snatched away from your grasp
at the very last minute.

491
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,680
That can really piss people off.

492
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,080
Make them do things
they might not have done otherwise.

493
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,720
Most people don't need
a good reason to be pissed off.

494
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,920
Take you, for example.

495
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
Oh, touché.

496
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,800
My wife liked to say
the best answer to anger is silence.

497
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
I'd like to meet your wife.

498
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,280
My wife is dead.

499
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,920
Since when?

500
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,920
Since she died. Back in Syria.

501
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
-I have told you this.
-I'd have remembered.

502
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
-Because you are so empathetic.
-Okay, whoa.

503
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,320
I told you I have to watch the girls,
I am responsible for them,

504
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,080
and sometimes I would be late
or even miss work.

505
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,160
I believe your answer was,
"I do not give a flying fuck."

506
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,920
Where in that sentence was I meant
to infer that your wife was… dead?

507
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,640
You told me you came here
because they needed doctors.

508
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,200
This is true.

509
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,520
She wanted our girls
to study medicine like her.

510
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,280
But neither is very good at science.

511
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,880
Mina, my youngest, she wants to become a…

512
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,040
TikTok influencer.

513
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
How did she die?

514
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,320
She operated on the wrong person.

515
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,280
It seems like
Lyle's life went right down the shitter

516
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,760
after his brother died.

517
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,160
I don't know.
Have you read his psych report?

518
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,400
"At eight years old, Lyle Jennings
was caught killing a neighbor's dog

519
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,400
who barked at him
during a holiday parade."

520
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,920
"LJ was suspected
in several more animal killings

521
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,280
but never caught and never admitted to any

522
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,080
during evaluation sessions."

523
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
"LJ was referred to the examiner."

524
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,280
Seems like Lyle was born
bent the wrong way.

525
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,640
First time he got sent to Godhaven was
for stalking a boy from school.

526
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,760
The kid's parents found him sleeping
on the floor beside the kid's bed.

527
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,520
Lyle broke in during the night. He was 12.

528
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,840
What is that smell?

529
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
Despair.

530
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,160
"Lyle Jennings's mother, Ailsa Jennings,

531
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,240
was placed in involuntary psychiatric care
for 19 months

532
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,200
following the death of her husband,

533
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,040
leaving LJ and his brother
alone on the property."

534
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,800
Can't wait to get her file.

535
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,280
-Where'd you see that?
-Uh, page 23.

536
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,400
From another evaluation.

537
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,320
"As punishment,

538
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Ailsa Jennings would regularly lock
Lyle and his older brother

539
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,080
inside the hyperbaric chamber
on the Shorebird property

540
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,640
for long periods of time."

541
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,680
"LJ had no negative association
with these punishments."

542
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
"Thought this was perfectly normal."

543
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,240
Looks like she left in a hurry.

544
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,400
Seems like she completely lost the plot
just after Harry's death.

545
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
"According to Lyle,

546
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,920
Ailsa's behavior towards him following
the death of his brother became worse."

547
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
"It was following
a long absence from school

548
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,520
when the police visited the property

549
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
that they discovered
what she had been doing,

550
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,400
and was then sectioned."

551
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,720
The father, Clive Jennings,
died in a fire, smoking in bed.

552
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,120
14-year-old Lyle was
the only other person home.

553
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,960
What, you think
Lyle killed his own father at 14?

554
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,960
Be brilliant if he did.

555
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,640
Moira specifically said not to do
what you are now about to do.

556
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,880
She said not to go in if we found Lyle,

557
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
which will be easier to accomplish
if we find a fucking clue.

558
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
-So…
-You'll do this without a warrant?

559
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,040
-Did you bring one with you?
-No.

560
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,240
Then, yes, I'm going in without a warrant.

561
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,480
And without you. Keep you safe.

562
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,240
Shorebird Ocean Systems.

563
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
What's that?

564
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,280
It's the father's business.
Shorebird Ocean Systems.

565
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
SOS.

566
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,360
Would you like me to open that for you?

567
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,400
-Yes, please.
-Hang on.

568
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,920
"When he was 15,

569
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
Lyle Jennings was accused
of coercing another boy

570
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
into a decompression chamber
on the property."

571
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,880
"He then snuck out
and left the boy alone in the chamber."

572
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,080
-Hardy--
-Wait. You have to keep reading.

573
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
"Lyle had been increasing the pressure

574
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,560
to see if, at some point,
the boy would lose consciousness,

575
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,320
when the local police discovered him."

576
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,600
"This was not long
after his mother was sectioned."

577
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,120
So Lyle Jennings kidnapped someone
and put them inside a hyperbaric chamber?

578
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
It says coerced, not kidnapped.

579
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,520
It's still pretty fucking weird

580
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,280
he locked another kid
into the place he was locked into.

581
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,440
Not weird.

582
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,040
It's pathological.

583
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,680
-Rose.
-Are you at the Jennings's?

584
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,840
Why?

585
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,800
Lyle Jennings once locked a kid
in a hyperbaric chamber for three days.

586
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
Carl.

587
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,400
When?

588
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,960
-When he was 15.
-15?

589
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,920
It's possible he did the same to Merritt.

590
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,360
You looked
inside the buildings and found nothing.

591
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,400
I only looked inside one of them.

592
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,240
The other was
under a hazardous material directive

593
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
and was closed off.

594
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,080
What kind of hazardous material?

595
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,560
Colin just said
the EA closed it off a while ago.

596
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,360
What's a while ago?

597
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,520
He didn't say.

598
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,200
Call him up and ask him.

599
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,000
How about that?
I don't fucking quit, bitch.

600
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,280
Oh, there you are.

601
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,840
Yeah.

602
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,440
Colin said it was declared a hazmat site
a little over four years ago.

603
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,440
That was the number he gave? Four years?

604
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,920
Interesting, right?

605
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
Very. Okay. Sit tight.
We'll take a look around.

606
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Uh, Carl,

607
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,720
he said not to enter the premises
without an officer from his department.

608
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,400
Tell him this is a crime scene

609
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,720
and he can fuck
an officer from his department.

610
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,040
I'm not telling him that.

611
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,440
Has he heard from his father?

612
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,480
No, not yet,
but he's phoning him every ten minutes.

613
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,520
-Okay.
-Uh, Carl…

614
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,600
is it a crime scene?

615
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,880
I'll let you know.

616
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,200
Watch out for toxic waste.

617
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,760
Yep.

618
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,280
It's okay.

619
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
What is that?

620
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,840
Some kind of…
deep sea exploration drilling shit.

621
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,200
Not the drilling manifold.

622
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
That.

623
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
It's Colin Cunningham, the son.

624
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,720
Oh, my God.

625
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,120
Is this live?

626
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,840
I think so.

627
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,560
Wherever this image is coming from,
it can't be far

628
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,720
because these antennas are not made for…

629
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,360
long-range distance.

630
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,320
Carl.

631
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,920
Hello, everyone. Um…

632
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
-Carl!
-There's another door.

633
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,480
…be it conscience, karma, or the universe,

634
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,960
they are ultimately, one way or another,
punished for what they've done.

635
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,920
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

636
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,960
don't ever truly get away with it.

637
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,400
The court might set them free,

638
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,720
but be it conscience, karma,
or the universe, they are ultimately…

639
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Hello?

640
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,400
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime…

641
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,120
Hello? Hello?

642
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,960
Hello?

643
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Merritt!

644
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,680
Merritt!

645
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,600
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

646
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
don't ever truly get away with it.

647
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,240
The court might set them free,

648
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,000
but be it conscience,
karma, or the universe…

649
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,760
I knew it.

650
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,880
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

651
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,880
don't ever truly get away with it.

652
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,360
The court might set them free,

653
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,840
but be it conscience, karma…

654
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
How the fuck do we shut this thing down?

655
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,280
…punished for what they've done.

656
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,200
I firmly believe that those
who commit violent crime don't…

657
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,920
Other side.

658
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,080
…ultimately, one way or another,
punished for what they've done.

659
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,200
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime…

660
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
Shit.

661
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,400
Um, the court might set them free,

662
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,680
but be it conscience,
karma, or the universe,

663
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,160
they are ultimately, one way or another,
punished for what they've done.

664
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,040
I firmly believe that those who--

665
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,840
The hyperbaric chamber
will begin to heat up

666
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,040
as pressure increases.

667
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,960
At five atmospheres, or 50 meters depth,

668
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,920
the temperature inside the chamber…

669
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,000
…32 Celsius, or 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

670
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,600
The rule of thumb is
the deeper, the hotter.

671
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,040
Oxygen will become denser,
and it will become tougher to breathe.

672
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,600
A person may start to experience…

673
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,360
-I'm fucking looking at her.
-Is she in the chamber?

674
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,560
We're trying to figure out
how to get her out.

675
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,440
Don't touch anything. I need a second.

676
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,920
-We're not letting her die.
-Do not fucking touch anything.

677
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,040
If you open it, you might kill her anyway.

678
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,280
How many atmospheres
of pressure is she at?

679
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,920
Uh… she was six on the outside
of the hyperbaric chamber downstairs,

680
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,360
and now it's… it's seven and a half,
so the pressure's going up.

681
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,840
Nine atmospheres
and the oxygen becomes toxic.

682
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,200
You need to do something.

683
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,720
We leave her, she'll die.
We get her out, she'll die.

684
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,360
-What the fuck are we supposed to do?
-You need to stabilize the pressure.

685
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,520
Once that's stable, it says
that the navy or the coastguard

686
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,880
could get her out
with a hyperbaric stretcher.

687
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,160
-What's that?
-A portable version of the chamber.

688
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,760
So even if the pressure drops,

689
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,080
if you get her into one,
you'll have a window.

690
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
-What? How long?
-Maybe 15 minutes.

691
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,600
Fifteen, okay.

692
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,040
Start looking for something
that controls pressure.

693
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,960
There are many controls for pressure.

694
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,280
Are they turned up?
It'll look like a lever.

695
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,480
Jesus fucking Christ,
can you turn that off?

696
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,320
…will begin to heat up
as pressure increa--

697
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,840
We might have one.

698
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,920
Gun!

699
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,600
I firmly believe
that those who commit violent crime

700
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
don't ever truly get away with it.

701
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,160
The court might set them free,

702
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,320
but be it conscience,
karma, or the universe,

703
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,040
they are ultimately,
one way or another, punished…

704
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,120
Carl!

705
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,840
What the fuck's happening, mate?

706
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,680
Hey!

707
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,640
Hey, arsehole!

708
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,720
Carl?

709
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Fuck.

710
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,280
We're okay.

711
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Oh, you bastard, you bastard.

712
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,520
Merritt,

713
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,280
I am Akram.

714
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,680
We're going to take you home now.

715
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,720
Oh, fucking hell.

716
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,560
Once you start, you just can't stop.

717
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Yeah, yeah.
Like crack or dry-roasted peanuts.

718
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,280
Oh, Jesus.

719
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,560
-All right, Carl?
-Hey.

720
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,400
Well, if I'd known you did home visits…

721
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,040
-Shall I pee in a cup?
-Only if that's where you normally do it.

722
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,280
-What happened to your arm?
-You been shot again?

723
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,720
Funnily enough…

724
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,440
No.

725
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,640
It's buckshot. I'll be fine.

726
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,200
I'm sure you'll all read about it.

727
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,400
Paying me back, are we?

728
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,760
You saw mine.
It's only fair I get to see yours.

729
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,800
-That's what I'm talking about.
-It's actually surprisingly nice.

730
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,800
-It's got nothing to do with me.
-Clearly.

731
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,360
-Carl, what the fuck happened to your arm?
-I was a policeman today.

732
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,240
First time in a long time.

733
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,000
-What the fuck does that mean?
-Can we do this tomorrow?

734
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,600
We'll have a lovely deep and meaningful.
I promise. All the gory details.

735
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,720
Here.

736
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
Thank you.

737
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,560
Wimbledon's birthday?

738
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,960
I only meant to leave them
on the doorstep.

739
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,720
And now it's a party.

740
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,680
Mm?

741
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,160
Oh, yeah!

742
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,920
Okay. In for a penny…

743
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,160
I just wanted to thank you in person.

744
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,240
I'm told you were the one
to push for reopening the case,

745
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,720
and if you… hadn't done that, then…

746
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,760
It was… it was very much a team effort.

747
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,400
I've thanked them already.

748
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,520
Everyone except for Detective Morck.
I was hoping he'd be here.

749
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,000
-You've not met him?
-Not yet, but I would like to.

750
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,240
Detective Morck took a little time off.

751
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,240
Oh, how much time off?

752
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,560
When it comes to Carl, who can say?

753
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,680
All right, I understand.

754
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,400
I'm leaving myself.
For who can say how long.

755
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,880
Where are you going?

756
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,240
I'm gonna take William home, to Mhòr.

757
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,400
Spend some time with my dad.

758
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,800
We've been talking, uh,
but there's still a lot left to say.

759
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,360
There usually is.

760
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,840
Well, uh, thank you again for everything.

761
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,680
Good luck, Merritt. I hope you find
what you're looking for on Mhòr.

762
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,080
Thanks very much, ladies and gentlemen.
I shall see you all tomorrow.

763
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,640
Uh, Marjorie,
would you get me the minutes?

764
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,320
-Okay.
-Thank you.

765
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,400
Detective Morck.

766
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,160
Lord Advocate.

767
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,240
Did we have an appointment?

768
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,560
Not unless you made one.

769
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,400
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not gonna report you

770
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,160
for what happened
during the Graham Finch trial.

771
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,520
Though, obviously, I can't promise
that Kirsty Atkins will be as forgiving.

772
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,800
-May I?
-I would.

773
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,160
You did what any father
in your position would do.

774
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,440
I don't think
you want to be casting aspersions.

775
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,320
Shutting the fuck up is
your best strategy right now, trust me.

776
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,520
You're gonna double my budget,

777
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,480
or more accurately, give me the money

778
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,440
that was originally allocated
to my budget.

779
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,280
What else can I do for you?

780
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,040
I'm sure, Lord Advocate, with your weight,

781
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,720
you can get a deserving candidate
fast-tracked to the D.I. rank.

782
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,080
I presume you're talking
about the Syrian gentleman

783
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,800
whom you introduced as your bodyguard.

784
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,240
He's a political refugee
who's here on asylum,

785
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,360
and loathe as I am to admit it,

786
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,840
he's a good copper,

787
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,120
better than most.

788
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,520
I'll see what I can do.

789
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,160
That would be lovely.

790
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,800
Thank you.

791
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,480
Oh, and, um…

792
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,880
I'm gonna need a new car.

793
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,080
And not some impounded piece of shit
or some tired pool car.

794
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,080
Any particular make and model?

795
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,160
I don't know.

796
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,960
What do you drive?

797
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,400
A Ford Fuck Off.

798
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,000
-Sorry.
-Hey, it's okay.

799
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,480
Prick.

800
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
Hardy.

801
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,360
When you get yourself sorted down there,
I have something I'd like you to look at.

802
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,080
-A case?
-No, a fucking hemorrhoid.

803
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,960
Yes, a case.

804
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,000
Something for me and Carl?

805
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,240
Something for you.

806
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,000
Off you go.

807
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,040
All my nightmares escaped my head

808
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,480
Bar the door, please don't let them in

809
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:19,040
You were never supposed to leave

810
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,920
Now my head's splitting at the seam

811
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,480
And I don't know if I can

812
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,040
Oi!

813
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,160
What the fuck?!

814
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:01,360
Welcome home

815
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:47,920
Here, beneath my lungs

816
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,480
I feel your thumbs

817
01:08:53,560 --> 01:09:00,400
Press into my skin again
