1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,040
His wife lived for 90 days
in a women's refuge.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,400
-Do you come here a lot then?
-Yeah, I find it calming.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,640
The cemetery?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,760
Have you been listening to what I've said?

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,320
Someone inside the Crown Office told
Graham Finch about your witness,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
and he's had her killed.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,200
Almost killed.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm listening.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Looks more like you're eating your lunch.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,960
-I'm eating my lunch so no one kills you.
-Excuse me?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,440
If what you're saying's true,

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
then you're talking
about pissing off some powerful people.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,800
Since you're clearly an amateur at this,

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
setting a meet in a place you frequent,

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,760
I'd imagine
they have an idea of what you're up to

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,040
and are, in all likelihood, watching you.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,160
I'm not the one investigating
mobsters and murderers.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
I've worked really hard
to have zero profile

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,040
on the worldwide fucking shite bucket

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,720
that now feeds
every wannabe Trotskyite under 30

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,640
a steady diet of absolute certainty.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,320
Has it ever occurred to you
that staying off the internet

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,080
can make someone
just as paranoid as being on it?

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
Not off it entirely.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Just the parts where you post
pictures of your glittered balls

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,760
alongside the odd Negroni or…

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
epic slice of carrot cake.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
But, hey,

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,160
what's the, uh… the saying?

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,840
"Just because I'm paranoid
doesn't mean folks aren't after me."

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
I think maybe we've digressed.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
Been getting any nasty emails?

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,600
Maybe some threatening texts?

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,760
Well, after you're gone,

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,000
car accident,

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
stumble in front of a moving tram,

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,160
there'll be a report of some nameless,
faceless psycho that was stalking you,

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,520
as opposed to a pro in a suit
that's working for your betters.

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Here.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,440
Throw me a dirty look.

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
-What?
-Do it.

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Then pick up the rubbish,
put it in the bin, and walk away.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Is there a secret message
stuffed inside your bacon butty?

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,280
Walk away quickly,
like I've pissed you off.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
No problem.

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
And, Merritt,

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
next time, pick a better spot.

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,960
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
La, la, la

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
La, la, la

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
La, la, la

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,560
So this has all become
a giant fucking melodrama.

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,560
You need to come home, Jasper.
I want you to come home.

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,840
I propose that we meet up
and have a proper talk.

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,200
What's that place that we'd get ice cream

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
back when we were normal human beings,
near your school?

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll meet you there tomorrow
at four o'clock, and we can have it out.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,440
In public
so that we don't hurt each other.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,880
That last part was a joke.

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Okay, bye.

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
Did you walk
down the middle like I told you?

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
Yes, right down the middle.

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Good.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,360
In my experience, it's usually better

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,280
for the surveilled not to know
they're being surveilled.

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah, sometimes it's better
to give the cage a good rattle

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,880
to see how the tiger responds
when it wakes up.

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,040
This is how many animal trainers
have lost their arm.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Morck.

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm in the middle of something.
Why can't you tell me now?

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Fergus.

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,280
My doctor once told me
I've got a tortured liver.

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,680
Yeah, you'd think they would have invented
a safer pint by now.

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,480
It's so far gone,
I don't even get drunk anymore.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,080
Got that from my da.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
Fergus, your message said
something happened.

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
You know, if you'd told me three years ago
that up until yesterday I'd stay sober,

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
I'd have spat in your face.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,120
What happened yesterday?

80
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,000
Jesus.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,520
Who'd you bump into?

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,920
I was hoping you'd tell me.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
Me? How do I know?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,120
You were mentioned.

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,960
One of them says, "Next time Morck
comes to see you, tell him to fuck off."

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
-"Give him nothing."
-One of them?

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Cozy wee threesome.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
All tooled up under their suits.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,040
-Sounds like they came worried.
-Too fucking right.

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
That was the sucker punch by the way.

91
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
I think they thought
I'd stay lying there in the car park.

92
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
-But?
-I got up.

93
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,240
-And?
-I left them lying in the car park.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
All three?

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Yeah, that sounds
like the Fergus Dunbar I remember.

96
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,920
Brawn over brain always. Well played.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
So are you gonna tell me what jackpot
you've got me in the middle of?

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
I fucking wish I knew.

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Outside the bulges in their suits,
what was the vibe?

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
Ex-law? Military, maybe?

101
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,960
Who the fuck are you?

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,520
I am Akram.

103
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
My bodyguard.

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,560
You'll need him.
Vibes? They were bad ones.

105
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,240
The kind of guys
that when they came into a pub,

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,920
you either got up and left
or called for backup.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
So you've no idea who sent them,
but they know

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,040
you and I have spoken about Merritt.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,360
Yeah, they probably know
we're talking now.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
I've been getting followed
since you came to see me.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,240
-Are you sure?
-I do have some instinct left.

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,960
Don't doubt it, but if you're right,

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,360
somebody inside tipped off
somebody outside.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
Maybe it's your fucking bodyguard.

115
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Whoever it is,
they assume you know something.

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,520
If it was somebody on the inside,

117
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,840
they would've known I'd been working
on the case for eight months

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,960
and didn't get anywhere.

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,840
-Someone thinks you got somewhere.
-They were wrong.

120
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,480
Moira was right
to take me off the case when she did.

121
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,840
How about we give you a lift home?

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm all right.

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,880
It'd be a shame to throw away three years,

124
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,680
abandon these nice kids
who seem to think you're really cool.

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Carl, don't act all human.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,320
Doesn't suit you.

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
Makes you look like a bigger arsehole.

128
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,880
If that's possible.

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Thanks for the heads-up.

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
What?

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
I think if you were allowed to continue,
you would've solved the case.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,480
-What makes you think that?
-I've read your file.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,000
And everywhere we go,
you have already been.

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,240
We're following
in the footsteps of your investigation.

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,640
Great minds, eh?

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
I think you did such a good job back then
that someone was very afraid of you.

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
And that they are still afraid.

138
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Good night, sir.

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
All right?

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,200
What?

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,440
-We've arrested someone for the shooting.
-My shooting?

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not sure
you can claim exclusive rights,

143
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,440
but yeah.

144
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,400
-Who is it?
-No one you know or know of.

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,320
-What's his name?
-We can't tell you.

146
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,680
Uh, not until
you've identified the shooter.

147
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
We need you to come in for a lineup.

148
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,280
-Me?
-Well, Jim can hardly do it, can he?

149
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,640
Neither of us can,
given the fucker was wearing a mask.

150
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
You saw his eyes.

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,400
You said so in the report.

152
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay.

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,240
When would you like me to come
and look in some bloke's eyes?

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,400
The sooner, the better.
Today, if you could.

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
-Can't. Fully booked.
-Okay. When?

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
I'll consult my calendar.

157
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
-Right.
-Right.

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
You looking at Graham Finch?

159
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,120
Looking at everybody.

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't touch anything.

161
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
Amazing mentor you are.

162
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,680
I know. It's a gift.

163
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
D.C.I. Morck?

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,200
Walking it all through once more.

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,320
You want me to ID someone in a lineup.

167
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,480
I need to remember their face.

168
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,080
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,640
D.C.I. Bruce asked us to…
watch the place, see who showed up.

170
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,400
What, he's got you sitting outside all day

171
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,080
in the vain hope of bumping into
someone useful four months later?

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Either he has zero faith in either of you,
which is possible, or…

173
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,840
you're not telling me the truth.

174
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,520
We thought we'd come
and see if we missed something.

175
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,280
See if something new
didn't occur to us this time.

176
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
Did anything new occur to you this time?

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
We think you are right.

178
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,640
That whoever stabbed Mr. Allen
left the flat, but not the scene.

179
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
That maybe the stabbing wasn't
the actual crime.

180
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Stabbing a bloke in the head isn't
an actual crime?

181
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,640
-He meant not the actual objective.
-Yes, that's what I meant.

182
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,000
What was the actual objective,
do you think?

183
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,600
-To kill a cop.
-Just any cop who showed up?

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,800
Maybe someone
with a grudge against the police.

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,920
That's pretty much everyone around here.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,640
What makes you absolutely sure

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
that Archie Allen wasn't
the actual target?

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,240
He was a petty criminal
of no real weight or consequence.

189
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,480
The morgues are full of petty criminals
of no real weight or consequence.

190
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,200
I seem to remember there was
a journalist at the press conference

191
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,960
who mentioned something
about him being an informant.

192
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Dennis Piper, Scottish Telegraph.

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,520
Can you tell us if it's true

194
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,560
that you and D.I. Hardy knew
the victim, Archie Allen,

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,720
and if he was
a paid confidential informer?

196
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
He hadn't been registered.

197
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,720
Victim's full name was
Archie Arran Allen, the man from Arran.

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
You know how I know this?
It was in the file.

199
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,240
I didn't know it until I read it,
which for me is very strange

200
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
'cause I love names.

201
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,280
Love 'em. Names are like dogs.
Often resemble their owners.

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
I don't forget names,

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,360
but I had to read
Archie Allen's name in a file.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
P.C. Anderson never said
the victim's name.

205
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,400
All he said was he was here on…

206
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Routine wellness. Your man's daughter
in Lancaster called in.

207
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
Said her dad hadn't returned her calls.

208
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
And what he never said was…

209
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,280
was big fucker in the chair,
bayonet in his head,

210
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
that's fucking Archie Arran Allen.

211
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,360
Maybe he didn't know that.

212
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,320
-Oh, the daughter would've told him.
-He forgot to mention it?

213
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,720
He was nervous, so maybe,

214
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,840
but let's say you're right
that Archie was bait for a bigger fish.

215
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,040
It's only a matter of calling in
something as innocuous as,

216
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,160
oh, I don't know,
a routine wellness check.

217
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,360
Then this way, boom,

218
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,760
someone finds the body,

219
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,680
the cavalry don't appear right away…

220
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,280
…gives you time to do what you need to do.

221
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,560
The shooter was here
for you or D.I. Hardy?

222
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,120
No, no, no, not at all, no.

223
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
We had zero connection with the man.
We were here by chance.

224
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,240
Conversely, young Officer Anderson was
probably around here quite a bit.

225
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
This was his section.

226
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,360
I bet he'd been inside
this fucking house a few times.

227
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
You think he knew Archie Allen?

228
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,240
I think it's entirely possible
that if you look,

229
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,880
P.C. Anderson
and Archie Allen had an overlap.

230
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,080
That journalist was off by a little bit
but not by much, and fucking Anderson…

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
How long you been on the job? A month?

232
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
Three, sir.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,480
Anderson was
top of his class at the academy.

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,720
I looked it up.

235
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,360
So he wasn't dumb.
But he made a big play of acting like it.

236
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,360
-Think the weapon came from here.
-Don't…

237
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,880
Touching all the furniture,

238
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,000
so his prints would be written off
as a rookie move.

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,160
Hardy and I surprised him.
He didn't know his own story yet.

240
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,040
He'd seen the body, but he was thinking
about how to distance himself from it.

241
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
I mean, do we even know

242
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,560
if Archie Arran Allen has a daughter?

243
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,840
That would be good for you to find out.

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Got the feeling when I picked up
the keys that, uh, they knew you here.

245
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,480
I come here sometimes.

246
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh?

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,400
Mm. When I need some space.

248
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Mm. It suits you.

249
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,160
What is it, exactly,

250
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,440
that you want to know about my department?

251
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,240
I couldn't tell you exactly.

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,280
Something must've made you get in touch.

253
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,840
As I'm not very high up, I'm…

254
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
…guessing it's something specific.

255
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm a reporter, not a cop.

256
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,400
But in my job,
planting ideas often backfires.

257
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,160
Someone knows something or they don't.

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,920
When we first met,
I thought you looked familiar.

259
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Oh?

260
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,120
Actually, I knew.

261
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
-Really?
-Mm.

262
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,800
You were at the Finch trial.

263
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Almost every day.

264
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,960
The reason I know that is
you were sitting right behind my boss,

265
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,120
the lord advocate, Stephen Burns.

266
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,080
Good memory.

267
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
So my question is,

268
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,720
is this to do with Graham Finch?

269
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,720
Or maybe Stephen Burns?

270
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,840
Or maybe both.

271
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
You understand I can't trust you.

272
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,400
Well…

273
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
…trust works both ways, doesn't it?

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,360
Your proximity to Stephen
makes me nervous.

275
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
As I recall seeing you two chatting.

276
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
Mm. Chatting about the weather.

277
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
-You could be setting me up.
-For what?

278
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,400
I didn't know Stephen Burns then,
and I don't know him now.

279
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,240
-I am hoping you can help me with that.
-So it's Stephen you're looking at?

280
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,240
I would think
you two would be on the same side.

281
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Aye.

282
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,760
You'd think so.

283
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,160
Well, back to my first question.

284
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,360
How can we trust each other?

285
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,360
You wanna pat me down?
Make sure I'm not wearing a wire?

286
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,560
There's lots of places
you could be hiding a wire.

287
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,880
So how can I be sure?

288
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,360
For example, you could be hiding
your own wire. Somewhere.

289
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,480
Why would I do that?

290
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,280
Same reason you're wary of me.

291
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,120
-Sure Stephen Burns would love--
-Don't say his name.

292
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
Kills the moment.

293
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,840
There's a moment, is there?

294
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,840
Make me trust you.

295
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,240
Well, go on, then. You too.

296
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,120
Your eyes are two different colors.

297
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,760
Mm.

298
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,560
Does that make me
more or less trustworthy?

299
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,440
I'll let you know.

300
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,720
At it again, eh, Merritt?

301
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,160
Ugh, no.

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,880
Now I'm gonna have to wash ya' joggies.

303
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,200
There was a witness Merritt wanted to call
to the Graham Finch case.

304
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Which witness?

305
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,880
It's your job to decide
on witness statements, isn't it?

306
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,920
Yes. Which witness?

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,880
She would've came to you
and asked for her to be admitted.

308
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Yes, which witness?

309
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,560
Prior to witnesses
being declared to the defense,

310
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,280
who else would know their names?

311
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,720
-Just us.
-"Us" meaning you and Merritt?

312
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,040
Aye. What is this? What witness?

313
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,840
Apparently someone could've swayed
the verdict the other way.

314
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
Who? And how?

315
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,320
Kirsty Atkins.

316
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,960
She met Andrea Finch
in a domestic violence shelter.

317
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
I've never heard of her.

318
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,840
Sure? Shouldn't you check the file?
It was four years ago.

319
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,760
I worked on the case for months
before Merritt was appointed.

320
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
-I'd remember.
-Hmm.

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
Merritt was appointed
lead counsel over you, right?

322
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,200
-She was considered the best fit.
-And you were okay with that?

323
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,600
We work as a team.
Doesn't matter who leads.

324
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,080
But we found that in cases like Finch,
a jury's more affected by a woman's voice.

325
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,240
Mm.

326
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
Merritt's voice could be quite affecting.

327
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Excuse me?

328
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,200
Your relationship with Merritt went beyond
the boundaries of professionalism.

329
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,680
-It's relevant to the investigation.
-Not to me, it isn't.

330
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,320
We've discussed
all there is to discuss on that front.

331
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,920
How well did you know Finch's advocate,
Robert McDonald?

332
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,880
-Well enough.
-Well enough to feed him information?

333
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,160
-Why would I do that?
-To give them an advantage.

334
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,440
Is she having a laugh?

335
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,320
We're having difficulty believing

336
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,760
Merritt never mentioned
Kirsty Atkins to you, her trial partner.

337
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,720
-What makes you so sure she wanted to?
-What makes you so sure she didn't?

338
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,680
Again, asked and answered. I'm very sure.

339
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,200
At the time,
Kirsty was in Saughton Prison.

340
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,080
Merritt visited her
in week one of the trial. This we know.

341
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,120
Why would I sabotage my own case?

342
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,280
Because, as you said,
this wasn't just your case.

343
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,760
Ah, okay.

344
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
So this was revenge?

345
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,680
I was angry with Merritt
for not running away with me?

346
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Were you?

347
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,120
I was fucking furious at the time,
and for about a month.

348
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
And then I woke up embarrassed
at myself for being such a cliché.

349
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,040
If there was any witness
that could've changed the outcome,

350
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,600
any witness that could've helped put
that bastard away, I would've welcomed it.

351
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Kirsty was threatened
right after Merritt visited her in prison.

352
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,800
She was attacked. By some miracle,
they didn't kill her. She was transferred.

353
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,080
Now she's out in a month. My guess?

354
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,200
She'll be dead
by some mishap a few days later.

355
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
And this is all on Graham Finch?

356
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,200
We can't say without knowing
who it was that fed the defense.

357
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,320
So, if the personal stuff
did feed into the trial,

358
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
we need to know now.

359
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,560
You think I'd risk my career for her,
or let someone go free

360
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,480
for throwing their wife down the stairs
'cause my feelings were hurt?

361
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,400
-You risked your marriage.
-You're young.

362
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
Get married, and we'll talk in ten years.

363
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,280
Okay, let's just say that Merritt
brought this up with you hypothetically.

364
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,600
You're hypothetically asking
about a hypothetical?

365
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Indulge me.

366
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,840
Might you tell Merritt

367
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,960
that Kirsty wasn't the best witness
because of her background?

368
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,760
Not to mention
her desperation to get out of jail.

369
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,360
-A jury sees through that.
-You'd have stonewalled her?

370
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,200
I would have asked
to speak to the witness myself

371
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,080
and made my decision
based on how credible I thought she was.

372
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
-So by the numbers?
-By the numbers.

373
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,560
Okay, so what would Merritt's next move be
to get Kirsty admitted as a witness?

374
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,400
She could go above me, but it would likely
just get kicked back down to me.

375
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,280
No. You're wrong.

376
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,160
You just said she'd go above you.

377
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
It doesn't mean that she did.

378
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,280
You get me worried
about my relationship with Merritt

379
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,560
just so you can play your real card,
which is Stephen Burns?

380
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,640
Oh, excellent. Hats off.

381
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,240
Be careful what you learn from this man.

382
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
There's practiced,

383
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
and there's reckless.

384
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,200
Stephen Burns brought Merritt
into the department.

385
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
He was invested in her success.

386
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,640
There's no way he would do anything
but help her, or at least try.

387
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,400
Now, if you'll excuse me,

388
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
I'm late.

389
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Thank you, Liam.

390
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,000
Jasper.

391
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
How you doin', buddy?

392
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,360
Fine.

393
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,280
Carl Morck's kid, right?

394
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,560
D-do I know you?

395
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,800
Not by name.

396
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,360
But you can feel who I am, can't you?

397
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,200
Or what I am.

398
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,800
Course you can. You're a smart kid.

399
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,240
-Carl's on his way… here right now, so--
-Aye.

400
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,440
So where is he? 'Cause frankly--

401
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,680
Sit.

402
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,640
Do not cry or whimper
or make any kind of sound.

403
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,560
Imagine this was your young balls
I'm doing this with.

404
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,280
'Cause if you shout or if you scream

405
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,440
or if you do anything outside of
just sitting there quietly looking at me,

406
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
I'll ruin you.

407
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,520
Okay?

408
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,320
Okay.

409
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,560
There's a good lad.
I mean, I'm not so bad to look at, am I?

410
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,280
No.

411
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,040
No what?

412
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,200
No, you're… not that bad to look at.

413
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Thank you, Jasper.

414
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
You're very nice to look at.

415
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,280
I know some people
who would pay good money

416
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,560
just to look at you.

417
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,560
All of you.

418
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I know some others
who would pay good money too

419
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,600
to put things inside you.

420
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,280
Things human and not.

421
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,760
Both wet and dry.

422
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,280
See, and they would get off
not just on your nice face

423
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,840
but on all that fear
and the blood that comes out of you.

424
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
And they would film it all.

425
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,640
So after they dropped you at the hospital,
'cause these are just men with appetites,

426
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,880
they're not animals,

427
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,960
they could relive those moments
over and over again.

428
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,040
Just like you'd be doing

429
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,200
in your own mind

430
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,160
for the rest of your life.

431
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,080
So… here's what I'd like you to do for me.

432
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I'd like you to pass on
everything I've just said to you

433
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,160
in exactly the way I said it to Carl

434
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,600
when he gets here.

435
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,640
Speak of the devil.

436
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Nice kid you've got there.

437
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
Oi.

438
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
Easy, tiger.

439
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,120
I'm not resisting.

440
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,760
-What did you do to the kid?
-Nothing. We were talking.

441
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
I like kids.

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,360
-You fucking tell Finch that if he wants--
-Who?

443
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,880
Tell Graham Finch,
the next time he wants to send a message,

444
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,360
to get his fucking arse
down here himself, yeah?

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,160
Fucking cunt!

446
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Carl!

447
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Move.

448
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
Keep pressing down

449
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
until you feel
all your weight along the floor.

450
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
-Wow.
-Exactly.

451
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,880
What did you say
this technique was called again?

452
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,480
It's mine. It's a Dr. Loo technique.

453
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,320
This isn't what it looks like.

454
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,240
-Too bad.
-Eh, eh, eh.

455
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,080
And press.

456
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Now try and lift your legs.

457
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,160
All right. Good boy.
Let's get him into the chair.

458
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,600
Ready?

459
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,280
-Sit up.
-Okay.

460
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,240
And three, two, one, lift.

461
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,600
Whee!

462
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,200
Lift yourself up. Come on, push.

463
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,400
Let's try and keep you out of bed
as much as we can.

464
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Thanks, boys.

465
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,760
Be nice to your father.
He's worked hard today.

466
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,720
Oh, I'm always nice to my father.

467
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,840
-How's your day, Dad?
-Fuck off.

468
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,440
Why are you haunting me?
I know you're in love with me.

469
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,600
In love with my own dad?
That's disgusting.

470
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,920
Fuck's wrong with you?
Don't you have a life?

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,200
Now you sound like my mum.

472
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,400
-I don't want to go home.
-Why not?

473
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,760
'Cause I don't like being alone.
I keep seeing dead old people.

474
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,760
Hmm. PTSD? You thinking
about that old couple you ran over?

475
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,800
I knew you'd comfort me.

476
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,640
Well, seeing as you're here,
you might as well help me.

477
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,200
Do you need the loo?
Do you want me to get you a wee bowl?

478
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
No, I don't need the loo.

479
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,800
So I've been reading old news.

480
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Every wee thing that happened in Edinburgh

481
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,640
around the time
before and after Merritt went missing.

482
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,480
Everything from the opening
of a new pie shop up the Mile

483
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,200
to various pub fights

484
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,480
to the death of a Chinese medical student

485
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,680
who somehow confused
formaldehyde for vodka.

486
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,120
-There's a new pie shop?
-Four years ago, dimwit.

487
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Right, yeah. Sorry.

488
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,560
Nothing all that interesting
except for a story

489
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,320
about a gentleman named Ned Finkle.

490
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,280
Ned Finkle?

491
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,280
-Some handle, eh?
-Ooft.

492
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,040
He was released from this very hospital
two weeks after being run over

493
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,320
by a young lawyer named Julia Montgomery.

494
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,720
-Mm.
-Sorry, did that trigger you?

495
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm medicated.

496
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,640
So he's out jogging when the Fiat
driven by 28-year-old Julia Montgomery

497
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,520
suddenly veers across the street,
puts poor Mr. Finkle up in the air.

498
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Lost both his legs.

499
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,040
Jesus.

500
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
What happened? Did she fall asleep?

501
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,320
Mrs. Montgomery claims
she was forced off the road

502
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,560
by another vehicle
that came up alongside her.

503
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,040
But seeing how she smacked him from behind
and there were no witnesses,

504
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,280
it was her word against his.

505
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,840
What, so she… she just got away with it?

506
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,160
Well, only if she was lying.

507
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,240
How'd you mean?

508
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,680
Julia Montgomery was born Julia Burns.

509
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,400
She married an oral surgeon
named Robert Montgomery two years before.

510
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,320
-Burns?
-His daughter.

511
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,600
So someone sent a message
to Stephen Burns?

512
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,360
Attagirl.

513
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,360
-Graham Finch.
-Probably.

514
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,480
And you think Merritt knew?

515
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,200
Again, probably.

516
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,160
Good work, Dad.

517
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
Well done. You're all over the socials.

518
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
"Unhinged cop at it again."

519
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,640
Fucking cunt!

520
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,480
-Carl!
-Will that get me laid?

521
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,920
Probably. But not necessarily
by anyone you'd want.

522
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Mm.

523
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,240
-Where's Jasper?
-Uh, school.

524
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,440
He said to say he'll pick his stuff up
from his nana's on his way home.

525
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,440
Okay.

526
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,840
Do you think violence is
a good thing to be modeling for Jasper?

527
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,360
I wasn't modeling violence.

528
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,560
I was modeling how to tell
a creep not to fuck with me.

529
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,000
Right. Well, uh, whilst I don't approve,
the experience did have one benefit.

530
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,240
This morning, he actually made his bed.

531
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,920
I know.

532
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
Very significant.

533
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,520
So… notice it's happening dead center.

534
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Like they knew where the camera is,

535
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,480
parked there so it would catch all of it.

536
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,080
And then,

537
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,280
right after…

538
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,760
-Land Rover wasn't even his car.
-Mm-hmm.

539
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,440
Hang on.

540
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,360
BMW 7 Series.
Let's have a look at the tag.

541
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,760
-So what you guys doi--
-Shh.

542
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,560
Nice.

543
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Carl Morck?

544
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
Dr. Sonnenberg.

545
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,520
We meet at last.

546
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Please.

547
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Please take a seat.

548
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Question.

549
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Where's Dr. Irving?

550
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,320
Ah, well, lucky for you,
I managed to return earlier than expected.

551
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,160
Turns out
a torn meniscus takes less time--

552
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,080
Nobody told me.

553
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,600
Well, they should have.

554
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,320
It's important to end
a therapeutic relationship properly.

555
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,040
Yes. Yes, it is. It's very important.

556
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,400
And I feel a sense of abandonment,
anger, and resentment.

557
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,440
That's good. That's an excellent place
for us to get started.

558
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Let's just rearrange, shall we?

559
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,080
-Course, if you think that's--
-Please, don't get up.

560
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,400
We wouldn't want you to have
any more surgery.

561
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,760
-It is allowed for you to drive faster.
-I know.

562
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,960
-You seem nervous.
-Do I?

563
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,880
Yes, is it because of your, um…

564
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,640
-Never mind.
-Just ask if you're gonna ask.

565
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
What happened?

566
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,080
I hit an elderly couple in my car.

567
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,920
I was in pursuit of this…

568
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,120
Does it really fucking matter?

569
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,240
No. I meant what happened after.
You said you had some issues.

570
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Oh.

571
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,280
Yeah, it's not that big a deal.

572
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,320
Okay.

573
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,200
I tried to kill myself.

574
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,200
I am sorry.

575
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
Slit my wrists.

576
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,520
Well,

577
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
wrist.

578
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,920
Um… Passed out
before I could get to the other one.

579
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,080
I can't stand the sight of blood.

580
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,160
D.I. Hardy found me.

581
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,520
I was helping him and Carl with this…

582
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
Doesn't matter. Anyway, um…

583
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,360
he came by my flat when I didn't show up.

584
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,960
He saved your life?

585
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,160
Not really, no. Um…

586
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,720
The doctor said I wouldn't have died.
The… The cut wasn't deep enough.

587
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Um…

588
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,120
But he definitely saved it after.

589
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,360
-How so?
-By being nice.

590
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,720
It's a black BMW 7 Series,
registered to Edmund Solomon.

591
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Flat 58.

592
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,680
-This is not the best neighborhood.
-I've got your back.

593
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,680
Thank you.

594
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,800
Rose, do me a favor.

595
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,720
Wait here.

596
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,320
What? No.

597
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Please.

598
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah?

599
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,000
Sir, is your car the black BMW?

600
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,240
What about it?

601
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm sorry, sir, but your car is on fire.

602
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,360
-What d'you say?
-Your car is on fire.

603
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,000
Get out my fuckin' way.

604
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,080
Oh.

605
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,920
You fuckin'--

606
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,760
My fuckin' leg!

607
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,280
Sir, would you please call an ambulance?
Mr. Solomon has fallen down the stairs.

608
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,880
It appears he has broken his, uh…

609
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,720
…femur.

610
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,200
Fuck that cunt.

611
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,480
Your neighbors don't seem to like you.

612
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,040
Who hired you and your friends
to harass D.C.I. Morck?

613
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,600
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

614
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,200
Okay. But in the meantime,
please tell me who you work for.

615
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,440
If you're gonna arrest me, just do it.

616
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,600
Well, I'm not actually a policeman.

617
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
But you are lucky you're talking to me
and not D.C.I. Morck because…

618
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,800
he would probably kill you.

619
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,680
I won't. However, I will hurt you.

620
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,120
Please, who hired you?

621
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,480
Who hired you?

622
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,920
Ho! Gonnae shut the fuck up?

623
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,080
Okay. I'm listening.

624
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,280
What the fuck were you thinking?

625
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,640
-I was thinking I wanna kill this prick--
-Wait. I love this part.

626
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,560
-Fucking cunt!
-Carl!

627
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,080
'Twas only the reasoned voice of a child
could finally stop the beast.

628
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,280
-I was set up, for fuck's sake.
-Yes!

629
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,880
It looks like someone
may have indeed set you up.

630
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,800
And while that's very concerning,

631
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,120
what is even more concerning

632
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,400
is the fact it's fucking possible
to set you up in the first place.

633
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,440
You look like a bloody lunatic.

634
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,960
He threatened Jasper.

635
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,520
Be that as it may,

636
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,640
you have now lost hold of yourself
in public twice in the same week.

637
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,360
That's got to be a bloody world record.

638
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,240
I don't even know what to fucking say.

639
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm fucking speechless.

640
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,320
What the fuck, Carl?

641
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,440
Show's been going on for a while now.

642
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,960
-Oh, yeah.
-What the fuck?

643
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,200
Are you fucking five
or are you fucking fifty?

644
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Fucking pathetic, that's what it is.

645
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,000
And normally,
a banger fucking week like that

646
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,920
would be what I'd like to call
a fucking career ender.

647
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,160
-Catchy.
-Shut up!

648
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,040
And I am not firing you.

649
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,960
Because no doubt that's exactly
what whoever got your easy-gotten goat

650
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
wanted to happen.

651
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,520
Ah, yes!

652
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,240
The other enabling members
of Team Doolally.

653
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
To what do I owe this pain?

654
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,400
Uh… we located the driver of the vehicle
who picked up the… victim.

655
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,640
Can we not call
that piece of shit a victim?

656
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,880
Where is this driver?

657
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,480
At the moment,
he's in hospital with a broken leg.

658
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,520
Oh?

659
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,440
He fell down the stairs.

660
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,320
Really?

661
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,520
He's employed as a chauffeur
by Ballantyne Transfer & Security.

662
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,960
Which is owned by Finch Overseas Shipping.

663
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,680
And have you talked to Finch?

664
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
We've been…

665
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,200
rattling his cage.

666
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,840
What are you waiting for?

667
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,960
Merritt was spending time
with a journalist called Sam Haig

668
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,800
who was looking into corruption
in the… Crown Office.

669
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,680
Okay.

670
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,960
He died in a climbing "accident"
right before she disappeared.

671
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,160
And you think someone
inside the Crown Office was involved?

672
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
Not someone.

673
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,520
Stephen Burns.

674
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,640
What the actual fuck?

675
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,280
We think there was a connection
between Burns and Finch.

676
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,760
I can't wait to hear it.

677
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,120
Finch threatened Burns's daughter.

678
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,640
Her car was driven off the road
by another vehicle

679
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,280
the same time as Finch's trial.

680
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,520
Merritt didn't like losing
when it was fair.

681
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,400
If her superior was helping Finch--

682
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,160
-This is all theory, not evidence.
-I'd like to hear what Burns has to say.

683
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,520
-Formally question the lord advocate?
-He won't give me anything if it's formal.

684
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,080
-You wanna waterboard him?
-Yeah, I'd love to.

685
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,080
But it's frowned upon,
so I'll settle for surprising him instead.

686
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,840
-We're all set.
-What for?

687
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
The lineup.

688
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,320
Oh, fuck.

689
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,880
-Turn to the right, please.
-What the fuck for?

690
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,480
They're wearing masks.
I need to see their eyes.

691
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,480
Back to the front.

692
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Ask number six to step forward.

693
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,280
Number six, please step forward.

694
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
Tell him to take off his mask.

695
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
Please remove the mask.

696
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you sure?

698
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
It's just you and me in here.

699
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,720
This gentleman's guilty of something.
Probably a lot of somethings.

700
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,480
But my shooter, he is not.

701
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,880
Okay.

702
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,440
-Looks like that hatch--
-Shut the fuck up.

703
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,200
That fucking hatch.

704
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,560
That fucking airlock. It's broken again.

705
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I told you to fix it.
