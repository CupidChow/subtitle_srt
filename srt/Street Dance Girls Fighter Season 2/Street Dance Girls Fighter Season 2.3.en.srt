1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,890
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,160
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 is back stronger.)

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,389
(Jaw-dropping performances)

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,230
(The skilled dancers call on the IN buttons.)

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,100
(Team Trials full of love and passion ended.)

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,329
I mean it.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,170
(But it's too early to celebrate?)

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,500
(The crews will be disbanded.)

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,770
(Shocked)

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,539
(I don't want to be separated.)

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
(Only 7 dancers from each team...)

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,908
(will advance to the next mission.)

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,380
(Final Selection Battle)

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,478
(The participating crews and individuals react differently.)

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,548
But we're seven people.

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,219
(Let's do our best in the given situation.)

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,789
(The dancers brace themselves.)

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,188
(Cheering up)

19
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,390
(Let's go!)

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,399
(No hesitation! They head straight to the stage.)

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,670
(With captivating dance moves, )

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
(They're insane!)

23
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,170
(prove yourself...)

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,310
(and win the hearts of the masters.)

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,840
(To be selected, )

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,848
(they yield to no one...)

27
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,579
(and give their all in this dance-off.)

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,920
(Let's put aside our astonishment...)

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,848
(and discreetly make decisions.)

30
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,818
- The dancer is...
- Park Eun Seo!

31
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,059
(Surviving in the fierce Final Selection Battle, )

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,290
It's Kim Soo Jung.

33
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,000
(7 dancers were chosen by each master.)

34
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,400
(The six powerful teams have been formed.)

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,140
The actual competition...

36
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,640
(The true competition begins now.)

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,510
(The first mission is announced as soon as the teams are formed.)

38
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,069
What?

39
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,340
(Puzzled)

40
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,109
(Prepared)

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,049
(Which teenage dance crew will be number one in the whole world?)

42
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,419
(Which team is at the futsal court?)

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,029
I can't wait to introduce them.

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,458
(It's Team BEBE.)

45
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,260
- I'm so curious.
- The new members of BEBE.

46
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,399
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,169
(Welcome.)

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,869
- The mini-BEBE members.
- Today...

49
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
(Why is Team BEBE at the futsal court?)

50
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,938
(Curious and expectant)

51
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,369
It's the First Mem-BE-ship Training.

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,008
We want you to play games and enjoy the day...

53
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,409
to become better friends between you guys and with us too.

54
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,719
And we prepared one more thing for you.

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,049
You've joined Team BEBE, right?

56
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,718
We got padded vests for you guys.

57
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,888
(Warm vests for Team BEBE)

58
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,959
All right.

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,029
We got them in our team's color.

60
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,060
Why don't you try it on?

61
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,158
You're officially joining BEBE by wearing it.

62
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,169
- How lovely!
- Amazing.

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,968
You guys look great in them.

64
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,008
Blue must suit them best.

65
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,639
Thank you.

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,239
You can't take it off now.

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,309
(We'll never take them off.)

68
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,650
- You can't take them off.
- Never.

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,279
The first event is street dance futsal!

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
(Street dance futsal)

71
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,918
Okay.

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,659
It's street dance futsal, so you have to dance nonstop.

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,860
You have to dribble the ball while dancing.

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,388
- But...
- Shall we begin?

75
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,529
- Okay.
- Okay.

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,098
(Street dance futsal: Team Blue versus Team Yellow)

77
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,869
(Team Blue: Rana, A Ra, Eun Seo, Seung Ju, Tatter, Cheche, Bada)

78
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,929
(She fails to contain her laughter.)

79
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,069
(Team Yellow: Ga Young, Seo Yeon, Chae Won, Kyma, Soweon, Minah)

80
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,539
(Provoking them)

81
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,770
(Shy)

82
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,409
- Okay!
- Good luck!

83
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,840
Show us your moves, leader!

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
(Automatically dancing in sync)

85
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

86
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:32,979
Start.

87
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,590
(Naturally trying to dribble the ball)

88
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:40,729
Get to the ball!

89
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,589
(They have to dance and kick the ball.)

90
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,830
- We have to keep dancing.
- Baggy.

91
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:46,830
What am I supposed to do?

92
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,469
(It's a pretty close game.)

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,370
Go, Team Blue!

94
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,869
- No!
- Okay!

95
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,679
Dance!

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,878
(Bada is more focused on dancing than the futsal.)

97
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,710
("Smoke" by Dynamic Duo)

98
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,379
- We have to do it.
- Everyone! There you go!

99
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,750
- All right!
- Okay!

100
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,249
(Eun Seo and Ga Young have a war of nerves.)

101
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,189
(They want to be the main dancer of "Smoke.")

102
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,729
Okay!

103
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,188
(Where's Bada going?)

104
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,230
No!

105
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,060
We can't lose here.

106
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,758
You need to get the ball back.

107
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,799
- There you go!
- Great!

108
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,500
- Score a goal!
- Keep playing!

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,739
All right!

110
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,398
(They don't even care about the futsal now.)

111
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,739
They were so cheerful...

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,578
and sociable. I was thankful.

113
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,339
I feel like we've grown closer.

114
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,078
(Team JAM REPUBLIC is meeting with the masters.)

115
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,989
(Wary)

116
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,419
(The atmosphere is different from that of Team BEBE.)

117
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,419
(Awkward)

118
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,789
(Their personalities and nationalities vary.)

119
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,129
(Japan, New Zealand, Korea)

120
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,828
Should we teach each other...

121
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,999
some basic words in each other's languages?

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

123
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,229
Like, "hi," "yes," or "no."

124
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,638
- "Annyeong." - "Annyeong."

125
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,970
"Annyeonghaseyo" is a formal way.

126
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,509
"Annyeonghaseyo."

127
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,309
What about in Japanese? What's "hello?"

128
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,679
- "Konnichiwa." - "Konnichiwa."

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,850
What about "yes?"

130
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,279
- "Hai." - "Hai."

131
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,179
(Team JAM REPUBLIC gets closer by learning each other's languages.)

132
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,290
(The masters of JAM REPUBLIC appear at that moment.)

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,159
(Squealing)

134
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,790
(I can't believe I'm finally meeting them!)

135
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,328
Hello. It's so quiet.

136
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,459
Hi.

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
(Good to see you.)

138
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,230
- Feeling good?
- Yes.

139
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,898
Gosh. Everyone's so quiet.

140
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:29,970
Are we shy?

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,110
So, we thought we might as well get to know each other.

142
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,869
It was so surreal because I look up to them.

143
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,739
And now I'm going to sit and have lunch with them.

144
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,809
It was really exciting.

145
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,049
Where are you guys staying?

146
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,919
We live in another city. It's not that far.

147
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,948
- Okay.
- Good.

148
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,719
- It takes about an hour.
- Nice.

149
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,689
Your English is so good.

150
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,188
I used to live in Singapore for about ten years.

151
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,758
- Ten years?
- Yes.

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,028
We have all-rounders here.

153
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,300
- Yes.
- I'm so happy.

154
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,529
How do we order?

155
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,068
So, they say the pork belly is the best here.

156
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,099
- Pork belly?
- Yes.

157
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,539
And there's a special way we order food in Korea.

158
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,409
- Yes?
- We say, "Aunt."

159
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,878
- "Aunt." - Yes.

160
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,939
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

161
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,349
They didn't hear us. Aunt.

162
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,579
They're so confused because "aunt" is used when...

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,120
the person is a woman. We call them aunt.

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,419
(Sorry)

165
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,720
When it's a man, we say, "Uncle."

166
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,430
Uncle.

167
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,029
(She desperately calls the uncle.)

168
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,170
- Please give us pork belly.
- Please give us pork belly.

169
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,328
- Pork belly?
- Thank you. Yes.

170
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,000
(There was a slight mix-up, but they ordered their food.)

171
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,110
- Gosh. That looks so good.
- Is that kimchi?

172
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,138
(Shaking)

173
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,278
Yes, I learned this trick in Korea.

174
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,779
To make the rice nice and neat, you shake it.

175
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,919
(They all shake the bowls.)

176
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
(Shaking)

177
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,560
(Ta-da)

178
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,259
That looks so good.

179
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,789
(Welcome, first time having Korean barbecue?)

180
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,230
Everyone, dig in.

181
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,529
Would you like to guide us in how to make a little...

182
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,169
With pleasure.

183
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,569
- One lettuce. And...
- One? Yes.

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,410
Okay. One.

185
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,638
- One lettuce?
- Yes.

186
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,378
- Put in anything you want.
- Anything.

187
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,909
- Yes.
- Magic sauce.

188
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,009
(Kirsten's favorite magic sauce, ssamjang)

189
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,079
Kimchi. Nice.

190
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,149
And rice? Okay.

191
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,649
- There's only one rule with this.
- Yes?

192
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,819
You have to finish it in one bite.

193
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,289
One go, right?

194
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,789
(All this in one bite?)

195
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,929
No cutting it off.

196
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,859
I'm eating Korean barbecue with JAM REPUBLIC.

197
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,959
(Proud)

198
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,359
(That's so cute.)

199
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,870
JAM REPUBLIC and Korean barbecue.

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,300
(Putting their wraps together for a cheer)

201
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,898
(LaTrice properly tastes her wrap.)

202
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,969
Did you dip it?

203
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,240
(Bursting into laughter)

204
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,040
Come on. One bite. Push it in there.

205
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,809
(Barely eating it)

206
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,879
Good job.

207
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,349
Did you get it?

208
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,119
(Their friendship grows as they make wraps for each other.)

209
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,420
(They're not bullying each other.)

210
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,660
(Team JAM REPUBLIC enjoys its meal.)

211
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,499
(Where is this loud place?)

212
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,458
- Welcome, girls!
- Welcome!

213
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,128
(Team HOOK was invited to Master Aiki's house.)

214
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,999
I'll show you around my place.

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,569
I'd love that.

216
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,839
(What's the first room she takes them to?)

217
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,578
(The dressing room for a sneak peek of Aiki's stage costumes)

218
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,879
It's my dressing room.

219
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,179
Do you guys recognize this jacket?

220
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,208
- Yes!
- That's...

221
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,720
It's what we wore for the finals of "Street Woman Fighter."

222
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,990
(HOOK's stage costume for the finals of "Street Woman Fighter")

223
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,288
- Take this energy.
- Yes.

224
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,229
(Chae Hyung receives the energy from the finals.)

225
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,528
- That looks so good on you.
- You look great.

226
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,629
You're like a member of HOOK.

227
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,159
It suits her.

228
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,269
You can take anything you need.

229
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,370
I want that helmet.

230
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,110
Why are there so many helmets?

231
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,808
Why don't you try the helmet with that jacket?

232
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,840
- Try it on.
- Right.

233
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,379
(It's already funny.)

234
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,148
I don't think it'll fit.

235
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,709
(Team HOOK receives all the good energy.)

236
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,378
- You look great in it.
- You totally do.

237
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,888
You're killing it. Awesome.

238
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,288
(Laughing)

239
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,619
Is her hair supposed to look like that?

240
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,058
I doubt anyone will be able to pick a fight with you like this.

241
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,089
Seriously.

242
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,989
You look way too intense.

243
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,500
Are the other teams watching?

244
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,600
Let's take a short break.

245
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,469
- Do you have a practice room?
- No, we don't.

246
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,099
You can use ours if you need one.

247
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,138
(Surprised)

248
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,709
And if you have to practice after midnight,

249
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,779
you can come here and sleep.

250
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,250
I mean it. It's totally fine.

251
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,149
We also sleep here from time to time.

252
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,620
You can just come and meet us.

253
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,350
- We'll be playing Nintendo games.
- Don't worry about it.

254
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

255
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,689
I wanted you to let loose and have fun today.

256
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,860
So we brought pajamas for you.

257
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,158
(Delicious food is a must at a party.)

258
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,829
Let's go!

259
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,830
Who wants pizza?

260
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,570
- Me.
- Okay.

261
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,570
(Today, she's a mom, not a master.)

262
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,269
You need to eat your vegetables.

263
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,869
- They aren't eating vegetables.
- What kind of salad...

264
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,870
do you have there?

265
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,669
- They're like our kids. How nice.
- Thank you for the food.

266
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,638
- Eat a lot, girls.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,308
- Thank you for the food.
- That way, you can practice a lot.

268
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,610
- Yes, Mother.
- Try this.

269
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,879
This is so tasty.

270
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,250
Do you want to have some of this salad?

271
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Did you enjoy the food?

272
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

273
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,460
(The mood changes. It seems Funky Y has something to say.)

274
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,489
Now that we're done with this delicious meal,

275
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,829
I will now announce your first mission.

276
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,258
(I will now announce your first mission.)

277
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,869
(A mission all of a sudden?)

278
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,199
There's an interim mission.

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,268
We have the next mission.

280
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,970
(Did you say, "Interim mission?")

281
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,009
We're meeting today, so we can give you the next mission.

282
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,809
The first mission is...

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,008
You're announcing that in a dinosaur outfit?

284
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,009
(Dinosaur Funky Y is too cute to be announcing a mission.)

285
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,620
This is quite new. You should try to look serious.

286
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,249
Here's your first mission.

287
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,189
(What's their interim mission?)

288
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,490
You will be choosing any K-pop song.

289
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,158
The performance should be 1 minute and 30 seconds.

290
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:58,898
You must come up with your own performance.

291
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,928
This time, we'll be testing your teamwork and your creativity.

292
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,929
The mission begins now.

293
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,199
What? It starts now?

294
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,038
You have 24 hours.

295
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,638
Within 24 hours...

296
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,908
You have 24 hours to put it together.

297
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:12,909
Pardon?

298
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,210
(Finish it in 24 hours? In a day?)

299
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,849
Come up with a performance that's 1 minute and 30 seconds in a day?

300
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,250
With the seven of us?

301
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,048
Can I be completely honest here?

302
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,149
I thought, "They're crazy."

303
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,719
1MILLION is the best crew for K-pop songs.

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,459
So we ought to continue their reputation...

305
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,199
and win first place in the K-pop mission.

306
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,199
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

307
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,469
Let's do this!

308
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,128
- Yes!
- Yes!

309
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,099
- Let's show them how it's done.
- Teach them a lesson.

310
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,839
"This is what 1MILLION can do."

311
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,909
Totally.

312
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,639
(The day of the evaluation for the K-pop Choreography Mission)

313
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,449
(The performances of this interim mission...)

314
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,580
(will signal the start of the team battles.)

315
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,019
(The stage where the K-pop Choreography Mission will be held)

316
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,450
(The six teams nervously enter.)

317
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,658
I could feel that it was really starting.

318
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,059
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 is starting at last.

319
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,600
All the teams looked really prepared.

320
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,830
It was our first time checking out the other teams' performances.

321
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,168
We didn't have much time to prepare. So I was curious to see...

322
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,240
what kind of performances they came up with.

323
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,740
The first thing that crossed my mind was, "This will be fun."

324
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,139
I think I was very ambitious.

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,009
I thought I didn't have a choice but to do well.

326
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
(Looking around)

327
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,388
Everyone prepared nice outfits.

328
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,518
They made an effort.

329
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,158
- Yes.
- When did they prepare the outfits?

330
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,388
How did they pull that off?

331
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,689
(Each team's color stands out in their outfits.)

332
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,798
(Among all the teams, a team grabs everyone's attention.)

333
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,329
(Chic-looking leather)

334
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,668
I was quite surprised to see Team MANNEQUEEN's outfit.

335
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,268
First of all, they were made of leather.

336
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:49,340
On top of that, I saw a dancer who had dyed her hair blond.

337
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,740
It was a bit intimidating.

338
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,878
We had the best outfits.

339
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,879
All the effort we made for the outfits paid off.

340
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,349
(Gauging the team gently)

341
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,219
We should have brought the 1MILLION towels.

342
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,860
You're so right. Maybe, we should've worn the 1MILLION T-shirts.

343
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,558
By the way, our outfit looks the plainest.

344
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,590
Right. Then should we make things more interesting?

345
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,129
(Sexy)

346
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,399
Oh, we're dancing in front of each other.

347
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,639
I see. We're facing this way when we dance.

348
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,469
- This is crazy.
- Just now...

349
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,440
Where are the judges?

350
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,178
- Is it just us?
- There are no judges?

351
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,878
Where will the masters be watching from?

352
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,240
- I don't know.
- Wait. They're not coming today?

353
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,649
They should be watching.

354
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,620
(A mysterious room is set up on the floor above.)

355
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,619
(Hello. Peekaboo!)

356
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Let's go.

357
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,119
(They will be watching from the secret room.)

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,190
Gosh, I can't wait.

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,528
They don't know that we're watching them.

360
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,288
They'll be surprised when they find out.

361
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,298
I can't wait.

362
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,299
I'm curious.

363
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,628
I'm most curious about this.

364
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,729
This is a performance they put together by themselves.

365
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,699
Some of the dancers didn't know each other.

366
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,999
It's their first team project.

367
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,408
We're checking out their potential as a team for the first time.

368
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,908
- Right.
- Really.

369
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,378
Oh, I'm nervous.

370
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,809
But I'm excited.

371
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,449
- I'm kind of worried.
- You're worried, right?

372
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,979
- I'm more worried.
- I'm very worried too.

373
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,849
I'm getting more nervous than when I had to perform.

374
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,450
- I'd rather perform.
- Right.

375
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,950
- Really? Watching is easier for me.
- No.

376
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,720
I like watching performances.

377
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,090
(Strongly agreeing)

378
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,058
We will now begin...

379
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,460
(What's going on?)

380
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,500
(The monitor suddenly turns on.)

381
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,628
We will now begin the interim mission...

382
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,699
of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

383
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,599
We will now evaluate your K-pop choreography Mission.

384
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,308
(Looking forward to it)

385
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,970
(Feeling confident)

386
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,080
Let's go!

387
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,139
- At last.
- It's finally starting.

388
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,049
I will go over the rules for evaluating your choreography.

389
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,648
All six teams will take turns and perform their choreography...

390
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,419
for 1 minute and 30 seconds onstage.

391
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,918
As for the evaluation,

392
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,859
- What about the evaluation?
- No way.

393
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,429
Come on. I wonder what it is.

394
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,859
you will be evaluating each other.

395
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,729
(They didn't even think about evaluating each other.)

396
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,730
This is crazy.

397
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,069
- They'll evaluate themselves.
- What?

398
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
The dancers will do that?

399
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,870
But that way, it will be an honest evaluation.

400
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,039
That will be the surest way.

401
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,469
- I wonder which team will win.
- But this way,

402
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,278
we can find out how the kids perceive each other.

403
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,408
Which team will win first place? And which team will come last place?

404
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,250
- I hope we don't rank last.
- Same here.

405
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,819
I really didn't think we'd be evaluating each other.

406
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,918
It made me want to do better, so the other teams...

407
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,319
wouldn't look down on us.

408
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,148
- Seriously. I must stay sharp.
- Right.

409
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,388
Each team will rank all six teams,

410
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:23,128
including itself, from the 1st to 6th places.

411
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,499
The teams will receive points based on their rankings,

412
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,428
which will decide your final scores.

413
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,570
The team that comes in first will receive a special benefit.

414
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,538
- I wonder what the benefit is.
- What is it?

415
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,970
What is it? I can't wait to find out.

416
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,668
We will now begin the internal evaluation...

417
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,139
for the K-pop Choreography Mission.

418
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,479
The team that goes first will choose the next team.

419
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,148
(We have to single out a team?)

420
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,649
(Their nervousness peaks.)

421
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,249
(Already getting a headache)

422
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,250
I got goosebumps.

423
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,288
(Even the masters are surprised by the process.)

424
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,888
Raise your hand if there's a team...

425
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,158
that wants to go first.

426
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,330
(Raise your hand if there's a team that wants to go first.)

427
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,429
This is crazy.

428
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,200
- The team that wants to go 1st?
- The team that wants to go 1st.

429
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,500
Does anyone want to go first?

430
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,600
I should get some sleep.

431
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,000
Don't raise your hand.

432
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,639
(Acting distracted for no reason)

433
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,268
- The team that wants to go first.
- No, not us.

434
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,939
- Don't raise your hand.
- Not us.

435
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,969
Never.

436
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,340
No. Don't go first.

437
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,309
Gosh. Wait. Is this about reading the room?

438
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,450
I wanted to check out the other teams' performances first.

439
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,079
All six teams were smiling,

440
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,289
but deep down, they were all waiting to check each other out.

441
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,690
Everyone is trying to get into each other's head.

442
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,960
- This is getting serious.
- We can never go first.

443
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,389
If we mess it up,

444
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,699
- we might...
- We might get everything wrong.

445
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,928
Chae Hyung, don't shake your head.

446
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,570
Don't stand out. Stay still, Chae Hyung.

447
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,268
(Suddenly calming down)

448
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,339
This is a K-pop mission.

449
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,470
Which crew represents the K-pop scene? It's 1MILLION.

450
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:44,268
(Which crew represents the K-pop scene? It's 1MILLION.)

451
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,339
Don't raise your hand. Don't be brave for no reason.

452
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,378
- "Don't be brave for no reason." - No.

453
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,379
You don't want them to go first.

454
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,879
(Looking away completely)

455
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,518
The dancers who specialize in choreography aren't volunteering.

456
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,490
They must not feel confident.

457
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,159
(Trying to provoke them)

458
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,529
- Gosh. That was harsh.
- Right.

459
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,299
No.

460
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,829
- We must go last.
- Right.

461
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,670
(Starting to think)

462
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,339
No, don't fall for that.

463
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Don't volunteer.

464
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,269
(None of them are volunteering to go first.)

465
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,740
Since no crew volunteered, even after a lot of time had passed...

466
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,450
Should we go?

467
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,519
I think we should.

468
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,089
- We should?
- I think we should.

469
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Are you good with that?

470
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,558
- Yes.
- Guys.

471
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,588
Guys, let's go.

472
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,689
- Should we go?
- Yes.

473
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,028
- Okay.
- Let's go.

474
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,358
(Team JAM REPUBLIC bravely volunteers to go first.)

475
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,930
(Cheering intensely)

476
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,838
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

477
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,098
Let's go, babies!

478
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,108
Go, Team JAM REPUBLIC!

479
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,368
- They're so cool.
- Go, Jammies.

480
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,539
I knew it. People who are good are usually confident.

481
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,650
- They can handle going first.
- Yes.

482
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,009
Let's go!

483
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,078
(Team JAM REPUBLIC bravely gets onstage first.)

484
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,750
- Let's go!
- Gosh, you guys are so cool!

485
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,358
Let us introduce ourselves first. On three. One, two, three.

486
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,160
- World domination, JAM REPUBLIC.
- World domination, JAM REPUBLIC.

487
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
What was that?

488
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,160
- That's so cool.
- That's so cool.

489
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,199
"World domination."

490
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,839
(I want to say a cool line too.)

491
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,538
I'm the leader of Team JAM REPUBLIC.

492
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,039
My name is Park Eun Woo.

493
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,710
You look gorgeous!

494
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,109
She's so cool.

495
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,509
- I'm a huge fan of hers.
- Right.

496
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:29,779
She's so pretty.

497
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,679
- She lived in Singapore...
- Her English is good.

498
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,749
for ten years.

499
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,420
- So her English is really good.
- Really?

500
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,459
I'm really curious to find out...

501
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,318
which language they use to communicate.

502
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,089
I think their communication could have been difficult.

503
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,789
- Right.
- The way they had to communicate.

504
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,399
(At Team JAM REPUBLIC's practice room, 24 hours ago)

505
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Now, let's move on to songs.

506
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,069
Who's an artist you would think of when you think of K-pop?

507
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,338
(An artist famous for K-pop?)

508
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,469
BLACKPINK.

509
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,739
(Answering right away)

510
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,379
- BLACKPINK.
- BLACKPINK.

511
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,939
Nika.

512
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,849
Play "DDU-DU DDU-DU."

513
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,578
(They pick a song quickly.)

514
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,579
It moves like...

515
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,650
(Everyone listens to BLACKPINK's "DDU-DU DDU-DU.")

516
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,819
(Bobbing her head)

517
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,028
(Her body responds to the strong beat right away.)

518
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,189
It can be really feminine,

519
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,930
but really masculine at the same time.

520
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,500
And then we can go on to floorwork.

521
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,798
- I feel like...
- Because you guys...

522
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,828
are really good at floorwork.

523
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,670
- Correct?
- Yes. Now, we're going to do all.

524
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,008
(Rushing)

525
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,710
That's exactly 1 minute and 30 seconds.

526
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Perfect.

527
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,609
- Does everyone like it?
- Good?

528
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,379
- Okay.
- Okay.

529
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,778
- Do you like it?
- Good.

530
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,180
- The timing.
- Yes, the timing was perfect.

531
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,319
You're the tallest, right? Can you stand in the back for now?

532
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,018
- Are we doing positions?
- We're doing formations.

533
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,858
- I feel like formations...
- Yes.

534
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,328
Because we want to start strong.

535
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,390
- And clean.
- Okay.

536
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,298
People who spoke English started to create the choreography.

537
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,930
It was really tough.

538
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,500
And one.

539
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,869
I think if we're going to do a headspin like this...

540
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,069
Please wait.

541
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,170
Can you show me your pose?

542
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,950
(Translation: Please show me your pose.)

543
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,920
(It worked.)

544
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720
Like this.

545
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,089
Okay.

546
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,819
I think you should raise the other hand.

547
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,859
(Translation: I think you should raise the other hand.)

548
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,259
Yes, any way you want.

549
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,000
Communication was difficult.

550
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,099
It took a long time for us to put together the choreography.

551
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,139
I was worried that we wouldn't finish in time.

552
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,809
I was mostly worried about that.

553
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,278
Dancers from four different countries were put together.

554
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,209
We couldn't communicate freely.

555
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,279
So I wasn't sure if we could complete the choreography.

556
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,049
We really did our best.

557
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,618
I told them we'd be able to show the other dancers...

558
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,190
the unique style of Team JAM REPUBLIC...

559
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,459
when we went up to the stage.

560
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,690
(What's the first performance Team JAM REPUBLIC prepared?)

561
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,558
("DDU-DU DDU-DU" by BLACKPINK, choreo by Team JAM REPUBLIC)

562
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,259
(Already looking impressive)

563
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,130
(Let's go, Baby Audrey!)

564
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,769
(Dominating the stage with her facial expression)

565
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,859
(Hesitant and struggling)

566
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,660
Oh, no.

567
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,690
(Nika doesn't know where to go from the middle of the stage.)

568
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,960
(Looking around)

569
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,400
(Puzzled)

570
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,700
Oh, no.

571
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,469
The three of us in the back were supposed to move as a unit.

572
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,799
But Nika was standing in the middle.

573
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,410
I was like, "Where is she?"

574
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,210
(She hurriedly joins them.)

575
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,108
(Suddenly, everyone is floundering.)

576
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,240
What's going on?

577
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,279
We panicked.

578
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,750
Oh, my gosh.

579
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,619
(Flustered)

580
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,819
You can do this.

581
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,549
Keep going, girls.

582
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,819
- Keep going.
- Let's go.

583
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,089
I was like, "Whatever. Just do it."

584
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,490
I was thinking about how I could fix that.

585
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,799
Hey, go!

586
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,039
(Everyone is surprised.)

587
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,338
(Jumping)

588
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,750
(They are in their element.)

589
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,079
(It's Miyabi's solo part.)

590
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,149
(Screaming)

591
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,150
Let's go!

592
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,858
(Getting goosebumps all over the body)

593
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,829
- I love Miyabi. She's my favorite.
- Right?

594
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,230
Let's go!

595
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,599
(Excellent!)

596
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,140
(Smiling)

597
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,509
(Ria sets out.)

598
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,650
(Ria shows off her furious popping.)

599
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,289
(Cheering)

600
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,719
(Captivated by her coolness)

601
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,759
Gosh. Popping. Let's go!

602
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,430
- Come on. Finish it off.
- Gosh. Popping. Let's go!

603
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,900
(Squeezing through)

604
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,839
Between her legs.

605
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,039
What's that?

606
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,539
(Assembling)

607
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,150
Between her legs.

608
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,380
What's that?

609
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,680
(Disassembling)

610
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:46,099
(Their ending poses)

611
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

612
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,969
Good job, girls.

613
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,139
It would've been great without the mistakes...

614
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
- in the beginning.
- Right.

615
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:56,339
They were nervous.

616
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,439
There was a little mistake. She forgot. But that's okay.

617
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,278
I'm not expecting so much from them.

618
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,579
This is their performance.

619
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,749
And the first team to actually put their hand up,

620
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,049
which is a huge thing for anyone to do.

621
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,649
So I'm happy with it.

622
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,818
I could see there were so many parts...

623
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,450
that I loved that they did.

624
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,019
So yes, I'm proud of the girls, regardless.

625
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,259
(Nika droops her head down after the performance.)

626
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,230
You okay?

627
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,599
(Nodding)

628
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,869
(Leader Park Eun Woo checks on Nika.)

629
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,099
When I watched your performance, I clearly saw...

630
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,508
everyone's unique styles and charms,

631
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,569
which I saw during the Team Trials.

632
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,910
But...

633
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,079
I would like to point out that not everyone's skills...

634
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,779
were on par.

635
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,078
(Lee Na Ra provides sharp feedback.)

636
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,819
Moreover, the way you handled the mistakes...

637
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,689
could have been better.

638
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,359
(Heavy-hearted)

639
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,558
(Listening carefully)

640
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,558
(Feeling anxious)

641
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,299
(Na Ra, this is a bit harsh.)

642
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,598
(Her evaluation is harsher than they expected.)

643
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,970
Gosh. I can't say anything after that.

644
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,409
(Glancing)

645
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,740
(Slightly hurt)

646
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,439
- Na Ra.
- But...

647
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,880
everything she said was valid, so I can't say anything to it.

648
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,910
She's as eloquent as Yoonji.

649
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,619
Na Ra, you have to be really good now.

650
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,750
- Na Ra can't mess it up now.
- Na Ra.

651
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,249
You'd better kill it, Na Ra.

652
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,849
- Na Ra. You can't mess it up.
- Gosh.

653
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,430
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's performance ends with some disappointment.)

654
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,629
(It's their turn to pick the next team to perform.)

655
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,160
Should we ask Miyabi?

656
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,829
- Yes.
- Which team she wants?

657
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,740
(Let me think.)

658
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,239
(Thinking hard)

659
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,369
Gosh.

660
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,410
(Glancing)

661
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:39,680
I get the feeling it might be...

662
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,339
(I get the feeling it might be...)

663
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,048
Team MANNEQUEEN?

664
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,649
- Na Ra.
- Na Ra.

665
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,779
- "Come out, Lee Na Ra." - Yes.

666
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,849
"You attacked us first, right? Okay."

667
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,720
I would call out whoever called us out.

668
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,588
(Covering her eyes)

669
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:55,828
I think they're going to choose Team MANNEQUEEN.

670
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:58,399
They might be more curious about popular teams on the contrary.

671
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,558
Like Team BEBE or Team 1MILLION.

672
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,299
Do we look not that interesting?

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,799
(Which team will be called to perform next?)

674
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,568
Team BEBE.

675
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,210
(Team BEBE)

676
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,680
(Already? What a surprise in the order.)

677
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
(Us?)

678
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,279
I had a feeling that they would pick us.

679
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,480
Team BEBE.

680
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,220
I knew it. Okay.

681
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,789
- Let's go!
- Let's go, Team BEBE!

682
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,788
You got this!

683
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,028
(Team BEBE is the second team to perform.)

684
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,129
- Team BEBE.
- What?

685
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,460
- It's Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

686
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,058
- Team BEBE.
- Gosh.

687
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,430
- Team BEBE.
- Let's go.

688
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,169
- Oh, my gosh.
- There must be a rivalry.

689
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,939
They might consider Team BEBE as their rivals.

690
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,640
- I see. Right.
- Yes.

691
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,539
(Master Bada can't hear anything at this point as she's nervous.)

692
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,140
I can't wait.

693
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,308
(Contrary to everyone's expectation, Team BEBE performs early on.)

694
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,649
Strong teams are performing in the beginning.

695
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,009
What are we going to do?

696
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:52,049
Gosh. Ga Young must be the leader.

697
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,579
She looks like the perfect leader.

698
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,548
(Another leader is watching her.)

699
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,619
- Hello. We're Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

700
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
(Looking forward to it)

701
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,390
This is crazy.

702
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,789
The song we chose for our performance is...

703
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,400
(What kind of performance did Team BEBE prepare?)

704
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,140
It's "Thunderous" by Stray Kids.

705
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:15,910
(Nice!)

706
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,140
(Getting hyped up)

707
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,979
(Surprised)

708
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,039
"Thunderous."

709
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,479
(The song has a message about speaking up one's mind...)

710
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,879
(and keeping one's conviction, )

711
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,180
(regardless of people's judgment and their nagging.)

712
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,619
Oh, yes. I love it.

713
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,318
The song suits them well.

714
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,490
It really does.

715
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,029
We have a key dance move for this performance.

716
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,829
This dance move represents us being thunderous.

717
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,929
So we're sensitive to sounds.

718
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,729
Then, we have a dance move that shows our determination...

719
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,069
to win. In this move, we move forward.

720
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,609
Lastly, we finish with a victorious move.

721
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,079
She's just like me when she explains the performance.

722
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,579
She's the carbon copy of you.

723
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,609
- She gave three points like you.
- Yes.

724
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,049
Not messing it up is our priority.

725
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,549
We can do this.

726
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,990
(Punching)

727
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,450
Let's get into our formation.

728
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,990
Coming up with a cool performance is the best.

729
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,829
But to top that,

730
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,129
we must put on a performance that makes us stand out.

731
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,430
So we might be able to win first place if we practice hard.

732
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,500
We'll crush it today.

733
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:25,240
- Very good, BEBE!
- Very good, BEBE!

734
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,139
(Are they finally...)

735
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,609
(going to start?)

736
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,649
- Let's go, Team BEBE!
- Go, Team BEBE!

737
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,119
- Let's go! You got this!
- Let's go!

738
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,689
(Everyone is looking forward...)

739
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,319
(to Team BEBE's performance of "Thunderous.")

740
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,559
I hope they do well.

741
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,130
It's okay even if you mess it up.

742
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,529
("Thunderous" by Stray Kids, choreo by Team BEBE)

743
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,308
(They're off to an intense start.)

744
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,049
Gosh, they're good.

745
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,089
I already know they're not going to mess this up.

746
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,390
- They're good.
- Gosh, their moves are so in sync.

747
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,259
(Impressed, nervously checking them out)

748
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,000
(Amazed)

749
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,180
From their performance, I definitely saw a style similar to BEBE's.

750
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,950
(Loving it)

751
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,819
Gosh, they definitely remind me of BEBE.

752
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,269
(Impressed)

753
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,710
(Smirking)

754
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,539
(Getting chills)

755
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,309
(Gosh)

756
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,980
- Gosh.
- She's good.

757
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,720
They're using the space so well. Their formations are good.

758
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,329
(They're doing great.)

759
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
(Cheering)

760
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,470
- That was so entertaining.
- That was insane.

761
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,249
(Make some noise!)

762
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,079
(Copying her babies' ending pose)

763
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,279
That was insane. They're so good.

764
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,588
But they really were good.

765
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,890
They were really good.

766
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,289
Amazingly, they seemed just like BEBE.

767
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,259
They gave off the same vibe as BEBE.

768
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,899
Even the way they went out with confidence was like us.

769
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,970
Seriously.

770
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:08,000
(Team BEBE's ending pose was brimming with confidence.)

771
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,410
(They're just like the real BEBE.)

772
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,139
- The last part.
- Their attitude and gestures.

773
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
That's right.

774
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,549
You didn't secretly help them, did you?

775
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,778
I've never seen this before, really. I don't even remember their faces.

776
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,249
(I don't even remember their faces.)

777
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,589
It's so high quality that it's hard to believe they did it on their own.

778
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,019
I think they'll get a good evaluation.

779
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,089
They're good. I knew this would happen.

780
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,999
(Time for Team BEBE's evaluation)

781
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,700
But they weren't perfectly coordinated, right?

782
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,839
(The dancers write their evaluations sincerely.)

783
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,170
Gosh. This is hard.

784
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,109
I think we did well.

785
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,109
We were confident since none of us made a mistake.

786
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,849
(What kind of evaluation will Team BEBE receive?)

787
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,588
Despite having a limited time to prepare,

788
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,890
I felt that I was watching a choreography preview video.

789
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,858
I believe that's how perfect your attention to detail...

790
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:05,160
and choreography was.

791
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,500
It was very impressive.

792
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

793
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,569
First of all, I really enjoyed your performance.

794
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,309
You mentioned that you expressed a "thunderous" sound...

795
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,809
and your sensitivity to it with your hands,

796
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,849
but I thought you could've put more energy into that part.

797
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,690
Instead, it felt like you did what you always did.

798
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,990
It didn't grab my attention any more than usual.

799
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,588
(Trying to gauge Bada's reaction)

800
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:37,629
I see.

801
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,829
- It was the best. Thank you.
- Thank you.

802
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,569
You just did well doing what you do well.

803
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:50,239
(The others are taken aback by the heavy competitiveness.)

804
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
It was a performance I expected to see.

805
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,008
You gave us a performance...

806
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:58,079
that we anticipated seeing from you.

807
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,078
I felt that was a bit regretful.

808
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,349
From my perspective, nothing seemed groundbreaking.

809
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,690
(Flinching)

810
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,088
(Shocked)

811
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:09,259
(Wary)

812
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:13,298
The kids are even scarier.

813
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,430
(The evaluations were more cutting than she expected.)

814
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,839
(Team BEBE unexpectedly received harsh criticism.)

815
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:22,338
They said our performance was too obvious.

816
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,980
This was a moment for us to show ourselves off,

817
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,579
so I think we needed to be obvious.

818
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,779
Why wouldn't we show off the things we're good at?

819
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,179
If a team with good energy ends up going last, it'll be worse.

820
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,250
- That would be more memorable.
- We should block that.

821
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,959
I think it'll be us. I have a feeling.

822
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,229
(We can't go after Team BEBE.)

823
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,729
Not me.

824
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,599
- Not yet.
- Right.

825
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,599
(Appealing to them)

826
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,969
(Pick us.)

827
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,139
Team BEBE will choose this team to go next.

828
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,609
(Which team will Team BEBE choose to go next?)

829
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,710
Won't they pick the team they think will do the worst?

830
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,109
- No, it'll be Team LACHICA.
- Team LACHICA.

831
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:03,709
Team LACHICA.

832
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,348
- I think it'll be LACHICA.
- Yes, oh, my gosh.

833
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,720
- It's going to be us.
- It's us.

834
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,119
Please, seniors.

835
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,589
(Who will Team BEBE pick to go next?)

836
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,618
We choose Team 1MILLION.

837
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,559
(Team BEBE chooses Team 1MILLION to go next.)

838
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,059
(Incredible)

839
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,130
Please do well.

840
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,598
Everyone's so relieved.

841
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,599
They're all going like this.

842
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,698
We choose Team 1MILLION.

843
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,699
(What a relief!)

844
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,940
(Surprised)

845
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,009
(The 3rd performance will be by Team 1MILLION.)

846
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,849
(Feeling regretful for some reason)

847
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,979
They chose Team 1MILLION? It's like they want to go head-to-head.

848
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,019
- I'm curious.
- I want to see them the most.

849
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:44,789
Let's go.

850
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,889
- I'm so curious about 1MILLION.
- Who's the leader of this team?

851
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,399
Yoon In Jung. I think she'll be the leader.

852
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,630
(Did Yoon In Jung become the leader as predicted?)

853
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,929
All right. Now that we're a team,

854
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,500
we have to pick a leader.

855
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,110
How should we pick one?

856
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,940
I want In Jung to be our leader.

857
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:09,109
I think she'd make a good leader.

858
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,010
I agree. I vote for In Jung.

859
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,280
(Everyone wants her to be leader, like they were waiting for this.)

860
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:18,149
Everyone's eyes are on me.

861
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,158
(The answer was already there. You can just be the leader now.)

862
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,460
- Then In Jung will be our leader.
- Okay.

863
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,389
That sounds great. Thank you.

864
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll work hard.

865
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,459
(The mood is the opposite when they're developing choreography.)

866
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,570
Is there anything anyone was thinking of?

867
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,038
Everyone in the group...

868
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,739
thinks quality is very important.

869
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,509
How can we bring out the highest quality performance...

870
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,808
in such a short time?

871
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,479
That was my biggest concern.

872
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,678
(Leader In Jung sought the most effective method.)

873
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,578
If we want to choreograph quickly, I think dancers of similar styles...

874
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,948
- should go together.
- Right.

875
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,549
It would take longer to mix dancing styles.

876
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,058
What do you think about mixing choreography...

877
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,888
and other genres?

878
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:55,929
(With In Jung at the center, they make progress quickly.)

879
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,829
So Min can come up with the tutting part.

880
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,698
Because In Jung has a lot of experience,

881
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,829
I think we're following her lead naturally.

882
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,598
(Dividing up the dance parts quickly)

883
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,268
(Coming up with chorus choreography with 3 dancers in a group)

884
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:08,269
This is good.

885
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,738
(Lee So Min is in charge of the intro tutting part.)

886
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,538
(This choreography factory is working hard.)

887
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,380
- Kind of like this?
- Yes, I like it.

888
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,079
- That's good!
- I'm nervous.

889
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,118
I believe our team is the best matched out of all teams.

890
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,658
So if we emphasize how clean our dancing is,

891
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,219
I think we'll win first place.

892
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,489
(What is the 1st performance by Team 1MILLION like?)

893
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,530
The song we chose to show off our performance...

894
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,669
is "Lupin" by KARA.

895
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,368
(High anticipation)

896
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,369
That's a famous song.

897
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,299
(The masters are surprised by the unexpected song choice.)

898
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,110
That's a really fierce song.

899
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:50,179
(It is a dance-pop song that has a fast beat and an addicting chorus.)

900
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,178
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

901
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,578
(Let's go for 1st place with "Lupin!")

902
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,289
They're experienced, so they don't seem nervous.

903
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:58,889
I'm looking forward to this.

904
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,328
They're all about synchronization, so if someone's even a little off,

905
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,159
- that's going to reflect poorly.
- That's right.

906
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,400
Especially since that's what we want to see.

907
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,059
Don't you think they'll do tutting?

908
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,500
- A tutting mistake will be obvious.
- Yes.

909
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,130
It would be so entertaining if they made a tutting mistake.

910
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,300
- Look.
- Seriously.

911
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,308
Overlap with Ha Neul's foot.

912
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:17,868
(Team 1MILLION feels the pressure of the others' expectations.)

913
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,079
I think they'll do well.

914
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,709
(Amid everyone's expectations and worries, )

915
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,079
(how will they perform?)

916
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,719
("Lupin" by KARA, choreo by Team 1MILLION)

917
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,219
(Hollering)

918
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,488
(Artistic tutting)

919
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,900
- Gosh.
- Gosh. They're so good.

920
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,210
(Shush)

921
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,209
(Moved)

922
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,409
That's it!

923
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,119
They're so perfectly in sync.

924
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,159
(Stumbling)

925
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,030
(Sim Ha Neul made a mistake in a technical part.)

926
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,400
(Losing her way)

927
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:19,339
(She was so taken aback that she keeps making more mistakes.)

928
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
She keeps making mistakes.

929
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:21,570
It's all right! Focus!

930
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:24,769
Let's go!

931
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,280
Gosh. This is good!

932
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,690
- Gosh, In Jung.
- In Jung.

933
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,230
In Jung's good.

934
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,099
That's nice.

935
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,510
(Team 1MILLION's performance ends.)

936
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,110
Nice.

937
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,710
- That's too bad.
- It's a shame.

938
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,079
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

939
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,518
(They console one another after the performance.)

940
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,690
It's all right.

941
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,460
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

942
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,860
Everyone got something wrong.

943
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,389
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

944
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,859
If I make a mistake like that, please console me too.

945
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,859
- Me too.
- That kind of mistake.

946
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,368
Before I'm able to do that, I'll probably make a mistake.

947
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,429
(I'll probably make a mistake.)

948
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,940
We might have to be the ones consoling you.

949
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:28,869
- But I thought it felt fresh.
- They did very well.

950
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,409
(What kind of evaluation will Team 1MILLION get?)

951
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,849
You used a lot of original elements.

952
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:39,678
Your expressions were great, as was your command of the stage.

953
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,889
On the other hand, your techniques...

954
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,820
could have been a strength for you,

955
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,019
but they seem to have caused you to overreach instead.

956
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,630
The technical mistake you made...

957
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,598
was very disruptive, so I felt that was a shame.

958
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,199
(They continue to get negative feedback for the mistake.)

959
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,309
In this case, the girl who made the technical mistake...

960
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,339
- Her face is becoming glum.
- It's because...

961
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,439
they did such a great job.

962
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,348
The only thing to criticize is the mistake.

963
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,480
- That's what I'm saying.
- Just that.

964
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,578
(What a shame.)

965
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,819
It was nice that each dancer's face...

966
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,419
was expressive enough to stand out.

967
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,859
The formation also lived up to the name, 1MILLION.

968
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,488
It was that cool.

969
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,099
I'd like to watch the performance again.

970
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,868
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

971
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,499
(The performance and evaluations are over.)

972
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,170
I feel bad seeing Ha Neul's head down.

973
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:40,440
I caused harm to the team by making a mistake.

974
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,709
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's all right.

975
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,679
You did well. It's all right.

976
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
It's okay.

977
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,779
It didn't make me feel regretful or anything...

978
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,049
because I could tell she wasn't giving up until the end.

979
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,289
I was so grateful.

980
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,888
They kept telling me that I did my best...

981
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,190
and that it was all that mattered.

982
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,699
I was so grateful.

983
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,928
We were all a little unstable...

984
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,170
in terms of memorizing the choreography.

985
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:10,069
I guess we made a few mistakes...

986
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,569
- because we were too excited...
- I know.

987
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,979
- to do well in front of you.
- We understand.

988
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,210
We understand.

989
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,709
- We understand.
- It's okay.

990
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,420
If you could sense that we had worked hard,

991
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,880
that's more than enough.

992
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,788
- How cool!
- Thank you.

993
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,219
How cool!

994
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,689
- She's cute.
- She's a good speaker too.

995
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,759
I don't care at all about the mistakes they made today.

996
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,189
- Right.
- First off,

997
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,170
I couldn't help but see if they had potential.

998
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,300
And they had great teamwork to begin with.

999
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,868
I might be able to make a lot of cool performances...

1000
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,268
- with them.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1001
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:44,510
- Absolutely.
- Exactly.

1002
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,009
(Which team will go after Team 1MILLION?)

1003
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,339
- When will we get to perform?
- I want us to go.

1004
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,780
- It might be us.
- I can't wait.

1005
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,249
I don't want us to go after Team 1MILLION.

1006
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,250
I know.

1007
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,348
- It might be Team MANNEQUEEN.
- Team MANNEQUEEN.

1008
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,949
They might choose Team HOOK.

1009
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,388
- Yes. What do you say?
- I'm good with it.

1010
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,389
Okay.

1011
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,018
We've made up our mind.

1012
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,058
(A moment of nervousness)

1013
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,059
Team 1MILLION has decided to choose...

1014
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,570
It might be us.

1015
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,729
(They're getting a feeling.)

1016
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,499
(Her lips are getting dry.)

1017
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,738
Not many teams remain.

1018
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,639
(She's super nervous too.)

1019
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,209
Team HOOK.

1020
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,480
(The fourth team to go is Team HOOK.)

1021
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,808
(The fourth team to go is Team HOOK.)

1022
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,549
Oh, goodness.

1023
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,550
Team HOOK.

1024
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,280
- HOOK.
- HOOK.

1025
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,518
(What must come has finally come.)

1026
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,788
There are only Team MANNEQUEEN...

1027
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:31,820
- and Team LACHICA left.
- I want my team to go soon.

1028
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,159
- Go for it!
- You can do it!

1029
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,829
They have this cool vibe already from the way they stand.

1030
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,559
Let's go, Chae Hyung.

1031
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:42,500
Let's go.

1032
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,000
- Little Wang.
- You can do it.

1033
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,829
She looks so much like Yeni Cho.

1034
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:48,400
(They have an unparalleled presence. How will they introduce themselves?)

1035
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,670
(Making cute noises)

1036
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:53,209
(Screaming)

1037
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,210
- HOOK.
- HOOK.

1038
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,380
(They can't believe what they've seen.)

1039
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,618
- HOOK.
- HOOK.

1040
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,380
(Their cheerful chant makes the girls laugh here and there.)

1041
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,050
How cool.

1042
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,789
That's new.

1043
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,459
(How cute.)

1044
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,519
They're cute.

1045
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,658
How distracting.

1046
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,489
(One chant was enough to drain the masters.)

1047
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,659
I can't wait. I love them.

1048
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,170
I wonder how they choreographed a K-pop song.

1049
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:18,269
I wonder what song they chose.

1050
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,769
It's probably something fun.

1051
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,238
- It might be an exciting song.
- Since it's Team HOOK...

1052
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,239
Right. An exciting song.

1053
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,209
- My guess is a hip-hop song.
- A funky song.

1054
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,269
"Growl" by EXO?

1055
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:27,739
- The school uniforms?
- Yes.

1056
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,109
("Growl," the epitome of a school-outfit concept?)

1057
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,449
I like their oversized outfits.

1058
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,019
- I can't wait.
- Same here.

1059
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,519
They make me curious. It's unimaginable.

1060
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,348
We've prepared to perform...

1061
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,718
Seo Taiji and Boys'...

1062
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,820
(Seo Taiji and Boys)

1063
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,189
Seo Taiji and Boys'...

1064
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,190
(Surprised)

1065
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,730
"Classroom Idea."

1066
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,799
("Classroom Idea" by Seo Taiji and Boys...)

1067
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,499
(represents students from that time...)

1068
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,569
(and supports them to live an independent life...)

1069
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,570
(away from the standardized educational system.)

1070
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,138
Seo Taiji and Boys' "Classroom Idea."

1071
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:57,510
(Surprised)

1072
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:59,139
That's crazy.

1073
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,309
What a surprise.

1074
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,408
- How do they know this song?
- That's bold.

1075
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,250
I don't really know it myself either.

1076
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,519
It's an old K-pop song.

1077
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,219
It's pretty cool.

1078
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,218
"Classroom Idea" represents...

1079
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:14,518
the troubles and struggles...

1080
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,860
that teenagers go through.

1081
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,158
We'd like to express it with our own color, concept,

1082
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,328
and image freely. So we're in school outfits.

1083
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,999
(I see.)

1084
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,769
Like delinquents.

1085
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,710
With our ties all loose.

1086
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,379
And with a beanie on like this.

1087
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
- Their outfits look cool.
- Yes, it's cute.

1088
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,179
That's the concept we've prepared.

1089
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,619
Should we choreograph the song all together?

1090
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,280
How about standing in a line...

1091
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,718
and doing this?

1092
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,889
Or we could look at a sheet of paper and show disappointment.

1093
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,529
(After some starting moves, )

1094
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,159
(stepping forward as they tear the paper into pieces)

1095
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,030
(What a crazy idea by the youngest.)

1096
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,900
The youngest is the best!

1097
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,230
I think I'm so smart.

1098
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,939
Joo Bin and I will work together.

1099
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,109
You guys are together.

1100
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,709
And the two of you discuss together...

1101
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,869
- Let's go.
- the locking and waacking moves.

1102
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,948
To live up to our name, Team HOOK,

1103
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:12,408
we'd like to make it humorous and witty...

1104
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,649
and express our own street mood...

1105
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,449
in an awesome way.

1106
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,189
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

1107
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,989
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1108
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,360
Student Seo Chae Hyung.

1109
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
What is that?

1110
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,928
What is it?

1111
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,268
- Student Lee Ga Hyun.
- Yes.

1112
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:32,469
(Yeon Ju hands out mysterious sheets of paper to the members.)

1113
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,840
(What is the paper they prepared for?)

1114
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,539
Gosh, she got a zero.

1115
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,268
- Gosh. They prepared props too.
- Props.

1116
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,109
They prepared props.

1117
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,380
They're really like HOOK.

1118
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,578
It looks like a test that got a zero.

1119
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,808
That really feels like HOOK.

1120
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,250
Right.

1121
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,589
I'm excited to see them.

1122
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,218
I like their style already.

1123
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:54,819
I think it's very important that they show their style.

1124
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,590
And I like the concept.

1125
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,559
- Oh, my gosh.
- That startled me.

1126
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,229
(Team HOOK's placard suddenly breaks down.)

1127
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,400
Oh, my gosh.

1128
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:04,928
(What is going on?)

1129
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,369
Oh, mother.

1130
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:08,868
Why does it have to be ours that breaks down?

1131
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,369
What kind of signal is this?

1132
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,739
Hold on. I'm feeling anxious.

1133
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,739
Your team's placard and my team's decoration broke down.

1134
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,679
I'm having a bad feeling.

1135
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
It feels ominous.

1136
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Let's get it.

1137
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,379
Go for it.

1138
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,150
(Everyone's excited.)

1139
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,989
We're going to beat them all and place first.

1140
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,730
I thought we had a chance to place first.

1141
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,000
(How will Team HOOK's K-pop performance turn out?)

1142
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,468
(They've prepared some acting too.)

1143
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:38,598
- They're acting.
- They should be.

1144
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:39,769
They should be acting.

1145
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,808
(Team HOOK is troubled to see their poor grades.)

1146
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,570
(Empathizing and laughing)

1147
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,439
- Oh, she got a zero.
- Her mom's going to scold her.

1148
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,579
I know how that feels.

1149
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,280
("Classroom Idea" by Seo Taiji and Boys, choreo by Team HOOK)

1150
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,289
(Amazed)

1151
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,190
(Intense)

1152
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,559
Let's go!

1153
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,559
(They're rocking it.)

1154
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:10,499
(Aiki is surprised too.)

1155
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,769
(Surprised)

1156
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,369
There they go.

1157
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
They've got to tear the paper apart.

1158
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:16,869
That's right.

1159
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,340
(Applauding)

1160
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,880
(Throwing the report cards)

1161
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,579
It's real hip-hop.

1162
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,550
(Immersed)

1163
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,920
What on earth?

1164
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,400
(Chae Hyung seems to have some kind of problem.)

1165
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,869
I thought, "What are they doing?"

1166
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,039
(Aiki senses a strange air and starts to feel anxious.)

1167
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,039
Please.

1168
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:56,039
I didn't know what to do and looked to the side.

1169
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,380
The others were looking at me with the same expression.

1170
00:47:58,849 --> 00:47:59,980
Then I knew we were doomed.

1171
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,250
(Screaming)

1172
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,820
What are they doing?

1173
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:04,449
(The masters burst out laughing to see their cute mistake.)

1174
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,119
- What are they doing?
- They made a mistake.

1175
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,420
They can't remember the moves.

1176
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:10,558
(An intense scream fills the studio.)

1177
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,189
(Cracking up)

1178
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,198
Yes!

1179
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,769
Let's go!

1180
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,098
- Yes!
- Let's go.

1181
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,239
I didn't know what to do. I wondered if we should improvise.

1182
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,209
Their faces were making it obvious that they had made a mistake.

1183
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,468
And they screamed too.

1184
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,940
It wasn't a pleasant sight.

1185
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,110
(Chae Hyung stops dancing.)

1186
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,448
- Oh, no.
- Keep going.

1187
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,848
- You must keep going.
- What are you doing?

1188
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,219
Pull yourselves together!

1189
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,789
Hey, darn it.

1190
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,429
Chae Hyung is losing her mind.

1191
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,530
Let's go.

1192
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,359
(They barely get back on track.)

1193
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Go!

1194
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,599
Let's go.

1195
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:51,599
(Messing up)

1196
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:52,829
Go!

1197
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,039
Oh, no.

1198
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,868
(Team HOOK belatedly continues with the performance.)

1199
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:00,209
- Okay! We're almost there!
- Nice.

1200
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,639
- There you go.
- Yes!

1201
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,550
(Cute)

1202
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,250
(She's cute.)

1203
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,519
(The DJ appears.)

1204
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:15,889
Cool.

1205
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,159
I like that.

1206
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,670
Nice.

1207
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:26,499
Great.

1208
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,769
(Showing off some popping moves to make up for the mistake)

1209
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:32,739
(There they go!)

1210
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Okay.

1211
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Okay!

1212
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:39,110
(Their troublesome performance comes to an end.)

1213
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,949
(She's a little late until the end.)

1214
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:43,849
Gosh.

1215
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,320
(Standing up)

1216
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,960
(Dashing to the screen with a bottle in her hand)

1217
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,959
(Cracking up)

1218
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,328
- You girls...
- It's okay.

1219
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,558
- They did well.
- Goodness.

1220
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,030
- They did a good job. Sit down.
- Gosh.

1221
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,400
(Team HOOK's placard broke down earlier.)

1222
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,900
That feels like bad luck.

1223
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,739
It feels like bad luck.

1224
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,569
- Look.
- Wait a second.

1225
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,639
- They had a strong concept.
- It's okay.

1226
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:09,379
We could definitely see that they could think outside the box.

1227
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,479
They expressed it well.

1228
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,650
This was the main move.

1229
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,249
(They quickly and easily copy Team HOOK's main dance move.)

1230
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,320
- Okay - You got it.

1231
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,389
I'm sure you'll all agree,

1232
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,118
but when they first started,

1233
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,519
I thought it was okay up to the 2nd and 8th beats.

1234
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,828
- Okay - Okay.

1235
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:26,058
After the 2nd and 8th beats, she started saying,

1236
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,559
- "Please." - Right.

1237
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:28,760
(They safely get through the opening.)

1238
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,869
(Please.)

1239
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:35,569
Okay, next.

1240
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,039
Okay. What?

1241
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,669
(What did I just see?)

1242
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,510
- That's how my face changed.
- That's hilarious.

1243
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,739
Team HOOK sure is different.

1244
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,308
When they first walked out,

1245
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,380
I thought they would totally kill the stage.

1246
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,150
They just got killed.

1247
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,050
I liked the DJ thing.

1248
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,689
- Right.
- Me too.

1249
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,820
- I mean, - This thing.

1250
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,260
you must've been so shocked that that's the only thing you remember.

1251
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,360
(She shouldn't be laughing, but it's so funny.)

1252
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,460
They were so funny.

1253
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,928
That was too short.

1254
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:05,500
What are we supposed to evaluate?

1255
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,769
There's nothing to evaluate.

1256
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,639
They didn't dance at all.

1257
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,170
What was that?

1258
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,179
I'm flustered. Wait a second.

1259
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,909
I can totally predict the feedback.

1260
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,210
We didn't show them much of our dancing.

1261
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,320
(Grabbing the microphone)

1262
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:23,250
(The schoolmates have a hard time looking at each other.)

1263
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,650
They're evaluating each other.

1264
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,860
Let's be honest.

1265
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:28,789
First of all,

1266
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,159
(Swallowing hard)

1267
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:31,860
I loved the concept.

1268
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,859
You created an opening...

1269
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,428
that fit the concept.

1270
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,500
So the opening drew me in.

1271
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:38,800
However,

1272
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,510
there were members that didn't know the moves.

1273
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,739
It looked like that infected the others.

1274
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,879
(Aiki droops her head at the accurate feedback.)

1275
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,779
I know what she means when she says the mistakes were infectious.

1276
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,908
I saw it...

1277
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:52,909
(Witnessing the infection spreading in real-time)

1278
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,150
spread.

1279
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,690
I think I saw one person almost giving up.

1280
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,960
(Ga Young accurately saw the moment that they were frazzled.)

1281
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,000
If your face hadn't changed,

1282
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,359
it would've gone better.

1283
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,868
It could've been better. Well done.

1284
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:12,030
Honestly,

1285
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:17,170
you didn't fully show us the performance you prepared.

1286
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,880
(So I have nothing to say about the flaws.)

1287
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,509
So I have nothing to say about the flaws.

1288
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,909
(That's harsh.)

1289
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,710
That's the flaw.

1290
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,718
(Feeling bitter)

1291
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:29,988
(The masters are surprised by the harsh feedback.)

1292
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:31,989
(Gasping)

1293
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,718
Those that get criticized in the beginning...

1294
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,189
end up doing well later.

1295
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,359
That's right. It happens.

1296
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,460
But they're getting too much criticism.

1297
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,130
You're right.

1298
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,468
Is it okay to get this much criticism?

1299
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,769
It's fine.

1300
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,269
I'm sure we're next.

1301
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,368
(Team MANNEQUEEN and Team LACHICA warm up.)

1302
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,610
- Should we get ready?
- It's us.

1303
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,639
Who could it be? Is it Team LACHICA or Team MANNEQUEEN?

1304
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:55,780
I'm not sure.

1305
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,679
The team we chose...

1306
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,079
(Who is the fifth team to perform in the K-pop Choreography Mission?)

1307
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,989
is Team LACHICA.

1308
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,989
Is Team LACHICA.

1309
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,788
Thank you.

1310
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,389
(Come on, Team LACHICA.)

1311
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:12,289
I knew it. HOOK would go with LACHICA.

1312
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:14,899
HOOK would go with LACHICA.

1313
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,198
We're rivals forever.

1314
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,929
- We're rivals forever.
- Right, rivals forever.

1315
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,299
I feel weird...

1316
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,000
hearing those young girls say,

1317
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:25,969
"We're Team BEBE." Doesn't that feel weird?

1318
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,280
- You're right.
- It feels so weird.

1319
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,380
- Hello, we're Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

1320
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,750
(She smiles like a proud mom.)

1321
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,920
(The leader of JAM REPUBLIC?)

1322
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,789
(Smiling)

1323
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:40,420
(We, Team 1MILLION...)

1324
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:42,689
(The corners of her mouth turn up.)

1325
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,429
1MILLION did something that fit 1MILLION.

1326
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,900
- It feels weird, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1327
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:48,729
To hear them call themselves 1MILLION.

1328
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,269
It's like they're our babies.

1329
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,899
When they said, "Team HOOK," I almost walked out there.

1330
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,900
- I know.
- Right.

1331
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:54,139
- Me too.
- I started standing up.

1332
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,038
It's interesting...

1333
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,269
- to have them use our names.
- That's right.

1334
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,339
- Two, three. LACHICA.
- LACHICA.

1335
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,709
- Brush, gargle, - Brush, gargle,

1336
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,779
- and spit it out.
- and spit it out.

1337
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,149
We're Team LACHICA.

1338
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,348
You're so cute.

1339
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:09,479
(Addicted)

1340
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,888
(They want to keep saying the magical chant.)

1341
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,118
That's cute.

1342
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,218
How are they so cute? Hyun Seo is cute.

1343
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,860
(Even their matching hair and outfits are cute.)

1344
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:19,429
Are they all very young?

1345
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,529
They're all young. One was born in 2008.

1346
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,598
They look like middle school students.

1347
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,329
I heard they had 4 members that were born in 2007.

1348
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,098
- I wonder what they prepared.
- I think it'll be cute.

1349
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,699
Don't you think it could be something like "TT?"

1350
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,169
- They're wearing matching outfits.
- Yes, and their hair too.

1351
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,969
- It's cute.
- Yes, they're cute.

1352
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,739
I think they'll do something full of energy.

1353
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,610
- Maybe something by SEVENTEEN?
- Right.

1354
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,779
I thought it might be "Super" because of their hair.

1355
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,519
- I thought that.
- I see.

1356
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,750
I don't think it will be a girl group's song.

1357
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,348
- Because of their outfits.
- Right.

1358
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,389
(What song did Team LACHICA choose?)

1359
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,759
The song we chose for today...

1360
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,659
is "Oh!" by Girls' Generation.

1361
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:52,888
("Oh!" is a cute and honest love confession.)

1362
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,900
(It has a light and energetic melody.)

1363
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,229
We chose this song...

1364
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,368
to charm everyone here...

1365
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:01,098
in front of us,

1366
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,799
along with the older guys and girls watching.

1367
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,439
- "To charm everyone." - "To charm everyone."

1368
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,440
That's so cute.

1369
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,980
(Even the mean girl's heart melts at the comment.)

1370
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,209
You're right.

1371
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,409
- It's "Oh!" by Girls' Generation.
- "Oh!"

1372
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,009
("Oh!" by Girls' Generation?)

1373
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,118
(Laughing)

1374
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,320
How do you feel, master?

1375
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:17,288
How do you feel?

1376
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,388
(The master of Team LACHICA is surprised by the unexpected choice.)

1377
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:20,260
I hate what I said earlier.

1378
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,618
I said I thought it'd be a boy group's song...

1379
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,659
like "Super."

1380
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,229
(I thought it might be "Super...")

1381
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,488
(because of their hair.)

1382
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,360
I don't think it will be a girl group's song.

1383
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,900
(Did I not read them right?)

1384
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,570
(They prepare for the performance by relieving their nerves.)

1385
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,098
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1386
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,099
(Let's go, Team LACHICA.)

1387
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,968
Let's go!

1388
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,269
(They cheer for them with expectations.)

1389
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:42,739
Let's do a good job. Please do a good job.

1390
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,919
I was determined to do well,

1391
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,289
so the others wouldn't look down on us.

1392
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,619
("Oh!" by Girls' Generation, choreo by Team LACHICA)

1393
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,059
(Here comes the youngest.)

1394
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,698
(The youngest is cute.)

1395
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,030
She's cute.

1396
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,038
What's that? She's cute.

1397
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,340
That's right.

1398
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,369
(She takes over the stage as she shows off her charm.)

1399
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,489
(Look at her face.)

1400
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,829
(My heart is fluttering)

1401
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,869
She's so cute.

1402
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,650
Let's go!

1403
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,259
(Don't smile)

1404
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,288
(She loves it.)

1405
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,329
(Don't make fun of me)

1406
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,429
(Chaotic)

1407
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:11,099
(Glancing over)

1408
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:13,229
- She got it wrong.
- It's okay.

1409
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,900
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1410
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,010
- Do more.
- Keep going.

1411
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,739
I told you this happened.

1412
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,210
(However, )

1413
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:26,280
(they keep making mistakes until the end.)

1414
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,250
(Frustrated)

1415
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:34,619
Okay.

1416
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:36,389
They did a good job. It was cute.

1417
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,359
Nice, they made as many mistakes as our team did.

1418
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,499
(Laughing)

1419
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,558
(She can't deny it.)

1420
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,899
Okay.

1421
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,229
(The forever rival doesn't make mistakes alone.)

1422
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,828
(Suddenly excited)

1423
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,599
- Didn't we do a bit better? No?
- You think so?

1424
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,408
I admit it.

1425
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:51,440
(Right. At least your team danced.)

1426
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:55,139
I was disappointed in myself.

1427
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,880
I thought I was too proud earlier.

1428
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,579
Don't cry.

1429
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,050
No one should cry.

1430
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,849
I feel so disappointed.

1431
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,550
I wanted to do better.

1432
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,118
It felt like a talent show.

1433
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,090
Yes, like one at a private academy.

1434
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,929
No, like at a middle school.

1435
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,230
There weren't any moves that caught my eye.

1436
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:18,098
They were dancing, but I couldn't see the moves.

1437
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,169
- I saw no quality either.
- No.

1438
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,839
I think they just felt too eager...

1439
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,239
to show us a lot.

1440
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,110
(Team LACHICA calmly waits for the other teams' evaluation.)

1441
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,409
(Team HOOK is waiting for the right time to give feedback.)

1442
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,509
(Glancing at the others)

1443
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,919
(Now is the time!)

1444
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,349
All right.

1445
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,549
(What is she going to say?)

1446
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,949
Don't say anything.

1447
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,360
Do you think you're in the place to say anything?

1448
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,158
(She is laughing but feels sad on the inside.)

1449
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,130
Her voice is smaller now.

1450
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,000
First of all, you were very cute.

1451
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:53,670
And...

1452
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,269
we have nothing to say.

1453
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,309
We're in no position to say anything.

1454
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,880
While we were watching,

1455
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,880
we felt sad.

1456
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:07,650
(Team HOOK felt sad for them as they watched.)

1457
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,749
I know how hard you worked to put this performance together...

1458
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,050
since we did the same.

1459
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,919
They didn't make mistakes...

1460
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,759
- when dancing in their genre.
- You're right.

1461
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,499
- Right.
- But when they changed genres,

1462
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,828
- they made mistakes.
- They've never done this...

1463
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:24,968
- in such a short time.
- Right.

1464
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:26,768
And they moved around too much.

1465
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:28,170
- You're right.
- Right?

1466
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,538
I believe that also...

1467
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:33,369
added to the confusion.

1468
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,408
I liked how they were witty...

1469
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:38,750
in trying to show us a better performance.

1470
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,179
But should I say that nothing stood out?

1471
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,449
- That was disappointing.
- The performance?

1472
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,789
Yes, the whole performance.

1473
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:48,288
(Now there is...)

1474
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,619
(only one team left.)

1475
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:51,189
(It'd be so entertaining if they got it wrong.)

1476
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,190
(They must not feel confident.)

1477
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,288
(It felt like a talent show.)

1478
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,900
(At a middle school)

1479
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,098
The quality of the performance...

1480
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:59,300
got worse toward the end.

1481
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,239
(Nothing seemed groundbreaking.)

1482
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,170
(You didn't fully show us the performance you prepared.)

1483
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,510
(So I have nothing to say about the flaws.)

1484
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:10,409
(There was nothing to leave out from her harsh criticisms.)

1485
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,780
(Gasping)

1486
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:20,050
(Her spicy feedback even made the masters walk on eggshells.)

1487
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:25,889
(Many victims had their feelings hurt.)

1488
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,800
(This team brought the attention of the five other teams on themselves.)

1489
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:34,339
(The last performance of the K-pop Choreography Mission)

1490
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,469
- It's us.
- Okay.

1491
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,609
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1492
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,739
- Let's see it.
- Gosh.

1493
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,579
- What's that?
- That's insane.

1494
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,348
(Fierce look in her eyes)

1495
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,519
Their outfits show their determination.

1496
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,679
They were wearing leather.

1497
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,389
I could see they were determined.

1498
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,718
When did they prepare their outfits?

1499
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,090
I don't know. When did they?

1500
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,189
- Even the yellow prop.
- They really look like MANNEQUEEN.

1501
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,260
They came prepared. They even braided their hair.

1502
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,429
Since we're the queens.

1503
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:07,269
The outfit has to be perfect.

1504
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,709
Two, three.

1505
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,909
- Queen of queens, top of tops.
- Queen of queens, top of tops.

1506
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,849
- Hello, we're Team LACHICA.
- Hello, we're Team MANNEQUEEN.

1507
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:23,279
We're Team LACHICA.

1508
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,389
(What?)

1509
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,949
No, I'm sorry.

1510
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,388
(Who said "LACHICA?")

1511
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,989
I'm sorry. We'll do that again.

1512
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,090
Oh, my gosh.

1513
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,860
"LACHICA?"

1514
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,499
(She said "LACHICA!")

1515
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,500
She said she's Team LACHICA.

1516
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:37,529
(Dumbfounded)

1517
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,530
Gosh.

1518
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:39,569
Two, three.

1519
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,639
- Queen of queens.
- Top of tops.

1520
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:45,340
- Hello, we're Team MANNEQUEEN.
- Hello, we're Team MANNEQUEEN.

1521
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,479
(They struggle to greet everyone onstage.)

1522
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,539
You said, "LACHICA." That's funny.

1523
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:51,550
- They're cute.
- They're cute.

1524
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,050
The song we chose...

1525
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,249
is "BOOMERANG" by Wanna One.

1526
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,349
"BOOMERANG."

1527
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,888
"BOOMERANG."

1528
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:01,759
(Team MANNEQUEEN is doing "BOOMERANG?")

1529
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,820
I didn't see that coming.

1530
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,130
(Everyone is surprised by Team MANNEQUEEN's song choice.)

1531
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,598
("BOOMERANG" by Wanna One is an electro trap song...)

1532
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,659
(with a strong synth beat that describes love as a boomerang.)

1533
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:12,269
Since the title of the song is "BOOMERANG,"

1534
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:13,869
there are a few strong points...

1535
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:16,539
that will remind you of a boomerang in our performance.

1536
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:18,639
You can watch and find out...

1537
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,738
how we expressed it in certain moves.

1538
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:23,439
Hip-hop and waacking...

1539
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,280
are two very different genres.

1540
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,179
So it may be difficult for you to imagine them coming together,

1541
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,590
but you will find out how we do it by watching us.

1542
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Good luck.

1543
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,618
I can't wait to see this.

1544
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:37,389
It's 3 styles in 1? I'm looking forward to it.

1545
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,460
- How do you feel?
- I'm so nervous.

1546
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,130
- Nervous?
- Nervous.

1547
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,429
(Even the master is nervous before their first performance.)

1548
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Don't get nervous.

1549
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:46,529
- The first formation.
- Okay.

1550
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,839
(What kind of performance will Team MANNEQUEEN show us?)

1551
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,900
Don't show your face at first.

1552
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:52,309
I'm so excited to see this. I think they'll be good.

1553
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,739
It's a team of hip-hop and waacking dancers.

1554
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,449
So I was curious to see if they could create a nice balance.

1555
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,820
(Nervous)

1556
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:02,050
My hands are sweating.

1557
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,789
I feel like they won't make a mistake.

1558
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,019
(We'll see.)

1559
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,630
(Let's see how they do.)

1560
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,558
(Team MANNEQUEEN is even perfect in the way they look.)

1561
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,328
(Will they also be able to put on a perfect performance?)

1562
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:19,800
We'll show you how good we are.

1563
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:23,099
(Nervous)

1564
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:27,780
("BOOMERANG" by Wanna One, choreo by Team MANNEQUEEN)

1565
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,289
(This is nice.)

1566
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,119
(Nice!)

1567
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,619
(There you go!)

1568
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,000
Gosh. How are they so good?

1569
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:57,368
(Waacking in the middle...)

1570
01:03:57,369 --> 01:03:59,369
(and dancing hip-hop on the floor!)

1571
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,039
(Surprised)

1572
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:12,119
That's sexy.

1573
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,590
(Team MANNEQUEEN even added techniques to their performance!)

1574
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:20,800
(Gasping)

1575
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,030
Na Ra.

1576
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,198
- I can clearly see their concept.
- Right.

1577
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:25,400
- It stands out.
- Yes.

1578
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,769
(Focused)

1579
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,309
(Showing off techniques)

1580
01:04:33,409 --> 01:04:34,909
(They all cheer for them.)

1581
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,949
They were going to use the bandana.

1582
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,189
(A perfect ending for the queen of queens.)

1583
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,889
- Okay.
- "We're the queen" at the end.

1584
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,400
I don't care about the boomerang. I'm the queen.

1585
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,800
- I'm the queen.
- So I'm the queen.

1586
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,800
You all do something else since I'm going to do this.

1587
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,308
- That was good.
- They did things like dominoes.

1588
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:05,940
Yes, they were good.

1589
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,210
- You think so? It seemed messy.
- Yes, I was surprised.

1590
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:11,079
You're greedy.

1591
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:13,249
(Funky Y is greedy.)

1592
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,979
- They're good.
- What more do you want?

1593
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,750
(They did well. What more do you want?)

1594
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,249
They said they did a good job of bringing hip-hop...

1595
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,759
- and waacking together.
- Right.

1596
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,689
So I was looking forward to it but was a bit disappointed.

1597
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,460
(The dancers discuss and evaluate the performance thoroughly.)

1598
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:30,428
(What kind of evaluation will Team MANNEQUEEN receive?)

1599
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:33,099
The flaw I saw...

1600
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,439
The flaw...

1601
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,698
(Flaw?)

1602
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,809
It starts with the beat and "Boomerang."

1603
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,780
So I thought you'd grab our attention,

1604
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:48,650
but I was sad not to see any moves that stood out.

1605
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,988
You said the focus...

1606
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:55,119
was the harmony of two genres,

1607
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:57,260
but they seemed to moving separately.

1608
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,489
(Move separately?)

1609
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,599
(Feeling uncomfortable)

1610
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,869
I thought I might be watching from too up close...

1611
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,299
and fixed my position,

1612
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,610
but I still didn't know where to watch.

1613
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,210
I like the feedback we received.

1614
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:15,840
It motivates me.

1615
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,848
It was a bit less than I'd expected.

1616
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:22,780
- A bit?
- Yes, a little bit.

1617
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,218
A tiny bit.

1618
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:26,519
A teeny tiny bit.

1619
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,689
Yes, like fine dust.

1620
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,690
Yes, like fine dust.

1621
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:30,730
(She thought it was missing a tiny bit of something.)

1622
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:31,989
(Fine dust alert)

1623
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,860
- What?
- "Fine dust."

1624
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,029
(Laughing)

1625
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,869
Isn't that Aiki? Is Aiki sitting over there?

1626
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,738
She's just like you.

1627
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:43,698
I've never seen anyone like her.

1628
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,739
(A spitting image of Aiki)

1629
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,078
(After the performances are over, they start ranking them.)

1630
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,280
Which team stood out the most?

1631
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,948
Team BEBE...

1632
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,149
showed us exactly what we expected.

1633
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,949
- Right. Team BEBE.
- I vote for Team BEBE.

1634
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,218
- What?
- Yes.

1635
01:06:58,219 --> 01:06:59,320
(They share favorable reviews of Team BEBE's performance.)

1636
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,319
- Were we very good?
- Yes.

1637
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,630
Were we much better than the others?

1638
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,629
All right, then...

1639
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,059
You know we're the only team talking to the camera, right?

1640
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,230
I think...

1641
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,868
I think Team HOOK showed us...

1642
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,969
something that was memorable.

1643
01:07:16,769 --> 01:07:19,069
- What are you doing?
- What is with your hair?

1644
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,908
(Mentality restored)

1645
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:24,679
They seem to have reached the state of nirvana, and it's hilarious.

1646
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,179
Their hair is all tangled.

1647
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,480
We're so sorry, Master Aiki.

1648
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:30,789
We love you.

1649
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,349
(You scared me.)

1650
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,750
They know how to do a show.

1651
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,359
We thought we'd win first place when we were in the green room.

1652
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,960
(Laughing)

1653
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:41,159
For the next first mission,

1654
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,300
we will do our very best without sleeping a single minute.

1655
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,570
They must've slept a lot.

1656
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:49,869
Did you sleep well?

1657
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:51,239
Did you even have dreams?

1658
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:52,968
(She asked, "Did they even have dreams?")

1659
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,480
Who do you think will win first place?

1660
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:56,010
First place?

1661
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,679
I think Team BEBE.

1662
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,579
I think Team 1MILLION.

1663
01:07:59,949 --> 01:08:01,649
- Team 1MILLION...
- Yes, they were good too.

1664
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,650
and Team BEBE were clean.

1665
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:07,090
But we made a mistake,

1666
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,719
so I think more people will vote for Team BEBE.

1667
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,530
I saw Team BEBE make mistakes toward the end.

1668
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:13,829
But that didn't show.

1669
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,999
That was such a tiny mistake.

1670
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,129
(She has a lot to say but is holding back.)

1671
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,369
Oh, my gosh.

1672
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,069
My team made so many mistakes that you can't even evaluate them.

1673
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:27,579
We really messed up.

1674
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:31,180
I will announce the ranking.

1675
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:34,550
- Right away?
- Please don't.

1676
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:36,779
Oh, gosh.

1677
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:40,649
I will start with the team in sixth place.

1678
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,960
- My gosh.
- This is cruel.

1679
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,189
We won't be the first to be mentioned, will we?

1680
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:47,698
In sixth place...

1681
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:49,429
We made mistakes...

1682
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,369
and didn't get the details right.

1683
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,100
It's not that we weren't well-prepared...

1684
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:56,539
not to perform well.

1685
01:08:58,609 --> 01:08:59,669
I didn't know what to do.

1686
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,979
(Chae Hyung feels more disappointed because they worked so hard.)

1687
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:02,309
In sixth place...

1688
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,809
(Which team placed last for the internal evaluation?)

1689
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,380
is Team...

1690
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,119
(is Team...)

1691
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,819
(is Team...)

1692
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:14,720
(Which team ranked the lowest and surprised everyone?)

1693
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,359
is Team LACHICA.

1694
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,359
Team LACHICA.

1695
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,299
(Gabee is at a loss for words.)

1696
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,630
(Aiki feels mixed emotions, although her team isn't last.)

1697
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,430
(The dancers of Team LACHICA calmly accept the result.)

1698
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:31,470
We made many mistakes and didn't show you what we prepared.

1699
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,140
I felt sad about that.

1700
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:38,050
I couldn't be happy about it. I was frazzled.

1701
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:41,118
Although we're in sixth place,

1702
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:44,079
we have nowhere to go but up from here.

1703
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,220
We'll be back with a better performance...

1704
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,118
for the next mission. Thank you.

1705
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,158
- You were amazing!
- You're the best!

1706
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,500
I think I realized something.

1707
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,199
No one is good from the start.

1708
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,999
It was a mission...

1709
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,898
that gave us a chance, not poison.

1710
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,269
(Team LACHICA will keep moving forward, taking this opportunity.)

1711
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,269
Fifth place goes to Team...

1712
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,270
(The ranking for internal evaluation continues to be announced.)

1713
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:08,380
HOOK.

1714
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:11,509
(We chant when we're sad.)

1715
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,510
- HOOK.
- HOOK.

1716
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,318
(HOOK)

1717
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:15,319
(Laughing)

1718
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,449
It's unsettling.

1719
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,489
It's unsettling.

1720
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,188
Fourth place goes to Team MANNEQUEEN.

1721
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,890
(Team MANNEQUEEN is 4th place for the internal evaluation.)

1722
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:23,989
Team MANNEQUEEN.

1723
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,929
(It's not bad!)

1724
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,158
Well done.

1725
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:29,130
(Cute little MANNEQUEEN)

1726
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:32,469
The 3rd place goes to Team 1MILLION.

1727
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,868
(Team 1MILLION is in 3rd place for the internal evaluation.)

1728
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:34,869
Team 1MILLION.

1729
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,539
(The result is unexpected.)

1730
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:37,739
Team 1MILLION.

1731
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:41,139
(She feels uncomfortable for some reason.)

1732
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,679
Why is the ranking the same as Street Woman Fighter 2?

1733
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,050
What's this? Why is it like this?

1734
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,050
It's annoying.

1735
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:51,149
The 1st and 2nd places aren't announced yet.

1736
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,019
Let me announce the first place.

1737
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,189
(Is it Team BEBE that is in perfect sync?)

1738
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:57,260
It's Team JAM REPUBLIC and us.

1739
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,828
(Is it Team JAM REPUBLIC with fancy techniques?)

1740
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:01,459
Let me announce first place.

1741
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,460
(The masters are holding hands tightly.)

1742
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:03,529
(Holding hands)

1743
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,569
It's like Street Woman Fighter 2.

1744
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:07,600
It's the same, isn't it?

1745
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,169
(It's a battle between the teams that were in the top 2...)

1746
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,770
(in Street Woman Fighter 2 again!)

1747
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,538
They were so in sync.

1748
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:19,749
The quality of the choreography was great and they had various elements.

1749
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,279
I really liked it.

1750
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,488
I loved Team JAM REPUBLIC's performance.

1751
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:27,188
There were many creative parts,

1752
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:29,319
which was very impressive.

1753
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,289
First place...

1754
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,528
(Which team is in 1st place for the internal evaluation?)

1755
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,659
What do I do?

1756
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:39,229
goes to Team...

1757
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,770
BEBE.

1758
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:42,770
(Team BEBE is in 1st place for the internal evaluation.)

1759
01:11:43,069 --> 01:11:44,339
(Exclaiming)

1760
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,909
You guys are in first place.

1761
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,908
(Team BEBE is in 1st place for the internal evaluation.)

1762
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:51,680
(Team JAM REPUBLIC is in 2nd place for the internal evaluation.)

1763
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:53,908
Thank you.

1764
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,019
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1765
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,148
I totally agree with this.

1766
01:11:57,149 --> 01:11:59,549
- Congratulations.
- I totally agree.

1767
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,520
I'm so happy.

1768
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:06,259
I want to thank the members for their hard work.

1769
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,800
The other teams...

1770
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,569
also must've been very busy and tired,

1771
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,568
so I'd like to thank them for their hard work.

1772
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:17,568
Let's cheer up more.

1773
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:19,069
You worked hard. Thank you.

1774
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,408
(The Internal Evaluation Mission is finished with their applause.)

1775
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:25,850
What's the benefit? That's what's important now.

1776
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,618
The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places...

1777
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:29,879
They might be able to pick a team to have a match with.

1778
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,520
- We've done it, right?
- Yes.

1779
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,890
For the Battle Performance Mission.

1780
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,960
(Oh, I remember that one!)

1781
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,719
The team in first place...

1782
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,528
is given a benefit for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

1783
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:41,358
They can pick an artist to work with...

1784
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:43,060
and their opponent first.

1785
01:12:44,329 --> 01:12:46,429
(That's amazing.)

1786
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,500
They can choose both?

1787
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,099
That's big.

1788
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,399
It's nice.

1789
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,039
(I'm happy that we're in 1st place.)

1790
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,639
The top three finishers for the K-pop Choreography Mission...

1791
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,879
can pick an artist...

1792
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,679
and an opponent.

1793
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,019
An artist has three parts.

1794
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:04,549
Part A and Part B will be given to each team...

1795
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,988
after a discussion.

1796
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:07,818
And Part C is a joint part...

1797
01:13:07,819 --> 01:13:09,720
where the two teams will perform together.

1798
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,828
One team will do Part A, and another team will do Part B.

1799
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:12,890
And they will do Part C together.

1800
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,759
We did a mission like this in Street Dance Girls Fighter.

1801
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,930
A mission where we could pick an artist.

1802
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,669
We don't have a choice. Only the top three can choose.

1803
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,099
(We don't have a choice. Only the top 3 can choose.)

1804
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,538
If our names are called here, it will hurt our pride.

1805
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:28,038
I feel bad for my girls.

1806
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:29,978
(My poor girls)

1807
01:13:29,979 --> 01:13:32,149
The theme of 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

1808
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:33,679
is international K-pop artists...

1809
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,979
International K-pop artists?

1810
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:37,989
who shook the world.

1811
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:40,319
BTS.

1812
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,560
BLACKPINK.

1813
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,159
SEVENTEEN.

1814
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,099
("Seven" by Jungkook, "Chicken Noodle Soup" by j-hope, )

1815
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,658
("Pink Venom" and "Ice Cream" by BLACKPINK)

1816
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,269
("Super" and "Left and Right" by SEVENTEEN)

1817
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,569
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

1818
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,500
(I like it.)

1819
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:00,169
(Which artist do the dancers in the top three want?)

1820
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,738
BLACKPINK's songs suit our team,

1821
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:04,009
and we like their songs.

1822
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:07,509
Coincidentally, we danced to their song...

1823
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,680
for the interim mission that day.

1824
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:13,788
Among the artists, I wanted to do BLACKPINK's songs the most.

1825
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:16,589
But I didn't know what Team BEBE would choose.

1826
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,528
What would you choose if it were you, Bada?

1827
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:19,789
I personally...

1828
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:22,800
would choose SEVENTEEN's Part A...

1829
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,529
or BTS' Part B.

1830
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:26,630
- "Chicken Noodle Soup." - "Chicken Noodle Soup."

1831
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,340
Team BEBE, please come forward.

1832
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:35,380
The artist Team BEBE chose...

1833
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:37,140
is...

1834
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:39,809
It is...

1835
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,810
(Team BEBE keeps them in suspense.)

1836
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,720
It is...

1837
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,389
(The queen of suspense)

1838
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,020
I hope they pick SEVENTEEN.

1839
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,859
I think they will.

1840
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,890
It's BLACKPINK.

1841
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,359
(For real?)

1842
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:56,858
(They picked BLACKPINK.)

1843
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,269
(Is this for real?)

1844
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,430
(Her hope for SEVENTEEN is gone.)

1845
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,340
That woke me up.

1846
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,840
I think they wanted to do something different...

1847
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,270
after the feedback they got earlier.

1848
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,880
(It felt like you did what you always did.)

1849
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,949
(You just did well doing what you do well.)

1850
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:20,020
When we received the feedback earlier,

1851
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,419
they said it was too obvious.

1852
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,688
We can do something different too.

1853
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,259
So we'll be able to show the unexpected side of us.

1854
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,460
(With BLACKPINK's song)

1855
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:32,329
That's amazing.

1856
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,930
They're doing something completely different.

1857
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,469
If it's BLACKPINK,

1858
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,239
they will choose Team 1MILLION or Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1859
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:39,608
(I like BLACKPINK.)

1860
01:15:39,609 --> 01:15:41,409
The team...

1861
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,750
Team BEBE can win against...

1862
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:46,949
is Team...

1863
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:48,719
But I...

1864
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,118
(During the team discussion earlier)

1865
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,720
Rather than Team MANNEQUEEN or Team 1MILLION,

1866
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:53,619
I'd pick Team HOOK.

1867
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:56,759
(Do you want to eliminate them at once?)

1868
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,489
(They got all the moves wrong.)

1869
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:01,829
If the team in first place picks a team that got everything wrong,

1870
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,559
(Is it mean?)

1871
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,999
- it's mean.
- That's mean.

1872
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,170
It doesn't look good for us.

1873
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,969
My goodness.

1874
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,039
(Should we change it then?)

1875
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,310
It's Team MANNEQUEEN.

1876
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,709
(How dare you pick us?)

1877
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:17,609
- Now, should we...
- It's like BLACKPINK is...

1878
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,210
(Surprised)

1879
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,948
(She leaves for a moment.)

1880
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:24,579
Everything is so unexpected.

1881
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:26,549
- I didn't even imagine it.
- Amazing.

1882
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,158
I was thinking Team 1MILLION. Team MANNEQUEEN?

1883
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:30,159
What's going on?

1884
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,760
This is fun.

1885
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,658
(The battle between the two teams makes you hold your breath.)

1886
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,658
(What are you looking at?)

1887
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,269
(What do you want?)

1888
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,640
After considering all the teams,

1889
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,500
we thought they were the plainest.

1890
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:44,909
(We thought they were the plainest.)

1891
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:46,568
(Plain?)

1892
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:47,569
Plain?

1893
01:16:47,609 --> 01:16:49,608
(It's so fun to watch.)

1894
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:50,639
(Interested)

1895
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,209
That's what we thought.

1896
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,510
Well...

1897
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,049
It's going to be very fun.

1898
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,278
Actually, we're thankful...

1899
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,560
that a team that has a completely different style...

1900
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,220
picked us.

1901
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,859
Are you sure that you're thankful?

1902
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,828
- Very much.
- I'm excited.

1903
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,060
I'm excited too.

1904
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,270
Something is off.

1905
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,170
(This K-drama is so fun.)

1906
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,969
(Team JAM REPUBLIC will choose its opponent next.)

1907
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:21,239
The artist Team JAM REPUBLIC chose is...

1908
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:24,539
I thought they were going to pick BLACKPINK, but...

1909
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,579
it's taken now. But I think...

1910
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,750
BTS?

1911
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:33,220
BTS?

1912
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,649
Don't pick BTS.

1913
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,220
It's...

1914
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,989
BTS.

1915
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,599
(It's an unexpected choice.)

1916
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,470
Do they want to do "Chicken Noodle Soup?"

1917
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,500
I didn't expect it.

1918
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,898
- I knew they would pick BTS.
- Seriously.

1919
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,569
- Really?
- Yes.

1920
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:54,239
Yes.

1921
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,479
Nice.

1922
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,810
The team we can win against is...

1923
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:01,448
(Don't ever make eye contact!)

1924
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:03,119
(Nervous)

1925
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,688
Team HOOK.

1926
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:08,020
(Team JAM REPUBLIC picked Team HOOK!)

1927
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:13,328
(Hey, Kirsten.)

1928
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:15,460
(Hey, Aiki.)

1929
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,059
(A match between Team HOOK and Team JAM REPUBLIC is decided!)

1930
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,068
This is intense.

1931
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,429
Naturally, we'll battle each other.

1932
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,670
Okay.

1933
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,738
- Team 1MILLION and Team LACHICA.
- It's intense.

1934
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:25,069
With SEVENTEEN's songs.

1935
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:27,238
(Oh, then...)

1936
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,909
I actually like it.

1937
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,909
It's my fate to do SEVENTEEN's song.

1938
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,250
I should do it.

1939
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,078
(Including the last match that was decided automatically, )

1940
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,448
(all 6 teams are matched!)

1941
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:42,158
Team JAM REPUBLIC is the only global team.

1942
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,919
I hope we can compete in a positive way.

1943
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,259
We're actually very competitive.

1944
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,929
So we're gritting our teeth.

1945
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:53,028
We have very different styles.

1946
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:55,038
So I was curious what it would look like.

1947
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:57,099
I want to create a performance where both of us shine.

1948
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,139
Peace and love.

1949
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,169
(Relaxed)

1950
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,238
- Peace and love?
- Yes. Peace and love.

1951
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,279
All teams are matched for 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

1952
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:08,009
(A list of matches for 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...)

1953
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,049
(is revealed.)

1954
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,390
Team JAM REPUBLIC versus Team HOOK for BTS.

1955
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:16,420
Team BEBE versus Team MANNEQUEEN for BLACKPINK.

1956
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,930
Team 1MILLION versus Team LACHICA for SEVENTEEN.

1957
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,129
(Team BEBE is back to the team room.)

1958
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,568
We took first place!

1959
01:19:27,569 --> 01:19:29,868
(Team BEBE took 1st place!)

1960
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:31,568
We did it.

1961
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:34,669
(We made it)

1962
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,908
Shall we sit down first?

1963
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,239
(She came back to her senses.)

1964
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:38,849
We took first place.

1965
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:42,679
(Team BEBE took 1st place for the internal evaluation.)

1966
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,380
We finished in first place.

1967
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,849
Pat our heads, please.

1968
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,358
(Compliment us, please.)

1969
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:49,720
- Bluetooth patting.
- Bluetooth patting.

1970
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,689
We struggled a lot as we were given 24 hours only.

1971
01:19:54,329 --> 01:19:57,658
So we thought it might work against us.

1972
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:01,770
But still, for a choreography that was made in a short time,

1973
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:04,340
I was very satisfied with it.

1974
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:08,539
I want to call Bada,

1975
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:11,279
ask questions, and tell her about this.

1976
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,978
(That's why I'm here!)

1977
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:16,149
Guys, I'm watching you.

1978
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,880
I'm watching you.

1979
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,019
(It's 10 seconds before meeting Team BEBE!)

1980
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,118
(They're just innocent victims who will be surprised by her visit.)

1981
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,028
(Hello, I'm Team BEBE!)

1982
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,630
Hello, I'm Team BEBE.

1983
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:31,029
(Hello, I'm Team BEBE!)

1984
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,770
Hello, everyone.

1985
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,170
(I got you surprised, right?)

1986
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:38,869
- It was a real surprise. Yes.
- Really?

1987
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,438
- You didn't know that I'd come?
- No.

1988
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:41,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1989
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:44,380
Na Ra is crying. Why?

1990
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:45,448
(Ra Na bursts into tears after seeing Master Bada.)

1991
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:47,449
- Don't cry.
- I was so surprised.

1992
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,779
Don't cry.

1993
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,818
Did I surprise you too much? I'm sorry.

1994
01:20:52,819 --> 01:20:54,689
- I'm sorry. Would you like to sit?
- Yes.

1995
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:57,020
You guys took first place.

1996
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,119
(Team BEBE took 1st place!)

1997
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,158
(She suddenly shows her specialty.)

1998
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:03,328
For real, you did so well.

1999
01:21:03,329 --> 01:21:04,600
You did a great job.

2000
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,469
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2001
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,470
Well done. I thought you were on the same team from the beginning.

2002
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:11,568
Yes. You're one team now.

2003
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:14,069
I was so proud while I watched on. I kept doing this.

2004
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:16,279
I kept cheering.

2005
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,279
(It's the sound Master Bada makes when she feels good.)

2006
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,448
You killed it. It was incredible.

2007
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:24,818
Did it show our own colors?

2008
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:26,948
- I could see it very clearly.
- You did?

2009
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:29,890
The feedback I wanted to give you is...

2010
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,259
(Gulping)

2011
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,889
(Nervous)

2012
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,899
You guys received feedback from the other teams, right?

2013
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,228
They said it was obvious.

2014
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:41,939
I also got similar feedback.

2015
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,938
The word "obvious" hurt me like a knife.

2016
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:49,379
"I showed it because it's my forte."

2017
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,809
"Why are they saying that it was obvious?"

2018
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:54,210
I wondered why they would give me feedback like that.

2019
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,020
You have to be the best in the world...

2020
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,549
when you do something obvious...

2021
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,449
not to hear comments like that.

2022
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:05,459
Honestly, I took up many challenges on Street Woman Fighter 2.

2023
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,028
I tried what I wanted to do...

2024
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,229
and tried them many times.

2025
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:14,269
Because that's building experience.

2026
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:17,738
"When I do something like this, I should work harder."

2027
01:22:17,739 --> 01:22:19,769
"People like it more when I do this."

2028
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,340
You can learn things like this.

2029
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,339
So I hope you don't always play safe.

2030
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,179
Put everything down and take up the challenge.

2031
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,880
Try this and that.

2032
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:30,520
I hope you can trust yourself and keep going.

2033
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:32,420
- I understand.
- Good.

2034
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,149
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2035
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:39,060
- Very good, BEBE!
- Very good, BEBE!

2036
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,630
(The interim evaluation day...)

2037
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:41,630
(for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

2038
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:51,539
(They will fight for Part C, the joint part, here!)

2039
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,340
We're facing Team 1MILLION.

2040
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:58,009
We're all facing...

2041
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,310
- Yes.
- our opponents.

2042
01:22:59,649 --> 01:23:01,210
This is so intense.

2043
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,818
I haven't felt something like this for a while.

2044
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:03,850
- for a while.
- I know.

2045
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,089
(Everyone is anxious in the studio. No one is smiling.)

2046
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:11,119
The team Team BEBE can win against is...

2047
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:14,459
(Starting from Team BEBE, they picked their opponents...)

2048
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,670
(and 3 matches were decided.)

2049
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,569
(They're all matched!)

2050
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,210
We prepared it as if our lives were at stake.

2051
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,210
We're Team LACHICA.

2052
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,579
So we will win no matter what.

2053
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,549
We have many weapons only we can use.

2054
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:33,680
So I'm confident.

2055
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:36,819
I'm ready to intimidate them.

2056
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,949
How is the choreography?

2057
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,188
We're going to fight with our dance.

2058
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,188
Of course. This is a dance battle.

2059
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,420
- You came okay today?
- Good?

2060
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,720
Let's get it here.

2061
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:47,260
- Did you memorize everything? Okay.
- I'm not nervous at all.

2062
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,859
When will our masters come?

2063
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,929
- Hello.
- Hello.

2064
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

2065
01:23:55,399 --> 01:23:57,068
- Hello.
- Hello.

2066
01:23:57,069 --> 01:23:58,539
- Hello.
- Hello.

2067
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,670
Master Waackxxxy has come.

2068
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,078
Oh, my gosh.

2069
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,880
(Waackxxxy, the world champion, is back!)

2070
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:07,509
(After Street Woman Fighter 2, Waackxxxy participated...)

2071
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,519
(in the biggest dance competition in the world...)

2072
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,619
(and became the first Korean and woman to win it.)

2073
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:11,920
(Waackxxxy is the best.)

2074
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,019
The birth of world-class teenage dance crews,

2075
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,719
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

2076
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,288
Hello, I'm Kang Daniel, the host.

2077
01:24:17,289 --> 01:24:19,759
(It's good to see you.)

2078
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,259
(It's been a while.)

2079
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,799
Today is a very important day...

2080
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,799
where the main team for the joint part...

2081
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,429
for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission will be decided.

2082
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,539
I'm so nervous.

2083
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:30,470
- I'm nervous.
- Please.

2084
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:32,109
Why am I so nervous?

2085
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,509
Let me explain the process of the interim evaluation...

2086
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:38,778
for the joint part battle.

2087
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:41,709
The two teams that are matched...

2088
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,619
will perform the joint part.

2089
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,350
After the joint part performance ends,

2090
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:49,089
the masters of the remaining four teams...

2091
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:51,858
will score each of them.

2092
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:54,130
The highest and the lowest scores will be excluded.

2093
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,559
The sum of the scores given by the remaining two masters...

2094
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,970
will be their final scores.

2095
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,369
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

2096
01:25:01,699 --> 01:25:03,899
- Please let it be us.
- Please let it be us.

2097
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:06,339
The team with the higher score...

2098
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,238
will be the main of the joint part.

2099
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,379
The team that is not chosen...

2100
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,209
can't show their choreography onstage.

2101
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,479
- That's sad.
- After putting so much effort in.

2102
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,819
I know. We worked so hard to make it.

2103
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,750
I'll kill them all.

2104
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:20,148
That team is going to perform...

2105
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:21,550
with the choreography made by the chosen team.

2106
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:24,819
There's something important here.

2107
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,659
The team that takes up the joint part...

2108
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:29,560
will be given an additional 100 points that will be reflected...

2109
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,699
in the final result of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

2110
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:33,929
The team will be given an additional 100 points.

2111
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,130
(Surprised)

2112
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,800
(Shocked)

2113
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:39,439
I think we were all shocked.

2114
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:42,340
It's a variable I didn't even think of.

2115
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:43,479
He said 100 points.

2116
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,680
- We must get it.
- One hundred points.

2117
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,050
A hundred points are a lot.

2118
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,810
We must get it.

2119
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,319
It's such a big deal.

2120
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:51,419
It's a huge benefit.

2121
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,090
We should pour everything into our performance.

2122
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,619
Honestly, it made me...

2123
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,260
so determined.

2124
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:00,359
We'll win. All we have to do is do well.

2125
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,430
We must do a good job.

2126
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,399
One versus One Performance Match Up Mission.

2127
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,929
You will either win or lose based on the final score.

2128
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,868
Some of you will be eliminated no matter what.

2129
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:10,669
(Which team will take the joint part and win the extra 100 points?)

2130
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,739
One versus One Performance Match Up Mission.

2131
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,068
Let's begin the interim evaluation...

2132
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:15,880
for taking the joint part.

2133
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,938
(Go, everyone!)

2134
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,680
Let's go.

2135
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,948
(Which team will take the joint part?)

2136
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:26,619
One versus One Performance Match Up Mission for SEVENTEEN.

2137
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:30,460
The interim evaluation for the joint part will begin.

2138
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,028
Guys.

2139
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:34,188
(Making a fuss)

2140
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,828
(They got excited as they're the first ones to go.)

2141
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:37,100
Let's go!

2142
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,568
For SEVENTEEN, Team LACHICA...

2143
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,170
and Team 1MILLION are matched.

2144
01:26:42,069 --> 01:26:44,339
It happened to be a battle between the two teams with some...

2145
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,369
of the best choreographies in the two seasons of Street Woman Fighter.

2146
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,009
Gabee, it's the 1st match against Team 1MILLION.

2147
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,739
How do you think it will turn out?

2148
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,050
We will win, of course.

2149
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:54,948
(We're Team LACHICA.)

2150
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:56,379
(That's your response?)

2151
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,449
It's a given.

2152
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,250
She answered in a split second.

2153
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,649
No.

2154
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,390
We will win no matter what.

2155
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,630
What are you talking about?

2156
01:27:05,729 --> 01:27:07,960
I'm sure 1MILLION will win.

2157
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,528
All right.

2158
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:11,799
Then let's watch Team LACHICA's performance first.

2159
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,369
Right away?

2160
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:15,199
- Why?
- All right!

2161
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,699
- Let's do it quickly and finish.
- We got this!

2162
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:22,340
- Let's do a good job!
- Let's brush our teeth.

2163
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,509
- Brush, brush.
- Brush, brush.

2164
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:27,079
- You got this!
- You got this!

2165
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,079
Gosh! They must be nervous.

2166
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,520
Don't get hurt.

2167
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,319
- Let's get into our positions.
- Good luck.

2168
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,649
I think you should move back.

2169
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,889
You said there was a part where you two weren't in sync earlier.

2170
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,688
Try it now.

2171
01:27:37,689 --> 01:27:39,329
(What did she say?)

2172
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:42,100
- You two try the technique.
- Good luck!

2173
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,599
(Will Team LACHICA that finished in last place...)

2174
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,799
(for the K-pop Choreography Mission rebound?)

2175
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,228
Sixth place goes to Team LACHICA.

2176
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:48,399
(Team LACHICA took 6th place for the internal evaluation.)

2177
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:51,239
- Well done.
- We did well.

2178
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,939
We must've done well to take sixth place.

2179
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:54,568
(She's upset.)

2180
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,409
- Well done.
- We did a good job.

2181
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,948
We finished in sixth place.

2182
01:27:58,949 --> 01:28:00,609
So it gave me a mental breakdown.

2183
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,448
(They feel down because of the shocking result.)

2184
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:04,448
(Hey!)

2185
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:06,618
Hey!

2186
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:07,649
(What is it?)

2187
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,819
(I'm here, guys.)

2188
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,728
(Perplexed and happy)

2189
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:14,688
(Relieved and crying)

2190
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,630
I saw how you guys did.

2191
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:17,829
(Did you watch our messy performance?)

2192
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:19,198
No, you did well.

2193
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,470
Why? You did a good job.

2194
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,739
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. You did well.

2195
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:24,840
Did you cry?

2196
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:27,169
- She did.
- You definitely cried.

2197
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,340
That's what your face says.

2198
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,039
I think the youngest is the only one who didn't cry.

2199
01:28:30,109 --> 01:28:31,680
The youngest is the only one who didn't cry.

2200
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,908
- I like that, girl.
- We should grit our teeth now.

2201
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,108
That's the attitude.

2202
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:36,579
(Bring up the fighting spirit.)

2203
01:28:37,949 --> 01:28:40,390
There you go. I love it.

2204
01:28:41,289 --> 01:28:42,920
How is it? How do you feel after that?

2205
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,460
We were making the choreography yesterday.

2206
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,959
But it didn't work. So we made the choreography today as well.

2207
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,059
- You did?
- Yes.

2208
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,099
When I saw your choreography...

2209
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,599
for the first time today,

2210
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,569
I thought it was good and that you executed it well.

2211
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,099
But after the mistake in the middle,

2212
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,568
you lost it.

2213
01:28:57,569 --> 01:28:59,239
The choreography definitely seemed good,

2214
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,568
but it didn't really show...

2215
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,409
as you were flustered and made mistakes, which was unfortunate.

2216
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,680
Okay. What happened, happened.

2217
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,809
You should experience failure at first.

2218
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:10,380
After you hit the bottom, all that is left is to go up.

2219
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,519
So keep that in mind and work hard.

2220
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,219
You're not doing it by yourself.

2221
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,919
We'll help you with what we can do for you.

2222
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,988
So I hope you trust us and follow us.

2223
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:21,158
You worked very hard today.

2224
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:23,228
I could see you did your best.

2225
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:25,199
With that mindset, you can win now.

2226
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,529
- Yes.
- Did you understand?

2227
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:28,130
- Yes.
- Okay!

2228
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,739
- Let's do the chant.
- Okay.

2229
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:34,939
- Brush, gargle, and spit it out.
- Brush, gargle, and spit it out.

2230
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:36,510
Okay. Let's go.

2231
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:39,010
You guys did a good job.

2232
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,180
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

2233
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:45,020
(They're practicing to take the joint part.)

2234
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:48,149
(She's watching!)

2235
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:51,559
- Oh, I know.
- Yes.

2236
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,328
Yes.

2237
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:54,358
(Nice)

2238
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:55,898
(But that was only for a moment.)

2239
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:57,398
(Kim Yoo Kyung got the choreography wrong.)

2240
01:29:57,399 --> 01:29:58,769
(Fumbling)

2241
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,000
Yoo Kyung!

2242
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:03,699
(One mistake threw Yoo Kyung entirely off-pace.)

2243
01:30:08,109 --> 01:30:09,979
(Colliding)

2244
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,479
(One mistake after another! The performance ends poorly.)

2245
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:14,649
- What was that?
- What's going on here?

2246
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,250
Okay.

2247
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,119
I'm sorry. I'm salivating.

2248
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,359
(Gauging her reaction)

2249
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,529
Yoo Kyung made a lot of mistakes.

2250
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,060
It's possible to go the wrong way,

2251
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,460
but I believe you shouldn't make it so obvious.

2252
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:31,800
You have to regain your senses right away.

2253
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:36,170
I lost my hold mentally.

2254
01:30:36,699 --> 01:30:38,970
Right now, you don't have a theme, do you?

2255
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,238
If you want all of these moves to work effectively,

2256
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:44,939
you have to be perfectly in sync.

2257
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:47,649
The quality has to level up at the same time,

2258
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,880
but all I see is So Yoon.

2259
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,350
But all I see is So Yoon.

2260
01:30:50,449 --> 01:30:52,250
Honestly, only So Yoon stands out to me too.

2261
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:54,249
Right now, it's just too...

2262
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,390
(The masters are disappointed by the lack of coordination.)

2263
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:58,060
(Can Team LACHICA overcome this obstacle?)

2264
01:30:58,789 --> 01:30:59,859
We can do it.

2265
01:31:00,529 --> 01:31:02,399
(Going over the details until the very end)

2266
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,669
We revised the choreography yesterday and practiced a lot.

2267
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,529
We were all firmly resolved not to have it go like last time.

2268
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:12,939
We'll show you a twist, though we came in last the previous mission.

2269
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:14,239
I'm so nervous.

2270
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,510
- They must be so nervous.
- I know.

2271
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:17,039
Let's go.

2272
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:19,449
(Nervous by proxy)

2273
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,709
(Team LACHICA's joint part)

2274
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,220
(Preparing a fresh start)

2275
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:25,750
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group Part C joint part)

2276
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:30,890
(Nervous)

2277
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:36,359
(Let's go.)

2278
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,000
(Very surprised)

2279
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,500
(This is great.)

2280
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,939
Yes, let's go!

2281
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:53,179
(Perfectly synced and perfectly on the beat)

2282
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,920
We ground our teeth to make sure we made no mistakes.

2283
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:57,720
(They're doing so well.)

2284
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,489
They're so prepared.

2285
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:08,590
(Amazed)

2286
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,310
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2287
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,078
(Gosh, they did so well.)

2288
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,239
(Relieved chuckling)

2289
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:26,750
(This is it.)

2290
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:28,010
Nice!

2291
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,380
- Nice.
- I liked this move.

2292
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,550
(They were pretty good.)

2293
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:36,960
Team LACHICA came better prepared than I thought.

2294
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,989
I was a bit worried, but...

2295
01:32:40,029 --> 01:32:42,800
- You did so well!
- You did well.

2296
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:44,959
Your changes were great.

2297
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,969
- Your changes were so good.
- You did well!

2298
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,970
- You did well.
- You did really well. You're great.

2299
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:50,868
(Relieved and proud)

2300
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:51,899
They did well.

2301
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,470
The formations were insane.

2302
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,180
They had a lot of different formations.

2303
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,210
Master Gabee of Team LACHICA,

2304
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:00,049
what did you think of Team LACHICA's performance?

2305
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:02,379
When we checked the performance yesterday,

2306
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,948
they made a lot of mistakes.

2307
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:06,819
It was amazing to see how they fixed all those mistakes.

2308
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,560
They left a deep impression on me with their amazing performance.

2309
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:10,759
We can learn from them.

2310
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,359
They didn't give up but made a lot of changes in just a day.

2311
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:14,960
Yes.

2312
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:18,328
Getting praised by our master...

2313
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,868
felt like she was recognizing our skills.

2314
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:20,970
It felt great.

2315
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,039
It's all right. Let's not fall into their energy.

2316
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:28,769
(But they can't help but feel nervous.)

2317
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,079
The next team to perform in the SEVENTEEN Performance Battle...

2318
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,078
is Team 1MILLION.

2319
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:36,550
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2320
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,719
Right this way, please.

2321
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,890
(What kind of performance did Team 1MILLION prepare?)

2322
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,919
- Okay, great.
- Shall we give it a go?

2323
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:43,920
(Team 1MILLION's practice room)

2324
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:45,659
(Checking the joint part choreography)

2325
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,930
(She already loves it.)

2326
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,430
(That's great.)

2327
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,300
Okay.

2328
01:33:52,899 --> 01:33:54,399
Okay. It was good.

2329
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,269
(Clapping for now)

2330
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,340
Congratulations.

2331
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:00,669
- Congratulations on winning.
- Yes, that's right. On winning.

2332
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:01,739
(Thank you in advance.)

2333
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,279
You're all set up to win this.

2334
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,278
In my opinion, that's how it is.

2335
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:07,379
This will clearly get you the win.

2336
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,549
(Pleased and proud)

2337
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:11,349
I wanted to try my best to find some flaw,

2338
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,019
so I could criticize,

2339
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,689
but there was no flaw at all.

2340
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:18,119
Should we keep watching it? Will we find a flaw then?

2341
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:22,028
As you were practicing this,

2342
01:34:22,029 --> 01:34:24,129
did you have any concerns?

2343
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,499
SEVENTEEN...

2344
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,139
is a group that's famous for their performances, right?

2345
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,868
So we were thinking we had to come up...

2346
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:35,569
with a performance that outdid their performances.

2347
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:37,738
That's why we wanted to add in some new formations.

2348
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:40,849
So how should we work to decrease these ambitions?

2349
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:42,749
I wish you wouldn't.

2350
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:43,750
(Giggling)

2351
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:45,850
- Be more ambitious instead!
- Really?

2352
01:34:47,449 --> 01:34:51,119
I had a lot of concerns, but they gave us great advice.

2353
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,089
That gave me a lot of courage.

2354
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:55,898
It seemed like they found us to be a reliable team.

2355
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:59,369
That made me feel grateful and happy.

2356
01:34:59,829 --> 01:35:01,170
In 1, 2, 3.

2357
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:03,169
- No matter what happens!
- No matter what happens!

2358
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:05,538
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2359
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:08,140
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2360
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,310
(What performance will they show as they're convinced they'll win?)

2361
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,448
(1MILLION gets ready to go.)

2362
01:35:13,449 --> 01:35:15,050
They're even in matching outfits.

2363
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:17,978
If they're doing a group choreo, will they focus on syncing up?

2364
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:20,250
I think they'll focus on perfect coordination.

2365
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:21,420
I'm curious what they'll do.

2366
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,358
We want to show how well the seven of us fit together.

2367
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:27,789
We want to show everyone the energy produced by our group dance.

2368
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:30,658
We have some highlights in our choreography...

2369
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:33,328
that we believe will catch the masters' eyes,

2370
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:34,500
so we're confident we can do this.

2371
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:36,538
In Jung's confident...

2372
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:38,199
- since she's done this before.
- Right.

2373
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:40,869
- No matter what happens!
- No matter what happens!

2374
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:44,109
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

2375
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,550
Cue the music. Let's go.

2376
01:35:46,609 --> 01:35:51,050
(Team 1MILLION's joint part choreography is revealed)

2377
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,890
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group Part C joint part)

2378
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:55,618
Yes.

2379
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:56,889
(Nervous)

2380
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:58,189
(Watching competitively)

2381
01:36:00,529 --> 01:36:02,359
Yes. Hey.

2382
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:04,929
That's it!

2383
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,270
(Unleashing their full power)

2384
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:07,770
(A perfect group dance)

2385
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:10,899
(Cheering)

2386
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:13,310
- That's it! Go!
- Go!

2387
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:16,039
That's it!

2388
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:19,209
They really are good.

2389
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,210
That's it.

2390
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,020
(Focused)

2391
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,960
- That's it!
- They're so good.

2392
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:42,170
- Yes!
- Yes.

2393
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,898
- Yes!
- Yes.

2394
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,509
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2395
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:49,479
- You did so well!
- You killed it!

2396
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:53,449
They're so coordinated.

2397
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:55,679
They're good.

2398
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,720
They did so well. You could see everything clearly.

2399
01:36:59,149 --> 01:37:01,188
It's coming back.

2400
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:02,819
(Already copying the moves)

2401
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,519
- It's over.
- Yes, we did it!

2402
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,630
(Yes, we did it!)

2403
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:09,129
It seemed like this team stripped their dance down.

2404
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,500
Right? Looking at their moves.

2405
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,728
Master of team 1MILLION, Lia Kim,

2406
01:37:12,729 --> 01:37:15,129
what did you think of your team's joint part?

2407
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:18,439
I'm so proud of these girls.

2408
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:20,839
They're so coordinated with one another,

2409
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,679
like they've been a part of the same team for ages.

2410
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,409
I think that's my team's strength. That's what I thought.

2411
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:28,310
Additionally,

2412
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,879
I'd be so grateful...

2413
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,818
if you considered how much effort they put in...

2414
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:37,358
in wearing matching outfits like this.

2415
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:39,589
We also wanted to wear matching outfits,

2416
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,359
but we're a Korean global team.

2417
01:37:41,659 --> 01:37:44,859
Everyone lives so far away that we couldn't match outfits.

2418
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,429
- We live in Busan too.
- Really?

2419
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:49,669
- They live in Busan.
- I know, but we...

2420
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:51,739
- We have four people living far.
- They're in Masan.

2421
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:54,640
(Acknowledging, understanding, accepting)

2422
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,010
To be honest,

2423
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,379
we're not going to compete for the center. 1MILLION, you do it.

2424
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,948
You can be in the center. Our girls are okay with that.

2425
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:04,448
You can have it. You can have the center.

2426
01:38:04,449 --> 01:38:05,478
(Master Gabee's appeal is 100 percent sincere.)

2427
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:07,688
- You can have the center.
- All we want is a good performance.

2428
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:10,589
We want to be able to do this flashy dance with 1MILLION.

2429
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:13,590
We aspire to make something even greater by working together.

2430
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,500
- My goodness. You can't beat her.
- You can't beat her.

2431
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,999
We have now watched both SEVENTEEN Performance Groups,

2432
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,169
Team LACHICA and Team 1MILLION.

2433
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:24,599
The joint part is joint, but it's also the focus of the competition.

2434
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,169
The team that is not chosen cannot showcase their choreography.

2435
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:30,210
Only the team that is chosen can create the final performance.

2436
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:32,809
Excluding the masters of Team LACHICA and Team 1MILLION,

2437
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:34,349
the masters of the other four teams...

2438
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,720
may now score the two groups.

2439
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:39,220
The maximum number of points you can give a team is 100 points.

2440
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:40,988
If it were up to me, I'd pick this team.

2441
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:42,049
(If it were up to me, I'd pick this team.)

2442
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,060
Is it too obvious?

2443
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,060
- That's right.
- I'd pick my team too.

2444
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,460
If it were up to us, we'd pick our own team.

2445
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,659
Both teams, please come to the center.

2446
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:54,929
(Time to reveal the result of the SEVENTEEN Performance Group)

2447
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:56,170
Right away? They're announcing it?

2448
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,069
(They must be so nervous.)

2449
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,309
Team BEBE's master, Bada,

2450
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:04,010
what did you think of the two teams' joint parts?

2451
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,608
First of all, Team LACHICA had so many formations...

2452
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:10,379
and so many key moves. It really surprised me.

2453
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,449
- Because in their interim...
- Oh, my!

2454
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,448
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2455
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,318
(Endless gratitude)

2456
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:18,619
- Yes!
- What was that?

2457
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:20,688
(What's with that cuteness?)

2458
01:39:20,689 --> 01:39:23,759
First of all, Team LACHICA's use of formations and stage space...

2459
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,698
was very good. And personally,

2460
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:28,028
at the individual level, it felt nice to see...

2461
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:29,738
each member bring their own genre and style to life.

2462
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:31,099
As for Team 1MILLION,

2463
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:34,139
the quality of your choreography and key moves was insane.

2464
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,809
(The quality of your key moves was insane.)

2465
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:37,608
That's what I thought.

2466
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:39,608
- Thank you.
- It was such a great dance...

2467
01:39:39,609 --> 01:39:42,850
that we wanted to get up and dance to it right away.

2468
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,079
It's such a high praise.

2469
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:47,350
(A little jealous)

2470
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:50,358
- Hi.
- Hi.

2471
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:52,590
(The shy master's greeting relieves everyone's nerves.)

2472
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,760
For Team LACHICA...

2473
01:39:54,859 --> 01:39:56,560
For Team LACHICA,

2474
01:39:57,329 --> 01:39:59,528
the composition was very interesting.

2475
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:01,629
And I liked the styles that were shown.

2476
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:03,600
And with Team 1MILLION, I think...

2477
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:08,470
the formation could've been more dynamic.

2478
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,039
(Flustered)

2479
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,049
It was the difference between playing it safe...

2480
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,719
and attempting a challenge.

2481
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,318
But this is Street Dance Girls Fighter 2, right?

2482
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:23,658
So I thought it was worthwhile...

2483
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:26,630
to be more challenging. But then,

2484
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:30,029
I'd choose to play things safe if I were in the same situation.

2485
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,129
- But then, - You're the best.

2486
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:33,130
I'm torn.

2487
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,130
(She can't tell her own feelings.)

2488
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,000
- "Torn." - I'm torn.

2489
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:37,170
It's confusing.

2490
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:38,170
- But then...
- It's hard.

2491
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,868
Thanks for the nice remark.

2492
01:40:39,869 --> 01:40:42,108
Between the two teams,

2493
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:43,879
which team will take the joint part?

2494
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,738
Let's first check the teams that gave...

2495
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:49,578
the highest and lowest scores, which have been excluded.

2496
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:51,179
- Why reveal teams?
- Why reveal it?

2497
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,180
Oh, the teams will be revealed?

2498
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:55,148
(There are no secrets here.)

2499
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:57,159
Who has given the highest score?

2500
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,519
Oh, no.

2501
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,630
I can't wait.

2502
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:02,590
The team that has given the lowest score to Team LACHICA...

2503
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,300
- My lips are dry.
- My lips are dry.

2504
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:06,930
It might be Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2505
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,600
(Ice sisters)

2506
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:09,600
(We just hope it's not us.)

2507
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,299
is Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2508
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,310
- Oh, no.
- Really?

2509
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,880
- Hey, Kirsten.
- But I'm a huge fan of yours.

2510
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:18,710
She's embarrassed.

2511
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,818
(Oh, dear.)

2512
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:23,920
Let me explain.

2513
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,520
(Let's hear it.)

2514
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:29,719
Maybe, the way we wanted to score...

2515
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:32,118
was different from the levels of how the other teams...

2516
01:41:32,119 --> 01:41:33,889
wanted to score.

2517
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:35,559
Just because ours is the lowest, it doesn't mean...

2518
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,459
we thought it was bad. No.

2519
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:40,100
It's just... We didn't mean it.

2520
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:46,539
On the other hand, the team who has given the highest score...

2521
01:41:46,869 --> 01:41:49,009
is Team HOOK.

2522
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,510
(Team HOOK has given them the highest score.)

2523
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:53,108
(Thank goodness.)

2524
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:55,578
Now let me announce the teams...

2525
01:41:55,579 --> 01:41:58,448
that have given the lowest and highest scores to Team 1MILLION.

2526
01:41:58,449 --> 01:42:01,090
The team that has given the lowest score to Team 1MILLION...

2527
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:03,759
(Nervous for no reason)

2528
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,489
It's Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2529
01:42:06,229 --> 01:42:08,228
(Is it us again?)

2530
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:09,429
(Feeling sad)

2531
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:12,799
The team that has given the highest score is Team HOOK.

2532
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,029
(HOOK's generosity is back.)

2533
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,340
(What's with that team?)

2534
01:42:16,539 --> 01:42:18,198
How generous.

2535
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:19,969
They're too generous.

2536
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,209
You're too generous.

2537
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:22,269
(A good judge to earn a high score from)

2538
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:23,810
What if we end up in a tie?

2539
01:42:24,609 --> 01:42:26,249
We're very confused ourselves.

2540
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,250
I see.

2541
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:29,879
We simply gave them the highest score...

2542
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:33,188
because both of them did a good job.

2543
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:36,188
They did so well that we had to give them the highest score.

2544
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:39,658
They seemed better than the original LACHICA.

2545
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:41,359
(They seemed better than the original LACHICA.)

2546
01:42:41,659 --> 01:42:43,029
So we gave them a high score.

2547
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:44,329
That's mean!

2548
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,959
- That's mean!
- Hey!

2549
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,470
(Her sudden attack causes a stir in the studio.)

2550
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,898
(Calm down.)

2551
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:51,399
It still feels nice.

2552
01:42:51,539 --> 01:42:52,739
Thank you.

2553
01:42:53,369 --> 01:42:55,438
(They're cute.)

2554
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:57,679
Excluding the highest and lowest scores,

2555
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:01,179
let me announce Team LACHICA's final score.

2556
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,210
(Praying)

2557
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,879
- Please.
- Goodness.

2558
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,220
Our team's scores are excluded, right?

2559
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:11,460
Team LACHICA's final score is...

2560
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,229
Gosh, it's making me nervous too.

2561
01:43:13,789 --> 01:43:14,829
Oh, gosh.

2562
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,858
We practiced harder than we did for the last mission,

2563
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,270
so we were half excited and half afraid.

2564
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:25,169
The score is 168.

2565
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,170
Okay.

2566
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,069
It's 168. Not bad.

2567
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:29,539
It's 168.

2568
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,608
Next, let me announce Team 1MILLION's final score,

2569
01:43:32,609 --> 01:43:35,210
excluding the highest and lowest scores.

2570
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,279
Team 1MILLION's final score is...

2571
01:43:37,479 --> 01:43:38,649
This is really unpredictable.

2572
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,488
I thought we'd already put enough effort...

2573
01:43:43,489 --> 01:43:46,188
into the performance,

2574
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:48,090
and thus, I thought we had a high chance.

2575
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,260
It's...

2576
01:43:50,729 --> 01:43:52,260
a hundred and...

2577
01:43:54,970 --> 01:44:00,840
(To be continued)

2578
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:03,840
Team LACHICA's final score...

2579
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:06,238
is 168.

2580
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,250
Okay.

2581
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,109
It's 168. Not bad.

2582
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:10,680
It's 168.

2583
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:14,550
Next, let me announce Team 1MILLION's final score.

2584
01:44:14,789 --> 01:44:16,689
Team 1MILLION's final score is...

2585
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,060
This is really unpredictable.

2586
01:44:21,729 --> 01:44:22,729
It...

2587
01:44:23,229 --> 01:44:24,559
is 174.

2588
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,560
(Team 1MILLION's final score is 174.)

2589
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:28,669
(Team 1MILLION takes the win with a difference of 6 points.)

2590
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,640
- What a bummer.
- It's too bad.

2591
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,270
Congratulations.

2592
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,209
Thus, the joint part of SEVENTEEN's song...

2593
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:36,778
goes to Team 1MILLION...

2594
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:39,238
with a result of 168 to 172. Congratulations.

2595
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:40,908
(Team 1MILLION gets to have the joint part.)

2596
01:44:40,909 --> 01:44:42,180
Congratulations.

2597
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,618
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2598
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:48,549
Team 1MILLION now has the directing right...

2599
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,988
of the joint part, along with the extra 100 points.

2600
01:44:50,989 --> 01:44:52,118
How do you feel?

2601
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:55,429
I'm grateful for how much they liked our performance.

2602
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:59,129
Now that we must perform with Team LACHICA,

2603
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:03,669
we will complete our performance with flashier and cooler formations.

2604
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,339
Please look forward to it.

2605
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,639
Good. We will.

2606
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,778
The joint part of the SEVENTEEN performance...

2607
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:12,078
will be choreographed by Team 1MILLION.

2608
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,049
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group Part C Choreography Director:)

2609
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:16,549
(Team 1MILLION)

2610
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,049
(To be continued)

2611
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:22,488
(BTS Performance Group fights over the joint part.)

2612
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:23,559
(We will begin now.)

2613
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,658
Let's go.

2614
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:27,229
We focused on raw swag as we prepared.

2615
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:29,999
(It's the same for us.)

2616
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,959
(Raw swag versus raw swag)

2617
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,430
(Their concepts overlap.)

2618
01:45:33,529 --> 01:45:36,028
(Team HOOK presents rough and strong hip-hop moves.)

2619
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:38,038
(They're good.)

2620
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,238
(Team JAM REPUBLIC presents energetic and raw techniques.)

2621
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:43,339
(Amazed)

2622
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,839
(It's crazy.)

2623
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,038
I thought we were going to win.

2624
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:47,809
I thought we had a chance to win.

2625
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:49,309
(With just a 1-point difference)

2626
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,318
(1 point?)

2627
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:51,319
(A difference of 1 point)

2628
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:52,979
(Shocked)

2629
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:56,049
(Which team will take the joint part of the BTS performance?)

2630
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:58,288
(The fight over the parts isn't over yet.)

2631
01:45:58,289 --> 01:45:59,658
(The leaders of the two teams...)

2632
01:45:59,659 --> 01:46:01,189
(gather to divide parts.)

2633
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:03,028
(So which part do you want to do?)

2634
01:46:03,029 --> 01:46:04,999
(Part A)

2635
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,599
(- This is ruined. - You want Part A too?)

2636
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:07,669
(Of course.)

2637
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,469
(You know "Pink Venom" starts with boom bap, right?)

2638
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:10,470
(Flustered)

2639
01:46:10,471 --> 01:46:12,698
We're used to dancing to boom bap.

2640
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,809
(We're a choreography team.)

2641
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:16,509
So we should be better than street dance teams.

2642
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:18,839
(A power struggle over Part A)

2643
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,249
(That's a little...)

2644
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,250
(Should we battle then?)

2645
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:22,779
(We'd like that.)

2646
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,180
(How will their unyielding fight over the parts turn out?)

2647
01:46:24,449 --> 01:46:26,078
(The videos became the talk of the town as soon as they were revealed.)

2648
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:27,519
(The public evaluation of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up)

2649
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,090
(What's the result of the fierce online public evaluation?)

2650
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:33,688
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

2651
01:46:33,689 --> 01:46:36,599
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 will have its 1st elimination.)

2652
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,600
(More nervous than ever)

2653
01:46:37,729 --> 01:46:41,629
(Which team will be the first to leave the show?)

2654
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:44,068
(An unexpected result?)

2655
01:46:44,069 --> 01:46:47,569
(Which team will be eliminated first?)
