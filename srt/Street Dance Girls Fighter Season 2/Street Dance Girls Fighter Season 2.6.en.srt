00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:15,890
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)
[Watch on www.kisskh.la]

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,460
Today...

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,230
(A team will be eliminated for the first time.)

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,399
(It will be decided by 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.)

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,429
(The extra 100 points for directing the joint part...)

6
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,870
(and the online public evaluation score)

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,100
(What we want is Part A.)

8
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,299
(An unyielding fight for the parts)

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,140
(She can't do a forward roll?)

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,340
(The conflict continued through the joint part practice.)

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,880
I don't like techniques.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,149
Okay!

13
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,179
(People showed great interest in the videos.)

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,149
(Each team's characteristic performance...)

15
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,649
(won points from the online public evaluation.)

16
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,990
(Everyone is surprised.)

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,820
(Conflicts aside,)

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,759
(they performed the joint part as one.)

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,759
(The total score of the extra points and the online public evaluation...)

20
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,060
(is 1,000 points.)

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,929
(And Team 1MILLION won 1st place with a full score.)

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,229
(5th and 6th places will go straight to the Elimination Battle.)

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,700
(Elimination Battle)

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Losing is not in my scenario.

25
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,540
The Elimination Battle turned out to be beneficial to us.

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,579
(Round 1, Group Battle, heated things up.)

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,079
(Round 2, 1-on-1 Ace Battle, caught people's attention.)

28
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,109
(Shocked)

29
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,150
(Going wild)

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,920
(Team HOOK won two rounds in a row,)

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,250
(and Team LACHICA was in trouble.)

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,219
(They'll clench their teeth this time.)

33
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,489
I'm never going to lose.

34
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,159
We'll lose, no matter what.

35
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,930
It's a battle of locking!

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,230
(Waacking meets locking,)

37
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,500
(and a powerful locking performance)

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,900
(They showed their charms...)

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,129
(in Round 3, 2-on-2 Duet Battle.)

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,069
(Team LACHICA went for the comeback with the first win.)

41
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,670
Kill them!

42
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,269
(With pressure on their shoulders,)

43
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,040
(the leaders had a dance-off for their teams.)

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
(Falling in love)

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,379
(However)

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,049
Team LACHICA will be out.

47
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,950
Don't cry. You did great!

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,650
We're still young,

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,989
so we have more days to dance from here on out.

50
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,989
I hope to see you again...

51
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,890
on a larger dance stage.

52
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,859
(Girl Group Choreography Mission)

53
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,629
(The 4 finalists will be decided through this mission.)

54
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,469
(The 5 teams give their best not to get eliminated.)

55
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,030
The second team to leave Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 is...

56
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,199
(The second team to be eliminated will be revealed soon.)

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,210
(Benefits for the champion team)

58
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,879
(10,000-dollar scholarship)

59
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,379
(To be continued)

60
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,020
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

61
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,219
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

62
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,830
(The 2nd mission, Girl Group Choreography Mission)

63
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,759
(The audience entered to evaluate the performance.)

64
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,099
The birth of the world-class teenage dance crew,

65
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,039
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2. Hi, I'm the host, Kang Daniel.

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,909
(Good to see you!)

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,539
(Excited)

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,639
(The dancers are watching it through a screen.)

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,550
- They're closer than I expected.
- There are so many.

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,409
(They spot the audience.)

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,879
- Why are there so many?
- Oh, my gosh.

72
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,650
They're at the center!

73
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,419
- There are so many.
- So many people.

74
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,719
(Taking a deep breath)

75
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,860
There is one last mission left...

76
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,789
to advance to the finals.

77
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,400
Currently, there are five teams remaining.

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,430
(5 teams survived the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.)

79
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,199
But not all five teams can...

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,569
advance to the finals.

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,370
The finalists will be determined...

82
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,270
on this stage soon.

83
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,039
The mission to determine the finalists is...

84
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
(Focused)

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,810
(Concentrating)

86
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,520
Girl Group Choreography Mission.

87
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,479
(Girl Group Choreography Mission)

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,750
(Excited)

89
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,150
(That is awesome.)

90
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,449
(Intrigued)

91
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,919
That's tricky.

92
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,990
(It's a perfect mission for Team BEBE.)

93
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,460
There will be a total of two rounds.

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,229
The first round is the Ace Match.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,469
The ace dancer of each team...

96
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,000
will give a performance of a girl band's song.

97
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,370
- They're the most confident ones.
- The true ace dancers.

98
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,009
In Round One, the Ace Match, the votes for each dancer...

99
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,539
will be added to the score of Round Two.

100
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,050
The second round is the Group Match.

101
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,550
The surviving five teams will each pick a girl band's song...

102
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,090
to give a new performance.

103
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,719
According to today's performance, one of the five teams...

104
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,889
(Focused)

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,590
(Gulping)

106
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,060
will be eliminated instantly.

107
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,399
(Instant elimination?)

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
(Speechless)

109
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
(Genuinely worried)

110
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
That's cold.

111
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,529
(Oh, no.)

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
My heart.

113
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,240
The four finalists...

114
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,709
will be decided...

115
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,540
by the crowd of dancers who are here.

116
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,050
(An Ji Min, Park Se Eun)

117
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,209
(Namgung Sol, Kim Soo Hyun)

118
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,550
- Please be generous!
- Please be generous!

119
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,019
Thank you for coming.

120
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,860
Let's begin today's show with a shout.

121
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,160
Street Dance...

122
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,629
- Girls Fighter!
- Girls Fighter!

123
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,060
(Let's do this!)

124
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,269
Girl Group Choreography Mission, Round One is the Ace Match.

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,470
The five dancers to perform...

126
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,269
will now step up to the stage.

127
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,439
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

128
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,079
Let's go!

129
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,149
(The 5 ace dancers enter.)

130
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,579
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so nervous.
- Let's go.

131
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,720
- Oh, my goodness.
- No!

132
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
(Also nervous)

133
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,189
Yoon In Jung, let's go!

134
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,790
(Team 1MILLION's ace, Yoon In Jung)

135
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,829
Ga Young!

136
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,930
(Team BEBE's ace, Lee Ga Young)

137
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,600
They look like an actual girl group.

138
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,240
You guys are gorgeous.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,509
(Practice room for Ace Match)

140
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,740
(No one's here yet.)

141
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,839
(Opening)

142
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,050
(Who's the first ace member to arrive?)

143
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,079
Oh, hi.

144
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,850
Hello.

145
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,189
Who else will be here?

146
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm so nervous.

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,319
(Someone opens the door and enters.)

148
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,529
(Excited)

149
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,589
(She bursts into laughter as soon as she sees her?)

150
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,129
(Hello.)

151
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,800
(Team BEBE's ace, Lee Ga Young)

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
- Hold on.
- What's this?

153
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
As I expected, Ga Young came as the ace.

154
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,470
What are you doing here? I knew you'd be here, though.

155
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,079
- I knew you'd be here too.
- Really?

156
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,079
(They predicted each other to be ace dancers.)

157
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,750
I wonder who Team JAM REPUBLIC chose as the ace.

158
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,019
It may be someone totally unexpected.

159
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,779
Maybe we're all leaders.

160
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,149
(It turns out to be a leaders' match?)

161
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,790
(Someone's here.)

162
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,120
(Who is it?)

163
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,790
Hello!

164
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,790
(Team MANNEQUEEN's ace, Lee Na Ra)

165
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,889
I thought so.

166
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,060
(The reveal of the 2nd mission)

167
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,060
The Ace Match.

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,899
(It's mine!)

169
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,240
(As soon as I heard the song, I wanted to do it.)

170
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,470
(If you're all right with it, can I be the ace dancer?)

171
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,379
(You're the only one who can do it.)

172
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,180
(Team MANNEQUEEN chose Na Ra as their ace dancer.)

173
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,250
This is a strong lineup. What do we do?

174
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,189
- Wait.
- Is someone here?

175
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,189
- Who is it?
- Let's see.

176
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,620
(Who's the other ace?)

177
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,389
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's ace, Miyabi)

178
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,129
(I think Miyabi's experience...)

179
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,959
(in making choreography and her knowledge...)

180
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,329
(Yes, I also think it should be Miyabi because...)

181
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,740
(I feel like her dance style fits an individual match.)

182
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,470
(Her dance is really high quality.)

183
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,310
(Who's the last ace to arrive?)

184
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,410
Hello!

185
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,910
- Goodness.
- Cool.

186
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,519
I never expected it'd be you.

187
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,850
It was a new combination, and I thought it'd be fun.

188
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,490
I thought that I could win.

189
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,089
It'd be more entertaining to beat the older dancers.

190
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,930
We have to choose the director.

191
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,100
(Directors)

192
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,040
I'd like the two of you to direct us.

193
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,100
I believe that these two are so trustworthy.

194
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,839
So, I recommend those two.

195
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,069
- What's your opinion?
- I like it.

196
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,209
Then, should it be us?

197
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,439
- Yes.
- Decided.

198
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,480
(They chose the directors of the Ace Match.)

199
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Thank you. We'll do our best.

200
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,579
Why don't we start dividing the parts?

201
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,850
I think you'll do a good job at the twerking part.

202
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,290
I think so.

203
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,360
- What do you think about this part?
- I'll take it.

204
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,230
We could come up with a duet in this part.

205
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,430
Maybe you and I can dance together.

206
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,529
- Okay.
- Good.

207
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,829
And Joo Bin will dance hip-hop in the end.

208
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,040
- Okay.
- Great.

209
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,810
Personally... You know the "dollar bills" part?

210
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,180
- I think Miyabi will be perfect.
- I was thinking the same thing.

211
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,810
I wanted to take that part, anyway. I'm fine with it.

212
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,949
(Amazed)

213
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,379
(Satisfied with the part)

214
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,649
- This is going so smoothly.
- This is great.

215
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,250
- It's going great, everyone.
- Great.

216
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,350
So nice.

217
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,259
We're the ace dancers representing our teams,

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,730
so we certainly want to do well.

219
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,529
But we decided that we concentrate on finishing...

220
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,299
the performance well.

221
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,629
We believe that it will be...

222
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,639
a great performance of a team.

223
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,870
- Did you practice hard?
- Yes.

224
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,539
How was dancing as a group of five?

225
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,139
We only did the moves,

226
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,879
and it was quite exhausting.

227
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,250
Of course. They're all there to fight.

228
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,820
- I bet they go all out.
- Yes.

229
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,179
- They're desperate to win.
- Yes.

230
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,889
Do you have any videos of your practice?

231
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,190
- Yes, I have a video.
- Okay.

232
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,990
(The masters monitor the practice video.)

233
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,690
- Did Miyabi come up with the moves?
- Yes.

234
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,259
- We did the overall moves, though.
- That's Na Ra.

235
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,799
- She's different.
- Gosh.

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,340
(The part where In Jung stands at the center)

237
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,870
(The masters analyze the dance with keen eyes.)

238
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,179
- Can you do the pipe move?
- Why didn't you blow it?

239
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:36,909
(Reading the room)

240
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,720
(She watches the video with a serious look.)

241
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,490
I'll be honest with you. Just from the video,

242
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,889
(Anxious)

243
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,090
I could only see Na Ra and Miyabi.

244
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,230
It's a common formation as it progresses.

245
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,269
Here, the other dancers should have...

246
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,340
moved to the side or gotten on the floor.

247
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,110
Ga Young and I...

248
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,710
both thought that we wanted it to be only us dancing here,

249
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,039
- but I couldn't say it.
- You can't do that.

250
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,409
You can't do that.

251
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,250
This is a true competition.

252
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,480
You must earn your part.

253
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,860
(Team BEBE monitors the practice clip with the masters.)

254
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,129
(The part where Ga Young stands at the center)

255
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,190
Nice.

256
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,029
(The masters watch without any reactions.)

257
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
That's all we practiced.

258
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,070
Okay.

259
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,539
(Glancing)

260
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,970
Did you feel that?

261
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:36,710
Did you?

262
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,139
- Yes.
- It's too weak.

263
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,879
You weren't that noticeable. You should ask for more parts.

264
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,179
- Okay.
- It's weak.

265
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,649
You two are dancing together...

266
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,490
- as a duet, right?
- Yes.

267
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,419
But In Jung is in front of you the whole time.

268
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,419
So it doesn't seem like a duet.

269
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,590
It looks like you're an assistant.

270
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,899
I had felt it, but it struck me when she said it.

271
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,100
You're off the center most of the time.

272
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,169
(Team JAM REPUBLIC discusses the parts.)

273
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,070
(Are you kidding me? Only four seconds?)

274
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,539
(Looking)

275
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,740
- That's not fair.
- That's not playing it fair.

276
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,279
If I'm being honest, you don't stand out.

277
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,549
Right. The more it goes on, the less noticeable you are.

278
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,820
Even though you got the ending,

279
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,279
it didn't leave any impact.

280
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,549
Actually,

281
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,720
out of the 1 minute and 30 seconds, my part is only 8 seconds.

282
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,360
- Your part?
- Right.

283
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,090
So...

284
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,320
That's not cool.

285
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,759
(She can only laugh.)

286
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,190
Here's In Jung's part.

287
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,929
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

288
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:35,799
One, two, three, four.

289
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,330
My part is pretty much nonexistent.

290
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,639
Your part has only 12 beats.

291
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,440
- In Jung.
- It's okay.

292
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,009
- Hey, it's okay.
- Gosh.

293
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,610
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

294
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,750
(In the end, she ends up in tears.)

295
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,620
No, you did well.

296
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,049
I thought we divided the song fairly.

297
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,419
I suddenly realized that compared to other girls,

298
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,889
I had a very small part.

299
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,700
Trying to get more parts against the other girls must be hard.

300
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,860
- Right.
- Seriously.

301
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,129
I was fixated on the idea that we had to perform as a team.

302
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,269
I didn't look out for myself.

303
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,769
When you take the spot in the front, you will stand out.

304
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,610
- That can also improve the quality.
- Right.

305
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,639
You can just focus on making the performance look cool.

306
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,710
I realized that I couldn't be accommodating.

307
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,679
I started to think that I needed to take more solo parts.

308
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,379
- You were so accommodating.
- Yes.

309
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,090
- I could see that in the video.
- You were way too accommodating.

310
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,190
This is a competition, after all. You must survive these challenges.

311
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,230
You're being too obliging.

312
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,690
You guys ended up with "Ice Cream" because you were accommodating.

313
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,659
- You must be stronger.
- Okay.

314
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,230
This will affect our team.

315
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,769
- I...
- Miyabi...

316
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,769
(Choking up)

317
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,570
I knew I always had to do better than the previous missions.

318
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,639
But it made me wonder...

319
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,309
how much better I had to be for the Ace Match.

320
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,450
The sense of pressure must have gotten to me.

321
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,220
I'm a bit upset.

322
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,320
You could have fought for your part.

323
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,750
(Tearing up)

324
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,320
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

325
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,419
Don't cry. Gosh, you fool.

326
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,429
(She bursts into tears as she's disappointed.)

327
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,330
- Why are you crying?
- You're upset.

328
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,000
For a second, I thought it was her makeup. Her eyeshadow.

329
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
It wasn't her makeup? She was really crying?

330
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,970
- You're upset. Of course, you are!
- I'm crying too.

331
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,399
- Gosh, seriously.
- Why am I crying?

332
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,740
- You're doing a great job.
- You're really good.

333
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,009
Don't worry.

334
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,139
Gosh. You're doing a great job.

335
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,909
Why are you crying?

336
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,009
You're doing well. You're great.

337
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,419
Being the youngest is the hardest thing ever.

338
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,220
I bet you couldn't speak up.

339
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,789
Gosh. It must have been tough, Na Ra.

340
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,259
- You can stand out, right?
- Yes.

341
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,389
- You can do this.
- Right.

342
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,429
To be honest, I was a bit upset...

343
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,759
that I couldn't get more parts for myself.

344
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,669
The masters saw right through me, so I was grateful too.

345
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,639
I was bottling up my disappointment. That's when it sort of unleashed.

346
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,370
(After getting the feedback, the 5 of them gather again.)

347
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,450
(The ace dancers can't bring up the topic.)

348
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,750
(Glancing)

349
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,850
I think we might have decided too rashly.

350
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,090
I think we need to revise them clearly.

351
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,289
I'm wondering if we can take more parts.

352
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,929
(More parts?)

353
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,730
(What should I say?)

354
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,730
As for the intro,

355
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,799
I can start it. Then Ga Young can take over.

356
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,029
After that, you can have your part.

357
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,340
Actually, since you guys want the intro,

358
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,370
you guys can take the entire intro.

359
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,080
- Can I take a part toward the end?
- Taking that part...

360
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,909
Would that be okay with you?

361
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,120
Then Na Ra is taking too many highlights.

362
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Right.

363
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,590
Wait.

364
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,820
(Will that be okay?)

365
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,460
I think it's very risky for us to let her take the latter part.

366
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,799
I don't think we should let her.

367
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,929
- She easily grabs attention.
- Like I told you...

368
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,340
(At that moment, it seems Miyabi has something to say.)

369
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,769
I know it's short,

370
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,240
but is it possible to divide the last part in half?

371
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:08,309
Should we just take the intro and ending?

372
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,409
Just the intro and the ending.

373
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,580
Or can I take the last part?

374
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,850
Can we change after that?

375
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,289
Actually, if you think about it, you have a lot of parts.

376
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,549
- They are long too.
- You do.

377
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,090
I think it will be better if someone else takes that part.

378
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,190
(Disappointed and upset)

379
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,100
Due to the nature of the battle, getting a lot of parts...

380
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,629
is imperative to win.

381
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,529
I wanted to divide the parts evenly.

382
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,629
But at the same time,

383
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,539
I didn't want another dancer to take the highlight.

384
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,440
I was utterly conflicted.

385
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,009
(It's not easy to divide the parts for the Ace Match.)

386
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,080
What should we do?

387
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,149
(It's not easy to divide the parts for the Ace Match.)

388
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,950
(What's the result of the battle among the ace dancers for parts?)

389
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,789
The five ace dancers prepared the Ace Match.

390
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:53,059
Their performance of Lisa's song "MONEY" will begin.

391
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,190
- Let's go!
- You got this!

392
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,200
Ready?

393
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,330
- Fight!
- Let's go.

394
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,200
(Let's go, ace dancers!)

395
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:02,970
Let's go!

396
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,299
- You got this!
- Let's go!

397
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,169
Let's do this!

398
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,769
(It's starting.)

399
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,809
- There it is.
- It's starting.

400
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:10,909
Show them!

401
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,740
Gosh. Oh, no. It's finally starting.

402
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,549
Let's go.

403
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,149
Please do well.

404
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,649
Gosh, the girls must be nervous.

405
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,350
As I'm here on behalf of Team 1MILLION,

406
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,789
I want to win first place,

407
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,620
so I can give our team the most extra points.

408
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,059
If our team ends up ranking the lowest,

409
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,759
we won't be able to join the finals.

410
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll do my best to win first place in this battle.

411
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm confident that I won't lose out even if I'm the youngest.

412
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,299
I don't want to burden my team.

413
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,769
I'll give it my all.

414
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,210
Like the ace dancer of Team BEBE,

415
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,110
I'll win no matter what.

416
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:50,409
(The dancers from each team quietly watch their performance.)

417
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,549
("MONEY" by Lisa, choreo by Team Ace Dancers)

418
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,419
(Screaming)

419
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,320
(They're already killing it.)

420
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,369
- That's it, In Jung!
- Yes!

421
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,970
(There it is. It's her signature, the square-shaped mouth.)

422
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,369
- That's intense.
- Hey.

423
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,609
Her facial expressions are so good.

424
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,680
(Way to go, Ga Young.)

425
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,789
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

426
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,690
(That's our Miyabi!)

427
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,839
She's so good!

428
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,839
Everyone is great.

429
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,380
- That's it, Na Ra.
- Yes!

430
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,990
(Na Ra is smashing it!)

431
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,890
That's it.

432
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,559
Gosh. Her tongue!

433
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,430
In Jung!

434
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,069
(Great job, Joo Bin!)

435
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,640
You rock!

436
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

437
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,680
Let's go, In Jung!

438
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,309
That's it!

439
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,480
Keep going!

440
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,759
(Their performance is insane!)

441
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,789
(Let's bring up...)

442
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,460
(the heat!)

443
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,630
She did it.

444
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,309
(Squealing)

445
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,910
(I love that move!)

446
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,619
(Amazed)

447
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,029
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

448
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,430
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

449
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,329
- You were great!
- You killed it!

450
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,900
Girls, you were amazing!

451
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,210
- Our ace dancers are so cool!
- Go, aces!

452
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,339
Nice, ladies.

453
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,980
(She's still captivated by Na Ra's move.)

454
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,140
Gosh, she's so good.

455
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,049
- Their power is amazing.
- The girls were on another level.

456
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,220
Well done.

457
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,549
That's impressive.

458
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,549
- They must've worked really hard.
- You guys rock!

459
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,250
They are called the ace dancers for a reason.

460
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,390
(Holding her facial expression to the end)

461
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,460
Well done!

462
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,660
- Well done!
- Gosh.

463
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,230
They were amazing.

464
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,960
When I saw In Jung dancing her heart out,

465
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,299
I got emotional.

466
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,369
I just thought that In Jung was going to win first place.

467
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,299
Na Ra had such an expressive face.

468
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,539
She stood out even next to these older dancers.

469
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,670
Why do I feel like I just performed? Why am I exhausted?

470
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,240
Gosh, Na Ra.

471
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,880
Round One, the Ace Match,

472
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,779
of the Girl Group Choreography Mission is over now.

473
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,950
You can only vote for one ace dancer...

474
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,750
whom you thought performed the best.

475
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,059
Please vote for your best ace dancer.

476
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,089
You will have 60 seconds. Then let us begin the vote.

477
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,589
(The audience will start voting for Round 1.)

478
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,130
Gosh, how can I vote?

479
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,599
I'm really nervous.

480
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,730
I'm nervous.

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,329
But all five of them have different styles.

482
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,500
Trying to figure out how the audience took it...

483
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,740
is quite difficult.

484
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,809
Five, four,

485
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,980
- three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

486
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,140
The voting is closed now.

487
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,579
(The votes have been counted with observers in attendance.)

488
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,049
(Good work!)

489
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,549
You guys were amazing!

490
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm curious to hear from the masters...

491
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,190
what they thought of the performance.

492
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,690
(How will the masters evaluate the performance?)

493
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,230
The five of them...

494
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,759
should form a girl group.

495
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,630
This elite group of dancers put on the best performance.

496
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,839
If I had any money in my pocket, I'd like to give some to them.

497
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,140
Congratulations!

498
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,440
Money!

499
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,339
When each dancer took the center stage,

500
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,640
I could clearly feel that...

501
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,450
their styles were perfect for the song...

502
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,950
which made their performance really cool.

503
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,279
I'm sure it was tough...

504
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,420
to perform as a group since all of them were ace dancers.

505
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm sure it was difficult to express their opinions openly...

506
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,160
or accept each other's feedback.

507
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,890
But you guys did a great job at making this fair for everyone.

508
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,359
Considering the fact that you created this cool performance,

509
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,500
I would like to compliment all of you for your hard work.

510
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,900
I would also like to say how amazing you were.

511
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,400
Thank you for the heartwarming feedback.

512
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,240
I will now announce the results for Round One, the Ace Match,

513
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,470
of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

514
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,170
(He'll reveal the results now?)

515
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,210
- Oh, my goodness!
- No!

516
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,740
(What are the results of Round 1, the Ace Match?)

517
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,150
The numbers are going up.

518
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,250
(I'm not going to watch this.)

519
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,250
- Wait.
- You won't tell us the results?

520
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:57,549
- Seriously?
- When can we find out then?

521
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,119
I guess Joo Bin will tell us the results when she comes in.

522
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,130
Gosh, that's really cruel.

523
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,089
- I'm so nervous. What is this?
- I can't watch this.

524
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,130
I wasn't this nervous...

525
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,529
- even when we were performing.
- Right.

526
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,230
My heart is beating so fast.

527
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,029
Gosh. This is the longest minute.

528
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,569
I can't watch this.

529
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,039
(Utterly nervous)

530
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,170
I bet she won.

531
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,470
- In Jung only stood out.
- Right.

532
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:17,740
- By far, she was the best.
- Seriously.

533
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,640
Na Ra and In Jung...

534
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,740
- stood out so much.
- In Jung...

535
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,910
Let me carefully guess the ranks.

536
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,210
In Jung probably won first place.

537
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,779
- Na Ra for second place.
- I agree.

538
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,150
Please.

539
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,319
I thought I delivered lively dancing moves...

540
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,220
and vivid facial expressions.

541
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,529
I might be able to aim for a high rank.

542
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,960
I used all of my energy and gave my all...

543
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,329
to this performance in my opinion.

544
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,359
So I'm feeling confident.

545
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,829
This could decide the fate of my team.

546
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,099
I had a lot on my mind.

547
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,500
The other ace dancers were amazing.

548
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,170
I wasn't sure how this would turn out.

549
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,309
(We're so nervous.)

550
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,579
Come on now.

551
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,009
(Surprised)

552
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:58,319
- Gosh. That's a huge jump.
- Gosh.

553
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,680
That's huge.

554
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,250
(Everyone is surprised by the results of the voting.)

555
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,660
(The ace dancers come back to the green rooms.)

556
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,059
- Well done.
- What place?

557
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,029
- Why are you crying?
- Well done.

558
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,130
- Well done.
- Well done.

559
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,670
- You were great.
- Hey.

560
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,369
- You were amazing.
- Well done.

561
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,440
(The members comfort the ace dancers who worked hard.)

562
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Joo Bin. Tell us the results.

563
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,609
- Guess my rank.
- Again?

564
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,509
Of course, to us, you're the winner.

565
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,680
- Tell us.
- The result is...

566
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,809
(Curious)

567
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,309
But...

568
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,220
The 1st and 5th places have a huge score difference.

569
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,289
The score difference is 94 points.

570
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,319
(Did she say 94 points?)

571
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,759
The 1st place took 99 points.

572
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,960
Who got first?

573
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,859
(Who's the ace dancer that took 1st place and 99 points?)

574
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,029
The dancer in first place...

575
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,460
(Who's the ace dancer that took 1st place and 99 points?)

576
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,559
The dancer in first place...

577
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,859
(Who's the ace dancer that took 1st place and 99 points?)

578
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,000
is me.

579
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,799
It's me.

580
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,269
(Make some noise!)

581
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,869
Let's go, winner!

582
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,369
Let's go, winner!

583
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,809
(Na Ra won 1st place in the Ace Match.)

584
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,480
(Utterly surprised)

585
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,480
(Really?)

586
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,319
I was over the moon because it felt like I was validated as a dancer.

587
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,190
I would like to thank the other dancers...

588
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,720
of Team Ace Dancers who helped me improve as a dancer.

589
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,059
Oh, no. I might start crying.

590
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,329
Yoon In Jung, the ace dancer of Team 1MILLION,

591
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,029
received 70 votes.

592
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,470
- Well done.
- Well done.

593
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,529
Miyabi, the ace dancer of Team JAM REPUBLIC,

594
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,140
received 32 votes.

595
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,140
Lee Ga Young, the ace dancer of Team BEBE,

596
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,609
received 25 points.

597
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,910
The ace dancer with the lowest number of votes...

598
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,410
was Lee Joo Bin of Team HOOK.

599
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,250
Oh, no. Poor Joo Bin.

600
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,380
She's shocked.

601
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,349
Anyway, these five votes...

602
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,549
could affect the result...

603
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,420
of our team performance.

604
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,960
I mostly felt sorry to my team.

605
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,599
But here's the problem. The benefit for first place...

606
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,829
Don't tell me she gets to decide the order.

607
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,299
- No way.
- She will decide...

608
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,829
the order of today's semi-finals.

609
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,130
Gosh, that's crazy.

610
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,940
(Shocked)

611
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,140
Like right now?

612
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,309
That's scary.

613
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,539
I wonder which place we'll be placed in.

614
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,039
She'll be strategic again, right?

615
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,549
Personally, I want them to start first.

616
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,710
I agree.

617
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,920
Here's what I know for sure.

618
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,150
I want us to go after this team.

619
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,349
I agree.

620
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,619
(What's the order of the performances...)

621
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,160
(Team MANNEQUEEN decided on?)

622
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,759
We will now begin...

623
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,529
Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

624
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,829
Okay. Round Two.

625
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,829
Round Two of this mission...

626
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:28,160
will be the Group Match.

627
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,900
(At last!)

628
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,039
This is the highlight.

629
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,140
- The Group Match.
- Yes.

630
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,539
Gosh. I'm nervous!

631
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:36,940
- Yes, let's do this.
- Let's go.

632
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:39,940
As for Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission,

633
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,609
each team chose one song...

634
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,410
out of the five songs...

635
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,250
from the beloved girl groups of the public.

636
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,450
They were required to interpret the songs in their own styles.

637
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,119
They must show the best performance to win this round.

638
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,920
Here's the team that will go first.

639
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,519
(Nervous)

640
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,359
(It can't be us, right?)

641
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,859
It's...

642
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,500
(After the Ace Match, Round 1...)

643
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,230
- This will tell us our order.
- Come on.

644
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,930
Let's not check.

645
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,640
(Each team was informed about their order of Round 2.)

646
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,140
What if we end up going first?

647
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,509
- Come on.
- Okay.

648
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,839
(I hope it's not us.)

649
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,640
(The leader will check it first.)

650
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,710
(What?)

651
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,250
(What is it?)

652
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,920
- Hey, you...
- You're acting, aren't you?

653
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
What?

654
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,619
- I see.
- What?

655
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,920
(Covering her mouth)

656
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,759
(No one expected this team to go first.)

657
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,289
What is it?

658
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,789
Team HOOK is going first.

659
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,230
Number one, Team HOOK.

660
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,730
Come on. Team MANNEQUEEN. I feel so betrayed.

661
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,170
How could they do this to us?

662
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,500
Here's what I think. This might be the best.

663
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,809
Let's put strong teams behind us.

664
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,869
We should make mediocre teams perform before us.

665
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:45,880
- Great.
- That way,

666
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,109
we'll seem better compared to them.

667
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,549
Personally, I want Team HOOK to go first.

668
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,710
I agree.

669
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,809
Great.

670
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,150
Team HOOK.

671
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,920
- I knew it. I told you!
- Gosh.

672
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,119
Let's go!

673
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,589
- Okay.
- Team HOOK!

674
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,089
- Team HOOK.
- Okay.

675
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,589
I had a feeling.

676
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,029
Going first is great.

677
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,359
Okay.

678
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,369
(Screaming)

679
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,170
(Team HOOK cheerfully comes up to the stage.)

680
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,839
You guys look adorable!

681
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,369
Look at their hair!

682
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,109
- What is this?
- What?

683
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,740
- Look at their wigs!
- What?

684
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,750
Where did they buy those wigs? Gosh.

685
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,049
- How pretty.
- Gosh.

686
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,279
Their rainbow wigs are so pretty.

687
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,980
- I love it.
- Yes.

688
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,920
The performance we prepared is...

689
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,319
(Curious and looking forward)

690
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,319
- I'm so curious.
- Tell us already.

691
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,890
The songs for the Group Match...

692
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,259
of the Girl Group Choreography Mission will be revealed now.

693
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,670
(A total of 5 songs from girl groups were revealed.)

694
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,470
Gosh, no way.

695
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,539
(Team HOOK gets hooked on one specific song.)

696
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,039
Gosh. What if we end up with that?

697
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,240
Never.

698
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,279
The song itself is great.

699
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,609
- It's a cute song.
- Right.

700
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,950
But I thought it would be so hard for us to pull it off.

701
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,279
That crossed my mind.

702
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,220
I'm fine as long as we don't get "I AM."

703
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,250
- I agree.
- "I AM..."

704
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,250
- We just have to avoid that.
- That's the only cute song.

705
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,319
- Not "I AM." - What do you think about "I AM"?

706
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,359
- Do you all not like it?
- That's not the right song for us.

707
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,329
Team 1MILLION who won first place...

708
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,200
will get to pick first.

709
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,799
Wait.

710
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,529
(It means Team HOOK won't get to choose.)

711
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,269
The song Team 1MILLION chose is...

712
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,799
"Monster" by Irene and Seulgi.

713
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,009
We chose "Illusion" by aespa.

714
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,339
We chose "UNFORGIVEN" by LE SSERAFIM.

715
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,880
Darn it. We'll end up with "I AM."

716
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,880
- The song Team MANNEQUEEN chose...
- Hi.

717
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,319
Please.

718
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,950
I'm sorry. We chose...

719
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,390
"MY BAG" by (G)I-DLE.

720
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,359
That's my life

721
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,190
(In despair)

722
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,690
(In denial)

723
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,829
To be honest, I'm very worried.

724
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,400
When we performed "Classroom Idea,"

725
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,329
we totally botched it.

726
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,369
We also struggled when we performed "Seven."

727
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,410
(BTS Performance Group, ranked 6th)

728
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,039
We advanced to this point through the Elimination Battle.

729
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,309
After the Elimination Battle,

730
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,980
we thought we were finally getting some breathing room.

731
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,380
(The street dancers are facing another struggle.)

732
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,250
To us, it's not a matter of confidence.

733
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,920
- We just have to do it.
- Right.

734
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,660
We must die trying if we have to.

735
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,259
Girls, should we start practicing?

736
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,029
(Team HOOK is about to start practicing.)

737
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,900
Colors are changing every day

738
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,970
(What is Chae Hyung holding?)

739
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,640
(A rope?)

740
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,710
We ended up using a rope for this mission.

741
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,910
People nowadays are fatigued and losing sight of who they are.

742
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,309
To compare the people to broken dolls,

743
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,710
we made a bold decision of using a rope.

744
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,009
(They use the rope as their key prop.)

745
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,220
Should we give it a try this time?

746
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,089
(Team HOOK starts practicing in earnest.)

747
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,619
(At that moment...)

748
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,019
The masters are here.

749
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,190
Hi.

750
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

751
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,329
Good work, girls. I can smell your passion.

752
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,599
Can you show us what you have so far?

753
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,759
- Yes.
- We'd like to watch it.

754
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,069
(They perform for the first time from start to finish...)

755
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,230
(with the masters watching.)

756
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,269
Keep the formation.

757
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,799
Pretend as if you're performing for real. Do the facial expressions.

758
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

759
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,640
(The dancers start the choreography in a serious manner.)

760
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,420
(Focused)

761
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,980
(Serious)

762
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,759
(Team HOOK performs without any mistakes.)

763
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

764
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:33,470
(But the masters aren't responsive.)

765
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,839
(Serious)

766
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,670
(Nervous)

767
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,779
I have a question for you guys.

768
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,480
Are you okay if you get eliminated after this?

769
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,509
(Shocked)

770
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,549
(At the mention of the elimination, the atmosphere gets cold.)

771
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,990
- No.
- No.

772
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,559
You cannot perform like this.

773
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,029
There was no acting.

774
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,099
I didn't see any techniques either.

775
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,299
Using props was good.

776
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,769
I could see that something was stopping you guys.

777
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,369
So this block you have...

778
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,039
You can't overcome it like this.

779
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,779
You can't get past it.

780
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,750
I don't want you to put on any sub-par performance...

781
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,019
that would just end up helping the other teams go to the finals.

782
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:21,819
(Surprised)

783
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,190
We're in trouble.

784
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,089
Even for our K-pop Choreography Mission,

785
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,029
Aiki didn't get mad despite how we did.

786
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,289
When we performed "Seven,"

787
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,160
we were revising our moves until the last minute...

788
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,960
and she still wasn't angry with us.

789
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,430
But today, she told us she was angry with us...

790
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,400
for the first time.

791
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,109
That's what made us realize the seriousness of it even more.

792
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:47,609
- At this rate...
- They really could be eliminated.

793
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,180
When these girls find their groove,

794
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,619
they're able to interpret things according to their own styles.

795
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,319
It was really obvious that it hadn't happened.

796
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,849
They've lost their way.

797
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,059
We need to help them, one way or another.

798
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,519
- Want to watch it together?
- Yes.

799
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,690
(HOOK's masters are taking extraordinary measures.)

800
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,660
You should change the intro a bit to be flashier.

801
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,859
If you listen to the background instrumentals,

802
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,630
there are a lot of things you can use to your advantage.

803
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,240
You have to make people hear the beats they don't usually hear.

804
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,509
You've matched your moves to the lyrics, which people know.

805
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,509
That's why it can feel boring.

806
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,750
(She helps them realize what they didn't notice before.)

807
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,779
The way you step out here is well-structured.

808
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,880
But you have to do more acting or something here.

809
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,450
Just putting your hand on top feels a little lacking.

810
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,589
I understand what you mean.

811
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,660
I didn't know we'd have to change so much of our choreography.

812
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,130
I think we'll have to redo everything from start to finish.

813
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,460
(The masters haven't addressed all of their concerns yet.)

814
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,400
Should we totally change their entire look?

815
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,539
Skills are important too,

816
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,500
but when all five crews are there, you have to stand out.

817
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,740
Why don't you all wear wigs that really stand out?

818
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,380
(Wigs?)

819
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,109
That should be enough...

820
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,049
to change your look completely.

821
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:02,589
I think it will be a great hidden card.

822
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,690
I really want you to show a different look.

823
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,390
We should borrow outfits and use styles that are different.

824
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,289
At first, we didn't really like the wig idea.

825
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,259
The masters seemed very firm on the wigs, though,

826
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,740
so we decided to trust them and wear the wigs.

827
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,609
(Team HOOK focuses on revising their choreography after feedback.)

828
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:25,740
We changed the whole thing from start to finish.

829
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,579
(Team HOOK repeatedly watches their dance to ponder revisions.)

830
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:31,309
It's going to change a lot.

831
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,920
We'll develop it further to show you a great performance.

832
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,049
I think a lot of the other crews...

833
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,950
think of us as the weakest one.

834
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,390
That has nothing to do with us.

835
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,990
"They performed 'I AM' like that?"

836
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,430
"Only they could've pulled it off." That's what we want to hear.

837
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,829
(She wants to hear that only Team HOOK could do this.)

838
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,500
Their performance will begin now.

839
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,869
(They're wearing those wigs for "I AM"?)

840
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:56,039
The appeal of an unexpected twist!

841
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,569
(The audience members look forward to it too.)

842
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,009
My hands are sweaty.

843
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,509
- I'm looking forward to this.
- It's going to be so entertaining.

844
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,880
- What is that?
- They're using a prop.

845
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,219
Is that a rope?

846
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,119
- Amazing.
- For "I AM"?

847
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,219
They're draping the rope over themselves.

848
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,420
If they make a mistake, it'll be terrible.

849
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,289
Please do well.

850
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,329
- Don't panic. Stay calm.
- Stay calm.

851
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,599
I only received five votes in the Ace Match.

852
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,199
Even if I collapse from using up all of my energy,

853
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm going to get the votes in the Group Match.

854
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,039
We'll show a perfect performance this time.

855
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,969
We will definitely make it to the finals.

856
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,179
(Can Team HOOK overcome their crisis?)

857
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,750
("I AM" by IVE, Choreo by Team HOOK)

858
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,230
(Standing up automatically)

859
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,539
(Amazed)

860
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,380
- They did so well.
- My gosh.

861
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,449
- It's so good.
- Amazing!

862
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,230
(Getting chills)

863
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,000
Ga Hyun!

864
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,219
That's it!

865
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,590
That's why

866
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:23,150
(HOOK's masters are overwhelmed by emotion while seeing the girls.)

867
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,449
(Focused)

868
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,500
(Moved)

869
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,869
Holy...

870
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:42,510
Let's go!

871
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,250
(Cheering)

872
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,619
My gosh.

873
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,219
- Go!
- Do more!

874
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,599
Galaxy!

875
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,300
(The galaxy looks insane!)

876
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:15,199
- Why do I feel so emotional?
- I know, right?

877
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,510
Maybe because of the song?

878
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,239
(Screaming)

879
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,289
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

880
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,300
(Overwhelmed by emotion)

881
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,030
(HOOK's masters stop holding back their tears after the performance.)

882
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,000
(That was amazing!)

883
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,500
Unbelievable.

884
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,409
Well done, ladies!

885
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,079
(Team HOOK showed a flawless, perfect performance.)

886
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,309
You did so great!

887
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,679
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

888
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,019
- What was that?
- I'm so sad. Why am I so sad?

889
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,019
- Was "I AM" always so sad?
- They did so well.

890
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,190
- That was amazing.
- They looked so cool.

891
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,820
- I'm so sad.
- Are you crying?

892
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,989
The "I AM" performance...

893
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,929
was so similar to the evolution of Team HOOK themselves.

894
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,599
They captured the journey Team HOOK took to get here.

895
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,199
I think that's why it was moving to all of us.

896
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,909
- I'm starting to tear up.
- Me too.

897
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,639
This was so moving. I'm tearing up.

898
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,079
(Getting teary)

899
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,750
Why are we crying?

900
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,750
(The HOOK masters are already sobbing.)

901
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,349
The masters are crying.

902
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:38,949
(Discovering the masters crying)

903
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,059
All of the masters were crying.

904
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,960
It wasn't just our masters.

905
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,159
Even the other teams' masters were all crying,

906
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,860
which dumbfounded us.

907
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,230
We just saw Team HOOK"s performance...

908
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,300
for Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission Group Match.

909
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,340
You did great.

910
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,369
(You did so great.)

911
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:59,039
- They did so great.
- Great job.

912
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,440
They made history with this.

913
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,480
- That dance for this song? No way.
- It's ridiculous.

914
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,380
Now it's time to vote.

915
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,750
If you thought Team HOOK showed a great performance,

916
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,389
please press the "O" button.

917
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,559
The voting begins now.

918
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,960
(The votes have been counted with observers in attendance.)

919
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,829
I'm so proud of them. I thought they'd have a hard time.

920
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
They did so well.

921
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,329
Their performance really moved people's hearts,

922
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:27,300
so I think they'll get many votes. They also performed well.

923
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,739
I would vote for them if it were me.

924
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,340
- So would I.
- Me too.

925
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,170
No, they're not going home.

926
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,809
The voting for Team HOOK is now over.

927
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,210
Five, four,

928
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,150
three, two, one.

929
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,079
The voting is now over.

930
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,820
- You worked so hard!
- You worked so hard!

931
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,260
- You worked hard!
- You did so great.

932
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,989
I'm curious what the masters thought of that performance.

933
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,829
First, master Aiki of Team HOOK,

934
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:53,829
what did you think of their performance?

935
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:54,829
(What did Aiki think of this performance?)

936
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,469
When we...

937
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,070
saw this...

938
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,510
Just a minute.

939
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,269
(Becoming overcome by emotion)

940
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,780
Don't cry.

941
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,579
(The HOOK masters can't speak as they're overcome by emotion.)

942
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,610
Don't cry.

943
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,219
(She spoke strongly on purpose,)

944
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,420
(afraid the team would be eliminated.)

945
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,420
(Master Aiki gave feedback with all her heart.)

946
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,090
(We went through a lot of trials.)

947
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:30,269
(Team HOOK worked hard till the end, never despairing.)

948
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,199
(After seeing the pull through...)

949
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,469
(HOOK's masters were moved by seeing the girls do that.)

950
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
You'll see when you watch the show,

951
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,679
but these girls are people...

952
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,550
who find it hard to pull off what they did tonight.

953
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:44,210
It's not just about the change in their look.

954
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,750
These girls accepted everything we asked of them, so we're thankful.

955
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,920
For the first time,

956
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,719
we really felt like masters.

957
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,489
That's why...

958
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,460
we're so grateful you came to Team HOOK.

959
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,960
(Moved)

960
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,599
(Team HOOK and the HOOK masters truly became one team.)

961
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,739
- Gosh, I'm tearing up at that.
- It's so moving.

962
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,570
I'm so glad you took that route and didn't try...

963
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,539
to fit into any mold of what you were expected to do.

964
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,139
The story you told was beautiful...

965
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,579
and you executed it well.

966
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,050
Your movement quality was great.

967
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,320
Your performance was great.

968
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,449
Your costumes and wigs were great.

969
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:22,550
So, good job.

970
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:23,789
Well done.

971
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,420
The masters cried a lot throughout the performance.

972
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,190
I think how they expressed the emotions and story...

973
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,059
was perfect.

974
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:38,369
The movements weren't one-dimensional.

975
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,440
They were expressed in various ways...

976
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,300
that I couldn't even make a noise from start to finish.

977
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,440
It was perfect.

978
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:50,150
During the Ace Match, Round One of Girl Group Choreography Mission,

979
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,579
Ace Lee Joo Bin received five points.

980
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,349
What will be their final score with the votes from Round Two?

981
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,090
And will Team HOOK get to advance to the finals?

982
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,889
The result...

983
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,690
Now? Later?

984
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,269
It will be revealed shortly.

985
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,269
Team HOOK, you may leave the stage.

986
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:13,300
Good work.

987
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,900
Good work!

988
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,969
Good job.

989
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,710
You did so well. You're awesome. You're unbelievably cool!

990
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,710
I want that wig!

991
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,980
Good job.

992
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,380
(They burst out crying as soon as they leave the stage.)

993
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,380
I'm choked up with various emotions.

994
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,750
I was actually worried a lot,

995
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,119
but as I was dancing,

996
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,860
I felt so happy.

997
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,460
It's a competition in a sense.

998
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,369
It's a first for me to deliver emotions...

999
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:47,139
to this point in a competition.

1000
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,869
I was fascinated by the fact that our intention...

1001
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:52,469
was conveyed well.

1002
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,150
They got us big.

1003
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,179
It felt like a heavy blow.

1004
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,650
This was the first performance?

1005
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,380
My arms shake.

1006
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,820
This is not easy.

1007
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:08,119
The masters cried already from the first performance.

1008
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,090
Do you feel threatened?

1009
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,329
(Nodding)

1010
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,929
Round Two, the Group Match...

1011
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,030
of Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1012
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,769
The next performance.

1013
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,300
(It might be our team, right?)

1014
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:22,000
It will be done by Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1015
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:24,210
It will be done by Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1016
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,280
Let's go!

1017
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:27,739
Let's go.

1018
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,139
I can't wait.

1019
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Go!

1020
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,949
(Team JAM REPUBLIC enters the stage as they receive a cheer.)

1021
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:39,960
Gosh, their outfits are all...

1022
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,860
Are those ninja outfits?

1023
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,659
She wears two caps no matter what.

1024
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,659
How unique. They all have a distinct concept.

1025
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,860
Hey, guys. We are...

1026
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,769
- Team JAM REPUBLIC.
- Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1027
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,300
(How cool.)

1028
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,199
(Go, Team JAM REPUBLIC.)

1029
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,639
But why are there five of them?

1030
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,369
(What?)

1031
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,610
One is missing.

1032
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,940
You're right.

1033
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,340
- Who's missing.
- Everyone...

1034
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,150
Team JAM REPUBLIC started off with seven members.

1035
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,949
But only five members will perform this time.

1036
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,179
What happened?

1037
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,690
(They became less in number again. What happened to them?)

1038
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,150
Hi, everyone.

1039
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,559
This is Nika from Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1040
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,030
There has been a family emergency which is leading me to fly home.

1041
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,760
I wish good luck to every other team participating.

1042
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,230
Just keep fighting.

1043
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Bye.

1044
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,400
(Nika had to leave the team due to her sudden situation.)

1045
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,300
Okay, let's figure this out.

1046
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's practice room)

1047
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,670
Even if we have five people, if we do it like them...

1048
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,639
- Right, that's five anyway.
- Yes.

1049
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,210
We have to do this mission as five members.

1050
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,179
Coming up with formations and stuff will be harder for us than others,

1051
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,349
but we'll do our best.

1052
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,019
Seven, eight. Face.

1053
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,889
(The 5 of them begin practicing for real.)

1054
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:49,119
(They continue under Eun Woo's direction.)

1055
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,130
Turn.

1056
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,929
(Dilly-dally)

1057
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:53,929
Bella.

1058
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:55,829
Hey, you youngest girl.

1059
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:00,769
- "Youngest." - Let's go again from the turn.

1060
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,809
I expected it wouldn't be easy.

1061
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,380
Our teamwork wasn't as solid as before.

1062
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,349
I could sense it as we practiced.

1063
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,019
Bella started taking a lot of breaks.

1064
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:16,550
And the rest of us were confused to see her.

1065
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,590
(Bella suddenly leaves the room in the middle of practicing.)

1066
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,329
(She doesn't come back even after a long time.)

1067
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,230
After Nika left our team,

1068
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,969
she probably felt restless.

1069
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,869
I saw that she was losing focus.

1070
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,869
(Not interested)

1071
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:40,340
Bella lost the only teammate that had made it through.

1072
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,050
So she probably felt lost.

1073
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:46,079
You know, she only had Nika from En Beatz.

1074
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,019
I'm concerned if it will be okay this way.

1075
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,989
(Eun Woo gathered the team to resolve the situation.)

1076
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:57,030
I think you should practice more.

1077
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,690
That's what I'm saying.

1078
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,000
When we're making formations,

1079
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
that's your time to practice.

1080
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,300
I thought I should be harsh...

1081
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,039
even if it hurt her feelings.

1082
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,239
Before you're a 13-year-old,

1083
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,840
you came here to dance.

1084
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,780
I want to talk to my mom.

1085
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,119
What do you mean? Just tell us.

1086
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,750
I want to.

1087
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:32,090
(She ends up leaving the room in tears.)

1088
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,369
(Slamming)

1089
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,139
I felt bad.

1090
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,440
She was like a younger sister.

1091
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,480
I wondered if I was too harsh on her.

1092
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,809
What should we do?

1093
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,920
I didn't feel so good.

1094
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,889
I felt like I'd burst out crying in a second.

1095
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,920
But I didn't want my teammates to see me cry.

1096
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:03,030
(Miyabi leaves the practice room too.)

1097
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,860
My friend from my original crew...

1098
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,369
had left which was really hard for me.

1099
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,869
She was my best friend for all of the time.

1100
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:21,079
I think it was probably not the best thing to do,

1101
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,179
but I left the room just so I could calm myself down.

1102
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,619
(She came back after a long while.)

1103
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,789
(Glancing)

1104
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:34,760
(She quietly approaches and hands something to them.)

1105
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,690
(A translating app)

1106
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,130
(What is it?)

1107
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,400
(Probably because she's embarrassed, she pretends to be indifferent.)

1108
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:46,739
Bella said,

1109
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,340
"I'm sorry I made things so big."

1110
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,940
"I know I'm not good enough,"

1111
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,840
"but I'll do the best I can."

1112
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,280
"Let's work hard and win this competition."

1113
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:58,050
(Miyabi reads her sincere message for a long time.)

1114
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,309
(Thumbs up)

1115
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,590
For the first time, I learned what was on Bella's mind.

1116
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,190
I thought when something happened,

1117
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,320
we should talk to each other or something...

1118
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,960
to resolve it one by one right away.

1119
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,630
Since we're a team,

1120
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,500
we should understand each other's feelings.

1121
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,739
Or it will be hard to perform together.

1122
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,840
So I think it's turned out so well...

1123
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,510
for our future performances.

1124
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,809
I really want to be a reliable person to them.

1125
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:37,489
And I want to show my other team members...

1126
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:40,320
that I really care and that I want to do well.

1127
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,030
(Team JAM REPUBLIC has become even tighter.)

1128
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,960
The Group Match of Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1129
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,630
What's the performance you have prepared?

1130
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,829
We've prepared LE SSERAFIM's...

1131
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,800
(Surprised)

1132
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:55,900
"UNFORGIVEN."

1133
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:59,739
(They're excited already.)

1134
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,480
(Smiling)

1135
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,940
It goes well with their outfits.

1136
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,849
Some of us flew hours here...

1137
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:08,750
from another country.

1138
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,719
Determined not to have them fly back...

1139
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,690
- How cool.
- That's cool.

1140
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,190
What a cool leader.

1141
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,260
That's how we've prepared it.

1142
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,190
She's so pretty.

1143
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,800
(All of a sudden?)

1144
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,030
It's crazy.

1145
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,030
(In love with Eun Woo)

1146
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,900
Team JAM REPUBLIC's reinterpreted version...

1147
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,840
"UNFORGIVEN" by LE SSERAFIM will begin now.

1148
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,239
Ready, fight.

1149
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,070
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1150
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,739
- Let's go.
- Do it.

1151
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:35,980
Go for it.

1152
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,110
Let's go.

1153
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:38,250
Let's go.

1154
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
I'm nervous.

1155
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,090
I wonder what kind of performance they'll make.

1156
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:46,250
Their choreography might be an unexpected one.

1157
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,829
It might be really powerful.

1158
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,429
They must've struggled with two members leaving the team.

1159
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,730
They need to fill in the void, right?

1160
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,699
Their situation goes so well with the song.

1161
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:58,699
Right.

1162
00:49:58,929 --> 00:49:59,940
I'm tearing up.

1163
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,809
It seems the leader's keeping the team going.

1164
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:07,880
I'm more nervous than I've been in any of my performances.

1165
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,750
For me, it doesn't matter what place we come.

1166
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,719
I just want us to walk off that stage...

1167
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,619
and tell ourselves that we couldn't have done any better.

1168
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:23,889
It's going to be cool.

1169
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:27,699
("UNFORGIVEN" by LE SSERAFIM, choreo by Team JAM REPUBLIC)

1170
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,139
(They're amazed from the start.)

1171
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,739
(Isn't that tutting?)

1172
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,010
It's powerful from the start.

1173
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,559
- Oh, my.
- This is crazy.

1174
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,130
(Shouting)

1175
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
They're so pretty!

1176
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:06,800
(Cheering)

1177
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,670
(Excited)

1178
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,409
How do they do it?

1179
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:20,880
All right.

1180
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,130
- Okay, guys.
- Let's go.

1181
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,500
They're using every technique possible.

1182
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,730
They did so well.

1183
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,570
Let's go, guys.

1184
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,179
(Look at Eun Woo.)

1185
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,449
(I love it.)

1186
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,599
Let's go.

1187
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,699
(Bella baby)

1188
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,349
(Shocked)

1189
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,679
(Getting goosebumps)

1190
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,019
(Marveling)

1191
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,369
Push, push.

1192
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:47,070
Let's go.

1193
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,539
(So cute.)

1194
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,380
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1195
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,610
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1196
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,519
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's performance for the Group Match is over.)

1197
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:03,179
(Nice.)

1198
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,590
(Bella's ending pose is highly addictive.)

1199
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,659
(There is another Bella over here.)

1200
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:08,860
I'm speechless.

1201
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,429
(Look at her.)

1202
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,699
(There is a buzz in the green room after Team JAM REPUBLIC's stage.)

1203
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:15,960
Her facial expression is amazing.

1204
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,269
- How are they so good?
- They were good.

1205
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:20,000
Stop being so good.

1206
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,269
I forgot they only had five members.

1207
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:26,510
They had enough energy to compete against seven people.

1208
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,440
I liked Team HOOK better.

1209
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,710
Team HOOK's stage was shocking.

1210
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,250
- I liked it better overall.
- Right?

1211
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,019
(Team HOOK and the masters are nervous...)

1212
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,119
(after Team JAM REPUBLIC's performance.)

1213
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,119
I think our team was better.

1214
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,219
- It's such a tight match.
- Seriously.

1215
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,389
- It's a tight match.
- They all came here determined.

1216
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,530
It's so tight.

1217
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,030
- We're just as good.
- We have to do well.

1218
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,329
- We're just as good.
- Right.

1219
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,400
I thought we'd be the only ones this good,

1220
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,030
- but everyone is good.
- You're right.

1221
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,440
Are they really young kids?

1222
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,500
- I don't think so.
- Seriously.

1223
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,570
They aren't kids when it comes to talent.

1224
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,610
No, they aren't.

1225
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,710
My gosh.

1226
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,039
I got goosebumps.

1227
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,920
For five girls, they filled the whole show.

1228
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,179
- It shows you don't need seven.
- Yes.

1229
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,250
(They are proud of the dancers that did so well despite a crisis.)

1230
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,789
We will end the voting for Team JAM REPUBLIC...

1231
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,929
in the Group Match, Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1232
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,800
Five, four, three, two, one.

1233
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,599
The voting is closed.

1234
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,440
You did a great job.

1235
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,309
This is the last hurdle to get to the finals.

1236
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:34,010
Please tell us how you feel about your performance...

1237
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:36,309
in the Group Match, Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1238
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,949
I've known these guys...

1239
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:40,079
for a little bit,

1240
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,250
but I feel like I've known them my whole life.

1241
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,250
We've come together...

1242
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,320
and we've become really close.

1243
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:49,690
We're all from different parts of the world.

1244
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,130
Japan, New Zealand, Australia,

1245
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,630
and Korea.

1246
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,030
But we bonded really well.

1247
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,730
Whether we make it or not,

1248
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,599
I'm so glad I got to experience it with these guys.

1249
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,039
- It just reminds me of us.
- Stop.

1250
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,239
(Tearing up)

1251
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,079
(A wave of emotions hit them as they understand the struggles.)

1252
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,309
No.

1253
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,480
(A wave of emotions hit them as they understand the struggles.)

1254
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:13,050
Are they crying?

1255
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,320
- Are you crying?
- Crying?

1256
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,889
- Don't cry.
- I think I'm going to cry again.

1257
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,550
My gosh.

1258
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,719
We love you.

1259
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,030
I just want to say what Sienna just said...

1260
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,190
reminded me our JAM REPUBLIC girls.

1261
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,630
It's the same thing we went through,

1262
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,599
many trials and tribulations, but at the end of it,

1263
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,570
I'm just so glad I got to meet these girls.

1264
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,500
We know how hard this journey...

1265
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,739
has been so far.

1266
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,710
But what you just did there,

1267
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,239
I don't think I have seen you girls go that hard.

1268
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:43,849
So just know we're really proud of you girls.

1269
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:45,110
You did amazing.

1270
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:50,690
I always really look forward...

1271
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,849
to the performances of Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1272
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,489
So I expected you to kill the stage,

1273
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,829
and starting from the quality of the intro,

1274
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,329
the way you dominate the stage,

1275
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,599
the technique, and the energy...

1276
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,530
you give off as you try to communicate with the audience...

1277
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,699
I thank you for creating such an amazing performance.

1278
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,170
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's stage ends with favorable reviews.)

1279
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,239
In the Ace Match, Round 1...

1280
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,980
of the Girl Group Choreography Mission,

1281
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,280
Ace Miyabi received...

1282
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,050
thirty-two points.

1283
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,349
After adding the votes they received in the Group Match,

1284
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:23,989
will Team JAM REPUBLIC be able to go to the finals?

1285
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,860
We will find out in a moment.

1286
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,190
Thank you.

1287
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,429
We respect you.

1288
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,099
That was cool.

1289
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,829
They were so cool.

1290
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,239
- When is our team performing?
- Team MANNEQUEEN.

1291
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,539
I think we're fourth.

1292
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:43,869
I think our team will be in the middle.

1293
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:46,670
Which team is next to perform in the Group Match, Round Two of...

1294
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,239
the Girl Group Choreography Mission?

1295
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,980
Who is it?

1296
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,280
(Team MANNEQUEEN?)

1297
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,119
(Team BEBE?)

1298
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,550
It's Team MANNEQUEEN.

1299
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,849
(They're finally performing.)

1300
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,389
(When is our team performing?)

1301
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,360
It's about time our team performed.

1302
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:08,960
When would you prefer to perform?

1303
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,300
What I had in mind...

1304
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,170
was to perform 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

1305
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,599
We'd have Team BEBE perform first.

1306
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,340
I don't think Team BEBE should become the reference point, do you?

1307
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,409
Let's have the better teams go later.

1308
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,309
We'll choose teams we think aren't as good as we are...

1309
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,550
in front of us.

1310
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,119
Team HOOK, JAM REPUBLIC, us...

1311
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,679
(Team MANNEQUEEN chose to perform in the middle.)

1312
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,349
Na Ra won 1st place in Round 1.

1313
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,619
So we were determined to be in the top ranking in Round Two.

1314
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,760
Team MANNEQUEEN, please come up to the stage.

1315
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,630
- Hip hop.
- Waacking.

1316
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:42,860
- Queen of queens.
- Queen of queens.

1317
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,969
- Top of the top.
- Top of the top.

1318
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:47,699
- Hi, we're Team MANNEQUEEN.
- Hi, we're Team MANNEQUEEN.

1319
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,139
- Gosh, she's pretty.
- She's so pretty.

1320
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:52,570
- She's so pretty.
- Did Chae Hyung look like that too?

1321
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,079
Chae Hyung is cute.

1322
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,309
Chae Hyung is also cute in a different way.

1323
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,909
- She gets more and more charming.
- You look like a baby gorilla.

1324
00:57:59,949 --> 00:58:03,949
The song Team MANNEQUEEN will be performing to...

1325
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:07,460
is "My Bag" by (G)I-DLE.

1326
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,889
("My Bag" is a good song.)

1327
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,329
My bag.

1328
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:12,960
Red five diamonds in my bag.

1329
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,429
They're dressed nicely.

1330
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:16,300
They look like mischievous kids.

1331
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,199
- Will it be hip hop?
- I think it'll be hip hop.

1332
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,170
It must be hip hop this time.

1333
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:23,469
They were all dressed like they'd do hip hop.

1334
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:26,110
I thought it might be a novel performance.

1335
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:29,610
You can look forward to a novel performance by us.

1336
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,650
(What novel performance will Team MANNQUEEN put on?)

1337
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

1338
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

1339
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:39,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

1340
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,519
- How are you?
- Good.

1341
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,559
- How are you?
- Good.

1342
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,690
How far have you gotten with "My Bag"?

1343
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:45,989
We...

1344
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,960
(We?)

1345
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,570
(Interim check of 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

1346
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,739
(Team MANNEQUEEN wasn't able to put on a complete performance.)

1347
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,070
Do you have a picture in your mind?

1348
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:01,610
(They weren't able to receive feedback from the masters.)

1349
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,349
I think it's going well.

1350
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:06,409
We're doing what we want to this time.

1351
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,050
That's right.

1352
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,150
- That's right. That's enough.
- That's the best.

1353
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,250
In our previous performances,

1354
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,090
we contemplated how to bring...

1355
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,429
hip hop and waacking together.

1356
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:23,630
(Team MANNEQUEEN focused on mixing hip hop and waacking.)

1357
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,000
(Team MANNEQUEEN focused on mixing hip hop and waacking.)

1358
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:31,409
We didn't worry about the genre for this performance.

1359
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,809
We created the dance to go with the song.

1360
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:36,079
It naturally became a performance that is mostly hip hop.

1361
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:37,809
Should we take a look at the choreography?

1362
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,050
(Team MANNEQUEEN shows the masters their dance.)

1363
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,349
(They immediately show a positive response.)

1364
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:46,849
(Look at that.)

1365
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:47,989
This is it.

1366
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:50,059
(This is it.)

1367
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:52,829
(Cheeky)

1368
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:55,400
(Why did you wait so long to show us how good you are?)

1369
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,969
(Here comes Hee Jae!)

1370
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,230
(Here comes Hye Rin!)

1371
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,599
(And here comes the tiger teacher.)

1372
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,840
That's all we have.

1373
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,880
(Their demonstration ends with the masters' cheers.)

1374
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,679
(You're so good.)

1375
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm not lying when I say this.

1376
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,780
The moment you started the intro,

1377
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,619
I felt tears in my eyes.

1378
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,449
This is perfect to grab the audience's attention.

1379
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,250
The way you created the intro...

1380
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,090
is like it was meant to bring out a response from the audience.

1381
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,920
- Thank you.
- It's so good.

1382
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,289
Okay, it's so good.

1383
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,599
I was worried they'd say...

1384
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:30,130
it wasn't good enough.

1385
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,369
But they kept saying they liked it.

1386
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:33,699
So I was relieved.

1387
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:35,940
It feels like you're bringing the song to life...

1388
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,469
with your dance.

1389
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,239
The other teams are in big trouble.

1390
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,710
If we just do as we practiced,

1391
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,550
I think we can win first place.

1392
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,579
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1393
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,320
Let's go, guys.

1394
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,349
- I can't wait to see this.
- Me too.

1395
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:55,590
I was hoping they'd go with this vibe.

1396
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,190
- They did it.
- I love it.

1397
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,889
Since Na Ra won first place,

1398
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,900
we don't know how the ranking will change.

1399
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,030
Let's go.

1400
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:05,000
(Everyone has their guard up against Team MANNEQUEEN...)

1401
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,670
(because Na Ra won 1st place in the Ace Match.)

1402
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,409
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1403
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,409
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1404
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,880
Let's go.

1405
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,139
- They're so chill.
- It's a back alley hip hop vibe.

1406
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,710
I think this will be cool.

1407
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,449
We didn't try to mix the things we are good at,

1408
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:23,949
but tried to make the dance fit the song.

1409
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:26,750
I think we came up with choreography...

1410
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,659
that is a way higher quality than we expected.

1411
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,260
I think we'll win 1st or 2nd today.

1412
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:33,929
Let's go.

1413
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:36,699
- Let's go.
- Please.

1414
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:37,769
Enjoy it.

1415
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,639
- Have fun.
- You can do this. Let's do it.

1416
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:43,000
They'll probably have an amazing intro.

1417
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,510
- They always have a good intro.
- I'm looking forward to it.

1418
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,210
(Expectations)

1419
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,610
(Curious)

1420
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,050
("MY BAG" by (G)I-DLE, Choreo by Team MANNEQUEEN)

1421
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,550
(Screaming)

1422
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,460
(Make some noise.)

1423
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,929
(They always have amazing intros.)

1424
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,500
This is it.

1425
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,059
(She covers her mouth in shock.)

1426
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,079
(They're cool and pretty.)

1427
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,280
- That's so pretty.
- That's pretty.

1428
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,550
- How is she so pretty?
- She's really pretty.

1429
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:32,650
Is this to show off her face?

1430
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,630
My gosh.

1431
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,630
(What's with the facial expressions?)

1432
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:56,880
That's so hip.

1433
01:02:57,179 --> 01:02:59,179
- They just went with hip hop.
- That's right.

1434
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:01,119
Even the waackers are good.

1435
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,190
(Electrifying)

1436
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:20,940
(She loves it.)

1437
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,000
(Marveling)

1438
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,039
That's insane.

1439
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,070
(Good.)

1440
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,110
(Harimu showers them with applause.)

1441
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,750
(Gosh, over there!)

1442
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,250
She's a queen.

1443
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,420
(Queen Dan Bi emerges!)

1444
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,489
(Marveling)

1445
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:45,960
The choreography is awesome.

1446
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,639
(Marveling)

1447
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,309
(Our youngest is doing great.)

1448
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:09,849
(Screaming)

1449
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,789
Hey, hey, hey.

1450
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,469
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1451
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:31,440
("My Bag" by Team MANNEQUEEN is over!)

1452
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,909
(They killed it.)

1453
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,579
You're even better than I am.

1454
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,710
- Nice.
- That was nice and clean.

1455
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:42,050
(Agreeing that they are the queen of hip hop)

1456
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,690
They're all so good.

1457
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:47,860
- I want to learn that dance.
- It was so cool.

1458
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,860
(The reaction is different in the green rooms.)

1459
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:55,329
They were so good I don't know what to do.

1460
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,800
(Team MANNEQUEEN's performance makes everyone nervous.)

1461
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:02,599
Team MANNEQUEENS has competed their performance...

1462
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,769
for the Group Match, Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1463
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:07,170
If you think Team MANNEQUEEN did a good job,

1464
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,239
press the "o" button.

1465
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,679
The voting begins now.

1466
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:12,880
- Please.
- Please.

1467
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:15,179
Press it.

1468
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,519
(Pressing the button)

1469
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,889
(Pressing the button)

1470
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:18,989
(Press it.)

1471
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,889
Who are the waackers?

1472
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,920
It's the two at the end.

1473
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:24,989
- How are they so good at hip hop?
- I know.

1474
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:27,800
I was surprised because it was so well-organized.

1475
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,500
How are street dancers...

1476
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,630
- that good at it?
- I know.

1477
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:33,329
I'd join their fan club if they made one.

1478
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,900
(Coming out as Team MANNEQUEEN's number 1 fan)

1479
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,139
I think we did the best out of all the missions with seven people.

1480
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,170
I was so happy and moved.

1481
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,940
I felt like we did it.

1482
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,150
We could hope for first place.

1483
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,380
(We can finally hope for 1st place.)

1484
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,119
The voting is closed.

1485
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:53,690
You'll make me cry.

1486
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:54,820
(Yoonji was crying quietly.)

1487
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:57,090
Our daughters are good, aren't they?

1488
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,289
(Don't cry.)

1489
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,159
I realized that sometimes...

1490
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,670
there isn't much we can do for you except watch.

1491
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:08,769
The seven members endured...

1492
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:11,440
the difficult times by themselves.

1493
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,269
I'm so proud of how amazing they are.

1494
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,639
Team MANNEQUEEN will never break down.

1495
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,780
We have yellow blood that will survive to the end...

1496
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,250
and show you a good performance.

1497
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,519
Yellow blood?

1498
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,590
I'd like to tell you I love you so much.

1499
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,920
(We love you too.)

1500
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,219
I think this is unfair.

1501
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,530
(What?)

1502
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:33,630
It's so unfair. It's unbelievable.

1503
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:37,369
You're good at waacking, hip hop and choreographing. What is this?

1504
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,969
(What? It was a compliment?)

1505
01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:42,369
I couldn't tell which members were waackers...

1506
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,639
and which were hip hop dancers.

1507
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,780
That's how good the quality of each member's dance was.

1508
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,880
I was automatically immersed in your performance.

1509
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,210
It was very cool.

1510
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,920
In the Ace Match, Round 1 of the Girl Group Choreography Mission,

1511
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,949
Lee Na Ra received 99 points.

1512
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,590
(She received the highest score of 99 points!)

1513
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:03,960
Gosh. That's a lot.

1514
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,460
We noticed how big a difference 100 points can make.

1515
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:10,500
We were highly satisfied, and the audience response was good.

1516
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:12,670
We even had the benefit, so we must be in first place.

1517
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:14,670
I have no regrets.

1518
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:17,199
I don't have a daughter, but it feels like I do.

1519
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,980
The next team to perform in the Group Match, Round Two...

1520
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,010
of the Girl Group Choreography Mission...

1521
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,280
(There are only two teams left.)

1522
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,380
(Team BEBE, the top choreographer...)

1523
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,119
(with extraordinary structure and expressions)

1524
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:33,690
(Perfect details and amazing organization)

1525
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,519
(Team 1MILLION, the strong winner candidate...)

1526
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,730
(with in-sync dance moves)

1527
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,329
(1MILLION did something only they can do.)

1528
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,460
(Their name is enough to make people sit on the edge of their seats.)

1529
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,730
(Only the top choreographing teams are left in the Group Match.)

1530
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,539
(Which team will perform next?)

1531
01:07:48,139 --> 01:07:50,099
(Let's have the better teams go later.)

1532
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,809
(I don't want Team BEBE to go right after us.)

1533
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:52,869
(Me, neither.)

1534
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:53,909
(The final order?)

1535
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:56,610
(4th: Team 1MILLION, 5th: Team BEBE)

1536
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,110
(The order of Round 2 was delivered to each team.)

1537
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,550
One, two, three.

1538
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,880
(The order of Round 2 was delivered to each team.)

1539
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,579
(Slightly surprised)

1540
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:05,750
- We're last.
- We're last.

1541
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,889
(Covering her mouth)

1542
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,719
I detest them for putting us after Team 1MILLION.

1543
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,230
- Seriously.
- I told you this might happen.

1544
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,900
- This is unbelievable.
- It's detestable.

1545
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,260
- This won't make us get eliminated.
- How dare they!

1546
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,500
They're wary of us.

1547
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,670
- They know they should be afraid.
- They are wary of us.

1548
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:21,770
(They check the order.)

1549
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:24,109
(Her eyes grow bigger.)

1550
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,770
(Why do I have a bad feeling?)

1551
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,409
- Number 3?
- We're number 4.

1552
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,039
- What?
- That's better than I expected.

1553
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:33,180
- Thank you, thank you.
- That isn't bad.

1554
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,949
Let's go.

1555
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,090
- We're waiting for you.
- Come on.

1556
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,260
1MILLION.

1557
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,229
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1558
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,430
- What are they wearing?
- It's luxurious.

1559
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,699
- That's a strong look.
- Gosh.

1560
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:56,140
- It's a very strong look.
- I love it.

1561
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,140
(Their fur sleeves capture everyone's attention.)

1562
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,670
I love that. Can I have those sleeves?

1563
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,909
Look at the outfits.

1564
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,510
How did they come up with that outfit?

1565
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,579
Did you forget to wax?

1566
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:07,920
(Feeling embarrassed for her)

1567
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,119
Look at their outfits.

1568
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,789
It stands out.

1569
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:16,560
(The 7 that stand out the most of Round 2)

1570
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,689
Hello.

1571
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:21,960
We're Team 1MILLION.

1572
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:28,369
Team 1MILLION is a group of dancers that are good at choreographing.

1573
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:32,140
Did you feel any pressure or face struggles while preparing?

1574
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,609
(Leader Yoon In Jung isn't able to share easily.)

1575
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,979
(What happened with Team 1MILLION?)

1576
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,489
(Team 1MILLION's studio)

1577
01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:46,420
(It's unusually silent.)

1578
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:54,699
(A heavy vibe and flustered looks on the faces of the dancers)

1579
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:57,029
(It was totally a festival when the masters checked the dance.)

1580
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,430
(I think you'll win.)

1581
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,430
(Happy, Elated)

1582
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,899
I wanted to criticize you as well, but there's nothing to say.

1583
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:04,510
(What happened to the bright and cheerful Team 1MILLION?)

1584
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,039
(1 hour ago)

1585
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,170
Is everyone here?

1586
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:09,779
No, In Jung isn't here.

1587
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:11,449
(Leader Yoon In Jung was preparing for the Ace Match.)

1588
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,250
Let's practice hard.

1589
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,149
(Joking around)

1590
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,189
(She forgot the moves.)

1591
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,260
Hey.

1592
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:25,229
Lee Ji Sol, Lee Ji Sol.

1593
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:26,260
(They're so happy.)

1594
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:28,699
Push further away.

1595
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:30,130
(Making gagging sounds)

1596
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:33,430
(Laughter fills the studio.)

1597
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:35,199
(They also practice singing.)

1598
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,039
(They're all happy.)

1599
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,810
(Right then! The masters suddenly drop in.)

1600
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,079
(They see the masters.)

1601
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,340
(Flustered, they can't move.)

1602
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

1603
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,010
(Hi, we're here.)

1604
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:48,149
Let's take a seat.

1605
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:51,189
We heard about the mission.

1606
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:53,220
I heard you chose the song...

1607
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:55,619
because we won first place.

1608
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,890
We won first place and chose "Monster."

1609
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,359
And chose "Monster."

1610
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,430
(Really?)

1611
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,869
(The winner's benefit was the chance to choose the song first.)

1612
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,939
("Monster" by Irene and Seulgi)

1613
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,340
(Team 1MILLION's unexpected choice)

1614
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:12,210
(It's better for Team BEBE.)

1615
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,579
("Monster" by Irene and Seulgi is a medium-tempo pop dance song...)

1616
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,850
(with conceptual lyrics about an immortal monster.)

1617
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,649
(It's an unexpected choice.)

1618
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,850
Why did you choose this song?

1619
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,449
(Wary and flustered)

1620
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,550
We chose "Monster..."

1621
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,220
in order to show a completely new side.

1622
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,819
What are your thoughts on the song? Do you think you will do well?

1623
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:35,699
We tend to do better on the stage.

1624
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:38,000
I think we will be able to overwhelm the audience.

1625
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,829
Let me check out...

1626
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,100
the performance first.

1627
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,199
- Okay.
- Okay.

1628
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,670
I can't wait to check it out.

1629
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,640
I didn't think...

1630
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,409
"Monster" would give them an advantage.

1631
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,420
(The dance check begins with high expectations.)

1632
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,760
(Focused)

1633
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:11,069
(Although the song began, the dancers stand still.)

1634
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:12,470
They didn't fill in this part.

1635
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,840
(They don't move in the beginning for over 20 seconds.)

1636
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:22,409
(The performance finally begins!)

1637
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:25,579
(The choreography is revealed only after a while.)

1638
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,750
(Suddenly, some dancers move to the sides.)

1639
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:32,520
(Tilting her head)

1640
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,159
(While the dance duet goes on, other dancers stop at the sides.)

1641
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:43,560
While dancing, I could feel...

1642
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,630
that their faces had darkened.

1643
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,510
I think we were in a serious situation.

1644
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,239
(Unsure)

1645
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,310
(Quite flustered)

1646
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,079
(At that moment,)

1647
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:03,279
(Leader Yoon In Jung returns after the Ace Match practice.)

1648
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

1649
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,420
Hello.

1650
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,659
When I entered the room,

1651
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:21,439
I could feel that the evaluation wasn't...

1652
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,069
favorable.

1653
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,539
I didn't get the sense that the choreography was complete.

1654
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,380
Compared to the previous performance,

1655
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,510
there were...

1656
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,550
no memorable scenes.

1657
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:35,149
There was a part in which you flipped over.

1658
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,350
When you did it together, it was quite impactful.

1659
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,289
But it wasn't a wow factor.

1660
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:44,560
You don't want people to say, "They did well for kids."

1661
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:45,989
Right?

1662
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:51,000
It isn't your goal to avoid placing last.

1663
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:54,270
(The crew masters' criticism continues.)

1664
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:57,340
I want the overall performance to have...

1665
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:01,010
the concept that suits "Monster."

1666
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:04,210
There are many dance moves that use the arms.

1667
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:07,649
Why don't you wear something like...

1668
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:10,180
a fur bolero jacket?

1669
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,250
It will be hard,

1670
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,989
but I think you will need to make...

1671
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,920
many scenes like this.

1672
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,760
(After the dance evaluation, Yoon In Jung becomes thoughtful.)

1673
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,829
(She watches the video of the choreography endlessly.)

1674
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,670
(Spotting In Jung)

1675
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,100
- Do you want to watch it with me?
- Yes.

1676
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,100
Do you want to watch it with me?

1677
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,939
(With the leader, the dancers think about the choreography.)

1678
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:35,239
To be honest, I was nervous too.

1679
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:39,210
I didn't have much confidence in this performance.

1680
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:41,149
I didn't have much certainty.

1681
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:42,880
Receiving that feedback...

1682
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,520
made me determined...

1683
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,319
to bring out our energy and create a nice performance.

1684
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,659
We will show a cool performance.

1685
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:56,060
(How will be Team 1MILLION's performance?)

1686
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,569
Now, Team 1MILLION's new interpretation...

1687
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:03,140
of "Monster" by Red Velvet's Irene and Seulgi will begin now.

1688
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,439
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1689
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:07,539
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1690
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:08,739
Let's go.

1691
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:15,180
After the Ace Match,

1692
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,090
I became determined to give my all to the performance.

1693
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,760
Let's show them what we can do without any regrets.

1694
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,260
They are the masters of the intro.

1695
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,130
It's so cool.

1696
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:28,899
What?

1697
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,399
- What?
- What is it?

1698
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,699
I think the beginning will be very grotesque.

1699
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:47,680
Look at that fur.

1700
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,050
They make a spider.

1701
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,319
They look like a spider.

1702
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,420
("Monster" by Irene and Seulgi, choreo by Team 1MILLION)

1703
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,560
Okay.

1704
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,409
(Their jaws drop upon seeing the whole-body twist.)

1705
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:15,109
(The audience is shocked.)

1706
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,489
(Did you see that?)

1707
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:28,960
(There you go.)

1708
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,220
- They made an eye.
- An eye.

1709
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,670
The teamwork.

1710
01:17:00,489 --> 01:17:02,520
(Amazed)

1711
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,430
- They are insane.
- They really are 1MILLION.

1712
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,760
How neat.

1713
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,130
How are their moves so neat?

1714
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,560
This choreography is so smart.

1715
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,310
(Shocked and thrilled)

1716
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,479
(They are so good.)

1717
01:17:47,569 --> 01:17:49,739
(Feeling emotional)

1718
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,079
- I love it.
- That was nice.

1719
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,920
(MANNEQUEEN crew masters are speechless from shock.)

1720
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,920
(Frozen)

1721
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,920
(How did they think of that?)

1722
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,789
(They are annoyed to see the team do so well.)

1723
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,109
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1724
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:32,680
Well done.

1725
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,510
- Thank you.
- It was insane.

1726
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,750
(It was insane!)

1727
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,789
(Shocked and moved)

1728
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:43,590
(It's game over.)

1729
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:45,859
Look at their eyes. It's insane.

1730
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:47,060
- They are like venomous spiders.
- Yes.

1731
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,529
The costumes provided a kick.

1732
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,100
(They did it!)

1733
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,600
- That was good.
- Yes.

1734
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,270
- That was good.
- They nailed it.

1735
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,270
They nailed it.

1736
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,939
(Harimu bursts into tears amidst the cheers.)

1737
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,670
- Well done.
- It was incredible.

1738
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,569
I watched from the crew masters' seats.

1739
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,380
The dancers on the stage were so beautiful.

1740
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,649
I became so absorbed in them.

1741
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:09,880
It was so touching.

1742
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,050
(Seeing them give their all to the performance was touching.)

1743
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,020
It's time for the decision.

1744
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,630
If you liked Team 1MILLION's performance,

1745
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,630
please press the O button.

1746
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:25,100
Maybe they will get a unanimous vote.

1747
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,199
It was the best performance Team 1MILLION has given.

1748
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:29,569
They should have shown it at the final.

1749
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:30,699
- Seriously.
- I agree.

1750
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,439
it suited the final.

1751
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:35,439
They should have a world tour with this performance.

1752
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:36,539
Seriously.

1753
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:40,909
Firstly, we perfectly showed...

1754
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,750
the picture we wanted to show.

1755
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,619
We could feel...

1756
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:49,489
that our energy was delivered to the audience members.

1757
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,489
We are very proud of that.

1758
01:19:51,489 --> 01:19:52,489
Yes.

1759
01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:54,560
(Team 1MILLION is satisfied with the performance.)

1760
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,960
The most shocking part was...

1761
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,000
"Two shadows."

1762
01:19:58,829 --> 01:20:01,069
That part is very short,

1763
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:02,970
but we saw a face in the center...

1764
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:06,270
and two people who represented the shadows.

1765
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:10,380
"How did they show such a short part in a neat way?"

1766
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,250
I had that thought. I have so much respect.

1767
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,510
As for us,

1768
01:20:14,979 --> 01:20:15,979
we were...

1769
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:18,949
very thankful that we sat right in the middle.

1770
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,350
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1771
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,449
I am jealous.

1772
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,819
- We couldn't see very well.
- We are sorry.

1773
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,060
We had the best seat.

1774
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,529
(We want that seat.)

1775
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:26,890
I think...

1776
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:30,329
they put everyone in a daze.

1777
01:20:30,329 --> 01:20:31,529
(People nod collectively.)

1778
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,529
If I were to give them a score as a crew master,

1779
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,539
I would give them 100 points and leave.

1780
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,140
It was...

1781
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,239
Where would she go?

1782
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:43,239
- Why would she leave?
- Why would she leave?

1783
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,510
- Why would you leave?
- I mean...

1784
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:47,880
(Why would you leave us behind?)

1785
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:49,819
I would drop out.

1786
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:54,550
I would drop out because it was the perfect performance.

1787
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:56,260
It was the absolute best.

1788
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,260
(Happy)

1789
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,989
My heart was so heavy.

1790
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,930
- Well done.
- When I saw...

1791
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:04,560
the audience members and crew masters' reactions,

1792
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,000
- I felt so proud and recognized.
- Well done.

1793
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,470
It made me so happy.

1794
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,270
Let's go.

1795
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,479
Team 1MILLION did so well.

1796
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,609
They might overcome the difference of 29 points.

1797
01:21:17,609 --> 01:21:20,449
(My throat suddenly feels dry.)

1798
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,920
The choreography had...

1799
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,180
so many original parts.

1800
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,920
It seemed like the team knew exactly when...

1801
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:31,729
people would scream...

1802
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:34,329
and get goosebumps.

1803
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,829
It's time for our girls.

1804
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:36,930
It's time for our girls.

1805
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,300
- It's time for our girls.
- It's their turn.

1806
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,529
Girls, good luck.

1807
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,199
- Let's go, Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

1808
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,510
- Let's go.
- Yes, finally.

1809
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,909
(We are so nervous.)

1810
01:21:46,909 --> 01:21:48,010
Let's go.

1811
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:49,479
They must be really nervous.

1812
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:50,779
Team 1MILLION did so well.

1813
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:53,609
The leader must be under so much pressure.

1814
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:55,319
(She knows that pain.)

1815
01:21:56,350 --> 01:22:00,489
(In the Ace Match, Round 1, Lee Ga Young placed 4th.)

1816
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:03,189
(The ranking was showing for Team BEBE.)

1817
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:05,329
- Come on.
- Well done.

1818
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:08,399
- You worked hard.
- You worked hard.

1819
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:09,699
You said you wouldn't cry.

1820
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:13,100
(Team BEBE's leader, Lee Ga Young cried since she felt bad.)

1821
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,239
- Let's have a hug.
- Okay.

1822
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:19,069
Okay. Let's focus on showing our performance.

1823
01:22:19,069 --> 01:22:21,409
Firstly, I am sorry.

1824
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,710
- Don't be sorry.
- You don't need to say that.

1825
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,979
Let's not think about it.

1826
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:26,079
Let's go to the final.

1827
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,149
Let's place first.

1828
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:29,550
I felt so bad for the girls.

1829
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,350
They told me that it was fine,

1830
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:34,090
but my heart was troubled.

1831
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,289
So that our team can shine,

1832
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:37,619
we will place first.

1833
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,460
The Group Match, Round Two of the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

1834
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,359
- Now comes the last performance.
- It's Team BEBE.

1835
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:43,430
Team BEBE.

1836
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,069
It's Team BEBE.

1837
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1838
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,770
(Let's go, Team BEBE.)

1839
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,939
Let's go.

1840
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:54,970
(Cheering)

1841
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,739
(Expectant)

1842
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,310
Okay.

1843
01:23:01,449 --> 01:23:05,149
- Hello, we are Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

1844
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,189
(She wants to try making B.)

1845
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,520
"We are Team BEBE."

1846
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,619
She even got the tone down.

1847
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:10,989
"We are Team BEBE."

1848
01:23:11,789 --> 01:23:14,630
Which performance did Team BEBE prepare?

1849
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:17,260
Team BEBE...

1850
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:20,800
(Which performance did Team BEBE prepare?)

1851
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,270
(Smiling)

1852
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,710
- We placed second!
- Yes!

1853
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,270
(Team BEBE's practice room)

1854
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:30,310
I heard that you chose the songs in the order of the rankings.

1855
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,479
That's right.

1856
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,310
That means you chose second.

1857
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,409
Yes.

1858
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,550
Which song did you choose?

1859
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:36,979
(They can't say it right away.)

1860
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,789
Say it on the count of three.

1861
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,250
(Wary)

1862
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,390
One, two, three.

1863
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:45,430
"Illusion."

1864
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,489
("Illusion"?)

1865
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,699
Illusion

1866
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,399
(It's one of Bada's hit choreographies.)

1867
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:53,500
(The crew masters even participated in the choreography proposal...)

1868
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,500
(of "Illusion" by aespa.)

1869
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,399
The original choreography is intense.

1870
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:57,699
That's right.

1871
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,170
We thought about it for a long time.

1872
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,739
We decided to show our colors...

1873
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,239
by adding new techniques...

1874
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,510
to the choreography.

1875
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,850
That was why we chose the song.

1876
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,979
- Yes.
- Well done.

1877
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,949
Would you show us the choreography...

1878
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:13,090
after checkups?

1879
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:18,090
(They show the choreographer before the original choreographer.)

1880
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,699
(I see.)

1881
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:29,470
(The crew masters watch quietly without showing any reactions.)

1882
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:31,270
Okay.

1883
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:34,770
(What kind of feedback will the crew masters give?)

1884
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,439
The opening lacks...

1885
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,710
the attention-grabbing qualities.

1886
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,510
The formation is lacking.

1887
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,979
It's very important to show good formations.

1888
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:46,350
There are no wow factors.

1889
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:49,989
You began the performance like this.

1890
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,789
There should be something...

1891
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:53,960
that's simple yet insane.

1892
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,500
I was so focused on the teamwork and dance moves...

1893
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,670
that I didn't think of the formation.

1894
01:24:58,670 --> 01:24:59,930
It was like a punch to the gut.

1895
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,970
Let's proceed with Team BEBE's rehearsal.

1896
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:05,810
(Team BEBE begins the rehearsal...)

1897
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,710
(as the crew masters watch.)

1898
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,739
(The opening became more intense.)

1899
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,310
(It's really nice.)

1900
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:14,880
(Fancy technique)

1901
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,420
I love it.

1902
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:17,579
(The crew masters are shocked by the wow factor.)

1903
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,550
(The formation transition follows.)

1904
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,020
(What?)

1905
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,090
Hold on. Stand at the circle for a second.

1906
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,890
Seung Ju, you didn't move in sync.

1907
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,329
The ones who come out second didn't move in sync.

1908
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:35,600
(Their arm movements weren't in sync.)

1909
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,140
The arms went in opposite directions.

1910
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,109
You need to keep the movements in sync.

1911
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,010
(Chae Won misses the timing again.)

1912
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,279
You weren't in sync again.

1913
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:46,310
(Wary)

1914
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:48,680
(They practice repeatedly, but continue making a mistake.)

1915
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,880
No. Again.

1916
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,520
Why don't they move on sync?

1917
01:25:53,289 --> 01:25:54,420
Seriously.

1918
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:57,859
Our movements weren't synchronized,

1919
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,159
so we were very nervous.

1920
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:04,199
In overall, the details are lacking.

1921
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:08,430
(Team BEBE's strong suits were teamwork and attention to details.)

1922
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:09,869
You go at two.

1923
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,909
Two. You do this at two.

1924
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,710
I know that they are very talented,

1925
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,310
so I want to protect their unique colors.

1926
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:18,310
Ga Young, what do you think?

1927
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,550
The members are so worried about this dance move...

1928
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,880
that their attention plummets during that particular part.

1929
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:24,750
If you are going to drop it, do it quickly.

1930
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,720
It isn't something you can fix in a short amount of time.

1931
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,460
It's your decision to make, Ga Young.

1932
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,560
If you are going to drop it, go ahead.

1933
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,659
Perhaps you can move separately.

1934
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:36,960
I thought a lot about...

1935
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,770
what to do.

1936
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,869
(Will Team BEBE be able to overcome this crisis?)

1937
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:46,409
(Team BEBE's performance begins.)

1938
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:48,779
(Impressed)

1939
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:51,180
(Startled)

1940
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,109
- What?
- Isn't it hypnosis?

1941
01:26:54,979 --> 01:26:57,479
This performance can determine the fate of the team,

1942
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,449
so it's my goal to overwhelm the audience.

1943
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:03,920
The order doesn't matter...

1944
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,090
because we have confidence in our performance.

1945
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,390
We can crush them all.

1946
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,829
(Nervous)

1947
01:27:11,529 --> 01:27:14,600
("Illusion" by aespa, choreo by Team BEBE)

1948
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,140
Yes!

1949
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,949
(Screaming)

1950
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,350
It's so BEBE.

1951
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:36,359
They have amazing teamwork.

1952
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:40,729
(They are so cool.)

1953
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,630
It's giving me BEBE.

1954
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,039
Look at the dance.

1955
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,350
Oh, swag.

1956
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:13,329
So much power.

1957
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:14,729
How do they have so much power?

1958
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,270
Let's go!

1959
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,739
(People cheer loudly.)

1960
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:36,649
Where did they get so much power?

1961
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,779
The stage might explode.

1962
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,130
(They are good!)

1963
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:09,750
(Surprised)

1964
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,680
(Cheering)

1965
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,350
(I must stand up for this performance.)

1966
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,720
(My goodness)

1967
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,359
It's such a wow factor.

1968
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,729
(Well done!)

1969
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:37,779
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1970
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:42,449
(Applause and cheers for Team BEBE)

1971
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:45,420
(Team BEBE is cool.)

1972
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,550
They killed the beat.

1973
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,760
How did they come up with such a cool choreography?

1974
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,789
It was insane. They did well.

1975
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:53,989
Team BEBE didn't disappoint.

1976
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,260
They did well.

1977
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,899
They did well.

1978
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:00,800
I am annoyed. I am annoyed that they did so well.

1979
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,539
Team BEBE didn't disappoint.

1980
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:05,569
Seriously, Team BEBE didn't disappoint.

1981
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,439
- They did so well.
- They did so well.

1982
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:09,939
They did really well.

1983
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:12,350
- Seriously, they are good.
- Team BEBE didn't disappoint.

1984
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:15,010
The intro and outro are so good that the chorus pales in comparison.

1985
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:17,479
Team 1MILLION's performance was too strong.

1986
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,390
I wonder how it was for the audience.

1987
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,989
Dancers, it's time to make a decision.

1988
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:24,390

(Pressing)

1992
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,300
They did so well.

1993
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:40,670
- To be honest, we had more energy.
- Yes.

1994
01:30:42,409 --> 01:30:45,340
Every team is determined to move on...

1995
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,350
to the final.

1996
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,350
- Totally.
- Are you angry?

1997
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:49,680
- They are too determined.
- Are you angry?

1998
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,680
(The audience voting for Team BEBE ends.)

1999
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,050
It was cool.

2000
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:56,119
You guys are really good.

2001
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:58,659
How are you guys so good?

2002
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,989
- I love it.
- Seriously.

2003
01:31:00,989 --> 01:31:02,859
Team BEBE is really talented.

2004
01:31:02,859 --> 01:31:04,859
You guys went against Team MANNEQUEEN last time.

2005
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,470
Even back then, I thought,

2006
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,199
"They are so good. How annoying."

2007
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,270
How did you guys gain so much power?

2008
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:12,869
The dance moves were so strong...

2009
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:14,770
that I felt like I was getting ripped apart.

2010
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,039
That's how much I could feel your energy.

2011
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:19,779
I could clearly see your confidence in this performance. I enjoyed it.

2012
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:21,649
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2013
01:31:22,279 --> 01:31:23,850
You're not Team BEBE.

2014
01:31:23,949 --> 01:31:27,250
You're Team BEBEBEBEBEBE.

2015
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:31,390
You were more than BEBE. It was a great performance.

2016
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:32,390
(The best compliments are compliments for my children.)

2017
01:31:32,489 --> 01:31:34,359
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2018
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:37,199
We went through a lot of trials during practice.

2019
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,970
But now you all looked amazing. Every single one of you.

2020
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:44,000
You should take more pride in your own style.

2021
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,970
You worked very hard. Yes.

2022
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:50,939
Master Bada gave us good advice...

2023
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:53,550
on choreography details and on gestures to add in.

2024
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,619
We were really happy with how our performance looked.

2025
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,520
It was also really fun...

2026
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,520
to see how the reactions changed with everything we did.

2027
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:03,619
We were number one in terms of audience reactions.

2028
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,229
I can't tell who will be eliminated.

2029
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:08,829
- Yes, it's hard to tell.
- Thinking about it.

2030
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,569
I think that's why the points from the Ace Match will be key.

2031
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:16,300
Until now, the extra points...

2032
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,270
- were worth a lot, like 100 points.
- That's true, they were.

2033
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,569
- But in our case...
- We got nearly 100 points.

2034
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:23,210
Yes, and it might just be a one-point difference that decides.

2035
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,579
Personally, I hope the points from the Ace Match play a big role.

2036
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:29,119
Before, all the other teams had zero points,

2037
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:31,250
- but now they have 60 or 70.
- That's true.

2038
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,890
I think the margins will be close.

2039
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:41,829
The Girl Group Choreography Group Mission is now over.

2040
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,829
All five crews worked very hard.

2041
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,069
(Clapping)

2042
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,340
- You worked so hard!
- You worked so hard!

2043
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,770
- Good job.
- You did so great!

2044
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,170
- You worked hard.
- Great work.

2045
01:32:56,609 --> 01:32:57,640
The Team Trials...

2046
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:00,750
and the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

2047
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:03,479
preceded today's Girl Group Choreography Mission.

2048
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,250
All we have left is the grand finale...

2049
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:08,149
for Street Dance Girls Fighter, Season Two.

2050
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:10,920
That's the finals.

2051

(the dancers look anxious.)

2054
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:21,270
- Gosh, I'm nervous.
- The time has come.

2055
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:24,739
(Very nervous)

2056
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:27,609
The results of today's Girl Group Choreography Mission...

2057
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,880
will combine the points from the Ace Match, Round One,

2058
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,810
and the Group Match, Round Two.

2059
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:34,979
The team with the lowest combined score...

2060
01:33:34,979 --> 01:33:37,279
(The team in 5th place, with the lowest combined score)

2061
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:40,350
...will be eliminated without the Elimination Battle.

2062
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:44,720
- That's so cruel.
- Truly. No chance to even battle.

2063
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,430
- That's so cruel.
- That's so cruel.

2064
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:50,300
- Eliminated without a battle.
- That's so cruel.

2065
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,670
Which teams will be the four moving up to the finals?

2066
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:56,470
We will reveal the results now.

2067
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,270
This is too much.

2068
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,239
Please, don't do this to me.

2069
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:04,279
Let's go.

2070
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:05,979
(Girl Group Choreography Creation Result)

2071
01:34:06,109 --> 01:34:07,850
Gosh, look at that.

2072
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,250
No!

2073
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,949
- This makes me so nervous.
- That's amazing.

2074
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,590
My heart.

2075
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,590
(My heart...)

2076
01:34:16,789 --> 01:34:19,659
- Let's hold hands.
- My hands are sweaty.

2077
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:23,029
Everyone did well today. It'll be a shame no matter who.

2078
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,430
First, we will reveal the points scored by each ace...

2079
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:27,600
in the Ace Match, which will provide extra points...

2080
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,340
to add to the Group Match points.

2081
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,310
(The Ace Match points will become a critical benefit...)

2082
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:35,979
(in the process of making it to the finals.)

2083
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:40,050
(Girl Group Choreography Creation Result)

2084
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,550
In the Ace Match, Round One of the Girl Group Choreography Mission,

2085
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:45,550
Team MANNEQUEEN's ace, Lee Na Ra, received 99 points.

2086
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:49,020
Team 1MILLION's ace, Yoon In Jung, received 70 points.

2087
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:53,289
Team JAM REPUBLIC's ace, Miyabi, received 32 points.

2088
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:56,399
Team BEBE's ace, Lee Ga Young, received 25 points.

2089
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,569
Team HOOK's ace, Lee Joo Bin, received five points.

2090
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:02,640
The team with the highest score in the Ace Match...

2091
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:03,970
was Team MANNEQUEEN.

2092
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,670
- We got a lot of points.
- You scored a beautiful number.

2093
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:10,579
- Na Ra, great job.
- Na Ra did a great job.

2094
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,239
That's great!

2095
01:35:13,479 --> 01:35:14,680
You did great.

2096

(Pressing her lips together)

2097
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,550
- She got 99 points. That's a lot.
- That's amazing.

2098
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:23,460
This is our 1st time ranking 1st in anything.

2099
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,529
It's still hard to believe...

2100
01:35:26,529 --> 01:35:28,460
that we're at the very top of something.

2101
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,859
There's a big difference in the points.

2102
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,800
(Team HOOK only scored five points, a single-digit score.)

2103
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,470
I think we felt even more intimidated.

2104
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,470
What will the final score be for each team...

2105
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,069
after the points from the Group Match are added in?

2106
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:45,710
First, we will reveal the team that came in first,

2107
01:35:46,579 --> 01:35:49,279
which will be heading straight to the finals.

2108
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,850
We will reveal the results now.

2109
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,590
They're announcing the results just like that?

2111
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,619
- Right away?
- Why?

2112
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,930
I think it'll be Team MANNEQUEEN.

2113
01:36:00,289 --> 01:36:01,760
They're revealing it right away.

2114
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,529
- Please let the 99 points help.
- The final results...

2115
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,699
(Lee Na Ra put Team MANNEQUEEN in the lead...)

2116
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:13,640
(with eye-catching moves that earned her 99 points.)

2117
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:15,569
- I can't watch...
- The team in first place...

2118
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,239
Gosh, please save me.

2119
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,609
- I think it'll be Team 1MILLION.
- Me too. Team 1MILLION.

2120
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,619
(Squeezing her hands together)

2121
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,689
(With 70 extra points from Round 1,)

2122
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,189
(Team 1MILLION also evoked much cheering for Round 2.)

2123
01:36:30,859 --> 01:36:31,859
Please.

2124
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:34,390
I have neck tension.

2125
01:36:35,229 --> 01:36:36,359
(Getting chills)

2126
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,659
The team in first place...

2127
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,770
(Is it Team 1MILLION, which showed explosive charisma?)

2128
01:36:39,869 --> 01:36:43,270
I think I was kind of hoping to get first place.

2129
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,170
(Or is it Team MANNEQUEEN, which earned 90 extra points?)

2130
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:49,409
This was the mission we performed the best in so far...

2131
01:36:49,409 --> 01:36:52,680
and we also had a great benefit, so I thought we might get first.

2132
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:54,510
The team in first place...

2133
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:56,180
Please.

2134
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,189
Team 1MLILION.

2135
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:05,060
(Girl Group Choreography Mission 1st place, Team 1MILLION)

2136
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:06,390
Team 1MILLION.

2137
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:10,029
(Jumping up)

2138
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,859
(Amazing!)

2139
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,270
(Team 1MILLION is speechless with happiness.)

2140
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:16,340
They did well.

2141
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,699
- They did really well.
- I totally agree.

2142
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,539
(Team 1MILLION, Score: 274, Rank: 1)

2143
01:37:20,539 --> 01:37:23,140
If they got 204 votes, nearly everyone voted for them.

2144
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,710
That's basically a perfect score.

2145
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:27,310
They ranked 1st in the last mission and 1st again in this one.

2146
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,050
Team 1MILLION takes 1st place no matter what.

2147
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,720
Can the first-place team...

2148
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,550
for the Girl Group Choreography Mission please come up on stage?

2149
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,350
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

2150
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,060
- You did great!
- You did a great job!

2151
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,159
Congratulations.

2152
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,489
Congratulations.

2153
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,529
Team 1MILLION did tear it up, to be honest.

2154
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:45,159
Team 1MILLION got 204 points...

2155
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:46,829
in the Group Match, which was Round Two.

2156
01:37:46,829 --> 01:37:49,340
In the Ace Match, Round One, ace Yoon In Jung...

2157
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,770
won an extra 70 points,

2158
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,810
making their final score a combined 274 points.

2159
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:56,579
Therefore, Team 1MILLION has been confirmed...

2160
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,340
to move on to the finals as the team in first place.

2161
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:00,449
- You did great!
- You did great!

2162
01:38:00,449 --> 01:38:02,380
- You worked so hard, girls!
- You did great!

2163
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,279
Thank you for giving us the honor...

2164
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:09,020
of first place.

2165
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,960
For the finals, we will create a performance...

2166
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,189
that's even greater...

2167
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:15,930
than the one we showed today.

2168
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:18,329
We resolve to show everyone that performance. Thank you.

2169
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,729
Congratulations on coming in first. I love you!

2170
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:21,899
Congratulations!

2171
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:23,270
(Thank you.)

2172
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,470
Must be nice.

2173
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:27,069
My heart is beating right now.

2174
01:38:27,069 --> 01:38:29,279
Continuing with the results of the Girl Group Choreography Mission,

2175
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:30,810
the team in second place is...

2176
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,109
- It'll be Team MANNEQUEEN.
- They have so many extra points.

2177
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:35,880
- It'll be Team MANNEQUEEN.
- Team MANNEQUEEN.

2178
01:38:35,979 --> 01:38:38,850
- Please let us be second.
- My heart is racing right now.

2179
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,890
It would be great if our team came in second.

2180
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,989
Or it could be Team BEBE or Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2181
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,729
(My throat is getting dry.)

2182
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:49,500
I really hope we came in 1st just for Round 2.

2183
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:52,829
(Team BEBE's Lee Ga Young got 25 points in the Ace Match.)

2184
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:58,069
(They caught everyone's eye with a powerful performance in Round 2.)

2185
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:01,310
(Can they go to the finals after coming in 2nd place?)

2186
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:03,180
(Nervous)

2187
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:06,779
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's Miyabi won 32 points in the Ace Match.)

2188
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,649
(In the Group Match, they used flashy techniques.)

2189
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:12,520
(Will Team JAM REPUBLIC be the ones to go to the finals in 2nd place?)

2190
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:14,250
Please.

2191
01:39:15,689 --> 01:39:19,020
The Girl Group Choreography Mission second-place team is...

2192
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:23,930
We also believed that we could take the votes.

2193
01:39:24,029 --> 01:39:26,069
We believed we did really well.

2194
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:28,600
We anticipate that we'll come in second.

2195
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:29,970
The second-place team is...

2196
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,369
Say Team BEBE.

2197
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:35,970
- Please.
- Please.

2198
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,739
- Gosh.
- Please.

2199
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:39,880
(The dancers pray fervently for their team to be called.)

2200
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,649
It's Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2201
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:44,220
(Girl Group Choreography Mission 2nd place, Team JAM REPUBLIC)

2202
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,189
My gosh!

2203
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:47,890
Well done, girls!

2204
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,159
Well done.

2205
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:53,229
Team JAM REPUBLIC.

2206
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:57,060
(Shocked)

2207
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:58,529
What about us?

2208
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:00,300
(Shocked)

2209
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:04,199
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

2210
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,170
Team JAM REPUBLIC...

2211
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:08,710
won 197 points in Round 2.

2212
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,539
With 32 extra points from the Ace Match, Round 1,

2213
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:15,149
their final, combined score was 229, and they came in 2nd.

2214
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:17,750
We took this as an opportunity...

2215
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,819
to show off each individual's appeal to all the dancers.

2216
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,760
We're very happy with our performance.

2217
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,920
Adding to that, coming in second...

2218
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,829
makes us very happy.

2219
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,329
You deserve it.

2220
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,060
Congratulations.

2221
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:33,569
Let's go.

2222
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,569
(Team MANNEQUEEN had 67 more points than Team JAM REPUBLIC.)

2223
01:40:35,569 --> 01:40:37,539
Even though we started off with such a high score...

2224
01:40:38,369 --> 01:40:39,970
Let's please just come in third.

2225
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:43,409
No. I think we'll be fourth.

2226
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,079
- They'll be third.
- I'm so nervous.

2227
01:40:45,079 --> 01:40:46,180
(I'm so nervous.)

2228
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:50,180
You never know. We could've gotten the most votes in Round Two.

2229
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,720
Just don't get your hopes up.

2230
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,750
We will now reveal the team that came in third place...

2231
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,590
for the Girl Group Choreography Mission.

2232
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,489
- Now I have no idea who it'll be.
- To achieve such a great result...

2233
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,489
My heart hurts.

2234
01:41:02,659 --> 01:41:03,659
Please.

2235
01:41:03,659 --> 01:41:06,300
(Both the dancers and the masters...)

2236
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,569
(are feeling incredibly nervous.)

2237
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,800
- Please let us be 3rd.
- Please be 3rd.

2238
01:41:09,899 --> 01:41:10,970
The team in third place...

2239
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:17,909
(Which team will place 3rd and become a finalist?)

2240
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:20,979
Team MANNEQUEEN.

2241
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:22,710
(Team MANNEQUEEN places 3rd.)

2242
01:41:22,779 --> 01:41:24,720
Thank you.

2243
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,720
Thank you.

2244
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:27,489
Good job.

2245
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:28,489
(Team MANNEQUEEN is finally relieved.)

2246
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:32,659
They received low points for Round 2.

2247
01:41:33,229 --> 01:41:35,060
They only got 115 votes?

2248
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,829
Still, Na Ra received such a high score.

2249
01:41:37,829 --> 01:41:41,529
Team MANNEQUEEN received 115 points from the Group Match, Round 2.

2250
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:44,000
Na Ra received the 99 extra points...

2251
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,270
- from the Ace Match, Round One.
- The extra points saved them.

2252
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,710
With the total score of 214,

2253
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:51,039
they've become a third-place team.

2254
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,649
I'm grateful and pleased...

2255
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:56,850
that we get to advance to the finals.

2256
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,319
But I feel like we couldn't live up...

2257
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:02,449
to taking a lot of extra points.

2258
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:05,359
So I feel sorry and sad about the final score.

2259
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:07,060
- You did well.
- Good job.

2260
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:08,529
- Good job.
- Nice job.

2261
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:10,800
- All right.
- Thank you.

2262
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,399
Now the remaining teams...

2263
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:17,399
are Team BEBE and Team HOOK.

2264
01:42:17,539 --> 01:42:19,510
They will be faced with either of the two situations.

2265
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:22,140
They will advance to the finals,

2266
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,739
or they will be eliminated...

2267
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:26,550
and leave immediately.

2268
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:29,350
I don't want to go home yet.

2269
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:32,149
I'm not ready yet.

2270
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:34,789
We used to place 1st or 2nd.

2271
01:42:34,789 --> 01:42:36,289
I can't believe this.

2272
01:42:36,289 --> 01:42:38,960
Leader Lee Ga Young of Team BEBE.

2273
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:40,630
Yes?

2274
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:43,600
What do you think is the percentage...

2275
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,000
of your team to become a finalist?

2276
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:49,069
I think it's more than half.

2277
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:50,399
More than 50 percent.

2278
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:54,609
I'll be happy if we place fourth and advance to the finals.

2279
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:58,979
But since we put our biggest effort ever...

2280
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,250
into this performance,

2281
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:03,020
I'll be able to accept it...

2282
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,289
no matter what the result will be.

2283
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,260
I'll announce the final result.

2284
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:13,989
Here's the fifth-place team that will...

2285
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:17,329
unfortunately be eliminated at the threshold of the finals.

2286
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,699
- Team HOOK was more memorable.
- Will they turn the tables...

2287
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:26,569
(Team HOOK made a big impression with a truthful story.)

2288
01:43:27,539 --> 01:43:28,539
I prayed.

2289
01:43:28,539 --> 01:43:31,479
I wanted my team to advance no matter what.

2290
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,979
But I can't be sure. Team BEBE did a great job too.

2291
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,390
(Please)

2292
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:42,819
As the final result, the fifth-place team is...

2293
01:43:42,819 --> 01:43:44,090
(Which team will place 5th and get eliminated?)

2294
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:47,090
Please let it not be us.

2295
01:43:47,859 --> 01:43:51,100
We came all the way here...

2296
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,529
to do the performance we want at the finals.

2297
01:43:53,029 --> 01:43:54,399
It's been hard for us to reach here,

2298
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:56,229
so we'll go all the way up to the finals.

2299
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:58,199
It's hard to predict.

2300
01:44:01,939 --> 01:44:03,680
I have so much to show.

2301
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:06,380
(Will it be Team BEBE?)

2302
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,180
(Or Team HOOK?)

2303
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:09,720
It's...

2304
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,649
(Girl Group Choreography Mission)

2305
01:44:11,649 --> 01:44:13,090
(The final team to be eliminated...)

2306
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:15,020
(Which team will be eliminated?)

2307
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:19,090
(To be continued)

2308
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:22,060
Let me announce the final result.

2309
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:24,560
Girl Group Choreography Mission.

2310
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,430
As the final result, the fifth-place team is...

2311
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,100
Team...

2312
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,340
BEBE.

2313
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,210
(Team BEBE places 5th.)

2314
01:44:34,539 --> 01:44:35,539
BEBE.

2315
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:38,279
(Surprised and shocked)

2316
01:44:40,409 --> 01:44:41,409
BEBE.

2317
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,819
(What?)

2318
01:44:47,819 --> 01:44:51,189
(Team BEBE is to be eliminated.)

2319
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:52,659
What?

2320
01:44:52,659 --> 01:44:54,760
(No one has seen it coming.)

2321
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,100
- What?
- Oh, my goodness.

2322
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,930
We're eliminated?

2323
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,970
The fourth-place team with the last ticket to the finals...

2324
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:06,810
is Team HOOK.

2325
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:08,270
Congratulations.

2326
01:45:09,239 --> 01:45:11,310
(Team Hook is the last finalist team.)

2327
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,310
Team HOOK received 194 points...

2328
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:16,010
during the Group Match, Round Two.

2329
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,779
With the five extra points...

2330
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:20,220
that Lee Joo Bin received during the Ace Match, Round One,

2331
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,489
their final score is 199...

2332
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:24,689
which is 43 points more than that of Team BEBE.

2333
01:45:24,689 --> 01:45:26,460
And now they're advancing to the finals.

2334
01:45:26,789 --> 01:45:29,590
We worked really hard...

2335
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:32,859
to prepare for Round Two,

2336
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:37,340
and the result is very satisfying.

2337
01:45:39,869 --> 01:45:41,369
The result is...

2338
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:44,279
just as unexpected for us.

2339
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:47,550
It's really hard...

2340
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:50,649
to say anything.

2341
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,520
Well done.

2342
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,260
According to the result, Team BEBE...

2343
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,630
has to leave Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

2344
01:46:03,829 --> 01:46:05,399
Leader Lee Ga Young of Team BEBE.

2345
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,199
Please say a last word.

2346
01:46:10,039 --> 01:46:13,000
(She lowers her head without getting to speak.)

2347
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:21,949
(She tried to hold it, but she ended up crying.)

2348
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:23,380
Don't cry.

2349
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:28,619
(She must've been burdened to be a leader and an ace dancer.)

2350
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:30,260
Don't cry.

2351
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,520
(She must've been burdened to be a leader and an ace dancer.)

2352
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,930
- Don't cry.
- Gosh.

2353
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,029
Please don't cry.

2354
01:46:36,029 --> 01:46:37,029
Well...

2355
01:46:37,329 --> 01:46:40,069
I feel so sorry...

2356
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:44,970
to my teammates about today's matches.

2357
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:48,270
(She was apologetic to the teammates throughout the day.)

2358
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:51,279
Still, for the Group Match,

2359
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,319
I think we did a good job.

2360
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:05,060
I'll be able to leave without any regrets. Thank you.

2361
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:14,470
It's once in a lifetime to be 16 years old.

2362
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,739
I could spend this moment...

2363
01:47:22,739 --> 01:47:26,180
most wonderfully with the friends...

2364
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:29,949
I made here in the show.

2365
01:47:33,619 --> 01:47:35,350
For that, I'm so happy.

2366
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,229
I won't be able to forget it.

2367
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:41,289
(She won't be able to forget the past moments.)

2368
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,829
Master Bada of Team BEBE.

2369
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:48,970
Please say a word of encouragement for Team BEBE.

2370
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,640
(She can't easily begin talking.)

2371
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:59,180
I love you girls so much, Team BEBE. You've been through so much.

2372
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,109
It's just the beginning,

2373
01:48:02,109 --> 01:48:04,180
and it's just a page of our lives.

2374
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:07,850
I want us to write...

2375
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:10,090
another page well together.

2376
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:13,289
Let's try to show better performances in the future.

2377
01:48:13,789 --> 01:48:15,560
I'm so proud of you,

2378
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,930
And well done. That's what I want to say.

2379
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:24,699
Good work, Team BEBE.

2380
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,340
You may leave the studio now.

2381
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,640
I've gained so much.

2382
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:35,810
This is a survival program, you know.

2383
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:39,319
I became true to every relationship,

2384
01:48:39,649 --> 01:48:41,619
and I became true to dancing.

2385
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:45,390
All that piled up to help me improve.

2386
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,890
I'm really grateful.

2387
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,659
It was so nice...

2388
01:48:49,659 --> 01:48:52,729
to work and perform together...

2389
01:48:52,729 --> 01:48:54,699
with amazing dancers.

2390
01:48:55,829 --> 01:48:58,770
Great job. You did so well.

2391
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:00,239
You did an amazing job.

2392
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:02,670
- Good job.
- You aren't hurt, right?

2393
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,079
- No.
- Good.

2394
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:06,079
Well done.

2395
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:09,109
All your performances were awesome.

2396
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:11,020
All your dance moves were incredible.

2397
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:13,020
But...

2398
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,819
We're proud of what you guys put together.

2399
01:49:15,819 --> 01:49:17,520
I know it's really hard right now.

2400
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:19,560
But remember, after this,

2401
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,060
people are going to see how amazing you guys came to be...

2402
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,600
and how amazing you are individually.

2403
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,960
You did so well at the Ace Match.

2404
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,869
- Gosh.
- You were really cool.

2405
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:29,069
Good job.

2406
01:49:29,569 --> 01:49:33,909
Good job. And you are amazing.

2407
01:49:33,909 --> 01:49:36,680
- Thank you.
- Don't cry. It's okay.

2408
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:41,079
We'll shine even more in the future.

2409
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:42,350
So please watch and support us.

2410
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:43,949
We were...

2411
01:49:43,949 --> 01:49:45,380
- Team BEBE.
- Team BEBE.

2412
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,479
Thank you.

2413
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:51,260
(Team BEBE's party streaming will be aired at 9pm on December 14.)

2414
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:53,090
(To be continued)

2415
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,159
(Goodbye, Team BEBE.)

2416
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:59,100
The finalists have been decided at last.

2417
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,800
Team 1MILLION will be the winner anyway.

2418
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:03,899
I'm certain we're going to win.

2419
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,140
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 is Team HOOK's drama.

2420
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:07,869
We should as well place first.

2421
01:50:08,069 --> 01:50:09,170
There will be...

2422
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:12,039
two rounds for the final mission.

2423
01:50:12,109 --> 01:50:13,409
(Two rounds?)

2424
01:50:13,409 --> 01:50:14,710
(It's a must.)

2425
01:50:14,779 --> 01:50:17,649
(Round 1 for the final mission)

2426
01:50:17,649 --> 01:50:20,420
(Street Dance Girls Fighter with Masters)

2427
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,250
(With us?)

2428
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:24,890
(Let's go.)

2429
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:26,359
(Getting all excited)

2430
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:28,359
(It's obvious we're going to nail it.)

2431
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:31,399
You'll make a joint performance with your masters.

2432
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:33,300
(Excited)

2433
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,470
(We might place 1st again.)

2434
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:36,069
How are you feeling?

2435
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,439
(Today's a relaxation day.)

2436
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:40,170
(Team 1MILLION gathers to relieve their fatigue.)

2437
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:42,640
(Mini Segment: I Can Speak Up Now)

2438
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:45,079
I made a technical mistake, you know.

2439
01:50:45,109 --> 01:50:46,640
My eyes met In Jung's,

2440
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,409
and she went like...

2441
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:49,550
(No way.)

2442
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,720
(Hye Rang, are you smiling?)

2443
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,380
(Are you looking at me straight in the eye?)

2444
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,390
(Lia's original name is Hye Rang.)

2445
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:54,390
(What's the story behind the seniority collapse?)

2446
01:50:54,449 --> 01:50:56,449
(Team HOOK visits a temple for a time of meditation.)

2447
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:57,859
(Peace of mind)

2448
01:50:57,859 --> 01:50:58,989
(Glancing)

2449
01:50:58,989 --> 01:51:00,029
(Wiggling)

2450
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,760
(A punishment is given to those who are distracted.)

2451
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,430
(They suddenly start crying.)

2452
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:07,270
(The monk ends up shedding tears too.)

2453
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:09,229
Until the show ends...

2454
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:10,770
(Team MANNEQUEEN has a karaoke competition...)

2455
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:11,939
(over the masters granting a wish.)

2456
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:13,510
(Showing off all the talents)

2457
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:14,939
(Forget the bet because it's exciting.)

2458
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:16,409
(In a trance)

2459
01:51:16,409 --> 01:51:18,239
(Who will get to make a wish to the masters?)

2460
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,979
(Welcome to the Christmas party.)

2461
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:21,579
(It's so exciting.)

2462
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:22,909
(It's time to pick random presents.)

2463
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:24,079
(Excited, Disappointed)

2464
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:25,579
This is so yours.

2465
01:51:25,649 --> 01:51:26,949
(What's the shocking present that Eun Woo receives?)

2466
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:28,920
(Team 1MILLION has a meeting to discuss the mission.)

2467
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,760
(It will be with Lia and Harimu.)

2468
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,619
(Totally reassuring)

2469
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:35,260
Is there any concept you really wanted to do?

2470
01:51:35,289 --> 01:51:37,930
A lot of us can do waacking.

2471
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:39,399
But I'm a little concerned...

2472
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,369
because there are the MANNEQUEEN masters.

2473
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:43,069
(Shaking her head)

2474
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,699
(The winner...)

2475
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:46,300
(will be Team 1MILLION anyway.)

2476
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,710
(For the joint performance,)

2477
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:50,279
(we'll have...)

2478
01:51:50,279 --> 01:51:52,140
(The masters are the best.)

2479
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,350
(Special guests will be joining us for the joint performance.)

2480
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:55,609
(All excited)

2481
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:56,880
(Let's smash it.)

2482
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,619
I'll be the queen this time.

2483
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:00,550
Of all the seasons of "Street Woman Fighter,"

2484
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,119
"Street Man Fighter," and Street Dance Girls Fighter...

2485
01:52:02,289 --> 01:52:04,720
(No one has ever made this kind of performance before?)

2486
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,720
(This is crazy.)

2487
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,689
(Let me be a little greedy for the finals.)

2488
01:52:07,689 --> 01:52:09,090
(Let's go.)

2489
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:12,529
We'll place first. As if we're rising in revolt...

2490
01:52:12,529 --> 01:52:14,300
I want to make less mistakes.

2491
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:16,430
I want to do really well for the final performance.

2492
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:19,100
We'll make sure the audience can't remember...

2493
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,210
the other teams' performances, but ours.

2494
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:23,239
We'll bring a performance...

2495
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:26,609
that can never be seen from the other teams.

2496
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,010
(How will the result of Final Round 1 turn out to be?)
