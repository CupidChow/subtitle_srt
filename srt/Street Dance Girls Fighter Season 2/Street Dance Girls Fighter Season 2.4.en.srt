1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,019
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

2
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,190
(They're given 24 hours...)

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,660
(to make...)

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,989
(an original choreography of 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

5
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,230
I thought it was insane.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,660
(K-pop Choreography Mission was evaluated internally.)

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,969
(Team HOOK's repeated mistakes made Aiki angry.)

8
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:33,000
You failed to show us the performance properly,

9
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,939
so I couldn't find any flaws to tell you.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,840
(The other teams kept making mistakes.)

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,210
(It's like I'm watching a talent show.)

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,210
(A talent show in middle school.)

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,350
(Their straightforward comments surprised the masters.)

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,820
(They make me speechless.)

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,520
(But these teams performed perfectly despite the short practice hours.)

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,049
(Team BEBE without any unnecessary details)

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,390
(Team MANNEQUEEN with a combination of waacking and hip-hop)

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,460
(How are they so good?)

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,359
(Team JAM REPUBLIC with fancy techniques)

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,259
(Those were some insane skills.)

21
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,259
(Team 1MILLION with outstanding tutting)

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,960
(Team 1MILLION lived up to its name.)

23
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,899
(Which team will place 1st and get the benefit?)

24
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,739
(Team BEBE placed 1st in the internal evaluation.)

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,969
(Congratulations!)

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,510
(The final round of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,209
Team BEBE thinks...

28
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,109
Team JAM REPUBLIC thinks...

29
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,939
it can beat...

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,480
Team MANNEQUEEN.

31
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,680
Team HOOK.

32
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,280
The matches of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,719
have been decided.

34
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,219
(The interim evaluation...)

35
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,250
(of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,290
(A fierce competition...)

37
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,390
(for the directing rights and extra points)

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,290
(Team LACHICA made use of the members' various genres.)

39
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,260
(Team 1MILLION's teamwork stood out.)

40
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,569
(Which team will take the joint part?)

41
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,000
I wanted to dance with them right now.

42
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,299
(But Master Aiki disagrees.)

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,870
1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

44
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,010
SEVENTEEN Performance Group.

45
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,609
(The directing rights for the joint part goes to...)

46
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,439
(Team LACHICA: 168 points versus Team 1MILLION: 174 points)

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,909
(Team 1MILLION takes the joint part.)

48
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:47,980
Congratulations.

49
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,950
1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,120
the BTS Performance Group...

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,620
and the BLACKPINK Performance Group.

52
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,390
The interim evaluation of the joint part begins now.

53
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,890
(Which teams will earn the directing rights?)

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,290
1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

55
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,560
the BTS Performance Group.

56
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,400
The interim evaluation of the joint part begins now.

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,730
BTS was chosen by Team HOOK...

58
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,400
and Team JAM REPUBLIC.

59
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,039
(Team JAM REPUBLIC chose to go against Team HOOK...)

60
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,669
(in the internal evaluation.)

61
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,909
- Dominate them.
- You bet.

62
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,340
Let's go, guys!

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,780
The 2nd-place teams from Seasons 1 and 2...

64
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,150
of Street Woman Fighter...

65
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,780
are going against each other in this match.

66
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,620
We focused on the raw vibe.

67
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,659
Our theme is a mixture of popping and technique,

68
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,430
which is also raw.

69
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,729
(We also prepared a raw performance.)

70
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,060
(That war of nerves!)

71
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,430
Raw versus raw.

72
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,199
Raw versus raw.

73
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,270
All right.

74
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's watch Team HOOK's performance first.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,409
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

76
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,370
Let's go! Good luck, guys!

77
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,580
I was extremely nervous, actually.

78
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,439
In the K-pop Choreography Mission,

79
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,780
we couldn't show people our full potential.

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,219
(They made a huge mistake in the Internal Evaluation Mission.)

81
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,319
(Aiki was furious.)

82
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,659
In fifth place is Team HOOK.

83
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,719
(And Team HOOK placed 5th.)

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,830
(After the Internal Evaluation Mission)

85
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,729
(Who is it?)

86
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,900
(Girls!)

87
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,870
Girls!

88
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,729
(Startled)

89
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,340
You punks!

90
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,139
(Choking up)

91
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,740
You punks!

92
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,509
(She bursts into tears the moment she sees Aiki.)

93
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,509
Are you crying?

94
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,409
Are you actually crying?

95
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,080
(Flustered)

96
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,520
Are you seriously crying, Chae Hyung?

97
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,419
I don't know.

98
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,819
(They cry as they feel sorry and regretful.)

99
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,189
I was going to scold them,

100
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,919
but I can't, now that they're crying.

101
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,330
(Embarrassed)

102
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,330
It's water under the bridge. You have your own charms.

103
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,129
You have more chances to show them in the future.

104
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,500
This is a joint mission,

105
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,469
so I want you to give your very best. You can do it.

106
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,409
We were so eager to prove ourselves.

107
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,879
I thought, "I'll give my all, preparing for this."

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,310
(They focus on preparing for the joint part.)

109
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,919
We'll go back to the basics but keep it energetic.

110
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,490
(They start practicing the choreography to win the joint part.)

111
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,460
(Repeating)

112
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,020
(And repeating)

113
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
Okay!

114
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,800
We have to get the joint part!

115
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,500
We all braced ourselves...

116
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,769
to show people our dancing.

117
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,300
It was a great opportunity to show our charms.

118
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,910
Look forward to it. We will win.

119
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,709
(Shouting)

120
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:32,980
(Team HOOK's chant starts out of nowhere.)

121
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,009
(Perfect teamwork)

122
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,509
(We're Team HOOK!)

123
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,980
(Bursting into laughter)

124
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,519
They all turned into hip-hop dancers.

125
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,550
I know, right?

126
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,689
We want to prove ourselves...

127
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,019
by earning Part C.

128
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,689
(Parched lips)

129
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,389
I hope they do well.

130
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,959
- I think they will.
- Of course.

131
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,629
I wasn't that worried.

132
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,730
(BTS Performance Group Part C, joint part)

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,740
(Intimidating)

134
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,610
(Focused)

135
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,449
(That's what I'm talking about!)

136
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,129
(Thrilled)

137
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,000
- What is happening?
- My brain has reset.

138
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,040
- Goodness.
- No way.

139
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,810
(We love it!)

140
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,569
I thought they were pretty threatening.

141
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,449
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

142
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
(Moved)

143
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,319
- Yes!
- You did so well!

144
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,220
- That was awesome.
- Yes!

145
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,060
I got goosebumps.

146
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,600
They're determined to win! Gosh!

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,930
- They're way too determined.
- What was that?

148
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,300
I couldn't believe how high the quality was.

149
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,139
(Nicely done!)

150
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,269
(The raw performance turned the stage upside down.)

151
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,300
Are you guys crazy?

152
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,040
That was insane. It was so good.

153
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,339
- It was certainly raw.
- Right?

154
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,639
I loved their eyes and spirits.

155
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,550
I could tell that they wanted to prove themselves.

156
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,079
I doubt we'll lose now.

157
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,019
(Team HOOK doubts that it'll lose.)

158
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I thought we were going to win.

159
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
(Meanwhile,)

160
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,990
(Team JAM REPUBLIC looks pretty nervous.)

161
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,730
The match felt real then as all of our members were nervous.

162
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,629
The next team to compete...

163
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,199
for the joint part in the BTS Performance Group...

164
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,399
is Team JAM REPUBLIC.

165
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,339
Let's check out their performance.

166
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,870
Team JAM REPUBLIC!

167
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,379
Will they just dance with six dancers?

168
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,410
- One of them is missing.
- Right.

169
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,149
(Team JAM REPUBLIC's practice room)

170
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,180
(Only 6 of them are here to practice the joint part.)

171
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
Team JAM REPUBLIC!

172
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,050
Team JAM REPUBLIC!

173
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,259
(Min Jung, who couldn't participate in the practice, appears.)

174
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,160
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you.

175
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,589
(They affectionately welcome her.)

176
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm so sorry...

177
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,860
that I can't dance with you guys this time...

178
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,829
because of my shoulder injury.

179
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,040
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

180
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,569
(The masters heard the news and visited.)

181
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,870
I know that there are six members sitting here right now.

182
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,410
And with six people, you can definitely do it.

183
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,009
Believe in what you have.

184
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,920
Believe that you guys are sitting here as six strong dancers.

185
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,420
She gave us great lessons mentally,

186
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,689
and I don't think I can forget them for the rest of my life.

187
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,420
I could feel that we grew today.

188
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,430
Three, two, one.

189
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,759
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

190
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,800
(Team JAM REPUBLIC trusts each other and motivates themselves.)

191
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,670
It's so global.

192
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,540
- I can't wait to watch them.
- I wonder how they'll dance.

193
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,839
There are probably a lot of techniques.

194
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,639
I want to show them a performance that they've never seen before.

195
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,209
We're going to win, 100 percent.

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,910
(What will their performance be like with people's high expectations?)

197
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,379
(BTS Performance Group Part C, joint part)

198
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,399
(Screaming)

199
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,100
Gosh. That's insane!

200
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,569
I thought, "They're going hard."

201
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,620
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

202
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,590
- Yes!
- Nice, ladies.

203
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
(We're proud of you.)

204
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,220
They're so good.

205
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,230
- That was so high-quality.
- Totally.

206
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,230
Their individual skills are great.

207
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,330
It felt good to really showcase...

208
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,830
everything to its fullest.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
It was well-structured.

210
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,470
I think they are crazily talented.

211
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,500
And I think they have the best spirits,

212
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,009
the best hearts, and the best mindsets.

213
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,940
And I think they're going to do well either way this goes.

214
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,879
The masters, except for the ones in the BTS Performance Group,

215
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,809
please write your evaluations.

216
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,679
You're clearly getting the extra points.

217
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,120
I think it's a matter of preference at this point.

218
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,720
I think Team HOOK will win. They'll take the directing rights.

219
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,590
They both have particular strengths, so it's tough to choose.

220
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,029
I can't tell the result, now that we've actually watched them.

221
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,529
First, we will reveal the team that gave the lowest point.

222
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,700
Why do I get so nervous when they reveal the scores?

223
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,200
I hope we weren't the ones that gave the lowest score.

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,210
The team that gave Team JAM REPUBLIC the lowest score is...

225
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,340
Team MANNEQUEEN.

226
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,909
(Us?)

227
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,480
The team that gave Team HOOK the lowest score is...

228
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,950
Please.

229
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,019
(Please don't be us.)

230
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,279
(Team LACHICA)

231
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,519
- Team LACHICA.
- Shoot.

232
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,590
What?

233
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,389
(That's ridiculous.)

234
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,389
(They can't hold their heads up.)

235
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,490
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

236
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,029
You kept bullying me in "Street Woman Fighter" too.

237
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,000
- It wasn't me.
- Now even here?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
No. I was very impressed.

239
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,029
My score wasn't that low, though.

240
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,240
That means you guys did well. I didn't give such a low score.

241
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,509
I expect good results for you.

242
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,580
(Laughing)

243
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
(Just wait and see.)

244
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,649
Excluding the highest and lowest scores,

245
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,850
we will reveal the final score for Team JAM REPUBLIC.

246
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,220
- My heart is racing now.
- It must be so nerve-racking.

247
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,559
I was a little bit nervous, but I tried my best...

248
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,190
for what I could do at the time, so I was excited.

249
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:22,929
Your final score...

250
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,730
is 172.

251
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,029
(Team JAM REPUBLIC, 172)

252
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,070
That's high.

253
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,669
(You can't predict the result yet.)

254
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,169
Next, excluding the highest and lowest scores,

255
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,909
we will reveal the final score for Team HOOK.

256
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,980
Your final score...

257
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,950
(Holding hands tightly)

258
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,779
Please.

259
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,419
That was almost a 200-percent growth from us,

260
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,789
so I believe we'll take Part C.

261
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,820
One hundred and seventy...

262
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,690
(Could it be?)

263
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,330
(If it's higher than 172, Team HOOK wins.)

264
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,659
One.

265
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,730
(Team HOOK, 171)

266
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,970
One.

267
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,830
(Shocked)

268
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,840
- It's a one-point difference?
- Yes.

269
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,370
(The difference was only 1 point.)

270
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,370
(Covering her mouth)

271
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,470
The scores for the joint part of the BTS Performance Group...

272
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,139
were 171 to 172 with only a 1-point difference.

273
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,809
Team JAM REPUBLIC takes the joint part.

274
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,049
Congratulations, guys.

275
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,379
- One point.
- Just one point.

276
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,950
I'd also like to say that you're very good, Team HOOK.

277
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,289
And you inspired us, and you're very good.

278
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:26,620
So, thank you.

279
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,990
(Regretful)

280
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,529
(BTS Performance Group's Part C will be directed by Team JAM REPUBLIC.)

281
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,899
Are we next?

282
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

283
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,000
My heart is pounding so hard. It's killing me.

284
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,769
(I am not nervous.)

285
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,970
(I'm not nervous at all!)

286
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,179
- Are you ready, girls?
- Are you ready?

287
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,509
- Let's do this.
- Are you ready?

288
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,409
We're going to dominate them.

289
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,320
The 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

290
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
BLACKPINK Performance Group.

291
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,889
We will begin the interim evaluation for the joint part.

292
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
Team MANNEQUEEN and Team BEBE have chosen BLACKPINK.

293
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,620
These two teams have never gone...

294
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,389
against each other on Street Woman Fighter 2.

295
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
They will finally compete.

296
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,730
- Right.
- He's right!

297
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,730
(I can't believe we're finally competing.)

298
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,799
(When they chose their opponents...)

299
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,169
(Team BEBE got the right to choose its opponent.)

300
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,000
(They chose Team MANNEQUEEN.)

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,539
(Bring it on.)

302
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,870
(A harsh comment...)

303
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,379
(on Team MANNEQUEEN)

304
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,139
(We can give you a harsh comment too!)

305
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,850
(Thanks.)

306
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,909
(You meant that, right?)

307
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,549
(There was a lot of tension between them.)

308
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,519
(We're not going to lose.)

309
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,460
It will definitely be a new match to check out.

310
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,330
I wonder which team will come out of this victorious.

311
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,129
Let's start with Team MANNEQUEEN's performance.

312
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,870
- Team MANNEQUEEN. Come on up.
- You got this!

313
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,899
- You got this!
- Go for it.

314
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:43,970
- You can do this.
- Let's go!

315
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,139
- Just do what you've been doing!
- You got this!

316
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,139
Yes!

317
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,139
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

318
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,139
(What is the performance Team MANNEQUEEN prepared?)

319
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,309
Let's take a look.

320
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,980
(Team MANNEQUEEN's practice room)

321
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,309
(The feedback day for Team MANNEQUEEN)

322
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,649
(Surprised)

323
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,879
(They're showing their performance for the first time to the masters.)

324
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,250
(Doing their best)

325
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,889
(The masters watch the girls with sharp eyes and focus on them.)

326
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,590
(What?)

327
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,059
(Their unfinished performance ends quickly.)

328
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,659
I couldn't stop studying their faces.

329
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,500
Our performance wasn't complete.

330
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,399
So I was a bit worried.

331
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,799
(Disappointed and contemplating)

332
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,139
Do you have any specific ideas for Part C?

333
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,009
Anything you want to try out?

334
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,879
(None of them can speak up.)

335
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,809
(As it's not finished, the masters can't give feedback.)

336
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,549
Are you still visualizing it?

337
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,289
Let's give them more time to practice.

338
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,190
Do you want to start from the top again?

339
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,759
- Just marking it?
- Yes. In front of the mirror?

340
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
Part C was pretty short.

341
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,129
But we weren't able to complete our choreography for it.

342
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,299
We haven't shown them what we're capable of.

343
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,500
Preparing the performance the best we can...

344
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
is the polite thing to do.

345
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,639
- Team MANNEQUEEN. Let's go!
- Let's go!

346
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,039
- Let's go!
- Okay!

347
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,039
Let's go, Team Street!

348
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,149
Show us!

349
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,509
Gosh. They really are a team of street dancers.

350
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,750
Gosh. They've got hip-hop dancers and waacking dancers.

351
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,649
- Hip-hop and waacking.
- Hip-king.

352
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,850
(That's a compound word for hip-hop and waacking.)

353
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,090
"Hip-king?" What?

354
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,690
(What was that?)

355
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,590
- Gosh. What am I feeling?
- No, we can do this.

356
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590
- Is this how it feels to have kids?
- Right?

357
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,830
- My heart is pounding.
- If I get married and have kids,

358
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,830
this is how I'll feel, right?

359
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,100
- They're going to start.
- Gosh.

360
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
You got this!

361
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,730
Goodness. It already looks...

362
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,539
(Curious and watchful)

363
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,009
- What's that?
- Gosh.

364
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,440
- Great.
- Nice.

365
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,539
- Goodness.
- Don't get hurt, girls.

366
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,039
- Gosh, girls.
- Don't get hurt.

367
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,850
- I'll show you who the queen is!
- Play the music!

368
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,120
- Wait.
- Wait.

369
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,720
(Team MANNEQUEEN grabs everyone's attention.)

370
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,120
Their intro is no joke.

371
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,190
That looks pretty cool.

372
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,860
I have a bad feeling about this.

373
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,919
(What are we going to do?)

374
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,960
Play the music.

375
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,299
(BLACKPINK Performance Group Part C, joint part)

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,230
(Intense)

377
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,700
(Restless)

378
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,639
(Impressed)

379
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:06,909
(Worried and pressured)

380
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,649
Oh, they're good at that.

381
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
There you go.

382
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,149
They took a simple path.

383
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,919
(This is what I'm talking about!)

384
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,960
I thought about how we could make the choreography dynamic.

385
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,029
(Let's go, queens.)

386
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,629
(Showing off the technique one more time)

387
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,269
I thought we could end up losing to them.

388
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,970
That's it!

389
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,309
Let's go!

390
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,940
(Wait. That move is...)

391
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,909
(Queen Na Ra of "BOOMERANG" from the K-pop Choreography Mission)

392
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,049
(The return of Queen Na Ra)

393
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,519
- Yes.
- Let's go!

394
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,860
Okay.

395
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,990
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

396
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,360
Gosh, they're better than me.

397
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,960
She just went like this.

398
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,500
"Move!"

399
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
"It's my turn!"

400
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
- That was so cute.
- Yes.

401
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,169
That was so good.

402
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
- Their performance had a punch.
- Exactly.

403
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,809
No. We can do this.

404
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,340
We can do this.

405
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,340
Ga Young. Don't even worry.

406
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,779
Ga Young. Go kill it.

407
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,080
- Don't worry, girls.
- Crush it.

408
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,179
Well done.

409
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,679
Hye Rin flew up pretty high earlier.

410
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,149
I think she flew like 2m.

411
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,149
- Gosh.
- Two meters.

412
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,750
Gosh. By the way...

413
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,590
- She's got two microphones.
- Seriously.

414
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,659
Combining various genres and working with different dancers...

415
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,259
over this short period of time wasn't easy.

416
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,190
I'm really proud of the girls for that.

417
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,100
When I thought about the 14 of them performing together,

418
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,159
I could easily see how their choreographies were suitable...

419
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,269
to showcase the key points.

420
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,070
I thought it would look really cool with Team BEBE.

421
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,299
That's what I thought about their performance.

422
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,370
Great.

423
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,610
(Feeling proud)

424
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:45,279
Next, we'll watch Team BEBE's performance.

425
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,139
- Let's go!
- Okay!

426
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,509
Come on out.

427
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,049
Let's go!

428
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,519
They must be so nervous.

429
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,649
I wonder what they prepared.

430
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,889
I'm curious.

431
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,919
Congratulations!

432
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,789
What a happy occasion this is.

433
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,690
(Team BEBE is in a celebratory mood.)

434
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,700
(The 6 teams evaluated each other for the K-pop Choreography Mission.)

435
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,299
(Team BEBE won 1st place.)

436
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

437
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm looking forward to your choreography even more...

438
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,039
after hearing that you won first place.

439
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,009
I know I shouldn't have high expectations,

440
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,240
but I can't help it.

441
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,480
Let's check out Part C.

442
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,740
- Okay.
- Great.

443
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,779
(It's time for Team BEBE to get feedback for their routine.)

444
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,720
(Master Bada watches them with sharp eyes.)

445
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,680
(She's filming the video to check later.)

446
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,819
(They finish in sync with a cool pose.)

447
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:30,819
Great.

448
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Thank you.

449
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,690
- That was cool.
- Thank you.

450
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,490
Personally, I thought the waacking part was quite short.

451
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,500
I think you can prepare it like a serenade.

452
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,369
"This is what we prepared for you." Something like that.

453
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,369
There are so many things you guys can do with this.

454
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,500
But there aren't a lot of moves that waacking dancers can do.

455
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,940
That's exactly what we were thinking too.

456
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,839
So we did our best to prepare this performance.

457
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,650
(The masters deliver their heartfelt feedback.)

458
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,680
- You got this.
- Let's go!

459
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,579
Okay. We'll give you time to practice.

460
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,650
- We'll leave you be.
- We'll leave you be now.

461
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,019
(Playful)

462
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,160
It went smoothly.

463
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,720
We were revising our choreography after hearing their advice.

464
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,359
And it helped us a lot.

465
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,130
We'll be able to create some high-quality choreography.

466
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,660
- Very good, - Very good,

467
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,000
- BEBE!
- BEBE!

468
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,599
(Very good, Team BEBE!)

469
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,240
- Good luck!
- Yes!

470
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,369
(Nervous)

471
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,170
I wonder if Team BEBE stuck to their style.

472
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,380
(The joint part from Team BEBE will be revealed now.)

473
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,210
(BLACKPINK Performance Group Part C, joint part)

474
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,480
Wait. They added waacking.

475
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,650
I see. They can do waacking too.

476
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,089
Nice!

477
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,930
Yes.

478
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,930
(That's cool.)

479
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,430
- Hey.
- Okay.

480
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,869
(That's nice.)

481
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,240
(Getting goosebumps)

482
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,569
- Hey.
- Okay.

483
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,049
We won.

484
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,160
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

485
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,119
- They kept it as Team BEBE.
- Yes.

486
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,890
- Yes, Team BEBE.
- They kept it as Team BEBE.

487
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,329
- They were so powerful.
- They killed it as usual.

488
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,329
That was no joke.

489
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,430
They're so good.

490
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,829
- Well done.
- Great job.

491
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,839
- Great job.
- Great job.

492
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,970
They definitely kept to their style.

493
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,269
I realized that after watching this.

494
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,740
They just assumed that they were going to take this part.

495
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,339
It looked like they added a part for us in their choreography.

496
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,380
I could feel their confidence.

497
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,779
- I would like to say something.
- Yes.

498
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,920
Actually, our performance was centered around the choreography.

499
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,319
But we wanted the hip-hop dancers to shine.

500
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,460
The same went for waacking dancers.

501
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,089
So I advised the girls that it would be nice...

502
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,400
to add those styles to the choreography.

503
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,730
And they accepted it right away.

504
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,170
So I'm really proud of them.

505
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,440
I would like to address the other masters now.

506
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
(Look at that.)

507
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,670
I hope you will kindly think of our intention. Kirsten.

508
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,309
(Kirsten.)

509
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,309
Hi.

510
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,410
(You know that I love you, right?)

511
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,250
- Okay.
- Kirsten.

512
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,549
Kirsten.

513
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,750
(The masters show each other loving gestures.)

514
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,549
(Oh, no. What am I going to do?)

515
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,789
Thank you.

516
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,789
(That was hilarious.)

517
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,920
I hope we get a good score.

518
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,990
Right. You can thank them in advance then.

519
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,930
- Thank them. Say, "Thank you." - "Thank you."

520
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,329
No. Let's abort that idea.

521
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,170
We, Team MANNEQUEEN, worked really hard on this.

522
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,069
We practiced even in the morning before coming here.

523
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,410
- Don't be shy.
- And...

524
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,309
Seo Yeon of Team BEBE. You were amazing.

525
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,779
- What?
- I'd like to compliment you.

526
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,779
They said they also practiced early in the morning.

527
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,009
So, great job. We both did a great job.

528
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,180
(I see. Both of them practiced in the morning?)

529
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
What?

530
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,319
We were in the same boat.

531
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,319
- What was that?
- Our situations were the same.

532
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,460
I know how it is.

533
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,059
"I know how it is."

534
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,059
- Keep it short.
- We worked hard.

535
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,390
Anyway, I hope you give us a nice score.

536
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,690
Okay. Great.

537
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,329
All right. Well done to both teams.

538
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,500
I wish good results for you.

539
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,769
- Thank you.
- Okay.

540
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,900
- That was a cute threat.
- It was a cute threat indeed.

541
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,539
Team MANNEQUEEN...

542
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,240
and Team BEBE chose BLACKPINK.

543
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,039
We watched both of their performances.

544
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,539
The team that wasn't chosen cannot showcase their choreography.

545
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,309
The choreography of the chosen team will be included in the performance.

546
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,450
You guys are the best.

547
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,819
(Thank you.)

548
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,019
I wonder which of the two teams...

549
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,660
will take the Part C.

550
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,990
I will now announce the highest and the lowest scores...

551
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,559
from the other teams. These two scores will be...

552
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,589
excluded from their total scores.

553
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,460
Gosh. I'm nervous.

554
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Wait.

555
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,559
Let's see.

556
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,569
(Nervous)

557
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,829
The team that gave Team MANNEQUEEN the lowest score is...

558
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:38,839
I'm nervous.

559
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,440
It's nervous to get the results onstage.

560
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,910
(Is it Team JAM REPUBLIC?)

561
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,309
Which one could it be?

562
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,539
(Busily scanning the room)

563
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,549
(It can't be me, right?)

564
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,349
(Which team gave the lowest score to Team MANNEQUEEN?)

565
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:52,349
It's Team LACHICA.

566
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,150
It's Team LACHICA.

567
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,819
(Everyone looks at one person.)

568
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,819
It's Team LACHICA.

569
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,289
No way. That can't be. Seriously.

570
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,890
- We were really generous.
- Seriously?

571
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,859
Why do you keep revealing this?

572
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,730
This is driving me crazy.

573
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,140
(Team LACHICA gave the lowest score to Team HOOK too.)

574
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,710
It wasn't even a low score.

575
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,539
Their scores were about the same.

576
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,140
We just...

577
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,940
I mean...

578
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,309
(She's got nothing to say.)

579
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,609
(They're just enjoying the banter as it doesn't concern them.)

580
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,250
- Seriously. This is so weird.
- Come on.

581
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,619
(Bursting into laughter)

582
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,450
She said this was weird.

583
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,920
(The girls also burst into laughter.)

584
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,119
Stop revealing the scores.

585
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,130
- She said this was weird.
- On the other hand,

586
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,890
as for the team that gave the highest score,

587
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,799
it was Team JAM REPUBLIC.

588
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,660
(We love you, Team JAM REPUBLIC.)

589
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,299
It was Team JAM REPUBLIC.

590
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,000
(This is amazing.)

591
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,900
(We gave the highest score?)

592
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,210
(Envious and anxious)

593
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,539
Gosh, this feels really good.

594
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,910
Next, I will now announce the teams...

595
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,750
that gave the lowest and highest scores to Team BEBE.

596
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,880
The team that gave the lowest score to Team BEBE is...

597
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,980
(Smiling)

598
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Is it Team LACHICA again? No way.

599
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,819
- It can't be us again.
- I think it's us.

600
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,559
- Is it us?
- It's Team HOOK.

601
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,819
(Puzzled)

602
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,390
(Team HOOK?)

603
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,789
(Everyone whines in disappointment.)

604
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,529
All right. Don't get the wrong idea.

605
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,000
(Team HOOK gave the highest score to Team LACHICA.)

606
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:21,640
Team HOOK gave the highest score.

607
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,769
(Team HOOK gave the highest score once again.)

608
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,480
Well, when we give the highest scores, the scores are...

609
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,009
(The scores are...)

610
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:29,509
(What?)

611
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,180
(What about the scores?)

612
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,519
Yes.

613
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,220
What do you want from me?

614
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,990
What do you want?

615
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,720
This is so weird!

616
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,859
What do you want?

617
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,160
- What can we do?
- Right.

618
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,630
On the other hand, the team that gave the highest score was...

619
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,799
Team JAM REPUBLIC.

620
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,039
(What we did earlier must have worked.)

621
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,740
(Team JAM REPUBLIC also gave us the highest score!)

622
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,309
What?

623
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,180
Nice.

624
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,240
They're suddenly scoring generously.

625
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,309
- Right.
- As they were singled out a lot...

626
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,380
- in the beginning.
- Exactly.

627
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,150
- We gave a high score.
- Right.

628
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,309
(How many more points did they give?)

629
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,650
They gave the highest score for both teams.

630
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,490
I will now announce Team MANNEQUEEN's final score...

631
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,420
after excluding the lowest and highest scores.

632
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,359
I'm so nervous. Hold my hands.

633
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,660
(Holding hands)

634
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,200
Team MANNEQUEEN's final score is...

635
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,269
Gosh. Why is your palm so sweaty?

636
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,599
I'm so nervous.

637
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,339
To be honest, I was really confident.

638
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,869
I think we'll be able to win more points...

639
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,039
than them.

640
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:33,579
Their score...

641
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,579
Their score...

642
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,650
(Team MANNEQUEEN's score is...)

643
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,049
is 167.

644
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,990
(Team MANNEQUEEN's score is 167.)

645
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,819
(Well done.)

646
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,390
Team BEBE's final score is...

647
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,500
As things are happening the way we want,

648
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,470
we might be able to win this one again.

649
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,599
(Please let us win.)

650
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,630
(Shutting her eyes tightly)

651
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,039
(What is it?)

652
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,069
(Team BEBE's score...)

653
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,369
It's 171.

654
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,710
(Team BEBE takes the joint part with a 4-point lead.)

655
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,309
- Congratulations.
- Nice.

656
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:12,950
We were only off by four points.

657
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,150
- It wasn't a huge gap.
- Well done.

658
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,589
- Well done.
- Well done, girls.

659
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,890
- For the joint part of...
- Well done.

660
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,119
- the BLACKPINK Performance Group, - You were amazing.

661
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,259
the final score had a four-point difference,

662
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,359
the score being 167 to 171.

663
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,660
Team BEBE will direct the joint part.

664
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,759
(It feels amazing)

665
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,329
(Embarrassed)

666
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,500
This is nice.

667
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,470
It was so sad because we were so close.

668
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,109
Losing Part C to Team BEBE...

669
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,410
was so upsetting for us.

670
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,769
We plan to work really hard...

671
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,210
with strong determination so we can beat Team BEBE.

672
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,480
We might be able to gain a huge lead this time.

673
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,650
We had the interim evaluation...

674
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,880
for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

675
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,220
Team JAM REPUBLIC will take...

676
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,349
the BTS Performance Group's joint part.

677
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,119
Team 1MILLION will take...

678
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,190
the SEVENTEEN Performance Group's joint part.

679
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,190
And Team BEBE will take...

680
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,960
the BLACKPINK Performance Group's joint part.

681
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,369
(1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

682
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,200
(Based on the results of the mission,)

683
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,569
(a team will be eliminated for the first time.)

684
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,839
(Which team will leave the stage today?)

685
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,150
I'm confident. We don't plan on going home.

686
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,579
We must win first place this time around.

687
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,319
I will not get eliminated. Over my dead body.

688
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,319
We will not be ranked last from now on.

689
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,690
It makes me think that we can beat everyone and get to the top.

690
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,490
(All 6 teams assemble in 1 place for the results.)

691
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,059
The birth of a world-class teenage dance crew.

692
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,700
You're watching Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

693
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,329
Hello. I'm your host, Kang Daniel.

694
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:36,269
(Clapping)

695
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,170
(It's nice to see you again.)

696
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,000
Today, the results of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

697
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,039
will be announced. And along with the results,

698
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,240
a team will be eliminated...

699
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,079
- for the first time.
- Oh, no!

700
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,710
- No!
- Oh, no.

701
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,210
(We don't want to get eliminated.)

702
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,220
Will you survive or get eliminated?

703
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,380
The fates of the six teams will be decided...

704
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,789
by the results of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

705
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,859
The teams that won the joint part...

706
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,720
received 100 extra points.

707
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,829
And including the score from the online public evaluation,

708
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,559
the final scores will be calculated.

709
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,430
As for the online public evaluation...

710
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,829
of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

711
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:12,299
the scores were received on the official platform of the show,

712
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,400
and Mnet Plus.

713
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,740
Here's how the scores were totaled. The view counts of the videos...

714
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,839
for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

715
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
on the official platform were added...

716
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,009
after multiplying the number of likes by 100.

717
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,980
Then, each vote on Mnet Plus was multiplied by 100...

718
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,420
and added to the total for the final ranking.

719
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,490
The team in 1st place received 900 points.

720
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,819
And starting with the team in second place,

721
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:33,619
we deducted 90 points for each step and added them to your scores.

722
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,890
That's a huge difference.

723
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,960
How is our view count?

724
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,259
I think it was high.

725
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,900
During the interim evaluation for the joint parts,

726
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,269
three teams won the extra points.

727
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,799
If they win first place for the online public evaluation,

728
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,440
they will be getting 1,000 points.

729
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,579
- A thousand points?
- Gosh.

730
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,309
(The online public evaluation will play a vital role.)

731
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,579
I want the 1,000 points.

732
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:58,049
The results of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

733
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,480
will decide the winning and losing teams based on groups.

734
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:03,250
And the three losing teams will be at risk of getting eliminated.

735
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,720
(3 teams will be at risk of getting eliminated.)

736
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,859
Right.

737
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,720
Since there are three matches.

738
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,789
(3 teams? That's a lot.)

739
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,390
Among the three teams that could face elimination,

740
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,259
one will be eliminated.

741
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,299
But there are winning and losing teams for each performance group.

742
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,769
So based on the extra points and the results of your opponents,

743
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,039
even if you win first place for the online public evaluation,

744
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,910
you could get eliminated.

745
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,069
(That's not easy.)

746
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,140
Even if we win first place,

747
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,809
we might face the Elimination Battle.

748
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,279
You don't know what will happen until it's really over.

749
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,309
Which team will be the first to leave the stage...

750
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,349
of Street Dance Girls Fighter 2?

751
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,880
(Which team will be eliminated first?)

752
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,220
Which team will it be?

753
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,660
(Hearts pound.)

754
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,319
- Why?
- No.

755
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,859
(Already? No!)

756
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,930
I'll now announce the final results...

757
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,529
of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission...

758
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,400
for each performance group.

759
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,529
(Hearts pound.)

760
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,000
(Why am I so nervous?)

761
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,309
(Weeping)

762
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,869
- No!
- I don't want that!

763
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,440
- Right now?
- Gosh.

764
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,250
(The votes have been counted with observers in attendance.)

765
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,380
First of all...

766
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
(Nerve-racking)

767
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,490
(Utterly nervous)

768
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,690
Why do I feel like it might be us?

769
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,660
(You think it might be us?)

770
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,690
(Nervous)

771
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,859
(Which team will be announced first?)

772
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,559
The BLACKPINK Performance Group.

773
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,029
Now?

774
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,170
(The 1st of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission)

775
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,700
Team BEBE...

776
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,769
- Please help us.
- Please help us.

777
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,009
(Team BEBE for the BLACKPINK Performance Group)

778
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,710
and Team MANNEQUEEN.

779
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,380
- Gosh.
- I'll announce their results now.

780
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
(Team BEBE versus Team MANNEQUEEN)

781
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,849
Gosh, I can't breathe.

782
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,750
I'm really curious about the result for this group.

783
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,750
- Right.
- They were both really good.

784
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,190
These two teams in particular had a close match.

785
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,059
("Their teamwork and composition were great. They're my favorite.")

786
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,160
("They were out of this world. They were crazy good.")

787
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,829
("Team White was amazing. They were so cool.")

788
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,099
("They were really good overall. I can't wait for their next stage.")

789
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,299
("What an original performance. Their choreography made the song.")

790
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,930
("The mix of black and white was amazing.")

791
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,869
(The public liked both teams of the BLACKPINK Performance Group.)

792
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,509
I bet it's a really close call for these two.

793
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,809
Right. Their group is the hardest to guess.

794
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,410
This is the BLACKPINK Performance Group...

795
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,650
of the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

796
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,779
The team that won the extra points...

797
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,720
was Team BEBE.

798
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,220
(Extra points for the joint part, Team BEBE: 100 points)

799
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,660
To be honest, I wasn't sure if we could win.

800
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,130
I thought that it might be a close match.

801
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,599
We have the extra points. So we'll be okay.

802
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,259
(Worried)

803
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,329
I really hope so.

804
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,430
If we had done a bit better,

805
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,700
we could have won the extra points. It was really sad that we couldn't.

806
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:37,769
Were there any difficult moments while preparing for this mission?

807
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,579
If I have to choose, I would say that...

808
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,779
we had a tough time at the beginning of the mission.

809
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,589
(What happened to Team BEBE and Team MANNEQUEEN?)

810
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,049
(The two leaders met up to decide the parts.)

811
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,359
(Having a war of silence)

812
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,230
You knew that the intro to "Pink Venom" is boom bap, right?

813
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,160
- Yes.
- Did you still want to do it?

814
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,259
Of course.

815
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:02,099
I've given it some thought. Your team's logo starts with a B.

816
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,599
(Laughing)

817
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,299
Hey, you're forcing it now.

818
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,099
Even the logo is telling you what to do.

819
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,809
- Soo Jung. That was so lame.
- It's so obvious.

820
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,210
(This isn't easy.)

821
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,180
We're going to break away from our usual style.

822
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,250
We'll take a completely different approach now.

823
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,650
"Ice Cream" will be perfect for that then.

824
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,920
But...

825
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,450
choosing BLACKPINK was enough to shock people.

826
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,059
We can show a different style of choreography for female songs.

827
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,460
And "Pink Venom" is the right song to showcase our moves.

828
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,630
Given the beat and tempo, don't you think...

829
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,960
that song is perfect for the street genre?

830
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,400
- That's a stereotype.
- You can...

831
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:37,829
I thought she was trying to give us the genre...

832
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,000
we'd struggle the most with so we'd end up last.

833
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,569
- We're doomed.
- Indeed.

834
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,339
We'll end up here all night at this rate.

835
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,049
I've been thinking, and I think the intro of "Ice Cream..."

836
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:52,380
will be perfect for waacking.

837
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,119
- I can't stop thinking that.
- For us?

838
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,289
Would you like to see it for yourself?

839
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,619
Go ahead, Hye Rin.

840
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,259
They said it'd be good for waacking. So try it.

841
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,460
(Team MANNEQUEEN tries to incorporate waacking into Part B.)

842
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,759
(So you think this looks good?)

843
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,230
Seriously. She's hilarious.

844
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,900
Look at that.

845
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
(But the members of Team BEBE stop smiling.)

846
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,640
(There's tension between them again.)

847
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,539
See you later then.

848
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,039
So do you guys not want to dance to "Ice Cream" at all?

849
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,069
No, not at all.

850
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,839
We have members who street dance.

851
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,650
Is it right for us...

852
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,079
to give them a part that they can't even attempt?

853
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,420
We specialize in choreography, so we can do "Ice Cream."

854
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,289
(The two teams meet again after a short meeting.)

855
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:31,819
We'll take...

856
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:33,960
(Nervous)

857
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,089
Part B.

858
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,890
- What?
- We'll do Part B.

859
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,829
Just take Part A.

860
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

861
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

862
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,230
(Practice day for the joint part)

863
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,069
Who are the two people waacking?

864
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:48,069
(The two teams gather again after deciding on the parts.)

865
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,640
The two people waacking can come out separately.

866
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,809
The two people dancing hip-hop will be right here.

867
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,410
It was disappointing that I lost the chance to direct.

868
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,250
We still wanted to try our best to our ability.

869
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,890
That's what we were thinking.

870
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,059
We're going to be in the front and all the way in the back.

871
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,859
You just have to be at the corners of the rectangle.

872
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,890
- I see.
- Can I see you here?

873
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,799
Yes, a little wider. Move farther back.

874
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,200
(She won't allow even the slightest slip.)

875
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,299
Yes, like that.

876
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,470
I had so many images in my head...

877
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,640
that I wrote them down before going to practice.

878
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,480
Again. In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
and seven.

880
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,809
(Something feels empty.)

881
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,910
Should we add one more person to the diagonal?

882
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,779
Let's include Hee Jae in this one. Okay.

883
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,319
In 5, 6, and 7.

884
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,519
That looks good. One more time.

885
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,119
In 5, 6, and 7.

886
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,960
(They repeat and sync up every little detail.)

887
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,599
(Glaring openly)

888
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,029
(This is going to take a while.)

889
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,700
It took a long time.

890
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,299
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

891
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,410
(They keep practicing the joint part.)

892
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:57,609
- One more time.
- Okay.

893
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,640
(Leader Ga Young makes them repeat moves over and over.)

894
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,989
We heard the same music 8 or 10 times,

895
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,719
and we kept listening to the same part again and again.

896
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,360
It felt very disorderly.

897
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,389
(Why is Ga Young focusing on the details to this extent?)

898
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,199
(Meeting the masters, two days earlier)

899
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,099
If you decide to fix the details later while you're practicing,

900
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,269
- you end up missing things.
- Right.

901
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,429
(This is totally a pro tip.)

902
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,000
(As soon as you make the moves,)

903
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,139
(perfect the details.)

904
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,909
You'll run out of time the closer you get to the deadline.

905
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,570
You'll end up just going with it, even if it's not perfect.

906
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,139
(The masters' advice is to perfect the details immediately.)

907
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,610
That advice really spoke to me.

908
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,150
The choreography we came up with...

909
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,849
shows every miss in coordination really clearly.

910
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,190
So we paid a lot of attention to that.

911
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:52,500
(Team MANNEQUEEN becomes increasingly exhausted.)

912
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,429
Time kept passing.

913
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,130
Was this really the most effective way to do things?

914
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,639
If it were me, it would've taken a lot less time.

915
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,380
(A meeting of two teams with totally different styles)

916
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,519
(Can these two teams safely complete their joint part?)

917
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,250
(Nervous and worried)

918
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,219
(Nervous)

919
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,289
- Hye Rin.
- Let's go!

920
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,719
- Please.
- Hye Rin.

921
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,730
(The BLACKPINK Performance Group's video is finally revealed.)

922
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,900
("Pink Venom" by BLACKPINK, choreo by Team MANNEQUEEN)

923
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,369
(Is that really Team MANNEQUEEN?)

924
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,769
That's Team MANNEQUEEN?

925
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:39,110
- Is that really Team MANNEQUEEN?
- It is.

926
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,010
- This is Team MANNEQUEEN.
- It's Team MANNEQUEEN.

927
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,219
(It's so powerful!)

928
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,619
(Giggly and happy)

929
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,400
She looks at the camera until the very end.

930
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,570
They came up with great structures.

931
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:09,940
Let's go, Dan Bi!

932
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,849
- It wasn't her!
- It wasn't her!

933
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,150
It wasn't Hye Rin.

934
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,329
Let's go!

935
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,400
That's amazing!

936
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,039
(Amazing!)

937
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:42,769
(Amazed)

938
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,780
When we saw their expressions under their masks,

939
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,239
we realized that they really made it come alive.

940
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,280
They showed off their craziness properly.

941
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,050
So this was Na Ra. No wonder.

942
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,730
Let's go!

943
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,789
(Team BEBE, let's go!)

944
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:07,860
("Ice Cream" by BLACKPINK, choreo by Team BEBE)

945
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,570
The formation is great.

946
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,300
Gosh!

947
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,510
(Embarrassed)

948
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,539
What am I doing?

949
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:23,110
(Screaming)

950
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,980
(She's so cute.)

951
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,920
They look so pretty.

952
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,260
They're so good at dancing.

953
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,369
Okay!

954
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Okay.

955
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,679
(Screaming)

956
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:05,150
(Whistling in appreciation)

957
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,420
(So cute)

958
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,159
They're so cute.

959
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,230
They went with a very "love and peace" look.

960
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,579
(Suddenly showing no emotions)

961
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,250
(Surprised)

962
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
She was smiling, then suddenly looked emotionless!

963
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,079
(Embarrassed)

964
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,750
The ice cream has melted!

965
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,690
(BLACKPINK Performance Group joint part, directed by Team BEBE)

966
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,869
Gosh. The joint part is really great here.

967
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:00,809
(Cheering)

968
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,380
(Satisfied)

969
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,179
(How are they so cute?)

970
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:06,449
(Copying her)

971
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,289
(That's great!)

972
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,789
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

973
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,260
The ending was cool.

974
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,000
- Seung Ju, nice skirt.
- Seung Ju.

975
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,400
(Copying Seung Ju's skirt attack.)

976
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,900
- Seriously.
- That was really great.

977
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,670
- Soo Jung is embarrassed.
- You did great.

978
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:35,139
- You did well. You looked so cool.
- You were cool.

979
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,409
(Amazed)

980
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,250
The joint part was really well made.

981
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,250
- It was really impressive.
- Team BEBE did a great job.

982
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,349
- The joint part was so well made.
- I know.

983
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,389
It wasn't boring or common.

984
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,130
They created a good performance.

985
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,159
That's why it was hard to predict who won this match.

986
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,730
I wonder what the masters thought about this performance.

987
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,269
(How will the masters evaluate it?)

988
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,980
Honestly, watching the video,

989
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,780
I naturally thought the 1st team up was Team BEBE,

990
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,179
and the 2nd team was Team MANNEQUEEN.

991
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,210
- That's true.
- Yes.

992
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,420
(Really?)

993
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,550
The two teams were so nicely blended together...

994
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,750
that it was that confusing.

995
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,320
I was a bit jealous. I didn't know Team BEBE was that good.

996
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,260
(Clapping all around)

997
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,000
(I told you we were good.)

998
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,269
I didn't know you'd make that performance come alive so well.

999
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,530
So they did have a lot of talents after all.

1000
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Gosh, they were amazing.

1001
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,940
In the middle, the person who was spinning...

1002
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,309
- In this part.
- Yes, exactly.

1003
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,349
The one spinning.

1004
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,610
Were you really trying to express soft serve ice cream?

1005
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,150
- Pardon?
- Soft serve ice cream.

1006
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,590
Oh, the swirling ice cream.

1007
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,050
- Just say you were.
- Yes, that's correct.

1008
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,119
I see.

1009
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,989
(Laughing)

1010
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,929
Yes, that's right. Whatever you say is right.

1011
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,289
- Come on.
- No way.

1012
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,099
- That's not right!
- She's right.

1013
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,159
I'm right? Okay.

1014
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,900
I liked that it seemed to express ice cream,

1015
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,969
so I found it very entertaining. I enjoyed the performance.

1016
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,969
In the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

1017
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,679
Team BEBE won the extra points for the joint part,

1018
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,280
leading to an early lead.

1019
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,949
In the BLACKPINK Performance Group, Team BEBE and Team MANNEQUEEN...

1020
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,380
were viewed online...

1021
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,820
for 308,137 times.

1022
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,650
- The teams were balanced.
- Team BEBE...

1023
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,789
- Both teams are good.
- Right.

1024
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,019
The difference in the number of votes...

1025
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,460
between Team BEBE and Team MANNEQUEEN...

1026
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,329
was fewer than 1,000.

1027
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,300
It was fewer than 1,000 votes.

1028
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,769
The winning team between these two teams...

1029
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,469
won by the slimmest margin.

1030
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,840
- I'm really curious about this one.
- Me too.

1031
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,309
I can't tell which way this one will go.

1032
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,079
The final results of the BLACKPINK Performance Group...

1033
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,539
between Teams BEBE and MANNEQUEEN, will now be revealed.

1034
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,480
We didn't have a lot of confidence,

1035
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,380
since we ended up doing the "Ice Cream" part.

1036
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,690
We thought we might lose even with the extra 100 points.

1037
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,659
- This is so nerve-racking.
- Please let us win this once.

1038
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:03,559
(Desperate)

1039
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,860
(I'm so nervous.)

1040
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,559
I think we might be in the top half since we had a lot of views.

1041
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,699
(Team MANNEQUEEN versus Team BEBE. Final results are revealed)

1042
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,170
(BLACKPINK Performance Group, Combined points)

1043
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,239
(BLACKPINK Performance Group)

1044
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,949
(Surprised)

1045
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:23,949
It's high.

1046
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,409
It's really high.

1047
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,820
Team BEBE received 10,223 likes...

1048
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,289
and 7,804 votes.

1049
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,159
And placing second for the online public evaluation,

1050
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,460
they received 810 points.

1051
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,789
Good job.

1052
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,760
Great job.

1053
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,460
Team MANNEQUEEN received 6,868 votes.

1054
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,469
Placing fourth for the online public evaluation,

1055
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,699
they received 630 points.

1056
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,070
Good job.

1057
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,239
Hee Jae, smile.

1058
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,139
Smile, Hee Jae. You did well.

1059
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,139
(We did a good job.)

1060
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,579
- We did well.
- Are you crying?

1061
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,409
(Feeling bad)

1062
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,809
I thought we'd win, but we lost.

1063
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,150
And we had to do a dance battle.

1064
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,320
I felt a little upset.

1065
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,349
We're going to show what we can do for real.

1066
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,119
(Team BEBE wins the BLACKPINK Performance Group match.)

1067
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,960
Next is the SEVENTEEN Performance Group.

1068
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:10,760
(Their eyes open wide.)

1069
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,460
(It's our turn next?)

1070
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's us.

1071
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,460
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group)

1072
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,800
Let me announce the result...

1073
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,030
of the match between Team 1MILLION and Team LACHICA.

1074
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,269
Oh, please.

1075
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:21,340
Gosh, it's us!

1076
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,670
Hey, it's us!

1077
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,639
Girls, what do we do?

1078
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:27,139
I'm so nervous right now.

1079
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,280
The SEVENTEEN Performance Group.

1080
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,480
The extra points for the joint part...

1081
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,210
were given to Team 1MILLION.

1082
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,650
(Extra points for the joint part, Team 1MILLION: 100 points)

1083
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,880
(Team 1MILLION received the highest score from the masters.)

1084
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,590
(Everyone was amazed.)

1085
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,260
(They're getting the public's attention...)

1086
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,329
(as a strong winning candidate.)

1087
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,630
(How cool.)

1088
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,760
(I think I know what it means to show teamwork with choreography.)

1089
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,329
(Team 1MILLION lived up to its name.)

1090
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,829
(Could Team 1MILLION place 1st?)

1091
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,369
(Team 1MILLION is the biggest rival for the other teams.)

1092
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,769
(Even in the future,)

1093
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,510
(we'll keep placing 1st.)

1094
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,840
(Meanwhile, Team LACHICA received the 5th highest score.)

1095
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,449
(It's like I'm watching a talent show.)

1096
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,780
(A talent show in middle school.)

1097
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,920
(Should we give Team LACHICA the 5th place?)

1098
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:08,880
(Even for the internal evaluation, they received negative comments,)

1099
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,949
(placing in the lower half of the table.)

1100
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:12,619
(Everyone expected Team LACHICA to be a candidate for elimination.)

1101
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,860
As we did our past missions...

1102
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:18,090
(Our teamwork wasn't so great.)

1103
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,599
I felt so angry because we kept placing last.

1104
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,800
There's nowhere to back down,

1105
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,730
so I'll be even more determined.

1106
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,269
(Will Team LACHICA come back up?)

1107
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,840
- Let's check the formation.
- Okay.

1108
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Stand in line.

1109
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,110
One, two, go.

1110
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,139
One, two, three, four.

1111
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,380
Five, six, seven, eight.

1112
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,679
- You go first.
- Wait.

1113
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:42,889
(Is there a problem?)

1114
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,989
- Move more to the side.
- Okay.

1115
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,460
(The leader corrects the disorder of their formation.)

1116
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,019
(Open space)

1117
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,059
Check in front of you.

1118
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,190
(Nervous)

1119
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,400
(The distances aren't even again.)

1120
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,800
Yoo Kyung, move inward.

1121
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,769
- Inward?
- Yes.

1122
00:44:58,769 --> 00:44:59,800
Then I should stand in front of this.

1123
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,139
- You guys should be closer.
- Okay.

1124
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,510
To the front. In one line.

1125
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,969
(Leader So Yoon doesn't miss even the minor details.)

1126
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,679
To the front.

1127
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,909
Shouldn't we talk about when to come in?

1128
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,250
We rehearsed it earlier.

1129
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,750
- Yes.
- From the start...

1130
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,550
Five, six, seven, eight.

1131
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:18,449
We may be eliminated if we mess up this mission.

1132
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,420
So I became more detailed.

1133
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,289
- Se Jung.
- Yes?

1134
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,929
Make sure you're in the center during this part.

1135
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:27,659
Hyo Rin, your part comes after Se Jung's.

1136
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,000
Get the formation right, even if we're pushed back.

1137
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,599
(At that moment,)

1138
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,940
(their opponent, Team 1MILLION, arrives.)

1139
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,809
(They quietly watch Team LACHICA rehearse.)

1140
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,110
(Amazed)

1141
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,380
They're good.

1142
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,880
Gosh, it's really powerful.

1143
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,590
Their choreography is so hard. How will they do the joint part?

1144
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:54,489
Team LACHICA was really energetic.

1145
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,090
It was beyond what I expected. They had prepared this performance...

1146
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,900
with various, entertaining moves, along with witty facial expressions.

1147
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,570
I thought we could end up losing.

1148
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:09,570
Team 1MILLION said they expected to lose.

1149
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,809
So that their remark comes true,

1150
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:15,579
we'll work hard.

1151
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,050
My gosh.

1152
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,159
Hey!

1153
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,159
Their facial expressions are different indeed.

1154
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,760
("Super" by SEVENTEEN, choreo by Team 1MILLION)

1155
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,260
It's so neat.

1156
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,800
Faces have to be visible to be good, I see.

1157
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,940
Let's go!

1158
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:46,039
(In Jung dashes.)

1159
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,809
(Excited)

1160
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:50,550
(Look at these girls.)

1161
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,809
(She gives them respect too.)

1162
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,920
It's so solid.

1163
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,289
They're so good.

1164
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,699
Go, my seniors!

1165
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:12,699
(She goes to the same school as In Jung, Ha Neul, and Kyung Min.)

1166
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:18,869
They're good.

1167
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,579
They're tightly in sync.

1168
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,610
So Min!

1169
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,750
Let's go!

1170
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,619
Nice.

1171
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:34,860
(Amazed)

1172
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,789
(Overly immersed)

1173
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,760
Their facial expressions were overwhelming.

1174
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,900
I could tell they were very good.

1175
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,969
They're in perfect sync.

1176
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,010
Anesthetized?

1177
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,449
(Automatically standing up)

1178
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,920
Okay!

1179
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,119
(Embarrassed for nothing)

1180
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,860
(Moving onto Team LACHICA's Part B)

1181
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,230
How cute!

1182
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,289
(Let's go, Team LACHICA.)

1183
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,300
They're cute.

1184
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,099
("Left and Right" by SEVENTEEN, choreo by Team LACHICA)

1185
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:27,639
(They're good.)

1186
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,050
Oh, my. They're so cute.

1187
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,289
Let's go!

1188
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:45,659
(Look at her cute move.)

1189
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,639
Okay. Let's go, So Yoon!

1190
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,269
Look how powerful they are.

1191
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,719
(Getting ready to throw punches)

1192
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,820
(Hook)

1193
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,150
(What a facial expression.)

1194
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,389
(It's a highlight.)

1195
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,920
This is our style.

1196
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,829
Yoo Kyung is so cute.

1197
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,840
Let's go!

1198
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,869
- Let's go!
- Joint part, let's go!

1199
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,440
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group joint part, directed by TEAM 1MILLION)

1200
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,210
Gosh, nice.

1201
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,239
Let's go!

1202
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,980
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1203
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,980
(Automatically synchronizing)

1204
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,090
- This is crazy!
- How satisfying.

1205
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,920
It's so satisfying to see them dance.

1206
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,059
Gosh, you're scaring me!

1207
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,159
(Amazed)

1208
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,659
She's strong.

1209
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,260
I'm shocked.

1210
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,699
She's too good.

1211
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,269
That's nice.

1212
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,510
How neat.

1213
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,050
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1214
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,719
A perfect score.

1215
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,519
(Feeling loose)

1216
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,829
How cool.

1217
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:25,329
It's crazy. They're so cool.

1218
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,429
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

1219
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:27,860
It's so much better without the masks.

1220
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,130
It's really different.

1221
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,329
It's way better without the masks.

1222
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:32,230
- Really?
- How fun.

1223
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,239
Really.

1224
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,039
Both of them deserve to win.

1225
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,369
They're both amazing.

1226
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
First off,

1227
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,280
as I was watching the video,

1228
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,940
I was shocked by how insane it was.

1229
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,550
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

1230
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,820
(It was so absorbing that she couldn't take her eyes off it.)

1231
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,650
It seemed like a match...

1232
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,150
from Street Woman Fighter,

1233
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,219
in my opinion.

1234
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,960
And I liked that the two teams mingled well together,

1235
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,059
even though Team 1MILLION took the joint part.

1236
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,059
(They performed in high-quality as if they were one team.)

1237
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,199
It was much better...

1238
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,440
in terms of showing facial expressions and energy.

1239
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,440
So I can't wait to check the result.

1240
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,969
They did such a wonderful job.

1241
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:11,969
Yes.

1242
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,340
Good job.

1243
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,550
I was glad and happy...

1244
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,579
to receive her compliment.

1245
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,449
It was so touching.

1246
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:20,750
We got her recognition.

1247
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:23,389
Well...

1248
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,860
This is my personal curiosity, but I wonder why In Jung...

1249
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,230
is so mad every time she dances.

1250
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,059
Her angry face is so eye-catching.

1251
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,829
It's energetic.

1252
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,099
(Her friend agrees.)

1253
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:43,610
And when Team LACHICA did this,

1254
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:45,710
(What is she going to say this time?)

1255
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:48,039
it was a little like us.

1256
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,510
- Right.
- Right.

1257
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,409
(She loves it.)

1258
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,420
(This is our style.)

1259
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,280
- Right.
- Right.

1260
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,989
It briefly came to my mind that they might've...

1261
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,119
- suited our team too.
- Right.

1262
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,260
And I enjoyed it.

1263
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,460
I saw a new side of Team LACHICA.

1264
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,260
Especially Waackxxxy Junior.

1265
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,130
(Waackxxxy Junior?)

1266
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,130
(Waackxxxy is surprised.)

1267
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,730
Yes, Waackxxxy Junior.

1268
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,530
- Waackxxxy Junior.
- She resembles her.

1269
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,099
- She looks exactly like her.
- They look alike.

1270
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,539
- They do look alike.
- What?

1271
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,309
They really look alike.

1272
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,480
- They look alike.
- You're right.

1273
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,980
They look so alike.

1274
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,880
She looks like Waackxxxy.

1275
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,019
(They look similar.)

1276
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,250
They look alike.

1277
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,920
Waackxxxy Junior's facial expressions...

1278
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,989
were very memorable.

1279
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,360
I can't tell who will win.

1280
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,559
All right.

1281
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,230
Team 1MILLION took the extra points for the joint part...

1282
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,000
in the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

1283
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,030
taking the lead.

1284
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,840
In the SEVENTEEN Performance Group,

1285
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,469
Team LACHICA and Team 1MILLION received...

1286
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,110
a total of 286,705 views online.

1287
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,079
How many likes and votes did they get?

1288
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,579
I will announce the final result...

1289
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,349
after adding up the extra points of the joint part...

1290
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:02,380
and points from the online public evaluation.

1291
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,590
I'm scared.

1292
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,449
I can't watch this.

1293
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,559
- Please.
- I can't watch this.

1294
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,659
Honestly, Team 1MILLION had good teamwork,

1295
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,659
and the choreography was great.

1296
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:15,599
So I admit they were very good.

1297
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
However, we weren't bad either.

1298
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,300
We worked so hard to prepare this,

1299
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,199
so I'd be sad to compete in the Elimination Battle.

1300
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:26,639
I seriously couldn't tell who would win.

1301
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,909
Please.

1302
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,650
(Everyone is holding their breath as they wait.)

1303
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,409
- Please.
- I'm watching.

1304
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,349
Why aren't they announcing the result?

1305
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,519
- Hurry.
- What is it?

1306
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,590
(Everyone is shocked.)

1307
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,219
(Surprised)

1308
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,429
(What in the world happened?)

1309
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,900
Did they get first?

1310
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,070
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group, Combined Score)

1311
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,400
(SEVENTEEN Performance Group)

1312
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,139
Team 1MILLION received 10,806 votes.

1313
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:57,940
Placing first for the online public evaluation,

1314
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,340
they received 900 points.

1315
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,239
After adding up the extra points from the joint part,

1316
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,280
Team 1MILLION's total score...

1317
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:06,349
is a perfect score of 1,000 points.

1318
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,150
They placed 1st out of the 6 teams.

1319
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,889
- He said we got 1,000 points.
- We got 1,000 points.

1320
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:12,650
Even we never received 1,000 points.

1321
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,030
Team LACHICA received 10,363 likes...

1322
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,900
and 3,866 votes, placing 5th for the online public evaluation...

1323
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,230
and receiving 540 points.

1324
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,429
Our score was lower than I expected.

1325
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,639
Team 1MILLION won...

1326
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,900
in the SEVENTEEN Performance Group.

1327
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,239
They will continue onto the next stage. Congratulations.

1328
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,940
- You all did great.
- Gosh.

1329
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,139
- You did great.
- Thank you.

1330
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,510
Congratulations.

1331
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,750
I admit that you were good.

1332
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,349
- Gosh.
- That was a landslide victory.

1333
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,820
- I'm jealous.
- They must be so happy.

1334
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:44,190
I was very moved.

1335
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,349
It was a memorable moment.

1336
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:50,389
The losing team, Team LACHICA, is in danger of getting eliminated.

1337
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,360
I know how hard the members worked for this,

1338
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,530
so I am proud of them.

1339
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,670
You all did a great job. You really did.

1340
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:58,369
Team LACHICA,

1341
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,539
please get ready for the Elimination Battle.

1342
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,739
I think I'm going to cry.

1343
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,010
Next is the BTS Performance Group.

1344
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,409
(The last stage is the BTS Performance Group.)

1345
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,710
I will announce the result...

1346
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,719
of Team JAM REPUBLIC and Team HOOK.

1347
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,280
My gosh!

1348
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,349
(Shaking)

1349
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,920
(No, it can't be!)

1350
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,219
- I can't watch this.
- I'm so nervous.

1351
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:23,460
The team that received extra points for the joint part...

1352
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,030
(They competed for the joint part to receive the directing rights.)

1353
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,130
(Team JAM REPUBLIC: 172 points versus Team HOOK: 171 points)

1354
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,869
(Team HOOK lost the directing rights from a 1-point difference.)

1355
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,969
(Team JAM REPUBLIC won!)

1356
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,570
(Crushed)

1357
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,480
(Extra points for the joint part, Team JAM REPUBLIC: 100 points)

1358
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,480
(My extra points!)

1359
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,579
I'm mad.

1360
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,920
We lost 100 points because of 1 point.

1361
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:50,019
Aiki, master of Team HOOK,

1362
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,090
will they be able to turn the tables with the online public evaluation?

1363
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,559
If we aren't able to turn the tables...

1364
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,360
with the online public evaluation,

1365
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,429
we will turn the stage upside down.

1366
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:01,659
(We will turn the stage upside down.)

1367
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,800
(They are ready.)

1368
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
(The studio becomes heated.)

1369
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,940
(They're already turned upside down.)

1370
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,639
- She's so cool.
- She's cool.

1371
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,440
Why are you smiling?

1372
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:15,840
- Let's go!
- This will be fun.

1373
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,510
I'm so curious.

1374
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,849
(What kind of performance did Teams HOOK and JAM REPUBLIC prepare?)

1375
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:21,219
(The day after the battle for the joint part)

1376
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:25,019
Sadly, our joint part wasn't selected.

1377
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:29,019
But what did you think about our choreography?

1378
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,460
Win or lose, you guys were still amazing.

1379
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,500
And don't be too upset about it...

1380
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,800
because you performed so well.

1381
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1382
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:38,900
Thank you, Sienna.

1383
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,769
How do you plan...

1384
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,739
to direct Part C?

1385
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,940
(Team HOOK suddenly gets to the point!)

1386
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,650
(They are all curious.)

1387
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,349
(They just smile quietly.)

1388
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,389
- Can two members of Team HOOK...
- Yes?

1389
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,960
stand with their backs together and flip each other?

1390
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,320
- What?
- What?

1391
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,090
(What did you just say?)

1392
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,630
(Kicking up!)

1393
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,659
(Doing a headstand!)

1394
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,659
(Doing acrobatics!)

1395
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:10,469
(Team JAM REPUBLIC is the official master of techniques.)

1396
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,840
I'm sorry, I don't like techniques.

1397
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,000
(Techniques)

1398
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,300
(I don't know about techniques!)

1399
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,239
(Team HOOK is brought together through their unique groove...)

1400
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,480
(and strong hip-hop style.)

1401
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,409
(Team HOOK represents street dance.)

1402
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,579
(You want hip-hop dancers to flip each other over?)

1403
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,820
We are ruined.

1404
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,449
I was flustered at first.

1405
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,920
I decided to do as they wanted...

1406
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,119
since we didn't have the directing rights.

1407
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,519
So I went with what they said.

1408
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:42,460
(Joo Bin and Da Bin try a technique.)

1409
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,070
Flip her legs over.

1410
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,070
(Did they succeed right away?)

1411
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,670
(No, they didn't.)

1412
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,610
You just have to do that quickly.

1413
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,610
Try kicking your legs up.

1414
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,510
(Kicking)

1415
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,880
(Giving up easily)

1416
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,980
(What should we do?)

1417
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,679
This was the first technique.

1418
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,320
I was worried that we were struggling from the start.

1419
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,789
I wondered if they were trying to make us look bad.

1420
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:09,289
(Are they adding techniques to make us look bad?)

1421
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,559
We're going to change.

1422
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,760
Yes, let's try changing.

1423
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:14,300
(They change from Joo Bin to Soo Yeon to Chae Hyung.)

1424
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,400
(They keep changing the dancers.)

1425
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,559
Darn it.

1426
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,630
I think Eun Woo gave me a tough task...

1427
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,170
- because I'm the leader.
- Let's give it a try.

1428
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,369
(Of course, that's not true.)

1429
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,510
(Will Team HOOK's leader, Chae Hyung, be different?)

1430
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,570
(Powerful)

1431
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,739
Seven, eight.

1432
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:27,780
(Powerful)

1433
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,440
(Flopping to the ground)

1434
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,809
Let's break it up into parts.

1435
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:32,579
All right.

1436
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:35,280
(They keep trying flipping move.)

1437
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:36,579
(Shaky)

1438
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,119
(Shaky)

1439
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:41,719
(It's more difficult to stay balanced than they thought.)

1440
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,989
It didn't go as I hoped.

1441
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:45,260
My pride was hurt, and I was upset.

1442
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:46,929
It was a total disaster.

1443
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:48,829
The two teams at the end...

1444
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,269
will do somersaults.

1445
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:51,800
(Somersaults?)

1446
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,070
(There are more techniques?)

1447
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:56,369
This is what you have to do.

1448
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:57,909
(Jumping)

1449
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,710
(It's easy, right?)

1450
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,539
(Sure, it's easy.)

1451
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,780
(Feeling frustrated)

1452
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,349
(They try it since they were asked to.)

1453
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,349
(Falling)

1454
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:12,019
- That hurts.
- Right.

1455
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,289
"They can't do somersaults?"

1456
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,690
This is something I never imagined.

1457
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,329
(Is this the right situation...)

1458
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,829
(for us?)

1459
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,829
I thought...

1460
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:26,969
we should try our best in whatever they've prepared.

1461
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,469
I was determined to try my best.

1462
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:30,940
(Worried)

1463
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,170
However...

1464
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:33,809
Yes, I think...

1465
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:36,739
I don't want them to possibly injure themselves.

1466
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,079
- Yes.
- Because that would be sad.

1467
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,210
Then,

1468
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:44,050
I think it'd be better to change the choreography.

1469
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:47,820
They came up with this choreography...

1470
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,889
to create a good performance with us,

1471
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,429
but they were considerate of us.

1472
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,530
I was grateful.

1473
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,659
(They start practicing the joint part again.)

1474
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,199
(The two teams spent a lot of time creating new dance moves.)

1475
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,539
Push it to the side, then bring it back.

1476
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:03,239
(Chae Hyung and Da Bin of Team HOOK practice the one technique left.)

1477
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,739
(Flipping over)

1478
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,739
(They practice without a break, but it isn't easy.)

1479
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,050
We have to start shooting tomorrow.

1480
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,750
Since we didn't have much time to practice,

1481
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,289
I started feeling anxious.

1482
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,050
It scared me.

1483
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
(Anxious)

1484
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,960
(Hold on.)

1485
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:26,289
Oh, my gosh. I can't watch this.

1486
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,360
(Half worried, half excited)

1487
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,400
(The BTS Performance Group's video is finally revealed.)

1488
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,070

1489
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,340
(Who is that?)

1490
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,480
You're so pretty.

1491
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,610
Gosh, Da Bin.

1492
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,150
This will make my heart flutter for a week.

1493
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,480
- You're sexy!
- You're sexy!

1494
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,250
("Seven" by Jungkook, choreo by Team HOOK)

1495
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,989
It's Beethoven.

1496
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:54,289
It's Mozart.

1497
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,070
(Laughing in embarrassment)

1498
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,039
Why are you biting your lip?

1499
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:11,570
She bit her lip.

1500
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:22,679
(Cute)

1501
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,150
(She attacks with her expression.)

1502
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:29,090
(The master of expressions feels proud.)

1503
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,199
You look much better with the masks off.

1504
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:48,639
"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday."

1505
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,280
"Monday, Tuesday."

1506
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,650
(That's put together well.)

1507
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,130
(My gosh)

1508
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,030

(Screaming)

1510
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,769
This is insane!

1511
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:13,030
(They are shocked by themselves too.)

1512
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,340
(Shuddering)

1513
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,170
No!

1514
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,909
- Let's go.
- Here they come!

1515
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,079
(It changes to Team JAM REPUBLIC.)

1516
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,750
They're so pretty.

1517
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,219
- How far can her bottom go?
- It's a golden bottom.

1518
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,760

The girl with the two different hair colors!

Gosh, I love this.

1530
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,190
- They're so powerful.
- Seriously.

1531
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,440
(They start the joint part, Part C.)

1532
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,480

(They smile in satisfaction as well.)

1543
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,329
That was good.

That was so good.

1548
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,139
(and Team HOOK that showed outstanding teamwork and wit)

1549
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,809
I was grateful to the members of Team JAM REPUBLIC who directed it.

1550
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:13,179
I loved the joint part at the end.

1551
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,650
I was totally satisfied.

1552
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,349
- That was good.
- I loved it.

1553
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,219
- They're good.
- It was insane.

1554
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,090
- They killed it.
- I completely surrender.

1555
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,130
That was so much fun. I can't believe it.

1556
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,000
I think Team HOOK interpreted...

1557
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,869
the performance very well in their own style.

1558
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:35,269
You pulled your shirt up.

1559
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:38,340
And I thought that was very cheeky.

1560
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,380
(It was quite cheeky.)

1561
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,880
"It was cheeky." It was very cheeky.

1562
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,880
(Adding more cheeky charms)

1563
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,719
There is a huge difference...

1564
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:50,949
from when you were wearing masks and when you took them off.

1565
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:53,320
Both teams showed qualities as stars...

1566
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,719
through your facial expressions.

1567
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,289
It was very cool.

1568
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,360
I preferred Team HOOK with their masks off.

1569
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,500
I think we displayed our full charms,

1570
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,199
so I think we have a strong chance of winning.

1571
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,809
Team JAM REPUBLIC took the extra points for the joint part...

1572
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:15,010
for the 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission,

1573
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,809

01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,659
they received 450 points.

1596
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,000
Team JAM REPUBLIC won in the BTS Performance Group...

1597
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,670
and is advancing to the next stage. Congratulations.

1598
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,610
I wasn't just happy,

1599
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:23,409
seeing Team HOOK, who worked hard with us, face possible elimination.

1600
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:27,150
On the other hand, Team HOOK lost,

1601
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:30,579
sadly placing last in the online public evaluation.

1602
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,619
Being on "Street Woman Fighter,"

1603
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,960
I realized that crises often become opportunities.

1604
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,690
- That's right.
- So I think...

1605
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:39,289
you can become the star of the show.

1606
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,289
Yes, it's all right!

1607
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,829
Team HOOK, please get ready for the Elimination Battle.

1608
01:07:44,429 --> 01:07:46,500
The winners, Team JAM REPUBLIC,

1609
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,969
Team 1MILLION, and Team BEBE...

1610
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:51,110
will continue onto the next mission.

1611
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,239
On the other hand, the elimination candidates...

1612
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,280
are Team HOOK, Team LACHICA, and Team MANNEQUEEN.

1613
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,050
Our strength is in dancing,

1614
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,079
so I'm not worried.

1615
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:05,250
I don't want to be the first to be eliminated,

1616
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,659
so I was determined to do well.

1617
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,389
I am very confident.

1618
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:13,159
I will take this opportunity to show everyone what we have...

1619
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:15,429
a successful one.

1620
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,470
The teams that will go straight to the Elimination Battle...

1621
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,899
(Who is it?)

1622
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,069
are the two teams that have the lowest scores.

1623
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:28,609
It's Team LACHICA in 5th place and Team HOOK in 6th place.

1624
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,640
- Then we aren't battling?
- No, we aren't.

1625
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:34,380
I was a bit sad but thought it was a relief.

1626
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,979
Leader Chae Hyung of Team HOOK.

1627
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,319
You will be competing in the Elimination Battle.

1628
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,960
- Yes.
- Are you ready?

1629
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,260
We're totally ready.

1630
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:43,989
(Highly confident)

1631
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:48,260
I have to return to Masan if we lose,

1632
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,100
but we'll stay a bit longer while we're here in Seoul.

1633
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,399
(Masan swagger)

1634
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,670
Let's go!

1635
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,699
I will explain the rules of the Elimination Battle.

1636
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,569
The Elimination Battle will be a best-of-five.

1637
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,010
If either team wins 3 times 1st,

1638
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,810
the battle ends immediately.

1639
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,380
There will be an audience for the Elimination Battle.

1640
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,579
(That's interesting.)

1641
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,619
We can do this, Ye Jin.

1642
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:14,659
Everyone in the audience is a dancer.

1643
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:16,260
Gosh!

1644
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:17,989
It's a festival for dancers.

1645
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:20,859
We have to do well. They will be very objective.

1646
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,529
The result of the Elimination Battle...

1647
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:27,199
will 100 percent be determined through audience evaluation.

1648
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,699
Team HOOK and Team LACHICA,

1649
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,409
go to your team rooms and prepare for the Elimination Battle.

1650
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:35,180
(What kind of Elimination Battle will the two teams show us?)

1651
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:38,350
We aren't negative about the Elimination Battle.

1652
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:42,250
We will consider it a stage for us.

1653
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,220
If we were in fourth place and didn't get to compete,

1654
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,050
- I'd have felt more uncomfortable.
- Right.

1655
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,359
Honestly,

1656
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,659
I thought we might compete in the Elimination Battle,

1657
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,460
but I didn't expect us to be in last place.

1658
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:56,359
I really didn't think we'd be in last place. Seriously.

1659
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,630
Because we are in last place,

1660
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,439
- I feel more competitive.
- That's right.

1661
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:04,810
(And the other elimination candidate)

1662
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:06,869
Aren't you honestly annoyed?

1663
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:10,010
Frankly, I was mad.

1664
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:13,680
I think we have to do something different from Team HOOK to win.

1665
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,979
We're going to win no matter what. Losing is not an option for me.

1666
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,050
We aren't the worst dancers.

1667
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,619
- No, we aren't.
- Right?

1668
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,659
(The two teams are feeling highly competitive.)

1669
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,930
I really don't want to become the first team to be eliminated.

1670
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:29,960
I focused only on winning.

1671
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,970
There is nothing more to say, other than that we are going to win.

1672
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,000
We will end it in the 1st 3 rounds.

1673
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,970
Even when we spread out, go for a person in the audience.

1674
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,810
I think we can win three rounds in a row.

1675
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,880
Please!

1676
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:44,079
We're going to give it our full energy.

1677
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,210
- We are as good as they are.
- We won't lose.

1678
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,319
(The first Elimination Battle finally begins.)

1679
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,090
(Which team will be the first to be eliminated?)

1680
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,149
(Team LACHICA versus Team HOOK)

1681
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:58,130
(The audience has entered.)

1682
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:03,699
The birth of a world-class teenage dance crew.

1683
01:11:04,029 --> 01:11:05,600
Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

1684
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:07,640
It's nice to see you. I'm the host, Kang Daniel.

1685
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,000
(An explosion of screams)

1686
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,779
The 1st team to be eliminated from Street Dance Girls Fighter 2...

1687
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,680
will be determined on this stage today.

1688
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,710
(Nervous)

1689
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,020
(Anxious)

1690
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,680
The battling dancers must be really nervous.

1691
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:24,390
I know, since there are so many people watching.

1692
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:26,189
Why is it so grand?

1693
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:28,159
It's nice to meet all of you dancers...

1694
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,159
who are here as the audience of the Elimination Battle...

1695
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,989
and will be the judge to determine the winner.

1696
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,430
- They're the judges.
- Yes, I know. That's crazy.

1697
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:37,500
Everyone in the 1st row was in Street Dance Girls Fighter 1.

1698
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:41,770
I see Brand New Child and Simmon.

1699
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,239
They are the special judges.

1700
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,270
Today's winner...

1701
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,479
will be determined 100 percent by the audience's vote.

1702
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,079
- It's 100 percent?
- That's new.

1703
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,149
I think they will be sharp.

1704
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,579
- They will be very objective.
- Right.

1705
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,449
Today's Elimination Battle...

1706
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,149
is best-of-five.

1707
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:02,920
You will vote right after both teams have performed in each round.

1708
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:06,529
You can only vote for the one team you think did better.

1709
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:09,899
Either 1 of the 2 teams will be eliminated.

1710
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,369
Why am I nervous?

1711
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:14,800
Team HOOK and Team LACHICA...

1712
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:16,500
will be competing in today's Elimination Battle.

1713
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,270
Please come up onstage.

1714
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,079
Let's go!

1715
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:24,579
(Cheering passionately)

1716
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,449
You got this!

1717
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:27,680
Let's go!

1718
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,619
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Show them!

1719
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,590
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1720
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,750
- Go.
- Let's go.

1721
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,119
- Okay. Let's go.
- Go.

1722
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,989
- The Elimination Battle is for us.
- All right. Show them.

1723
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:41,630
We're not going home.

1724
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,800
The only thought I have is that we will win no matter what.

1725
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,369
Let's go!

1726
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,300
Let's go!

1727
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:51,539
- Let's go.
- You got this.

1728
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:53,810
- You got this!
- "Let's win no matter what."

1729
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:56,840
It feels like we truly became a team only now.

1730
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,949
So I thought it would be a pity to be eliminated.

1731
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,479
I thought, "We will win no matter what."

1732
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:02,850
The word "loss" wasn't in my dictionary.

1733
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,989
(Elimination Battle)

1734
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:09,189
The battle between the two teams...

1735
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:11,760
that were on Street Woman Fighter 1 will begin.

1736
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:15,260
This might be the last battle for one of them.

1737
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,329
Chae Hyung, the leader of Team HOOK.

1738
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,600
Are you confident...

1739
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,699
to win against Team LACHICA and survive?

1740
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:23,899
(Of course.)

1741
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,109
Of course.

1742
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:26,369
(That's her fighting spirit!)

1743
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,510
- Period.
- That's a neat answer.

1744
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:30,880
Okay. So Yoon, the leader of Team LACHICA.

1745
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,579
Are you confident to eliminate Team HOOK?

1746
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:34,579
Yes.

1747
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:37,619
(She tries to stay calm.)

1748
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:40,619
She scoffed?

1749
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:42,159
I'm shaking. I can't watch.

1750
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,260
No. You're going to watch it.

1751
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,890
You must survive the Elimination Battle...

1752
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:48,159
to make it to the next round.

1753
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,029
Team HOOK...

1754
01:13:50,029 --> 01:13:51,630
or Team LACHICA will be eliminated.

1755
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,569
Which team will survive, and which team will be eliminated?

1756
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:57,199
Let's get the Elimination Battle started right now.

1757
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,010
Gosh. It's scary to watch it in person.

1758
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,239
This is crazy!

1759
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,380
I have a tingling sensation on my scalp.

1760
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,979
I hope they do well.

1761
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,710
One versus one Performance Match Up Mission.

1762
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,119
The first round of the Elimination Battle...

1763
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:09,279
is a group battle.

1764
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,819
- Yes!
- For the group battle,

1765
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:14,319
- Let's go!
- all dancers on each team...

1766
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,319
will have a group routine battle with the opposing team.

1767
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:20,689
Let's decide who is going to go 1st in Round 1.

1768
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,560
Team LACHICA will go first.

1769
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,600
And Team HOOK will go later.

1770
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,930
(Team LACHICA will go first and Team HOOK will go later.)

1771
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,899
You should dominate the first round.

1772
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:30,239
Right. You should have a head start.

1773
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,239
We should win here.

1774
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:32,970
- They can do it.
- Yes. They'll do the routine well.

1775
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,779
- They must've practiced a lot.
- Right.

1776
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:37,079
We've never done this kind of thing, right?

1777
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,380
So the girls will show them.

1778
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,380
- For us?
- Yes.

1779
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,819
(Team HOOK is intimidating.)

1780
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:43,920
- HOOK!
- HOOK!

1781
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,449
- I know.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1782
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,720
(Shouting)

1783
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,520
(Team LACHICA can't lose.)

1784
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:52,529
It's a death match where one of them is eliminated no matter what.

1785
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:55,699
Team HOOK versus Team LACHICA. Team LACHICA versus Team HOOK.

1786
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,199
Let's begin the first round, the group battle.

1787
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,229
Are you guys ready?

1788
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,470
We're ready to fight.

1789
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:05,270
We should show our colors...

1790
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,770
and win no matter what.

1791
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:09,010
We'll finish it in three rounds...

1792
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,449
so that we can prepare for the next mission quickly.

1793
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:13,149
We're not leaving the show.

1794
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:15,579
Fight!

1795
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:22,619
Okay!

1796
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:27,529
Let's go!

1797
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,529
(That's so cool.)

1798
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:37,869
I thought, "They're quite good."

1799
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,479
Okay!

1800
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,220
I thought, "It won't be easy."

1801
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,479
They gritted their teeth.

1802
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:57,689
They were fully prepared.

1803
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:03,060
You're amazing. This is what I'm talking about!

1804
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,619
Five, four, three,

1805
01:16:26,619 --> 01:16:28,489
- two, one.
- Let's go!

1806
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,060
Switch.

1807
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,890
We will do as we always did and win this round.

1808
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,899
- Let's go!
- "We killed it. We won."

1809
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:37,159
- Team HOOK.
- We...

1810
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,229
- will not lose or go back home.
- Let's go.

1811
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,970
We'll show you how spicy street dance is.

1812
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:49,840
Oh, my gosh!

1813
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,750
Hey!

1814
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:53,979
It doesn't intimidate me.

1815
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,920
Go!

1816
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,449
It's so hip-hop

1817
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,029
(Her cap fell off.)

1818
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:11,260
"What do I do?"

1819
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,170
(Ga Hyun's cap fell off during the group routine.)

1820
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,869
"Pick it up for now."

1821
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,140
(Their energy is great!)

1822
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:20,939
(She threw it!)

1823
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,810
She handled it so well!

1824
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:29,279
"They're tough competitors."

1825
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,930
(Screaming)

1826
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,239
Five, four, three,

1827
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,340
- two, one. Battle over.
- "We did it. We dominated it."

1828
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,180
(Elimination Battle Round 1, the group battle, is over.)

1829
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,779
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1830
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:02,380
They're good.

1831
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,250
Hey, you guys are amazing!

1832
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:07,489
That's smart. Going outward. That's fire.

1833
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:10,260
They really ground their teeth.

1834
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,890
- Did we do well?
- Yes, we did.

1835
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:15,960
I think we killed the battle.

1836
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,170
- It's okay. We did well.
- We did well.

1837
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,770
We showed everything we prepared.

1838
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,069
So I'm confident we'll win.

1839
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,640
It's time for the audience to make a decision.

1840
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,039
If you think Team HOOK did better, press one.

1841
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:31,979
If you think Team LACHICA did better, press two.

1842
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:33,779
- Press 2!
- I'll give you 60 seconds.

1843
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:35,380
The voting has begun.

1844
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,180
(The audience starts voting for Round 1, the group battle!)

1845
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,020
The voting for Round One, the group battle, is over.

1846
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,420
(Which team will win?)

1847
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,260
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

1848
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:48,399
Bada, the master of Team BEBE.

1849
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,069
What do you think of the battle between Team HOOK and Team LACHICA?

1850
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:57,270
I think Team LACHICA chose the perfect song.

1851
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,739
And they killed it.

1852
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,069
It was witty and cool.

1853
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:04,710
When Team HOOK stared at them...

1854
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,550
(Team HOOK overwhelmed them with fierce eyes and attitude.)

1855
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:11,079
They ended it with their coolness.

1856
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,350
I really enjoyed it. Thank you.

1857
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,750
It was cool.

1858
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,020
Thank you.

1859
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,989
When Team LACHICA came out in the beginning,

1860
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:19,430
I thought they killed it...

1861
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,260
and that they would win.

1862
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,659
Then Team HOOK came out.

1863
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:27,130
"What? They killed it too." That's what I felt.

1864
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:31,369
I thought it'd be hard to choose the winner this time...

1865
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:32,869
while watching it.

1866
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,470
It was very tough.

1867
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,039
I don't know what will happen.

1868
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:37,479
- I don't know.
- Let's go!

1869
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:38,479
I really don't know.

1870
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,979
Which team will win the first round?

1871
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:44,279
Let's check the result.

1872
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:46,050
- Please.
- Let's go.

1873
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,989
I think we won.

1874
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:49,489
We'll win. Our girls did better.

1875
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:53,560
I never thought that we would lose.

1876
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,000
- Nice. We did it.
- We did it.

1877
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:58,930
Please.

1878
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,130
Energy is everything in a battle.

1879
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:03,039
And we dominated it.

1880
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:04,039
Which team do you think will win?

1881
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:06,369
- It's 100 percent Team HOOK.
- For sure.

1882
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,909
- Team HOOK?
- Me too.

1883
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,979
I feel like I felt more of Team HOOK.

1884
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,380
But Team LACHICA had probably more...

1885
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,380
- Like...
- cleanliness.

1886
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:16,550
- Team LACHICA's dance was better.
- Yes.

1887
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:18,750
- But Team HOOK dominated the stage.
- Right.

1888
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,649
I thought Team LACHICA did really well.

1889
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,989
I love Team LACHICA.

1890
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:24,159
I think Team LACHICA showed what they had better.

1891
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,289
Right.

1892
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:26,689
(Which team will win Round 1, the group battle?)

1893
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:29,699
I thought they were tougher opponents than I had thought.

1894
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:32,899
But I think we executed it better.

1895
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:34,500
So I think we will win for sure.

1896
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,640
I think our team showed more things to watch for.

1897
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,170
I was sure that we would win.

1898
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,680
(Which team will win Round 1, the group battle?)

1899
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,880
(Team HOOK wins Round 1, the group battle.)

1900
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,479
It's 178 to 57.

1901
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:54,489
Team HOOK won Round 1, the group battle.

1902
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,229
We won Round One. Let's keep it going.

1903
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,630
- Girl.
- Do as you always did. No pressure.

1904
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,100
You guys did well!

1905
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,430
That's it.

1906
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,930
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

1907
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:07,500
- We can do it. We must do it.
- Let's do it.

1908
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,640
Guys,

1909
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,970
it's okay if you win from now on!

1910
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:13,170
- They'll have a mental breakdown.
- Have confidence!

1911
01:21:13,939 --> 01:21:15,609
They should keep calm.

1912
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:17,640
Team LACHICA, don't be intimidated!

1913
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:19,880
The second round of the Elimination Battle...

1914
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,279
is a 1-on-1 Ace Battle.

1915
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,520
The Ace Battle is a 1-on-1 battle...

1916
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,619
between the ace dancers on each team.

1917
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,930
They must be under so much pressure for the Ace Battle.

1918
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,130
Who will come out?

1919
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,960
The 1-on-1 Ace Battle.

1920
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,029
I want Ga Hyun to go.

1921
01:21:38,029 --> 01:21:39,569
The other team doesn't have...

1922
01:21:39,569 --> 01:21:41,670
- a popping dancer.
- No.

1923
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,239
- It's time to show...
- Through a battle.

1924
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:44,770
- the charm of popping.
- Right.

1925
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,170
- Show them, Ga Hyun.
- Show them.

1926
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,010
- For the 1-on-1 Ace Battle, - You can do it.

1927
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,340
- Ga Hyun should go.
- Ga Hyun should go.

1928
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,250
I'm fearless.

1929
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,649
I can really take the first place.

1930
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:54,949
I can win.

1931
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,420
Okay.

1932
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:59,289
You do it then, Ho Yeon.

1933
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,590
The ace dancer of Team HOOK...

1934
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:04,159
is Ga Hyun.

1935
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,890
(Lee Ga Hyun, the popping dancer, is the ace battler of Team HOOK.)

1936
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,460
- Let's go!
- Popping.

1937
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,899
- Popping.
- I knew it.

1938
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:11,529
The ace of Team LACHICA...

1939
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:12,869
is Ho Yeon.

1940
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,739
(Put your hands up!)

1941
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:17,069
Oh, my gosh.

1942
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,270
There you go. You should get the audience on your side.

1943
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:22,579
The girls have changed.

1944
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:24,979
- I'm scared.
- They went crazy.

1945
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:26,550
Ga Hyun, the ace of Team HOOK...

1946
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,819
that won the last round.

1947
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:31,920
Are you confident to win again with the winning energy?

1948
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:34,390
It's going to be all good as long as I do as I always did.

1949
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:35,590
I can do it!

1950
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:37,460
That's great.

1951
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,060
- You're cute!
- Ho Yeon,

1952
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,529
the ace of Team LACHICA that lost in the last round.

1953
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:43,659
How determined are you this time?

1954
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:47,369
I'll show you what being "calmly crazy" is.

1955
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:48,670
(I like the energy.)

1956
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:51,300
Crazy.

1957
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,710
It's not easy to go crazy calmly.

1958
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,180
Again, I will spin the water bottle...

1959
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,439
to decide who is going to go first.

1960
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,319
All right. Team HOOK will go first.

1961
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:04,920
Team LACHICA will go later.

1962
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,649
"I should grit my teeth and do it."

1963
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,989
"Let's not be intimidated."

1964
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,890
"I must not lose in this round."

1965
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,560
"I must show them."

1966
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,100
Just show them, girls.

1967
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:18,399
- You got this! You can do it.
- Leave no regrets.

1968
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:19,500
Just leave no regrets.

1969
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:22,970
Ho Yeon, just show them.

1970
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:24,670
- Just show them.
- Show them.

1971
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,239
- Show them what being crazy is.
- You can do it!

1972
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,539
- You can do it.
- You got this.

1973
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:30,739
Tell her to be aggressive.

1974
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:32,979
- Act it out.
- She told you to be aggressive.

1975
01:23:32,979 --> 01:23:34,750
- Be aggressive.
- Aggressive?

1976
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,750
- At first...
- Be aggressive.

1977
01:23:37,649 --> 01:23:39,649
"We should win no matter what."

1978
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:42,819
"Let's just do as I always did. Please."

1979
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,359
"If I lose in this round,"

1980
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,359
"we will lose our energy twice."

1981
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:48,600
"So I will win no matter what it takes."

1982
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,130
The second round...

1983
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,170
- is an important moment.
- Yes.

1984
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,699
I really hope she does well.

1985
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:57,500
I feel like crying already.

1986
01:23:57,739 --> 01:23:58,869
Ga Hyun of Team HOOK...

1987
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,170
versus Ho Yeon of Team LACHICA.

1988
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,840
Round Two, the Ace Battle, begins. Are you guys ready?

1989
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,310
- Yes!
- Yes!

1990
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:06,180
Let's go!

1991
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,579
Fight!

1992
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:19,729
Her popping is intense.

1993
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:23,159
- You're doing amazing!
- Nice.

1994
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,569
(Surprised)

1995
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:26,600
(Her dance is crazy.)

1996
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,069
That's crazy.

1997
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,949
Let's go!

1998
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,020
Five, four, three, two,

1999
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,220
- Well done.
- one.

2000
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,520
Switch. Team LACHICA.

2001
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,789
- "I did it. I showed them all." - Let's go!

2002
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:56,699
The only thought I had was that I should dominate it.

2003
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,500
(Surprised, frozen)

2004
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:07,210
Oh, my gosh!

2005
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,939
(Cheering like crazy)

2006
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,550
Gosh. It was insane.

2007
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,310
Her showmanship was amazing.

2008
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:15,319
(Impressed)

2009
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:18,890
Go! Do it more!

2010
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:40,369
Five, four, three, two, one.

2011
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:42,039
Battle set.

2012
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:44,710
(Round 2 of the Elimination Battle, the Ace Battle, is over.)

2013
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:48,079
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2014
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:50,350
- You killed it.
- That was a sugary drink.

2015
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,579
It's sticky.

2016
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,149
- That improvisation was amazing.
- Your hair is...

2017
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,420
Was that not water?

2018
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,890
Oh, my gosh.

2019
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,859
I'd never seen anyone pour that drink on themselves before.

2020
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:02,159
She showered with that drink.

2021
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,699
I didn't expect her to pour it on herself.

2022
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:05,829
I could feel how determined the little girl was.

2023
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:06,869
- It's wild.
- I know.

2024
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:08,100
I keep seeing her.

2025
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,239
Gosh, how can they pick?

2026
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,500
This is crazy.

2027
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:15,310
"I did it. I ended it."

2028
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,180
Gosh.

2029
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:22,479
Actually, I saw myself in Ho Yeon.

2030
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,920
Yes. I go crazy like her...

2031
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,550
during a battle.

2032
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,560
I also think you should do everything.

2033
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,560
When you see a drink, you should pour it...

2034
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,989
and get the audience on your side. I was so impressed...

2035
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:34,859
that you poured everything into the battle.

2036
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,529
And the girl on Team HOOK who came out for the battle...

2037
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,500
showed the charms of popping...

2038
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,170
so well.

2039
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:43,970
The colors of the two teams were very different in this round,

2040
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,670
which was interesting to watch.

2041
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,569
It was the first solo battle as well.

2042
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,609
So I felt how heavy the burden was.

2043
01:26:49,779 --> 01:26:51,510
I got emotional watching it.

2044
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:54,350
So I'd like to tell both teams that they worked very hard.

2045
01:26:56,119 --> 01:26:59,189
Which team will win the Ace Battle?

2046
01:26:59,189 --> 01:27:01,050
Let's check the result.

2047
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,590
I think they will pick Ga Hyun who showed better quality.

2048
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:08,430
But they might pick Ho Yeon...

2049
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:10,729
who got the audience fired up.

2050
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:12,199
How will it turn out?

2051
01:27:13,029 --> 01:27:15,699
If Team HOOK wins, there will be only one round left.

2052
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,699
If Team HOOK wins this round,

2053
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,210
they will survive after winning the next round.

2054
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:24,039
I think Team LACHICA won for sure this time.

2055
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:26,649
- I think Team LACHICA will win.
- Yes.

2056
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,920
(Which team will win Round 2?)

2057
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:31,579
You were number one to us.

2058
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,819
Of course.

2059
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:35,020
You did well. I love you.

2060
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,819
- Me too.
- Ga Hyun did a great job.

2061
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,630
- She did so well.
- Yes, she did.

2062
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,890
(The masters of Team LACHICA are nervous as well.)

2063
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:46,800
(Which team is the winning team of Round 2, the 1-on-1 Ace Battle?)

2064
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,869
We dominated it.

2065
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,210
So I was like, "Okay. We might win."

2066
01:27:55,539 --> 01:27:58,810
It was the Ace Battle. So I wanted to win even more.

2067
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:05,279
It's 147 versus 86.

2068
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,350
Team HOOK won again.

2069
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,260
I'm so proud.

2070
01:28:10,989 --> 01:28:12,590
- Why are you crying already?
- She's crying.

2071
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,489
- Well done.
- You can't cry yet.

2072
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:15,930
(Team HOOK is happy about the win.)

2073
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,529
(Meanwhile, Ho Yeon of Team LACHICA has mixed feelings.)

2074
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:18,800
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2075
01:28:19,069 --> 01:28:20,069
It's fine.

2076
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,500
- Hey.
- It's okay.

2077
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,199
- It's time for us to win now.
- It's all right.

2078
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:27,510
- It's all right!
- It's okay. Don't worry!

2079
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,640
We can win.

2080
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:31,079
So if Team LACHICA loses this, then...

2081
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,279
They're going home.

2082
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:35,520
It's not over until it's over.

2083
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,220
They should make this an opportunity to show us...

2084
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:40,619
- Yes. They will grind their teeth.
- their moves with more energy.

2085
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:43,960
As Team HOOK won the second round,

2086
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,090
they got 2 wins 1st.

2087
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:49,460
Gosh, I'm so sweaty.

2088
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,699
- Because you're so nervous.
- Yes.

2089
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:53,000
If Team HOOK wins this round again,

2090
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,729
the Elimination Battle will end immediately.

2091
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,369
And Team LACHICA that has no wins...

2092
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,539
will become the first team to be eliminated on the show...

2093
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:02,010
and must leave this place.

2094
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:04,380
- No.
- That's the worst.

2095
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,649
No!

2096
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:09,050
"We will never lose. We will win no matter what."

2097
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:13,350
The third round that might become the last battle...

2098
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,590
is the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2099
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,319
(Elimination Battle Round 3, the 2-on-2 Duet Battle)

2100
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:20,460
- Okay!
- Let's go, 2-on-2!

2101
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,630
Let's go.

2102
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:24,159
Chae Hyung, the leader of Team HOOK.

2103
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,770
- Yes.
- Who are your...

2104
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:27,399
duet battlers?

2105
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:30,199
Our duet battlers are...

2106
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:34,710
- Round 3, the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.
- Duet Battle.

2107
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,310
It's Joo Bin.

2108
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:38,180
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

2109
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,180
- It's Ye Jin and Da Bin.
- Ye Jin and Da Bin.

2110
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:47,189
We've been mainly showing hip-hop performances.

2111
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,960
But Ye Jin and Da Bin are amazing as well.

2112
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,590
They're our gems.

2113
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,329
We want to show how charming...

2114
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:57,760
Da Bin's and Ye Jin's waacking and locking,

2115
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,329
which we couldn't show much of, are and win.

2116
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:02,840
A locking dancer and a waacking dancer have met.

2117
01:30:02,899 --> 01:30:04,899
It's Da Bin and Ye Jin.

2118
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,869
(Da Bin and Ye Jin will show a different side of Team HOOK.)

2119
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,680
(They approve of the provocation.)

2120
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:17,550
(Provoking)

2121
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:23,189
So Yoon, the leader of Team LACHICA.

2122
01:30:23,289 --> 01:30:25,789
Who are your duet battlers?

2123
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:28,630
Our duet battlers...

2124
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,829
are Hyun Seo and Yoo Kyung, our locking dancers.

2125
01:30:31,829 --> 01:30:33,500
(Hyun Seo and Yoo Kyung are locking dancers too.)

2126
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:36,399
It's a locking battle.

2127
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:39,640
I'm quite confident about this performance.

2128
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,470
- I'm quite confident too.
- Hold on.

2129
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,979
- Just "quite?" - No.

2130
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,409
I'm extremely confident.

2131
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,050
Our routine is great because it's perfect for a battle.

2132
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,210
- It has so much energy.
- Yes.

2133
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,619
If we dance to the perfect music for us with the right expressions,

2134
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:52,250
I think we'll kill it.

2135
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,149
(Hyun Seo and Yoo Kyung are Team LACHICA's duet battlers.)

2136
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,920
(I will never lose!)

2137
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,960
(Laughing)

2138
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,189
(She's cute.)

2139
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:01,489
Show it off!

2140
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,560
I will win no matter what.

2141
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:07,130
I'm going to spin the water bottle to decide who will go first.

2142
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,770
(Interested)

2143
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,170
- Let's go!
- Team HOOK will go first.

2144
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:12,810
- You got this!
- Team LACHICA will go later.

2145
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,869
- We can do it!
- You got this.

2146
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:16,140
- You got this!
- You got this!

2147
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,409
Good luck!

2148
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,810
Are you guys ready?

2149
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,779
Fight!

2150
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,119
There you go!

2151
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:44,000
That's a great song choice.

2152
01:31:50,979 --> 01:31:52,039
(Thrilled)

2153
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,180
I think we will win for sure.

2154
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:21,810
(Cheering wildly)

2155
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,579
Five, four,

2156
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:26,010
three, two, one.

2157
01:32:26,109 --> 01:32:27,409
We were expecting that much.

2158
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,220
- We totally won this one.
- We overpowered them completely.

2159
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:35,590
Switch! Team LACHICA, Kim Yoo Kyung and Lee Hyun Seo!

2160
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,760
I'll show you what waacking is.

2161
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,630
I'll chew up this stage.

2162
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:42,630
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2163
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:47,699
(Team LACHICA, Yoo Kyung and Hyun Seo go first.)

2164
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,569
What was with their facial expressions?

2165
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:01,210
(Cheering)

2166
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,949
Hey!

2167
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,779
Let's go!

2168
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,689
(It's the best!)

2169
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:10,789
(That's it!)

2170
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
(I love it.)

2171
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:34,750
(This is so exciting!)

2172
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,380
(Screaming)

2173
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,819
(Suddenly choking up)

2174
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,659
Five, four,

2175
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:48,329
three, two, one.

2176
01:33:48,659 --> 01:33:49,699
Battle over.

2177
01:33:49,699 --> 01:33:50,829
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2178
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:53,069
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2179
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:56,100
- You really don't know with this.
- You really can't know who won.

2180
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,739
- You did great!
- You did a great job!

2181
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,739
- They did it.
- They did it.

2182
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:02,479
- That's perfect.
- They're so good.

2183
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:04,340
They were so good.

2184
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,680
Okay. They were so good.

2185
01:34:06,779 --> 01:34:08,310
I don't know at all who'll win.

2186
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:11,350
- They did so well. My gosh.
- Anyone could win.

2187
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,949
"We've won this."

2188
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,520
I felt sure that we'd win this.

2189
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,859
- Don't cry!
- Don't cry!

2190
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:19,329
- No.
- Don't cry.

2191
01:34:19,329 --> 01:34:20,430
(After the battle, Hyun Seo was overwhelmed by emotions.)

2192
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:21,760
Don't cry.

2193
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:24,500
I'm tearing up too.

2194
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:30,739
(Master Gabee feels the girls' sincerity.)

2195
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:33,140
If you think Team HOOK's Ahn Ye Jin and Song Da Bin...

2196
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,970
performed better, press one.

2197
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:37,539
If you think Team LACHICA's Kim Yoo Kyung and Lee Hyun Seo...

2198
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:39,279
performed better, press two.

2199
01:34:39,449 --> 01:34:41,409
The voting begins now.

2200
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,250
(Voting for Round 3 of the Elimination Battle begins.)

2201
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:48,649
- Coordinated locking always wins.
- That's what I'm saying.

2202
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:49,760
They had great coordination.

2203
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,859
Team HOOK was great. They split, but I wasn't...

2204
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:54,729
- But LACHICA was better together.
- Yes. Together, Team LACHICA.

2205
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:56,529
Will it end here?

2206
01:34:56,529 --> 01:34:58,630
- Or will it keep going?
- Or will they continue? Right.

2207
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:01,899
You can't cry yet!

2208
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:02,899
(Hyun Seo can't stop crying from the threat of elimination.)

2209
01:35:02,899 --> 01:35:04,539
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry!

2210
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,710
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

2211
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:12,880
I must be going crazy.

2212
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:18,079
The voting is now over for Round Three...

2213
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:19,590
of the Elimination Battle, the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2214
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:21,649
First of all,

2215
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:25,119
my girls did so well...

2216
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,789
that I feel very moved.

2217
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:29,029
(But Gabee ended up crying.)

2218
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,930
But Gabee ended up crying.

2219
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:33,069
- I think I ruined the mood.
- Why are you crying?

2220
01:35:33,069 --> 01:35:34,930
I ruined the mood, right?

2221
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:37,270
That wasn't my intention. I just ended up tearing up a bit.

2222
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:39,369
- It's not your first time.
- I'm sorry.

2223
01:35:39,369 --> 01:35:40,569
(Gabee, don't cry.)

2224
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,609
I didn't cry because they danced poorly.

2225
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,210
It wasn't because I was sad, afraid they'd be eliminated.

2226
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:47,380
Once you're up here,

2227
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,420
all you have to do is show yourself.

2228
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,550
You just have to show who you are.

2229
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,250
And while I was watching from behind,

2230
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,090
they were doing so well.

2231
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,130
So I was proud of the girls who put themselves out there.

2232
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,829
That's why I started crying.

2233
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:03,960
That's how it was.

2234
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,300
I just want to tell them that they did really well.

2235
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:08,100
- You did really well.
- You did great!

2236
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:13,140
Who will be the winners of the 2-on-2 Duet Battle?

2237
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:16,409
Let's see the results now.

2238
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,550
I thought we would win this no matter what.

2239
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:25,319
All I could think about was winning.

2240
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:28,250
Please.

2241
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:30,619
We're on a different level.

2242
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:34,189
We have no intention of losing and going back home.

2243
01:36:35,859 --> 01:36:37,060
(What is the result of the 2-on-2 Duet Battle?)

2244
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:42,869
(What is the result of the 2-on-2 Duet Battle?)

2245
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:48,569
With a score of 39 to 196,

2246
01:36:48,939 --> 01:36:51,409
Team LACHICA's Kim Yoo Kyung and Lee Hyun Seo...

2247
01:36:51,909 --> 01:36:54,909
have won the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2248
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:58,279
(Team LACHICA wins Round 3, the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.)

2249
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,590
Nice! We won, and that's what matters.

2250
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:02,590
That's amazing.

2251
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:04,420
(That's amazing! Congratulations.)

2252
01:37:05,289 --> 01:37:08,090
You guys won!

2253
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,229
- You did well!
- You did well!

2254
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,600
You did a great job.

2255
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:13,600
It's not over yet. Don't cry.

2256
01:37:13,729 --> 01:37:15,569
(It's all right.)

2257
01:37:15,569 --> 01:37:17,800
You can't lose your spirit that fast.

2258
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,909
- You did well. It's okay.
- You did well. It's all right.

2259
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:24,409
Chae Hyung, you did well. Don't let this break your spirit.

2260
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,979
I just want you to listen to the music better.

2261
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:32,380
The fourth round of the Elimination Battle...

2262
01:37:32,819 --> 01:37:35,090
is the 1-on-1 Leader Battle.

2263
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,189
(The time has come.)

2264
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:39,329
- Okay!
- Let's go, leader!

2265
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:42,029
- This must be so much pressure.
- This is the most pressure.

2266
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:43,229
It's so much pressure to have the "leader" title.

2267
01:37:43,229 --> 01:37:44,829
Right. Leaders are under pressure.

2268
01:37:44,829 --> 01:37:46,029
(The leaders bear the burden of their teams' fates.)

2269
01:37:46,369 --> 01:37:47,670
- I trust you.
- Let's go!

2270
01:37:48,699 --> 01:37:50,770
If I lose here, it's over.

2271
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:53,010
I'm going to win no matter what for our team.

2272
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:58,010
I didn't want this pressure to pass on to our youngest member,

2273
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:00,050
so I knew I had to finish it.

2274
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,850
Why is my heart racing after hearing, "Leader Battle?"

2275
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:04,850
Is it because I'm a leader too?

2276
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,090
I'm so into this.

2277
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,319
This is why I didn't want to be the leader.

2278
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,960
Chae Hyung.

2279
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,159
(I would rather choose to faint.)

2280
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:15,930
Team HOOK is leading by 2 to 1. Its leader,

2281
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,029
Chae Hyung, do you have the confidence...

2282
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:20,029
to regain your spirit and survive?

2283
01:38:20,869 --> 01:38:24,000
"Brush and gargle?" I'll show you how to brush in rage.

2284
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,010
(Bursting into laughter)

2285
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,239
- What is she saying?
- What?

2286
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,710
Team LACHICA, brush and gargle!

2287
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:32,010
(Hook)

2288
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,880
In that case, the leader of Team LACHICA, So Yoon.

2289
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:38,449
You must win this round to have a chance at a comeback.

2290
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,720
Are you confident you can win?

2291
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:43,189
I'll show myself.

2292
01:38:43,789 --> 01:38:46,689
- You can do it!
- That's exactly it!

2293
01:38:46,689 --> 01:38:49,329
- Let's go!
- That's all you have to do!

2294
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,899
Let's go!

2295
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2296
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,100
Team LACHICA will go first, and Team HOOK will go after.

2297
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:01,939
Team HOOK will be safe from elimination with one more win.

2298
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,380
On the other hand, Team LACHICA needs to win...

2299
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,250
all of the remaining battles to remain in the competition.

2300
01:39:06,409 --> 01:39:08,479
This battle will decide it.

2301
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:10,949
- Oh, no.
- Will Team HOOK end it or not?

2302
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,090
They're really going to grit their teeth for this one.

2303
01:39:13,689 --> 01:39:16,460
While I was warming up,

2304
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,289
I made eye contact with So Yoon across from me.

2305
01:39:19,489 --> 01:39:20,989
And I thought, "So that's what I must look like now."

2306
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:24,600
Because our team's fate rests on this battle,

2307
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:26,970
I felt even more strongly that I had to win.

2308
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,199
Oh, no.

2309
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:31,840
(The ones watching are even more nervous.)

2310
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,470
- Do well.
- Let's go!

2311
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,539
Team HOOK's leader, Seo Chae Hyung versus Team LACHICA's, Park So Yoon.

2312
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,510
We will now begin Round Four, the Leader Battle. Are you guys ready?

2313
01:39:39,609 --> 01:39:41,010
Let's go!

2314
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:42,350
- Let's go!
- Fight!

2315
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:46,520
Let's listen to the music. I have to hear it.

2316
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,319
Hey! Kill it!

2317
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:56,960
She's good.

2318
01:39:58,229 --> 01:40:01,069
She's being very aggressive. She could make a mistake.

2319
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,119
(Screaming)

2320
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,619
(Watching competitively)

2321
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,319
Yes, push them back like that.

2322
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:23,960
More! Do more!

2323
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,390
Show them even more!

2324
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,130
Do more!

2325
01:40:37,539 --> 01:40:39,409
Four, three,

2326
01:40:39,409 --> 01:40:41,939
two, one. Switch!

2327
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,079
You did great.

2328
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,210
"I won this one."

2329
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,079
"I did my best, so I don't even doubt it."

2330
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,680
- Switch!
- You did great.

2331
01:40:48,979 --> 01:40:50,579
- Let's go!
- Yes!

2332
01:40:50,579 --> 01:40:52,579
- Let's go!
- Our sister is coming for you!

2333
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,789
"I'll do everything I can."

2334
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:57,319
Team HOOK's leader, Seo Chae Hyung.

2335
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:01,189
(Already looking forward to it)

2336
01:41:03,699 --> 01:41:05,300
"Oh, this is my song."

2337
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:06,899
That's a great song.

2338
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:22,279
(Amazed)

2339
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,520
(She already killed it.)

2340
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,880
"She's really gritting her teeth for this."

2341
01:41:36,729 --> 01:41:37,760
Chae Hyung, go!

2342
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:42,100
(That's it!)

2343
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,800
(Her mouth dries up.)

2344
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,039
(Covering her mouth)

2345
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:53,479
She looks so cool!

2346
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,789
- Chae Hyung.
- That's awesome.

2347
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:09,090
I'm so sad.

2348
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,460
(Her hip-hop juniors are crying from their hip-hop senior's battle.)

2349
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,029
- Five, four, - That's great.

2350
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:18,439
three, two, one. Battle four.

2351
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:19,670
(The 4th round, the Leader Battle, is over.)

2352
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:21,039
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2353
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:22,039
Gosh.

2354
01:42:22,039 --> 01:42:23,840
That was so charismatic.

2355
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,180
(Surprised by how cool she was)

2356
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:28,449
So Yoon, great job!

2357
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:30,680
Gosh, it's so sad.

2358
01:42:31,079 --> 01:42:32,550
I know.

2359
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:33,649
Don't cry.

2360
01:42:33,649 --> 01:42:34,850
- Good job.
- You nailed it.

2361
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:37,689
You'll win this one for sure.

2362
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,920
Good job.

2363
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,859
- You did great.
- Good job.

2364
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,729
This one is unpredictable.

2365
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:44,199
- I can't tell.
- The result might...

2366
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,960
depend on preference.

2367
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:47,399
Oh, dear.

2368
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:48,500
(This master is still overly immersed.)

2369
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,869
- Are you feeling the situation?
- Goodness.

2370
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:51,239
You're empathizing with their situation, aren't you?

2371
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:53,109
Yes. Gosh.

2372
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:56,310
It's time to make a decision.

2373
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:59,949
Press one if you think Chae Hyung, Team HOOK's leader, did better.

2374
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:04,020
Press two if you think So Yoon, Team LACHICA's leader, did better.

2375
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:06,079
We'll start voting now.

2376
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:09,319
(It's even harder to make a decision this time.)

2377
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:10,319
Goodness.

2378
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:12,090
It's hard.

2379
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:16,229
Please. I really don't want to be eliminated.

2380
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:18,500
I desperately prayed to win.

2381
01:43:18,829 --> 01:43:22,000
- Girls, you were awesome!
- Girls, you were awesome!

2382
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,170
- You're so good.
- Good work!

2383
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:24,170
You're cool!

2384
01:43:24,369 --> 01:43:26,409
(The dancers support the two teams for what they went through.)

2385
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:27,739
Gosh, I'm nervous.

2386
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:29,810
I'm thirsty.

2387
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:33,050
Team HOOK versus Team LACHICA. The voting will close...

2388
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,050
in five,

2389
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,380
- four, - Four,

2390
01:43:35,649 --> 01:43:36,649
- three, - three,

2391
01:43:36,819 --> 01:43:38,579
- two, one.
- two, one.

2392
01:43:38,949 --> 01:43:40,850
The voting is over.

2393
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:45,159
Master Lia of Team 1MILLION, how did you like it?

2394
01:43:46,329 --> 01:43:50,399
I'm also the leader of 1MILLION, you know.

2395
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:54,600
So I could really sense how the leaders were feeling.

2396
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:58,439
Until the end, they bravely gave all their might...

2397
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:01,970
It was such a touching sight,

2398
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:04,909
and I'd like to commend them both.

2399
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:06,380
Good job.

2400
01:44:06,979 --> 01:44:09,250
I think both were completely different...

2401
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,550
in terms of musicality and style.

2402
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:14,250
Team LACHICA, when you came out and danced,

2403
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,720
I think it got the crowd going crazy.

2404
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,859
So it was really a nice surprise.

2405
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:22,060
And Team HOOK, when you came in, the music kind of changed.

2406
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:25,829
You became more intricate with the music. There was more musicality.

2407
01:44:25,829 --> 01:44:28,500
And you have this swaggy soul,

2408
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,869
which is so fire.

2409
01:44:29,869 --> 01:44:32,069
So I think it was a really good battle.

2410
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:34,939
I can feel the energy, and I appreciate the energy.

2411
01:44:34,939 --> 01:44:36,779
So congratulations to both for the battle.

2412
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:39,439
I'm once again grateful...

2413
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,050
that I don't have to evaluate the battles.

2414
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:44,350
One will have to part ways with us,

2415
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:46,279
while the other will have to keep their place in the show.

2416
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:49,350
I know how nerve-racking... Don't cry. It's okay.

2417
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:52,520
I know how nerve-racking that is more than anyone else.

2418
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:56,329
But without shaking, they presented such a cool battle.

2419
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:59,529
It was truly awesome. You have my respect.

2420
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:01,270
Respect!

2421
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:03,239
You did well, so why do you cry?

2422
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:04,739
- Why would you cry?
- Don't cry.

2423
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:05,739
Don't cry.

2424
01:45:05,869 --> 01:45:07,439
Right, why would you cry?

2425
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:08,840
It's like "Crayon Shin-chan."

2426
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,109
"You did well, so why would you cry?"

2427
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,880
Don't cry.

2428
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,210
(They aren't crying anymore thanks to her.)

2429
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:15,180
Don't cry!

2430
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:17,619
But you cried too.

2431
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:20,949
Who will be the winner of Leader Battle?

2432
01:45:20,949 --> 01:45:22,989
Let's check the result.

2433
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,489
Please.

2434
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:30,560
I hope she wins. So Yoon did such a good job.

2435
01:45:31,029 --> 01:45:34,329
I was never as desperate before.

2436
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:36,130
I thought we'd win for sure.

2437
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,340
I just trusted...

2438
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,439
that Chae Hyung would win no matter what.

2439
01:45:40,909 --> 01:45:42,840
We go straight to the next round if we win.

2440
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,210
I desperately hoped that our team would win.

2441
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,020
Gosh, I'm nervous.

2442
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:53,350
- I can't stand watching it.
- I hope they survive until the end.

2443
01:45:53,649 --> 01:45:56,090
Oh, no. I don't think I can watch this.

2444
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,390
I thought, "Let's win. Let's please win."

2445
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,130
"We must advance. Please."

2446
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,600
(Which team will win the 4th round?)

2447
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:09,770
(What's the result of Leader Battle?)

2448
01:46:10,869 --> 01:46:14,340
(Team HOOK: 192 votes versus Team LACHICA: 43 votes)

2449
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:19,409
With the difference of 192 to 43,

2450
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:24,220
Team HOOK takes the win of the fourth round, the Leader Battle.

2451
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:26,789
She's crying.

2452
01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:28,250
(The dancers feel sorry and relieved that they end up shedding tears.)

2453
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,920
- Come here.
- Good job!

2454
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,130
Don't cry. You did well!

2455
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,699
- It's okay. You did well.
- Team LACHICA, you're the best.

2456
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:40,600
One versus One Performance Match Up Mission.

2457
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,430
Unfortunately, as the result of the Elimination Battle,

2458
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:46,470
the first team to leave Street Dance Girls Fighter 2...

2459
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,270
is Team LACHICA.

2460
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:49,510
(Team LACHICA is eliminated first.)

2461
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,880
(Surprised)

2462
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:54,079
Is this really necessary?

2463
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,279
- How mean!
- From So Yoon,

2464
01:46:57,279 --> 01:46:59,680
- Yes.
- please say a word each.

2465
01:47:00,489 --> 01:47:01,750
First off,

2466
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,689
I'd like to give thanks...

2467
01:47:04,689 --> 01:47:07,890
to the audience...

2468
01:47:08,489 --> 01:47:11,060
and to every dancer that has supported us.

2469
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:16,029
And most of all, I'm so grateful...

2470
01:47:16,699 --> 01:47:17,770
(Getting emotional)

2471
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,470
that I could build a precious relationship called Solid.

2472
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,810
(Her tears touch them even more because they're on the same path.)

2473
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:27,609
I'm grateful.

2474
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:31,680
And the masters.

2475
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,420
I'm so...

2476
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:36,659
We love you.

2477
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,760
I'm so grateful for the amazing experience...

2478
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,529
- they've given me.
- Thank you.

2479
01:47:42,529 --> 01:47:44,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

2480
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,600
Great job.

2481
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:47,600
(Feeling proud of her)

2482
01:47:48,029 --> 01:47:50,970
(This girl has become especially emotional.)

2483
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:52,470
(The battle)

2484
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:54,109
The battle...

2485
01:47:54,439 --> 01:47:55,640
The battle...

2486
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,079
(This is the true example of a voice with air.)

2487
01:47:57,079 --> 01:47:58,140
(Flopping)

2488
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,579
(Cracking up)

2489
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:02,079
- "The battle." - "The battle."

2490
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:03,380
I can tell she's resentful.

2491
01:48:03,949 --> 01:48:05,319
She's finding it hard to breathe.

2492
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:06,590
When you cry too much...

2493
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:07,649
You know what it is, right?

2494
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:12,220
When we discussed who should go up for Ace Battle,

2495
01:48:12,689 --> 01:48:16,359
I persuaded the team to let me.

2496
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:18,300
That was how they chose me as the ace for the battle.

2497
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,000
(Cracking up)

2498
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,470
Of course, she's disappointed.

2499
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,270
After splashing water on me,

2500
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:29,510
I spotted people from Street Dance Girls Fighter 1.

2501
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:31,180
It made me too nervous.

2502
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,340
Hey!

2503
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,880
- Why did you have to be there?
- Why?

2504
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,979
(You did well enough.)

2505
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:39,949
So I looked to the right.

2506
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:41,819
Then, I spotted the JAM REPUBLIC masters.

2507
01:48:41,819 --> 01:48:43,560
(Why would Team JAM REPUBLIC be there?)

2508
01:48:44,989 --> 01:48:46,060
It's their fault!

2509
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,890
(It must've been so scary to get their attention.)

2510
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:49,090
(It's hilarious.)

2511
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:51,260
(The three masters feel sorry.)

2512
01:48:52,029 --> 01:48:54,869
I was too nervous.

2513
01:48:54,869 --> 01:48:57,140
I usually do much better.

2514
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:58,869
- You did well.
- You did well.

2515
01:48:58,869 --> 01:49:00,939
- It's time to brag.
- Good job!

2516
01:49:00,939 --> 01:49:03,479
- You did well!
- And our...

2517
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,880
(She's so overwhelmed with emotions that she tosses the mic.)

2518
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:05,880
(I can't go on.)

2519
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:08,779
(She swallowed the wrong way while laughing too hard.)

2520
01:49:08,779 --> 01:49:09,850
(Say one more thing for me.)

2521
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,949
Oh, she's grateful to everyone.

2522
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:16,050
She'd like to give thanks to everyone.

2523
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,560
Goodness.

2524
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,789
It's hard to control your emotions.

2525
01:49:18,789 --> 01:49:20,229
- I know what it is.
- She must be so frustrated.

2526
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:21,729
It gets to the best of you.

2527
01:49:21,729 --> 01:49:22,729
(The masters are heartbroken even more to feel her frustration.)

2528
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:24,529
It was cool.

2529
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:29,430
I mostly do locking dances.

2530
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:30,970
And I started this genre...

2531
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,539
after watching the first season of the show.

2532
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:33,539
(She's over there.)

2533
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,569
(Kim Da Eun of ClueC)

2534
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:39,609
Watching them dance made me fall in love with locking.

2535
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:41,449
That's how it became my major.

2536
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:45,920
(Touched)

2537
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:48,819
(Kim Da Eun of ClueC showed off her flashy locking moves.)

2538
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:51,289
It's so meaningful to me that I played a part...

2539
01:49:51,289 --> 01:49:52,789
in the Elimination Battle onstage this time.

2540
01:49:52,789 --> 01:49:54,960
A lot of skilled dancers have joined the second season,

2541
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,430
so I hope the public gets to know more about them.

2542
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:58,760
Team HOOK, you were so cool.

2543
01:49:58,899 --> 01:50:01,399
- Good work.
- Hyun Seo, you're cool.

2544
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:02,529
How awesome.

2545
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:04,340
Good work.

2546
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,069
Chae Hyung.

2547
01:50:06,069 --> 01:50:08,670
(Hyun Seo walks toward Chae Hyung.)

2548
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:10,210
Chae Hyung.

2549
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,609
- I knew you'd win.
- Don't say that.

2550
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:15,579
So I got ready for the battle.

2551
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:17,180
No, Chae Hyung.

2552
01:50:17,779 --> 01:50:18,979
Thank you.

2553
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:20,420
(Master Gabee hugs the team and appreciates their hard work.)

2554
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,420
Why would you cry? You did a good job. Don't cry.

2555
01:50:23,489 --> 01:50:25,619
Sweetheart, you did an amazing job.

2556
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:28,359
It's impossible not to regret. I mean, we lost.

2557
01:50:28,829 --> 01:50:30,760
Honestly, it won't be easy to get another chance...

2558
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,300
to dance with others around my age like this.

2559
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,329
It was a competition,

2560
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:38,439
but it certainly was a good experience and a good memory.

2561
01:50:39,569 --> 01:50:43,609
Every day, I was happy that I was a member of Team LACHICA.

2562
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:45,409
They let me...

2563
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,350
build a lot of good memories within a short time.

2564
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:50,649
I'm so grateful for that.

2565
01:50:51,579 --> 01:50:52,750
We may have been eliminated early,

2566
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:56,789
but Solid, The Queens, and LACHICA will be together forever.

2567
01:50:56,789 --> 01:50:58,220
Gosh, it's cringy.

2568
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:02,189
We're still young,

2569
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:04,329
so we have a lot of days to dance ahead of us.

2570
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,329
We'd love to meet you again in a bigger dancing scene.

2571
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,439
In 1, 2, 3.

2572
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:13,710
(Team LACHICA made unforgettable memories until the end.)

2573
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,210
- Don't cry.
- Thank you.

2574
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:20,050
- Brush, gargle, and spit it out.
- Brush, gargle, and spit it out.

2575
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:22,979
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2576
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:24,079
Bye.

2577
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:29,220
(Goodbye, Team LACHICA.)

2578
01:51:31,819 --> 01:51:35,829
(To be continued)

2579
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,430
- We won!
- Yes!

2580
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:41,670
(Team 1MILLION is back with the load off their shoulders.)

2581
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:42,829
(Make some noise!)

2582
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:43,970
Nice.

2583
01:51:44,069 --> 01:51:46,600
First off, it seems the public...

2584
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,010
liked our performance...

2585
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:51,579
that was full of our blood and sweat.

2586
01:51:51,579 --> 01:51:52,840
That makes me happy.

2587
01:51:52,939 --> 01:51:55,449
I'm certainly satisfied.

2588
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,079
- No matter what happens!
- No matter what happens!

2589
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:02,390
- Let's go, Team 1MILLION!
- Let's go, Team 1MILLION!

2590
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:04,590
Congratulations!

2591
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:05,819
(The masters are here to congratulate them.)

2592
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:06,989
(Pleased)

2593
01:52:06,989 --> 01:52:08,060
(Congratulating them with her entire body)

2594
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,529
You placed first.

2595
01:52:10,529 --> 01:52:12,399
So we've prepared gifts for you.

2596
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:13,970
(Gifts?)

2597
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,329
- Ta-da.
- Goodness.

2598
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:18,239
Let me tell you what this is. It's a tambourine.

2599
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:19,670
- A tambourine?
- A tambourine?

2600
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,670
All right, these are what you need.

2601
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:24,039
Hairbrushes!

2602
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:26,510
(Wait, these are...)

2603
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,010
I love the shape.

2604
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,750
- It's cute.
- It must comb your hair smoothly.

2605
01:52:31,819 --> 01:52:33,319
I love the pretty colors too.

2606
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,520
I know.

2607
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:36,689
I have damaged hair.

2608
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:38,489
- You recently dyed your hair too.
- Right.

2609
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,060
A normal brush is stuck in the middle.

2610
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:42,189
Exactly.

2611
01:52:42,189 --> 01:52:45,100
It combs smoothly to the end without getting stuck.

2612
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,130
(Just once is enough to give her silky hair.)

2613
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:47,199
How silky.

2614
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:49,100
Your hair's so long.

2615
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,039
Right, I have really long hair.

2616
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:52,640
How smooth.

2617
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,069
Voguing, let's go.

2618
01:52:55,939 --> 01:52:58,140
(Excited to the maximum)

2619
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,380
(Team 1MILLION's team room is full of endless laughter.)

2620
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:00,579
- Why?
- Why?

2621
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:03,949
You know this is the most dangerous moment, right?

2622
01:53:04,449 --> 01:53:06,319
If you let your guard down...

2623
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:08,619
just because you placed first,

2624
01:53:08,789 --> 01:53:11,390
another team may outrun you right away.

2625
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:14,090
You've done a great job so far,

2626
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:16,729
but let's make sure we dominate the next mission too.

2627
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,329
- Let's make it ours.
- Completely.

2628
01:53:18,329 --> 01:53:19,359
Yes.

2629
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:22,630
- No matter what happens - No matter what happens

2630
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:25,039
- No matter what happens!
- No matter what happens!

2631
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:27,140
- Let's go, Team 1MILLION!
- Let's go, Team 1MILLION!

2632
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,010
Yes!

2633
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:32,279
(It's the day of the Semi-finals.)

2634
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:35,750
(The next mission to advance to the finals,)

2635
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:38,920
(Girl Group Choreography Mission)

2636
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:41,649
(They're excited already.)

2637
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:43,289
(How interesting.)

2638
01:53:43,289 --> 01:53:45,890
After today's mission, one of the teams...

2639
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:47,560
will be eliminated right away.

2640
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:49,590
(Oh, my gosh.)

2641
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:51,960
(Perplexed)

2642
01:53:52,699 --> 01:53:55,529
(Only the top four teams can advance to the finals.)

2643
01:53:55,529 --> 01:53:58,869
(Girl Group Choreography Mission...)

2644
01:53:58,869 --> 01:54:01,539
(has a total of 2 rounds.)

2645
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:04,010
The first round is called the Ace Match.

2646
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:07,050
Hello. I wonder who will come.

2647
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:08,050
(Starting from Ga Young, the ace member of Team BEBE,)

2648
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:10,350
(the 5 teams' ace members arrive, 1 after another.)

2649
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:11,649
(The last ace member arrives too.)

2650
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:13,550
- I think it's such a fresh group.
- Right.

2651
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:15,390
It's totally unexpected to see some of you here.

2652
01:54:15,489 --> 01:54:16,890
First off,

2653
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:19,119
we have to decide on the director in charge.

2654
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:20,829
(Of course, it should be the two oldest members.)

2655
01:54:20,829 --> 01:54:23,329
I'm so reassured to have these two.

2656
01:54:23,329 --> 01:54:24,399
I like it.

2657
01:54:24,829 --> 01:54:27,029
Thank you. I'll do my best.

2658
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:31,939
(They begin practicing after dividing parts.)

2659
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:33,739
(Under the amicable mood,)

2660
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:36,340
(their first practice comes to an end.)

2661
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,409
(However)

2662
01:54:37,409 --> 01:54:38,979
(Master Lia checks their practice video.)

2663
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:41,079
(Only Na Ra and Miyabi stand out.)

2664
01:54:41,079 --> 01:54:43,050
(Ga Young is hardly in the center.)

2665
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,649
Don't let them take parts just because they're older than you.

2666
01:54:45,649 --> 01:54:48,050
I think In Jung's part is too short.

2667
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:50,760
You have to secure enough of your part meticulously.

2668
01:54:50,819 --> 01:54:52,689
This show is a competition.

2669
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:54,890
Everyone will be keeping you in check.

2670
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,529
(Shedding tears from the pressure of the Ace Match)

2671
01:54:57,529 --> 01:55:00,569
(Master Yoonji understands her situation.)

2672
01:55:00,569 --> 01:55:02,869
(It's really hard to be the youngest member.)

2673
01:55:02,869 --> 01:55:05,399
You have to survive in this survival.

2674
01:55:05,939 --> 01:55:08,710
(Ga Young, take the latter part no matter what.)

2675
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:09,970
(No matter what)

2676
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:12,640
Maybe I enjoyed playing fair too much.

2677
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:15,250
(The ace members have gathered to practice again.)

2678
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,850
I'd like to say...

2679
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:18,979
(Is it okay for us to take more parts?)

2680
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:20,390
(There will be a global change.)

2681
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,520
But by any chance,

2682
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,090
would it be okay for me...

2683
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:31,199
- Take one?
- take some of the latter parts?

2684
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,300
It has too many moves.

2685
01:55:33,329 --> 01:55:35,029
(She knows how to draw attention.)

2686
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,470
It'd be very dangerous to give her that part.

2687
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:39,569
Should we do the beginning and the end of the performance?

2688
01:55:39,739 --> 01:55:41,439
(A breathtaking war over the parts among the ace members)

2689
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:45,109
(How will the Ace Match performance turn out?)
