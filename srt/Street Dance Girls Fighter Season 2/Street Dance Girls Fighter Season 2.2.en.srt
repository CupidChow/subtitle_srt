1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,948
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,819
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2 is even more global now.)

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,989
(The first hurdle, Team Trials)

4
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,969
(The explosive performances made the masters go wild.)

5
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,698
(Even the viewers loved the fancy dances.)

6
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,669
(Thrilled)

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,538
(They all press the IN button.)

8
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,756
(And there are skilled dancers that even the masters know of?)

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,108
(The number-one threat of the teenage dancers)

10
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,280
(JustJerk Rookies)

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,889
(JustJerk Rookies did a performance with amazing teamwork)

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,490
(They're insane.)

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,559
(All IN)

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,118
(Which team did JustJerk Rookies choose?)

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,460
We chose...

16
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,299
(BEBE)

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,398
(JustJerk Rookies chose BEBE.)

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,769
I believe that they're number one among the dancers their age.

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,970
(Another skillful crew with Yoon In Jung as the leader)

20
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,968
(VENTURE)

21
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,968
(Our objective is...)

22
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,238
(the championship win.)

23
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,139
(The strongest crew with only the skilled dancers)

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,310
Let's do well.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,349
Think of it as your last dance ever.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,159
(VENTURE's performance will be revealed soon!)

27
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,840
(To be continued)

28
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,079
(Team Trials)

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,408
(The passed crews are announced one by one.)

30
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,780
- Look.
- Lemon and lime.

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,349
(They enjoy the time and the success.)

32
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,390
(Refreshing)

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,750
It's good.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,290
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,729
Goodness. They're straight hip-hop.

36
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,900
- They're total hip-hop dancers.
- Totally.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,529
Blue jeans, white shirts, and durags.

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,568
(Loose white T-shirts)

39
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,539
(Complete hip-hop vibe)

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,539
They'll show us proper hip-hop.

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,408
(The hip-hop crew that everyone is excited about)

42
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,408
- So cool!
- White shirts and black jeans.

43
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:18,409
(The hip-hop crew that everyone is excited about)

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,609
They're wearing gloves. That means they'll go hard.

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,750
(Hip-hop is about fashion.)

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
In 2, 3.

47
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,749
- We'll easily snap you! Humble!
- Snap you! Humble!

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,589
- Hi, we're Humble.
- Hi, we're Humble.

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,619
(Welcome.)

50
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,489
"Snap you!" That's cool.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,489
I hear that Soo Jung and Hee Jae...

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,129
are famous battle dancers.

53
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,000
(Humble, the battle crew, enters the waiting area.)

54
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,210
(They notice that they're both hip-hop crews.)

55
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,569
(Nodding)

56
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,969
(Entering with charisma as a battle dancer)

57
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,939
Isn't that Soo Jung?

58
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,656
- She's a hip-hop dancer, right?
- They're so good at dance-offs.

59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
They're complete battle dancers.

60
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,955
(She intimidates them with only her facial expression.)

61
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,948
(Dancing)

62
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,996
(The teenagers dance passionately before the Team Trials.)

63
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,860
(As the excited dance moves continue...)

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,189
They're not as good as I thought they'd be.

65
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,830
After I watched them,

66
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,060
I thought, "This will be easier than I thought."

67
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,930
And, "How did they even pass?"

68
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,799
Our team is comprised...

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,968
of strong battle dancers.

70
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,900
Every single one of us is a battle dancer.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,968
What were your rankings in which competitions?

72
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,110
Brag about yourselves.

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,340
First, I...

74
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,639
(Laughing)

75
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,779
- We have too many.
- We've...

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,679
had so many good results...

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,620
along the way, so...

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,119
- We've always been in the finals.
- Yes.

79
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,019
In one battle,

80
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,059
I beat her and won the battle,

81
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,990
and in the other, she beat me and won the battle.

82
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,330
I'd say we have the best results in dance battles.

83
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,999
It says that Hee Jae has the best achievements.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,770
Please brag about yourself.

85
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,310
Recently,

86
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,339
in a competition called Korea Street Dance...

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,909
(That's a well-known competition.)

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,809
I won first place.

89
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,050
Goodness.

90
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,749
And in Burn the Street,

91
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,120
- I know that.
- we won first place.

92
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,419
- They only win first place.
- They took all the championships.

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,519
We have a lot more, but...

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
(We'll be humble.)

95
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,689
(Countless awards this year)

96
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,559
- You can't count them.
- Of course not.

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,799
I can't wait to see it.

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,469
Your scalps must hurt by now,

99
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,869
so let's watch the performance right away.

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,539
- All right!
- Let's go, Humble!

101
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,709
(Looking forward to it)

102
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,169
The performance by the best battle dancers.

103
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,310
I believe they'll be good.

104
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,939
- Let's see.
- Gosh.

105
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,679
- Easy snaps!
- Easy snaps!

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,819
- All right. Their energy.
- Here we go.

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,620
Energy!

108
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,519
(How good will their performance be?)

109
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,699
("Temple" by Baauer, choreo by Humble)

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,670
No way!

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,710
(The masters cheer for them as soon as they begin.)

112
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,050
Okay!

113
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,550
(Perfect teamwork and in sync)

114
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,149
- They're so good.
- Amazing.

115
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,329
(Absorbed)

116
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,170
(They're drawn in.)

117
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,849
They're so good.

118
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,779
They all look like babies, but they're...

119
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,550
Let's go!

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,060
(BEBE is the last one to press the IN button.)

121
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,669
(Humble gets 4 IN buttons.)

122
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,670
(Repeatedly pressing the button as she's moved)

123
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,999
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,898
- I couldn't help but press it.
- We couldn't help it.

125
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,299
- They're so good.
- They're characteristic.

126
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes, they are.

127
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,369
They make it look so neat for hip-hop dancers.

128
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,909
- Will you join MANNEQUEEN of love?
- They did well.

129
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,679
When Hee Jae stood up at the end...

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,326
and looked around, she thought, "Did we pass?"

131
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,350
(You caught me.)

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,818
(As they did the ending pose, )

133
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,939
(she quickly looked around.)

134
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,018
- I could hear your eyeballs.
- Yes. It was adorable.

135
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,729
That was incredible.

136
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,800
You guys were battle dancers, so I figured...

137
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,959
you'd be raw.

138
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,600
I was worried that you might have poor teamwork,

139
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,369
but you were so in sync. And...

140
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,639
you pulled it off perfectly when you all gathered and stepped back.

141
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,638
You reminded me of HOOK as soon as I saw you.

142
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,639
(Did we?)

143
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,878
(She looks like she has something to say.)

144
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,379
So, I believe that we can take good care of you.

145
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,819
But I have a favor to ask you.

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,349
(A favor?)

147
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,219
Can we see...

148
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,059
your freestyle dance?

149
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,089
(Exclaiming)

150
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,990
- I wanted to see it too.
- Same.

151
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,398
We love it.

152
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,929
We've been waiting for you to ask us.

153
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,930
- They must have been waiting.
- We have.

154
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,970
- That's cool.
- I can't wait.

155
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,269
We have to watch it.

156
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,239
- They must have wanted to do it.
- Exactly.

157
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,310
- Let's go, girls.
- Yes.

158
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,309
Let's do it!

159
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,009
- Let's go, Humble!
- Go!

160
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,920
Look at them warming up.

161
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,625
- They're warming up.
- This ought to be good.

162
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,649
(LACHICA is already up when it hasn't even begun.)

163
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,259
(Let's check out Humble's freestyle dance.)

164
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,089
(Let's go, Hee Jae.)

165
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,210
(Hee Jae, the one with most awards, goes first.)

166
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,199
(Staring)

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,240
She's amazingly good.

168
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,910
(She naturally switches with Bang Ji Min.)

169
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,079
(She's too good!)

170
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,819
(She also wants to dance.)

171
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,389
(Humble dominates the stage.)

172
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,389
(That's what I'm talking about.)

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,019
(The leader of Humble, Soo Jung, goes next.)

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,100
(Cheering repeatedly)

175
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,399
(And fancy footwork)

176
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
(Standing up)

177
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,610
(They all dance together in the end.)

178
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,120
(Also dancing to "It's Tricky")

179
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,689
(Great job.)

180
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,820
- So good!
- You guys killed it.

181
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,535
(The battle dancers seem more relaxed after the performance.)

182
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,689
(Encore!)

183
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,599
- Thank you for that.
- Impressive!

184
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,428
Impressive!

185
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,869
Nice.

186
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,539
(They applaud their passionate performance.)

187
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,240
Gosh. That was crazy.

188
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,610
We would have been sad if we hadn't asked.

189
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,009
How are they so cool? Why is my heart fluttering?

190
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,210
Right?

191
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,418
It was amazing to see you all dance together.

192
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,619
Thank you for the performance.

193
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,849
I actually wanted to come down there and dance with you.

194
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,059
(Seriously?)

195
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,720
- I badly wanted to dance together.
- Do you want it?

196
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,490
- Yes!
- Yes!

197
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,700
Will you join our team, then?

198
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,960
You're offering a deal?

199
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,069
If you promise to choose our team, I'll come down there right now.

200
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,600
(Yoonji makes a tempting offer.)

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,038
Hi, I'm Bada of BEBE. Hello, everyone.

202
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,169
(Hi.)

203
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,639
I really wanted to tell you this.

204
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,148
When I was on "Street Woman Fighter 2,"

205
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,110
I made a lot of people's hearts flutter, right?

206
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,018
- What?
- She said that herself?

207
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,125
(How could she say that herself?)

208
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,319
(Her teammates are surprised.)

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
And my heart fluttered for the first time just now.

210
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,689
And my heart fluttered for the first time just now.

211
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,989
(Bada said that her heart fluttered.)

212
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,789
When I watched you dance. I'm not even joking.

213
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,729
I realized...

214
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,099
what a thrilling feeling was.

215
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,999
BEBE has confidence...

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,268
in dance structures.

217
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,039
So, I believe we can give good feedback in terms of that.

218
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,008
Please know that BEBE...

219
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,610
seriously wants you.

220
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,809
Thank you for listening. You guys were great.

221
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,048
BEBE wants us.

222
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,579
(Humble will decide on a team.)

223
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,720
(They have a serious discussion.)

224
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,019
(Don't try to take them away!)

225
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,690
(Humble is ours.)

226
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,190
(Dumbfounded)

227
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,990
(Their long discussion ends.)

228
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,306
(Which crew will Humble choose?)

229
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,059
- Okay.
- Okay.

230
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,100
The team we chose is...

231
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,638
(Among BEBE, HOOK, LACHICA, MANNEQUEEN, )

232
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,340
(which team will Humble choose?)

233
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,408
It's MANNEQUEEN.

234
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:38,808
Why?

235
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,479
Why?

236
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,878
I love you. Oh, no!

237
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,879
(Squealing)

238
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,849
(We love you too.)

239
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,949
Thank you!

240
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,888
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

241
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,048
(Disappointed)

242
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,969
- Gosh. No way! This is insane.
- Good for them.

243
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,989
I'll show you that you've made a wise decision.

244
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,229
Thank you.

245
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,429
(All right. Here comes our present for you.)

246
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,528
(Yoonji, the best battler, is on the move.)

247
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,199
(I'm not dreaming, am I?)

248
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,339
Let's go, Yoonji!

249
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,275
(A celebratory performance by the queen of battles)

250
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,469
(Welcome to MANNEQUEEN.)

251
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,979
(A dance move by the queen of battles)

252
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,500
(Covering their mouths while cheering)

253
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,079
(Master Yoonji charges toward Humble to show her gratitude.)

254
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,220
(A powerful move)

255
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,048
(This is so fun.)

256
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,788
(Please don't get the wrong idea.)

257
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,288
(This isn't a battle. She's expressing her gratitude.)

258
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:28,690
(Full of passion)

259
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
(Come on, join me.)

260
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:31,899
(Everyone does the same move.)

261
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,999
- They're perfect together.
- They are.

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,398
(Even we agree.)

263
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,970
(This time, they do the steps.)

264
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,709
(Tricky)

265
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
Thank you.

266
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,149
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

268
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,849
(Yoonji and Humble have a passionate dance session.)

269
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,479
- We love you.
- We love you.

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
- We really love you.
- We love you too.

271
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,918
Good job!

272
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,519
You guys are so cool!

273
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,929
Aren't you over the moon right now?

274
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,860
- Well done.
- Aren't you so happy?

275
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,258
- Great job.
- How are they that good?

276
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,299
- Let's be humble for Humble.
- Humble.

277
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,528
- They came to us.
- We finally got street dancers.

278
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,899
(Full of love)

279
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,070
- They are impressive.
- I do want them.

280
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,229
- I really want them.
- I want them on our team.

281
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
(Screaming)

282
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,710
- This is crazy.
- Seriously.

283
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,479
We made the right choice.

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,589
- I think we did.
- I almost cried when I saw "In."

285
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,989
It's okay. I almost cried too.

286
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,489
- I almost cried.
- The two of us were like...

287
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,388
- What?
- Come on. Don't cry.

288
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,989
Let's give it up for our leader.

289
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,629
- Good job.
- Good job.

290
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,528
(Humble shares the joy of passing the tryout.)

291
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,729
- It's not over yet.
- Right.

292
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,298
- We're just getting started.
- It's just the beginning.

293
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,830
- But...
- No. It's okay. You can cry.

294
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,939
For this mission, we had to put on a performance.

295
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,099
But the next mission might be a battle.

296
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,169
So don't lower your guard.

297
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,080
Let's take a look.

298
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,755
Gosh, it's an individual dancer.

299
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,950
It's an individual dancer.

300
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,250
(The two dancers are getting ready for their performances.)

301
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,388
- Gosh.
- By the way,

302
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,196
- she has an impressive resume.
- It's another individual dancer.

303
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,359
(Sharply inhaling)

304
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,719
She started dancing at the age of three.

305
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,729
That's impressive.

306
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,590
She started dancing at the age of two.

307
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,259
It would be legendary if she could breakdance at two.

308
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:13,629
- At two?
- She would have been a baby.

309
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,950
It's possible. Two-year-olds have a good sense of balance.

310
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,538
She was three when she started. How did she start dancing then?

311
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,416
- She was lying down like this.
- That's amazing.

312
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,739
- Or when she walked...
- No.

313
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,209
- Babies start walking at two.
- Really?

314
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,439
They can start walking when they're two.

315
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,378
Three-year-olds can dance like this while walking.

316
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,379
(Vogue walking)

317
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,878
Maybe, she walked like this.

318
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,779
We've actually danced almost the same number of years.

319
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,089
- Really?
- Yes.

320
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,166
(Who is this prodigy dancer that surprised even Audrey?)

321
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,589
- Let's go.
- Sienna.

322
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,689
- Let's go.
- Sienna.

323
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,806
(Sienna is a brave girl who came all the way from Australia.)

324
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,330
(Koyama Miyabi)

325
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,528
- Let's go.
- Koyama Miyabi.

326
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,599
- Koyama Miyabi.
- Hi.

327
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,830
- She's so cute.
- I bet she's really good.

328
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,139
Hello.

329
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,169
Hello.

330
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,069
My name is Sienna Miroforidis.

331
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,840
And I'm from Sidney, Australia.

332
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,879
- Australia.
- Australia.

333
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,655
She wins first place whenever she competes in contests.

334
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,119
- Gosh.
- The champion of Australia.

335
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,018
The champion of Australia.

336
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,579
- Gosh. She must be really good.
- She started dancing at three.

337
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,720
(A girl plows through the fallen leaves.)

338
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,800
(The champion of Australia shows up!)

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,558
Oh, my gosh.

340
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,700
Thank you.

341
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,470
I did a lot of competitions in Australia.

342
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,940
And my crew is the defending champion right now.

343
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,579
(Sienna dominated all kinds of dance competitions.)

344
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm going to kill it for everyone and myself as well.

345
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Stay tuned.

346
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,548
I get the feeling she's going to rock.

347
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,309
- Let's go.
- Look at her facial expression.

348
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,489
Gosh. I can tell she's got this from her pose.

349
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,596
(How will the dance champion who was born in 2009 perform?)

350
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,659
(Choreo by Sienna)

351
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,559
(Who is this girl?)

352
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,799
Gosh, she's good.

353
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:55,899
Oh, my.

354
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,969
She's really good.

355
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,069
(Screaming)

356
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,070
Check out her power!

357
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,110
(Her facial expressions are spot on!)

358
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,080
A cute face, chubby waist

359
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,649
- She's killing it.
- Oh, my gosh.

360
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,288
(A standing ovation)

361
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,990
(Roaring on her feet)

362
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,459
(Who on earth are you?)

363
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
She's amazing.

364
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
Hey. Go!

365
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,200
(A powerful jump)

366
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,128
She's on fire.

367
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,269
I love her power.

368
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,970
(She's killing it.)

369
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,610
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

370
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,519
Press it.

371
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,120
(Pressing with one mind)

372
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,490
We should press it too.

373
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,889
(A familiar ending pose)

374
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,860
Wait, isn't that HOOK's signature pose?

375
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,159
Does she want HOOK?

376
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
HOOK?

377
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,569
Yes!

378
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,100
She wants HOOK.

379
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:05,439
(Checking the result with an air of mystery)

380
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,570
(Surprised)

381
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,209
(Sienna passes after getting all the votes.)

382
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,340
Let's go.

383
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,679
(Giving thumbs-ups to Sienna)

384
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,009
Love you!

385
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,879
I got goosebumps...

386
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,400
- when she did a flip.
- That's crazy.

387
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,419
(She now has to pick her team.)

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,589
(Which team will Sienna choose?)

389
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,720
JAM REPUBLIC.

390
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,319
JAM REPUBLIC.

391
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,089
(Make some noise!)

392
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,219
Let's go.

393
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,589
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

394
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,459
- Let's go.
- We got this.

395
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,559
We got this.

396
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,798
Thank you.

397
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,229
- Thank you.
- I can't wait for that.

398
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,230
Me too.

399
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,798
- Right.
- Good job, Sienna.

400
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,898
- Good job, Sienna.
- Good job.

401
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,038
- Thank you for choosing us.
- Good job, Sienna.

402
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,639
Thank you for choosing JAM REPUBLIC.

403
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,285
- I already know she'll kill it.
- I envy them.

404
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,709
She reminds me of Yoonji.

405
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,278
- Yes. The hairstyle.
- She's a mini version of you.

406
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,279
The mini version of Yoonji.

407
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,949
- She put up her hair in tight buns.
- Yes.

408
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,950
I like that.

409
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,450
Hello.

410
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,389
So cute.

411
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,889
I'm Miyabi, the Jazz Funk Monster.

412
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,690
(Welcome, Monster.)

413
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,788
I hope you like the food. No, I mean,

414
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,529
I hope you like my performance.

415
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,559
So cute. She practiced the lines.

416
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,599
So cute.

417
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,669
TSUBA KILL was on "Street Woman Fighter 2."

418
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,439
And you know the dancer, Yumeri.

419
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,538
Can you tell us how you know Yumeri?

420
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,709
Yumeri directly messaged me on social media first.

421
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,709
After she reached out to me,

422
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,318
I helped her with some projects.

423
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,719
And when I needed advice,

424
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,518
I could always talk to her about my situation.

425
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,190
That's how we got close.

426
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,189
(Tokyo in Japan)

427
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,328
We're TSUBA KILL.

428
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,429
I'm Rena.

429
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,729
I'm Yumeri.

430
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,200
What do you think the Korean viewers will think of my dance?

431
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,140
- I bet they'll be surprised.
- Yes.

432
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,909
- Everyone will be surprised.
- Everyone.

433
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,180
(Wide-eyed and jaw-dropping)

434
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,579
"Oh, my."

435
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,548
(She's good.)

436
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,150
You have some skills you can show them...

437
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,989
in a different angle unlike other Korean dancers.

438
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,659
- You don't have to worry at all.
- Okay.

439
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,689
But Korean dancers are amazing at expressing themselves.

440
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,288
You should pay attention to that. That might be helpful.

441
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,529
Like your facial expressions.

442
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,299
But you're an amazing dancer.

443
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,299
You're really good.

444
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,669
(A thumbs-up)

445
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,068
(You're the best.)

446
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,739
Everyone will be surprised, so crush them with your energy.

447
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,539
I'll give them my all...

448
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,049
and leave them in awe.

449
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,108
- "Amazing." - "Amazing."

450
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,750
Make them say that about your dance.

451
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,219
Thank you.

452
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,150
Good luck!

453
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,558
Yumeri told me that...

454
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,358
if I held myself back and didn't give my all every second I was here,

455
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,258
I would regret it later on. That's what she told me.

456
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,298
So I'll keep showing them who I am as a dancer...

457
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,740
and do my best to advance.

458
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,069
(Miyabi gets into her pose and focuses right away.)

459
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,008
(Amazed at her pose)

460
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,608
(Standing powerfully)

461
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,739
I think she's going to be great.

462
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,956
- I bet she's going to rock it.
- Even her initial pose is crazy.

463
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,549
I can tell she's got a firm body.

464
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,849
She's so cool.

465
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,449
- She's amazing.
- Let's get her.

466
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,219
- We don't need to see it. Get her.
- Okay.

467
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,289
(She's ready.)

468
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,288
- She's great. Look at her arms.
- Gosh. Her...

469
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,230
Gosh. I think I know her style. I'm getting a hunch.

470
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,259
(Even TSUBA KILL approves of her. How good is she?)

471
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,529
("DEEP" by Hyoyeon, choreo by Miyabi)

472
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Hey.

473
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,339
(She's already hooked.)

474
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,910
I love her.

475
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,609
Gosh. Oh, my.

476
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,650
(What was that just now?)

477
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,430
Let's go!

478
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,858
Hey!

479
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,859
(Amazed and mesmerized)

480
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,069
Hey. Vogue. Let's go! Yes!

481
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,710
Go for it!

482
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,249
Hey!

483
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,570
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

484
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,380
(They press the button as they're captivated by her charm.)

485
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,589
That's it!

486
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,906
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

487
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,359
- Come on!
- Gosh.

488
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,199
- Yes.
- I love you.

489
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
- You're crazy.
- Amazing!

490
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,969
- Come and join us.
- I love you.

491
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,269
- I love you.
- We love you.

492
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,269
Come to MANNEQUEEN.

493
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:34,640
That was insane.

494
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,240
That was crazy!

495
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,779
- She's good.
- She's good and calm.

496
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,679
Well, Yumeri...

497
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
(On alert)

498
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:44,879
Did you know that when Yumeri came to Korea for the first time,

499
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,019
she came to 1MILLION?

500
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,390
Yes, I know that.

501
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,920
She's going to use that card?

502
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,289
They know that Yumeri loves us.

503
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,959
We're good friends with Yumeri.

504
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,489
It would be great if you could work...

505
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,028
with us just like Yumeri did.

506
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,000
- Thank you.
- We love you.

507
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,829
Actually, to be honest,

508
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,169
I saw you a lot on Instagram.

509
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,509
I'm a huge fan of yours.

510
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,940
What?

511
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,980
The moment I saw you,

512
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,680
I knew I had to work with you no matter what.

513
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,950
Gosh, come on.

514
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,048
Look at her flirt.

515
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,980
I would kill to work with you.

516
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,220
I hope we can work like a team and crush it together.

517
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,858
You have amazing core strength...

518
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,058
and amazing movement quality for someone at such a young age.

519
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,200
You seem to be such a mature dancer already.

520
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,568
I can see why Yumeri would want to work with you. You're amazing.

521
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,369
And we respect Yumeri because she's also amazing.

522
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,269
And I also hope you choose us as well.

523
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,240
- What a sly fox.
- Yes.

524
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,809
(Come on. We all want her.)

525
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,309
The team I chose is...

526
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
(There's a suffocating silence.)

527
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,609
Which team do you think she'll choose?

528
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,960
- MANNEQUEEN.
- MANNEQUEEN?

529
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,890
Please.

530
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,189
- MANNEQUEEN or JAM REPUBLIC.
- Or JAM REPUBLIC.

531
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,199
JAM REPUBLIC?

532
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,059
(What's Miyabi's decision?)

533
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,670
JAM REPUBLIC.

534
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,069
(Gosh. Really?)

535
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,639
(Giving her a big welcome)

536
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,839
- Yes!
- Yes, welcome.

537
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,568
(Come and join us already.)

538
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,739
Thank you. I'm so happy.

539
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Gosh. Really?

540
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,348
No way.

541
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,479
They took everyone.

542
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
Congratulations.

543
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,549
I hate JAM REPUBLIC.

544
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,810
(The 2 of the best dancers from abroad chose JAM REPUBLIC.)

545
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,088
Hey, JAM REPUBLIC will have a strong team.

546
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,730
Really strong. All the dancers from abroad chose them.

547
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,259
Right. JAM REPUBLIC has a really strong team.

548
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,099
Now, it's like we have too many strong dancers.

549
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
- Now, it's like intimidating me.
- Yes.

550
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,199
Our team is really becoming Little JAM REPUBLIC.

551
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,469
- Yes. It's Australian domination.
- Australia and New Zealand.

552
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,140
World Domination Part Two.

553
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,439
(Studying the next team)

554
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,739
Wait, I think I recognize this team.

555
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,609
Didn't they dance to "Spicy?"

556
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,220
(Has LACHICA met this team before?)

557
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,379
Let's just stick to what we've been doing. Don't overdo it.

558
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,565
Just do what we've been doing.

559
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,019
In the first season,

560
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,095
I didn't have any regrets about our performance.

561
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,159
Let's go out there, have fun, and leave no regrets.

562
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,390
Let's do this.

563
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,340
(There's tension in the air. Who is this team?)

564
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,929
- The Queens.
- The Queens.

565
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,970
(Cheering)

566
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,730
(Exploding with energy)

567
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,769
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

568
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,440
I love their energy.

569
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,740
Let's go!

570
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,038
- Hello.
- Hello.

571
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,039
We are...

572
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,578
- back with determination.
- Back with determination.

573
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,910
- We're The Queens!
- We're The Queens!

574
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,979
(The crowns for the queens)

575
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,548
That's the heart the zoomers make now. Let's learn it.

576
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,289
- Okay. I memorized it.
- After this...

577
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,588
- Let's crush them all!
- Let's crush them all!

578
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,835
I was the youngest member of my crew in the first season.

579
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,989
I'm back as the leader now.

580
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,559
I'm Park So Yoon, a high school senior.

581
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,099
So cool.

582
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,568
(Park So Yoon was in the 1st season as the youngest member 2 years ago.)

583
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,345
(Park So Yoon was in the 1st season as the youngest member 2 years ago.)

584
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,339
(They passed the preliminary round with approvals from the masters.)

585
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:58,779
I'm back on the show because I want to show them our dance again.

586
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,439
I love the name of your crew.

587
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,608
The Queens. Like MANNEQUEEN.

588
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,380
I get the feeling you're here with an ulterior motive.

589
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,019
You said you held your own audition for Street Dance Girls Fighter 2.

590
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,559
Right after the first season was over,

591
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,259
we knew that there would be a second season.

592
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,258
Our dance academy had 80 dancers.

593
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,099
Only the cream of the crop joined to form this crew.

594
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,229
- Only 1 out of 9 passed.
- That's so competitive.

595
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,339
The competition was too high then.

596
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,940
That's so intense.

597
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,368
That was Street Academy Fighter.

598
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,669
- They had their own battle first.
- Street Academy Fighter.

599
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,186
- Street Academy Fighter.
- Seriously.

600
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,939
Let's check out your performance now.

601
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,108
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

602
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,409
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

603
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,079
You got this!

604
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,790
(Intense energy exudes from their poses.)

605
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,089
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

606
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,160
(Looking forward to it)

607
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,889
Gosh. Look at this.

608
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,960
- They're "the queens." - Like MANNEQUEEN.

609
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
("Savage" by Bahari, choreo by The Queens)

610
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:52,759
Show us.

611
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,160
Please.

612
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,038
(She wants to press the button already.)

613
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,609
Hey, press it.

614
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,289
(Covering her mouth)

615
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,220
I got goosebumps. I'm serious.

616
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,529
- That's amazing.
- Gosh, they're good.

617
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:27,959
(Even the teenage dancers are amazed just like the masters.)

618
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,169
(Even the teenage dancers are amazed just like the masters.)

619
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,630
("A Pale" by Rosalia)

620
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,140
We must get them to join us no matter what.

621
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,779
Their facial expressions are insane.

622
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,799
That's crazy.

623
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,780
("Bashment" by Ape Drums, choreo by The Queens)

624
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,869
Okay.

625
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,210
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

626
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,609
- Press it.
- Press it.

627
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,710
- Press it.
- Okay.

628
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,650
(Nonchalantly pressing IN)

629
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,719
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

630
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,929
- All in!
- All in!

631
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,259
They got all the votes!

632
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,730
(Cheering)

633
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:36,469
Gosh. They got all the votes. This is crazy.

634
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,599
Let's go! Gosh.

635
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,769
Oh, my!

636
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,980
(Tearing up)

637
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,608
They're crying. They're back to being kids after the performance.

638
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,210
- Don't cry.
- Why are they crying?

639
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,750
What the heck? Oh, my gosh!

640
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,650
Oh, my gosh!

641
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,118
I feel like watching that made my adrenaline spike.

642
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,989
You could do amazing things with our team.

643
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,528
So you know... If you like to join,

644
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:07,759
- we'd be very happy to have you.
- Very happy.

645
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:09,630
Good job today, guys.

646
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,969
Please join our team.

647
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,640
I mean it. I love you.

648
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,268
Please.

649
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,680
(Girls, look over here!)

650
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,379
(Is this really happening? Or are we dreaming?)

651
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,180
It takes a queen to recognize another.

652
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,548
It takes a queen to recognize another.

653
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:26,720
That's all I'm going to say.

654
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,518
Hey, Yoonji. Promote our crew a bit more. What are you doing?

655
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,289
- Wait.
- We'll keep going.

656
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,289
We will absolutely share everything with you.

657
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,828
I really hope you can join us.

658
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,829
(I love you. I mean it.)

659
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,559
(Happy and thrilled)

660
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,529
(It's time to choose their team.)

661
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,970
Let's think about what we can be the best at.

662
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,039
- I hope they pick us.
- Please.

663
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,539
Please pick us.

664
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,240
It takes a queen to recognize another.

665
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,038
I really hope they join us.

666
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,349
- Please.
- Please let it be us.

667
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,980
The team we chose is...

668
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,318
- It's us.
- Is it us?

669
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,319
- Is it?
- I think it's us.

670
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,118
They're The Queens. Come on, they should join MANNEQUEEN.

671
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,029
They made a crown at the end because they wanted us.

672
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,390
It's LACHICA!

673
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,160
It's LACHICA!

674
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,329
(The Queens choose LACHICA.)

675
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,170
(Joyfully dancing for winning them over)

676
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,710
What? How...

677
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,778
Seriously. Thank you so much!

678
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,950
Thank you! I love you!

679
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,250
I'm jealous.

680
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,980
- LACHICA.
- Gosh.

681
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,250
Gosh. Seriously.

682
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,149
(Bursting into tears)

683
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,319
We did it!

684
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,058
I had no idea everyone would want us.

685
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,788
You just wait! We, The Queens, are coming

686
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,329
- for you!
- Coming for you!

687
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,529
- Thank you for picking us.
- Thank you!

688
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,768
(Who is the next contestant that will continue the Team Trials?)

689
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:56,970
Who's next?

690
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,009
(Sato Rana)

691
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:00,639
She's from Japan.

692
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,308
Japanese dancers are known to be really good.

693
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,410
- Yes.
- Their foundation is crazy strong.

694
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,720
Wait. She took Bada's class?

695
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,420
She took Bada's class?

696
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:10,990
I think I know her.

697
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,289
She's been taking Bada's class.

698
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,258
Then she can see Bada in class.

699
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,289
Right.

700
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,959
(Shutting down any advantage Bada might have)

701
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,200
She can just do that.

702
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,258
From what I remember, her style suits our style.

703
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,769
- Really?
- Yes.

704
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,170
I'm starting to want her then.

705
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,009
(Who is the contestant that won Master Bada's attention?)

706
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,078
(A contestant walks in while getting everyone's attention.)

707
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,508
- Hello.
- Hello.

708
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,809
- Hello.
- Hello.

709
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,848
(The pink-haired girl, Rana, is from Japan.)

710
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

711
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,750
- That's Rana.
- Rana.

712
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,920
- It's Rana.
- Gosh.

713
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:43,789
I bet she's really good.

714
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,960
- Hello.
- She looks so feminine.

715
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,990
- Is she Japanese?
- Hello.

716
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,289
(Hesitant)

717
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,900
- What's your number? It's 180?
- It's 180...

718
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,429
- Is it 180?
- It's 181.

719
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,999
If your number is 181, you have to go to that side.

720
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
I see.

721
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,609
(She walks around the room and slowly heads to her seat.)

722
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,349
Right here. Is this my seat?

723
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:10,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

724
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,019
No way.

725
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,288
- I'm nervous.
- I heard 200 people came for this.

726
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:18,450
Two hundred?

727
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,490
(There are 200 people here?)

728
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,789
I forgot.

729
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,200
This is really scary.

730
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,769
(She starts to get nervous after seeing all the contestants.)

731
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,539
(Before entering the stage, )

732
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:36,785
(her nervousness gets even worse.)

733
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,039
You can do it.

734
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,509
The next dancer...

735
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,910
- may enter the stage.
- Please come in.

736
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,480
Sato Rana, let's go.

737
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,249
Sato Rana!

738
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,220
Rana!

739
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,328
- She's cute.
- I like the hair color.

740
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,890
- Nice.
- Pink for JAM REPUBLIC.

741
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,598
Welcome.

742
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,699
Welcome.

743
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,970
- Nice to meet you.
- So cute!

744
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,400
Hello, I'm from Japan,

745
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,939
and I'm the 18-year-old pink lion, Sato Rana.

746
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Thank you for the opportunity. Roar.

747
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,348
- Roar!
- Roar. She's so cute.

748
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,349
Roar.

749
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,849
Are you living in Korea now?

750
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,720
I live in Japan.

751
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,960
I come to Korea to study.

752
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,289
When you come to Korea to study dance,

753
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,259
- where do you stay and live?
- I always...

754
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,229
stay at a private dorm.

755
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,599
(Impressed)

756
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,099
Her passion is impressive.

757
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,170
She can achieve anything she wants with that kind of mindset. Amazing.

758
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,068
My dream is to become...

759
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,240
a dancer in Korea.

760
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,710
Korea also has a lot of teachers that I like,

761
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,079
so I come to Korean often.

762
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:57,848
(The private dorm she stays in whenever she's in Korea)

763
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,758
This is the dorm I stay at...

764
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,229
whenever I come to Korea.

765
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,136
(The private dorm she stays in whenever she's in Korea)

766
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,599
When I come to Korea,

767
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,730
I take a lot of classes...

768
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,900
taught by Bada.

769
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,868
(Her favorite Korean dancer is Master Bada.)

770
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,309
The first time I saw her dance...

771
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,779
with my own eyes,

772
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,180
I wanted to be able to teach classes like her,

773
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,450
and to work as a backup dancer like her.

774
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,960
That's what I started thinking,

775
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,359
and I was very inspired by her.

776
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,230
(Master Bada gave her an unwavering dream of becoming a dancer.)

777
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,098
Let's go! Don't be nervous.

778
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,699
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

779
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,539
- Good luck!
- It's all right. Just enjoy it.

780
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,579
(How will Rana's performance be?)

781
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,210
- She's got a different aura.
- I think she'll look cool.

782
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I think she'll be good.

783
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,619
I hope she does really well.

784
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:02,049
I think she'll do well.

785
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:05,619
- I'm looking forward to watching.
- Her name makes her sound good.

786
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,690
- What will she dance to?
- I'm really curious about that too.

787
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,130
(Choreo by Rana)

788
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,430
- Okay.
- Let's go.

789
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,140
(Surprised)

790
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,809
(Everyone cheers.)

791
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,279
She's good.

792
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,950
That's great.

793
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,059
(Impressed)

794
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,930
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

795
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,769
She's like Bayley.

796
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,739
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

797
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,039
- Yes?
- Yes.

798
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
Yes?

799
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,255
(Another IN button is pressed.)

800
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,680
(Very focused)

801
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,650
We have five seconds left.

802
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,910
(Press the button.)

803
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,295
Should we press the button? Do you want to press it?

804
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,650
Should we press it?

805
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,195
(The 10-second countdown is over.)

806
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,819
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

807
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,500
(What happened?)

808
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,399
(How many INs did Rana get?)

809
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
- What's happening?
- What is it?

810
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,521
(How many INs did Rana get?)

811
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,669
(She barely makes it with 4 ins with 1 second to spare.)

812
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,670
What a relief.

813
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,609
- That surprised me.
- That saved us.

814
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,010
That could've been a disaster.

815
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,110
You're really good! Truly amazing!

816
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,550
She's not just a pink-haired cat.

817
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,650
- She's not a pink-haired cat.
- She's a dragon.

818
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,218
- She's so BEBE.
- BEBE.

819
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,219
(Like this)

820
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,820
The standard's getting so high.

821
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,860
I was focused too much on watching to press the button.

822
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,000
(Time to win over the dancer)

823
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,570
Hi, hello. It's been a while.

824
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,698
In terms of control,

825
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,839
we love things that go from slow to fast.

826
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,808
That's why, in that respect,

827
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,578
I think we have a lot...

828
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,138
to teach you, Rana.

829
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,109
Personally, I'm very happy to meet you today.

830
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,119
Thank you for coming all the way to Korea for us.

831
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,519
You've been working very hard, and you're doing very well.

832
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,989
- Yes.
- Thank you.

833
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,889
(A man has appeared out of the blue?)

834
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,389
Hey.

835
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:24,989
(Giggling)

836
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,030
Rana.

837
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,058
- Rana.
- You...

838
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,570
You should become one of our comrades today.

839
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,238
(Rana is happy.)

840
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,879
- That was incredible.
- Just incredible.

841
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,709
- We said she looked great.
- Thank you.

842
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,110
(I just wanted to say something.)

843
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,880
The team I choose...

844
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,908
Please.

845
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:43,949
(Desperately pleading)

846
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,050
Sato Rana, come here.

847
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,849
(Dissatisfied)

848
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,719
Sorry, but we might take her.

849
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,488
- She might choose us.
- She might choose us.

850
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,559
(Confident)

851
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,928
I choose BEBE.

852
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,730
(Rana chooses BEBE.)

853
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,530
(This is so great!)

854
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,530
(She's happy even with a coughing fit.)

855
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,599
- Gosh.
- Lee Bada!

856
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,769
Bada, are you happy now?

857
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,339
- I love you.
- I love you.

858
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,379
I love you.

859
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,480
I knew that would happen.

860
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,679
They suit each other.

861
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,050
Good choice.

862
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,348
I'll give Rana a lot of feedback,

863
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,459
and I hope we're able to grow together. Thank you.

864
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,718
- Thank you.
- You're the best.

865
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,630
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

866
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,059
(Proudly showing off)

867
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,499
I got four ins.

868
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,530
- You got four?
- Yes.

869
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,840
(Rana made another happy memory in Korea.)

870
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,178
- VENTURE.
- VENTURE.

871
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,879
- Adventure.
- VENTURE.

872
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,448
- Hey.
- They covered their faces.

873
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,756
(Even their entrance seems symbolic.)

874
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,590
What's going on? Did they get plastic surgery?

875
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,090
(Teasing)

876
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,400
They're hiding their faces.

877
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,119
- "I'm shy." - "I'm shy."

878
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,730
In 1, 2, 3.

879
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,190
VENTURE, show off!

880
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,859
- VENTURE, show off!
- VENTURE, show off!

881
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,929
- Hello, we're VENTURE.
- Hello, we're VENTURE.

882
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,000
(Welcome.)

883
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:14,439
- I haven't seen that in a while.
- There's something in their eyes.

884
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,680
- What is that?
- What is that?

885
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,439
Contacts.

886
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,710
(Amazed)

887
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:21,139
They're wearing very unusual contact lenses.

888
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,509
Please introduce VENTURE to us and tell us about your crew.

889
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,679
I'll tell you one...

890
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,888
of VENTURE's proudest, most defining characteristics.

891
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:33,618
The majority of our crew members were on...

892
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,190
Street Dance Girls Fighter 1,

893
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,599
so we have a lot of experience as a crew.

894
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:44,099
(Sim Ha Neul was on season 1 as a Bling Girls member.)

895
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,779
(Kwon Kyung Min of High Ten battled Lip J and made an impression.)

896
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,649
As a result, I believe our performance...

897
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,909
will be more seasoned than the others.

898
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,719
- Oh.
- Gosh.

899
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,419
- She has so much confidence.
- I know.

900
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,820
The contact lenses are so unusual.

901
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
All right. Let's see your performance. Let's go.

902
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,429
- Good luck.
- Fire!

903
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,500
- I think they'll be good.
- Let's go.

904
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,500
(An unusual starting pose)

905
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,039
(Great anticipation)

906
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,610
Nice. Gosh.

907
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,578
- Okay, that's a good start.
- I see.

908
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:29,480
- It'll be Lady Gaga.
- Let's go.

909
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,480
(The other participants watch with bated breath.)

910
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:36,689
I'm really looking forward to this.

911
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,719
(What kind of performance will VENTURE show?)

912
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,059
("DIGITAL KHAN" by Lim Kim, Choreo by VENTURE)

913
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,500
(Focused and attentive)

914
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,269
They're good at performing.

915
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,269
They're good.

916
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,010
(This is clearly the face of someone watching very closely.)

917
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,619
- Yes.
- It's clean.

918
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
(Pleased)

919
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,269
They're so good.

920
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,380
(They tore it up.)

921
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,749
In Jung is really good.

922
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,760
(This is so great!)

923
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,410
(The dance makes you want to dance along.)

924
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,170
(A heart attack)

925
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,940
(The 10-second countdown begins.)

926
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,039
(The IN buttons light up, one after another.)

927
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,250
(They pass!)

928
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,749
Nice.

929
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,590
(VENTURE got 5 ins, everyone's except BEBE's.)

930
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,659
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

931
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:31,799
(They begin shouting as soon as they leave the studio.)

932
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,999
- We were the best.
- Yes!

933
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,538
- We did the greatest.
- We did the greatest.

934
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,279
- We did the greatest.
- We did the greatest.

935
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,539
(Which team did they choose?)

936
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,579
We chose...

937
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,319
Team 1MILLION.

938
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,550
(VENTURE chose Team 1MILLION.)

939
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,489
Thank you.

940
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,289
I told her to volunteer.

941
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,889
"Look."

942
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,829
"Can you stand watching others on TV?"

943
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,569
She seemed to be concerned...

944
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,499
if she could do better than her ambitious self...

945
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,469
when she was a first-grader in high school.

946
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,840
I actually feel a lot burdened...

947
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,448
because a lot of people said...

948
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:19,009
that they looked forward to seeing my future.

949
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,589
So I was quite worried...

950
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,488
I might not live up...

951
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,558
to their expectations.

952
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,289
But as we practiced,

953
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,729
I thought...

954
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,000
I wouldn't let them down.

955
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,328
I want to do much better...

956
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,300
than the last season.

957
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:45,469
(The Team Trials are getting hotter.)

958
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,538
Let's meet the teenage female students...

959
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,249
who went over the high hurdle...

960
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,808
and passed the Team Trials.

961
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,879
Let's go!

962
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,718
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

963
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,489
(The girls are going wild cheering for each of their teams.)

964
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,089
(The masters join in.)

965
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,058
- Team 1MILLION!
- Let's go!

966
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,589
(Let's do this!)

967
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,289
Let's go!

968
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,929
I love their passion.

969
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,428
A total of 27 teams...

970
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,669
have been selected through the Team Trials.

971
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,169
Congratulations.

972
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,109
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

973
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,738
(Congratulations)

974
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,178
However,

975
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,948
it's not over yet.

976
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:26,178
- Those who'll get to advance...
- Please.

977
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,149
- will be only...
- Three crews?

978
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,249
Seven members each team.

979
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,119
- What?
- What?

980
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,519
- What?
- What?

981
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,519
What?

982
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,829
(Shocked and confused)

983
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Seven?

984
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,630
But we have seven members.

985
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,299
We have seven members.

986
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,929
What, 7 and not 20?

987
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,029
We have 13 members though.

988
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,138
There are nine of us.

989
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:47,619
- They have seven.
- Within the team?

990
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,670
"What is going on?"

991
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,440
I was so flustered.

992
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,468
What does this mean?

993
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,609
And from now on...

994
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,848
(From now on)

995
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:57,849
The crews...

996
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,079
(From now on, the crews...)

997
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,219
The crews will be disbanded.

998
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,948
(A new rule for a new synergy and an individual evaluation)

999
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,859
- Why?
- For real?

1000
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,718
What in the world...

1001
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,030
Is this for real?

1002
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,559
This is totally unexpected.

1003
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,759
Tell me it's a lie.

1004
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,368
I thought it made no sense.

1005
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:18,829
I was just lost for words.

1006
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,269
Don't cry.

1007
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,546
We'll advance, so don't cry.

1008
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,239
This is so cruel.

1009
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,186
We shouldn't put our guard down indeed.

1010
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,739
- It's too cruel.
- Cruel.

1011
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,280
Yes, this is tragic.

1012
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:32,249
- No, don't do this!
- Goodness.

1013
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,579
How cruel.

1014
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,479
- So we're no longer a team.
- No...

1015
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,488
- Teams...
- How many members does M.S.G have?

1016
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,489
Seven, probably.

1017
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,219
JustJerk has seven members, right?

1018
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,119
They have five members.

1019
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,359
We're 13. How are we going to meet?

1020
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
We're 13.

1021
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,800
This is why they took crews and solo dancers together.

1022
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:48,299
- Oh, my gosh.
- This is amusing.

1023
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,529
That's why they took solo dancers.

1024
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,768
Solo dancers like the idea.

1025
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:53,269
You win.

1026
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,538
Oh, we're solo dancers.

1027
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:56,686
(You're a solo dancer? Me too.)

1028
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,510
- They're high-fiving.
- They're high-fiving.

1029
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,808
Solo dancers are loving it.

1030
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,509
(Smiling brightly)

1031
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,510
I'm really happy.

1032
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,550
You'll form new teams through an on-site mission...

1033
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,150
called the Impromptu Battle.

1034
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,988
(Final Selection Battle: Impromptu Battle)

1035
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,460
(Shaking her head)

1036
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,090
I'm doomed.

1037
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,360
This is really bad.

1038
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,828
I need to win for sure.

1039
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:23,198
It will be solely based on the masters' decisions.

1040
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,369
A theme may be different for each team.

1041
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,468
I see a lot of determined eyes. Right?

1042
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,609
I'm confident that I'll win,

1043
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,610
so it doesn't matter.

1044
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,178
I thought I could show my strength,

1045
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,409
so I was relieved.

1046
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,049
We should have as many of us as possible advance.

1047
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,880
Let's have All That Street go up.

1048
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,149
So that as many of us as possible can advance...

1049
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,150
Yes, as many as possible.

1050
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:43,589
Girls, we can do it.

1051
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,649
Our goal is to get as many to survive.

1052
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,989
Yes, let's cheer for each other.

1053
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:49,218
Let's do well individually.

1054
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,589
- We'll do well and...
- Then we'll meet again.

1055
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,059
- Let's meet again.
- Of course.

1056
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,759
I just want to say now...

1057
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,558
that although we've come here as a group,

1058
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,729
we love each other and it's what's best for all of us...

1059
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,170
as a team and as individuals. I love you guys either way.

1060
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,268
We need to stay focused...

1061
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,908
because JustJerk has seven members.

1062
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,570
All of them may go for a challenge.

1063
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,178
We need them to pick all seven of us.

1064
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,879
Let's all do the best we can...

1065
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,209
so they will think we're likely to win.

1066
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,579
- Let's all do it.
- Let's do it.

1067
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,779
Let's have all of us advance and two more from other crews.

1068
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,995
- Let's think of it that way.
- Right.

1069
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,348
Now that we've come this far,

1070
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,988
all five of us have to survive for sure.

1071
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,459
I'll lead the team...

1072
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,029
the best I can.

1073
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,405
We can just have all of us survive.

1074
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:26,659
- Yes!
- Let's do it.

1075
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,836
(Suddenly putting arms around each other's shoulders)

1076
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,206
(It's the teenage dancers' spirit to get over the hardship.)

1077
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,499
Yes, that's JAM REPUBLIC.

1078
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,340
JAM REPUBLIC, baby.

1079
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:36,738
(Other dancers join in.)

1080
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,039
(You are the best.)

1081
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,879
(The Impromptu Battle begins now.)

1082
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,809
(Final Selection Battle: Impromptu Battle)

1083
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,448
It's them.

1084
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,848
I'm going crazy.

1085
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,150
Aren't there so many of them?

1086
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,018
(Team MANNEQUEEN's selected dancers enter one after another.)

1087
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,860
Those hip-hop dancers...

1088
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,190
They're so pretty.

1089
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,559
(M.S.G full of talent and energy)

1090
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,199
(Humble, the hip-hop team of the strongest battlers)

1091
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,670
Rocking, choreography, girlish, waacking, popping...

1092
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,739
(Two Way with colorful charms)

1093
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,738
- Okay!
- Okay!

1094
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,239
(They're dancing all genres.)

1095
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:15,409
I'll press the button.

1096
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,510
- I like them.
- Me too.

1097
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,050
(Two Way chose Team MANNEQUEEN.)

1098
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,900
(4CUS, the all-genre performance team)

1099
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:25,449
(Their performance was as impressive as a mega crew.)

1100
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,820
(4CUS chose Team MANNEQUEEN.)

1101
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,689
It's so heartbreaking.

1102
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,190
We have to eliminate 25 of them.

1103
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,229
It took us so much to come here.

1104
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,630
There's no way we'll be eliminated.

1105
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,268
If we can't advance, it'll be meaningless we came here.

1106
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:40,968
There are seven in our team,

1107
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,300
so all of us might advance.

1108
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,010
This is going to be tough.

1109
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,709
Hello, girls.

1110
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,408
- Hello.
- Hello.

1111
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,339
4CUS, Humble, M.S.G, and Two Way,

1112
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,379
thank you so much...

1113
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,448
for choosing Team MANNEQUEEN.

1114
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:56,050
(Thank you so much.)

1115
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,589
Team MANNEQUEEN has the largest number of contestants.

1116
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,919
So that each of you leaves no regrets...

1117
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,529
and show all you want here,

1118
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,198
we've decided to have a cypher.

1119
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,130
(Team MANNEQUEEN'S battle: A 5-minute cypher)

1120
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,499
A total of 32 contestants...

1121
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,698
will make 4 groups of 8.

1122
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,368
Each group will be given five minutes.

1123
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:20,679
Within the given time, you can show what you want freely.

1124
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,409
This is going to be fun.

1125
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,609
- A lot of them are skilled, right?
- Yes.

1126
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,050
Those good at freestyle dancing.

1127
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,690
I can do better than others in terms of freestyle dancing.

1128
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,389
I'll have to give my everything for this.

1129
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:36,889
I wonder how I'm going to beat the 31 others.

1130
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,230
They must be so nervous.

1131
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,760
I'm scared.

1132
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,659
No, I'm not scared.

1133
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,299
Let me name the contestants...

1134
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,169
for the first group. Gil So Yeon and Kang Eun Sol of 4CUS.

1135
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,268
Kim Soo Jung and Choi Ye Ji of Humble.

1136
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,138
Shin Dan Bi and Kim Soo Min of Two Way.

1137
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:57,678
Lee Na Ra and Kim Joo Eun of M.S.G.

1138
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,049
It's doable.

1139
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,979
- Girls, rock it.
- You can do it.

1140
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,549
- You can do it.
- Let's go, So Yeon and Eun Sol.

1141
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,118
Okay. Are you ready?

1142
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,759
- Yes!
- Yes!

1143
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,689
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1144
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,289
DJ Som, are you ready?

1145
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:12,329
Let's go!

1146
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,699
Let's go!

1147
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,170
Let's go, Humble.

1148
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,768
(Who will start off the 5-minute cypher?)

1149
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,109
(Focused)

1150
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,209
Let's go.

1151
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,209
(The dancers hesitate to dance to the strong hip-hop song.)

1152
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,809
(Anyone, come up.)

1153
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,149
The prelude sounded totally like a hip-hop song.

1154
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,848
I thought I needed to go with this one.

1155
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:33,849
(Grinning)

1156
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,178
- Let's go!
- Go!

1157
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,049
- Go!
- Yes!

1158
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,290
(Kim Soo Jung of Humble starts off the 5-minute cypher.)

1159
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,889
(There she comes.)

1160
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,030
(Standing up automatically)

1161
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,059
She's so good.

1162
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,030
(Killing the beat)

1163
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,670
(Glaring)

1164
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,440
She's so cool!

1165
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,170
(One more time)

1166
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:58,868
- Let's go!
- Come out.

1167
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,615
(Ye Ji begins dancing after getting into the rhythm.)

1168
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,980
- Okay!
- Do it.

1169
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,449
Time's running out.

1170
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,979
You need to start dancing.

1171
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,718
- Girls, begin.
- You've got to come out.

1172
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,019
I thought, "Whatever. Let's just go for it."

1173
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:12,250
Let's go!

1174
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,760
(There she goes.)

1175
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,129
That's it!

1176
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,130
(Screaming)

1177
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,259
Gosh, she's so good!

1178
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
She's like Harimu.

1179
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,800
She's so like Harimu.

1180
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,538
She's really like Harimu.

1181
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:27,699
Yes!

1182
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,309
(Dashing toward BEBE's stand)

1183
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,670
(Nice)

1184
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,510
Okay?

1185
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:34,879
(Throwing the "Smoke" dance move)

1186
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,179
(She's so witty.)

1187
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,550
(Smoothly showing off the "Chili" move)

1188
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:38,809
Yes!

1189
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,980
Nice.

1190
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,250
(Cheering)

1191
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,759
(Even other contestants give respect to her charm.)

1192
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,920
(What?)

1193
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,690
She says, "Go away."

1194
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,530
(Sorry)

1195
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:55,760
(How witty.)

1196
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:56,929
"Sorry."

1197
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,030
"I'm sorry."

1198
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,130
"Sorry about that."

1199
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,109
(And another contestant stands out.)

1200
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,110
She's good.

1201
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:08,940
Nice!

1202
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,050
(Exploding with talent)

1203
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,150
Go for it!

1204
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,650
(The second cypher follows.)

1205
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:21,460
(Kim Hye Rin of M.S.G comes up without hesitation.)

1206
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,729
All right.

1207
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,889
It's your song!

1208
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:27,960
She's good.

1209
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,430
(Kim Hye Rin captures everyone's attention with each move.)

1210
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,510
(Jumping to her feet)

1211
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,509
Isn't that Yoonji?

1212
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,820
(I'm watching you.)

1213
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:48,820
That's right.

1214
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,459
I don't believe it.

1215
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,030
That's insane.

1216
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,099
Her eyes changed.

1217
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,070
Let's go.

1218
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,309
(Let's go.)

1219
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,280
(They love it.)

1220
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:15,940
(Marveling)

1221
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,550
Keep it up.

1222
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,119
(That's cool.)

1223
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,460
She's totally insane.

1224
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,829
Let's go, let's go.

1225
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,530
Who is she?

1226
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,730
I want her.

1227
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,199
(Marveling)

1228
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,010
(She fixes her coordinates.)

1229
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,940
(Pulling her shirt up)

1230
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:47,809
Where are you going?

1231
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,480
What are you doing?

1232
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,480
(She is totally at ease.)

1233
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,679
She is insane.

1234
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,980
(The music changes.)

1235
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:56,019
Let's go.

1236
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,449
Let's go.

1237
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,459
(This is my song!)

1238
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,690
It's her song again?

1239
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,189
You have three minutes left.

1240
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,150
(Other participants join in with 3 minutes left.)

1241
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,968
(Kim Hye Rin pushes through the dancers.)

1242
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:11,000
My gosh.

1243
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,170
(Focused)

1244
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,840
(That was totally insane.)

1245
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,579
Unbelievable. She was dancing for five minutes.

1246
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:22,639
You're so cool.

1247
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,250
Come to JAM REPUBLIC.

1248
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,649
This is insane. I don't know what to do.

1249
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,379
You have no regrets, right? Tell us you have no regrets.

1250
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,118
I wasn't too happy with the song,

1251
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,095
- There's nothing you can do.
- but I have no regrets.

1252
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,718
Humble was really good. I was surprised.

1253
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,388
This one is very talented.

1254
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:37,788
But this one knows how to use her techniques.

1255
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,859
Yes, she uses a lot of techniques.

1256
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,000
When I think about the performance, I'd go with her.

1257
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,530
But when I think about the image, I'd choose her.

1258
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,269
Let's go with this.

1259
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,469
- Are we done?
- Yes, we are.

1260
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,939
Thank you for waiting.

1261
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,579
I'd like to thank all 32 of you.

1262
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,308
You were amazing.

1263
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,679
You were truly amazing.

1264
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,809
All right.

1265
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,949
The first dancer MANNEQUEEN chose...

1266
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:07,319
- Please.
- I have to be named.

1267
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,690
I really have to be named.

1268
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,929
Will I be able to make it?

1269
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:14,730
(Nervous)

1270
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,070
Bang Ji Min...

1271
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,809
of Humble.

1272
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:29,409
(Bang Ji Min stood out with her techniques.)

1273
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,010
- Congratulations.
- You did it!

1274
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,449
(Ceremony)

1275
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,889
- All right.
- Yes.

1276
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:38,219
Are you ready?

1277
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,388
(Bring it on.)

1278
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:41,690
(Ji Min is the best.)

1279
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:44,079
(A gesture wishing her friends the best of luck)

1280
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,090
The next dancer we chose...

1281
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,559
Please let there be a member of M.S.G.

1282
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,170
Please let there be one of us.

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,300

1284
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,309
- Please let there be one of us.
- Is from M.S.G.

1285
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:01,709
- It's Lee Na Ra.
- Nice.

1286
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,038
(MANNEQUEEN's second choice is Lee Na Ra of M.S.G.)

1287
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,749
(Whoever wins is right for MANNEQUEEN!)

1288
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,619
(I knew it.)

1289
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,980
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1290
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,789
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1291
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,820
(Crying)

1292
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:14,320
The next dancer MANNEQUEEN chose...

1293
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:17,530
is Hwang Ye Ji of Humble.

1294
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:18,629
(MANNEQUEEN's third choice is Hwang Ye Ji of Humble.)

1295
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,159
Is Hwang Ye Ji.

1296
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,659
(Suddenly hugging)

1297
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,429
(Jumping)

1298
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,000
(Laughing)

1299
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,738
Two members of our crew were already called.

1300
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,969
When will I be called? Won't I be called?

1301
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,409
Two Way has to be called.

1302
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,449

00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,429

00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,799
It's Shin Dan Bi.

1311
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,000
- Thank you.
- I did it.

1312
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,110
I wish you luck.

1313
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,368
Thank you.

1314
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,178
The sixth dancer we chose...

1315
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:11,610
My name really has to be called.

1316
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,089

1317
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,618
(Nervous sigh)

1318
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:19,789
It's Kim Hee Jae.

1319
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,936
(MANNEQUEEN's sixth choice is Kim Hee Jae of Humble.)

1320
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,429
My baby.

1321
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,920
(Kim Hee Jae stood out with her light movements.)

1322
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,599
The last dancer MANNEQUEEN chose...

1323
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,670
I was really hoping we'd have...

1324
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:35,868
more from Humble.

1325
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,940
I really want someone from Two Way.

1326
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,309
Please let it be M.S.G.

1327
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,010
The last dancer MANNEQUEEN chose...

1328
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,848
is Kim Soo Jung of Humble.

1329
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:50,489
(MANNEQUEEN's last choice is Kim Soo Jung of Humble.)

1330
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,129
- Look.
- It's okay.

1331
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,058
You all did a great job.

1332
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,929
You reminded me of myself when I was a teenager.

1333
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,269
Don't cry, Yoonji.

1334
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,630
- Don't cry.
- Every one of you here...

1335
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,769
are part of Team MANNEQUEEN.

1336
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,509
(She's cute.)

1337
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,570
She's cute.

1338
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,138
You're younger than I am, but you're very mature.

1339
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,709
I wouldn't have been able to... I don't know.

1340
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,856
I honestly don't know if I could cheer for the others.

1341
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,449
You must feel jealous and upset...

1342
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,019
after trying so hard.

1343
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,750
You're very mature and impressive.

1344
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,320
Thank you.

1345
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,960
(Sad-lic is getting ready.)

1346
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,590
- Stop if you're going to cry.
- I won't cry.

1347
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,698
(They're so funny.)

1348
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,428
(Stop if you're going to cry?)

1349
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,429
I was very impressed while watching you.

1350
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,768
I learned from you.

1351
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,198
You were truly amazing.

1352
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:42,839
Should we take a group photo?

1353
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

1354
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,939
- Let's go, MANNEQUEEN.
- Let's go, MANNEQUEEN.

1355
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,379
(Dancers that will always shine with their passion)

1356
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,779
- Why do I feel like crying?
- Me too.

1357
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,280
- They were unbelievable.
- You're right.

1358
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,649
- They were unbelievable.
- They really were unbelievable.

1359
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,190
Really strong team.

1360
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:01,759
(Good job.)

1361
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,159
There are so many good dancers.

1362
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,190
(Clapping)

1363
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,500
- That's tough.
- How are you supposed to choose?

1364
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,069
How are you supposed to choose?

1365
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,006
(Next is Team LACHICA's Impromptu Battle.)

1366
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,399
(A minute ago, in the practice room for LACHICA's Impromptu Battle)

1367
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,800
Hey, hey, hey.

1368
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,610
(All eyes turn.)

1369
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,109
- Hello.
- Hello.

1370
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,408
- Hello.
- Hello.

1371
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:22,739
- Hello.
- Hello.

1372
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,779
In order to make a big stage...

1373
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,980
for you guys,

1374
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,050
(Big? What is it?)

1375
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:30,249
(Nervous)

1376
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,150
We chose the song "I AM" by IVE.

1377
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,959
(LACHICA participated in the choreography of "I AM" by IVE.)

1378
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,860
(LACHICA participated in the choreography of "I AM" by IVE.)

1379
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:42,198
You can come up with a dance...

1380
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,029
to "I AM" by IVE.

1381
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,969
We'll just decide the members.

1382
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,038
You can either do freestyle or choreograph a dance...

1383
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,010
and show us your best moves.

1384
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,380
(Next is Team LACHICA's Impromptu Battle.)

1385
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:01,420
(Solid has a mixture of battlers and all-genre dancers.)

1386
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:07,788
(The Queens got ALL IN for their strong performance.)

1387
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:12,489
(The Queens got ALL IN for their strong performance.)

1388
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,729
(The two teams have to come up with a dance for the Impromptu Battle.)

1389
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,199
(What kind of performances will the 4 teams put on?)

1390
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,530
Okay. Are you ready?

1391
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,899
- Yes.
- Yes.

1392
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,368
Okay, let's go.

1393
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,909
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1394
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,610
Good luck.

1395
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,089
(It's awesome to watch from the front row.)

1396
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,138
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

1397
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,009
- Let's go.
- You can do this.

1398
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,379
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1399
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,718
(Jeon Ho Yeon, Kim Yoo Kyung, Lee Hyun Seo are up first.)

1400
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,979
(Jeon Ho Yeon, Kim Yoo Kyung, Lee Hyun Seo are up first.)

1401
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,649
(Nervous, they tightly grab each other's hands.)

1402
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,419
Who will be able to be called a diva?

1403
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,230
Who will be able to be called a diva?

1404
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,130
Yes.

1405
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,029
(LACHICA Impromptu Battle, "I AM" by IVE)

1406
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,969
(Let's go.)

1407
00:58:57,769 --> 00:58:59,309
That's right.

1408
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:01,639
(Her eyes grow wider.)

1409
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
(Turn your heads.)

1410
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,819
(Very passionate)

1411
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,920
(This is it.)

1412
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:14,260
(She loves it.)

1413
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:19,429
(Their matching moves stand out in the choreography.)

1414
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,130
(Take my heart!)

1415
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,899
(I love it.)

1416
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,940
(That's so cute.)

1417
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:33,880
Is this a Galaxy?

1418
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,710
Galaxy.

1419
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,788
(Our talented dancers are doing great.)

1420
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,819
(That is who we are.)

1421
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,488
(Suddenly challenging them to a battle?)

1422
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,190
- Nice.
- Bring it on.

1423
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,058
(They don't forget the finale.)

1424
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,698
(They eat hearts...)

1425
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:56,030
(and out comes LACHICA.)

1426
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,829
- You're so good.
- I love it.

1427
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,745
They'll be able to go to the diva village.

1428
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,908
(Wait a second...)

1429
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:06,308
(What is Aiki looking at?)

1430
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:07,638
(Staring at something)

1431
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:09,308
Why does it look like they're wearing pork belly?

1432
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,609
(They suddenly feel dizzy when she attacks with pork belly.)

1433
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,650
Pork belly?

1434
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,448
They're wearing pork belly.

1435
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:15,820
What is wrong with you?

1436
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,919
I'm sorry. I get hungry around this time.

1437
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,789
It looked like pork belly.

1438
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,919
It's possible.

1439
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,119
- It's beef.
- Beef.

1440
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,989
Okay, beef. Let's go.

1441
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,529
Let's go.

1442
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,699
(Next is Kwon Jin Yoon, Han Ji Won, Kim Ji Seo, Cho Hye Jin.)

1443
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,468
(Their eyes meet.)

1444
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:34,876
(Cho Hye Jin shows up warming up her lips.)

1445
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,900
She's so cute.

1446
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,909
(Smiling like a proud mother)

1447
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:39,969
She bit it.

1448
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,610
She bit the beef.

1449
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,809
Let's have the music.

1450
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,880
(Shall we fly up?)

1451
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,449
(Their eyes change.)

1452
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:02,000
(The dancers perform as if they were always part of the same crew.)

1453
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,269
(They flew!)

1454
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,139
(Winking)

1455
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,550
(Look at her facial expressions!)

1456
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,449
(Meaningful smile)

1457
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,719
(Winking to the last moment)

1458
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,929
(Look at those talented dancers.)

1459
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,029
- So cute.
- So cute.

1460
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,229
I can see determination in their eyes.

1461
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,699
It's impressive that she was looking up here the whole time.

1462
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,630
(Eyes blazing)

1463
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:43,340
(Fixed gaze)

1464
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,110
(She catches the look.)

1465
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,509
She said it's impressive Hye Jin was looking here the whole time.

1466
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,316
- That's what we were talking about.
- I thought your eyes were here.

1467
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,550
She has bright eyes.

1468
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,919
- We enjoyed the performance.
- Thank you.

1469
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1470
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,590
- That was amazing.
- You did great.

1471
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,820
(LACHICA is having a discussion to decide the final 7.)

1472
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:02,066
- Let's include her for now.
- Okay, I'll include her.

1473
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,359
- It gets hard here.
- Why are there so many?

1474
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,760
They're all out.

1475
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,529
- Let's do this with Solid.
- Okay.

1476
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,469
Let's choose one member from The Queens to join us.

1477
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,699
All right, let's do that.

1478
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,400
The first dancer...

1479
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,769
LACHICA chose...

1480
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:19,570
Please.

1481
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,780
Let's all hold hands.

1482
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:24,349
(Holding hands tightly)

1483
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:29,949
(Who is the first member?)

1484
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,288
is Jeon Ho Yeon of The Queens.

1485
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:33,518
(The first dancer LACHICA chose is Jeon Ho Yeon of The Queens.)

1486
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:34,789
Your knees went weak.

1487
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,460
- Good job, Ho Yeon.
- Ho Yeon.

1488
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:39,269
(Feeling tears come to her eyes)

1489
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,360
I admit she was good.

1490
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,569
(Solid congratulates the first member chosen.)

1491
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,030
Congratulations.

1492
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,840
(Congratulations, Ho Yeon.)

1493
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,138
I felt apologetic.

1494
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:56,239
I wasn't just happy.

1495
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:02,719
(Ho Yeon tries to hold her tears back.)

1496
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,219
The second dancer...

1497
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,249
is Lee Hyun Seo of Solid.

1498
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,288
(The second dancer LACHICA chose is Lee Hyun Seo of Solid.)

1499
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:09,289
Hyun Seo did well.

1500
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,630
(Congratulations, Hyun Seo.)

1501
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,190
Ho Yeon.

1502
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,399
I felt happy,

1503
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,030
yet apologetic to my friends.

1504
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,229
- I feel like crying.
- It's a relief.

1505
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,550
(It's a relief Hyun Seo made it.)

1506
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,070
The third dancer...

1507
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,038
(The Queens?)

1508
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,739
(Solid?)

1509
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,448
Kim Yoo Kyung of Solid.

1510
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:33,749
(The third dancer LACHICA chose is Kim Yoo Kyung of Solid.)

1511
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,849
Thank you.

1512
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,320
(All the members of the first group passed!)

1513
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,788
We passed all three of you...

1514
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:45,159
because you did the best in performing the song by IVE.

1515
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,029
I felt like it was a miracle.

1516
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,300
Our hard work paid off.

1517
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,829
The next dancer...

1518
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,039
Please let it be a member of Solid.

1519
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,710
I imagined what it would be like if all seven members of Solid passed.

1520
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,340
Is from Solid.

1521
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,510
It's Eom Se Jung.

1522
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:10,479
(The fourth dancer LACHICA chose is Eom Se Jung of Solid.)

1523
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,650
- Thank you.
- All right.

1524
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,519
(Eom Se Jung showed overwhelming passion.)

1525
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,199
(Even her ending pose was perfect.)

1526
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,829
That was memorable.

1527
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,929
I thought there would definitely be another member of The Queens,

1528
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,369
but I was the only one chosen.

1529
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,038
The next dancer...

1530
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,039
(Please let there be one more member of The Queens.)

1531
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,440
(Hoping earnestly)

1532
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,779
is Park So Yoon of The Queens.

1533
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,149
(The fifth dancer LACHICA chose is Park So Yoon of The Queens.)

1534
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,179
You did great.

1535
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:46,889
We can't be the only ones from Solid.

1536
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,230
(Which dancer will join Team LACHICA next?)

1537
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,788
Cho Hye Jin of Solid.

1538
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:56,299
(The sixth dancer LACHICA chose is Cho Hye Jin of Solid.)

1539
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,670
- Hey.
- You were cool.

1540
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,038
(After the leaders of both teams pass, there is only one spot left.)

1541
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:03,340
How many are there?

1542
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:06,340
The last dancer...

1543
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,238
- The last...
- Please.

1544
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,710
(Who is the last dancer?)

1545
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:16,518
is Joo Hyo Rin of The Queens.

1546
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,848
(The seventh dancer LACHICA chose is Joo Hyo Rin of The Queens.)

1547
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,889
- Hyo Rin.
- Congratulations.

1548
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,428
There are nine members in The Queens.

1549
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:25,659
Each member represents...

1550
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,800
three members of The Queens.

1551
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,130
Whatever you weren't able to show people,

1552
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:34,070
we'll try harder to make up for it.

1553
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,670
(Team LACHICA has its 7 members!)

1554
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,469
(Street Dance Girls Fighter 2)

1555
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:43,139
Hello, everyone.

1556
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,210
- Hi.
- Hello.

1557
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,848
Don't be too nervous.

1558
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,578
I hope you do well.

1559
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,299
There are three teams that received ALL IN.

1560
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,420
(7 teams are gathered in Team BEBE.)

1561
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,365
(JustJerk Rookies, the descendant of winners)

1562
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:59,389
(Scoop, the duo with amazing teamwork!)

1563
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,730
(Choi Ye Eun, whose eyes change whenever she's dancing)

1564
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,300
(NASA with their explosive energy as if they're missing a screw!)

1565
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:10,639
(CHARM with their confidence and sharp eyes)

1566
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,539
(Amy, the world-class genius that has confident moves!)

1567
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,110
(Rana, the pink lion that has a Korean dream!)

1568
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,650
(I love you all!)

1569
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,050
(7 powerful teams are in Team BEBE.)

1570
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,949
How will they choose seven out of them?

1571
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,050
Who will get chosen?

1572
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:30,159
In order to make the final choice in members of Team BEBE,

1573
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,789
we will do freestyle dance.

1574
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,289
We will play a song for one minute.

1575
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,099
(They have to show everything they have within a minute.)

1576
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:39,939
It's impromptu freestyle dance.

1577
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,639
(The dancers look determined.)

1578
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,069
I was going to change my life...

1579
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,440
when I decided to be on the show.

1580
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,510
I am confident I will win.

1581
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:53,110
I'll win first place like I always do.

1582
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,380
I can do everything, so I'll show you.

1583
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,488
Okay, ready? Let's go.

1584
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:02,359
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

1585
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,420
Good luck.

1586
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,229
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1587
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,299
Let's go.

1588
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,845
(Park Eun Seo steps forward as soon as the song begins.)

1589
01:07:10,869 --> 01:07:11,900
(Come on.)

1590
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:16,969
She's so good.

1591
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,110
You have to show us more.

1592
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:20,880
Hey.

1593
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:23,840
(Powerful)

1594
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:27,050
(Clean body wave)

1595
01:07:27,449 --> 01:07:29,250
(That's right.)

1596
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,489
(Smart expression)

1597
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,889
Look at her.

1598
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:37,379
(Lee Ga Young takes over the empty center.)

1599
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,860
(Let's go, Lee Ga Young!)

1600
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,230
(Showing off their charm)

1601
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:44,670
Ga Young has an amazing body.

1602
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,130
(Satisfied)

1603
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:49,679
(Lee Ga Young becomes one with the beat.)

1604
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,480
Gosh, Ga Young.

1605
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,840
Hey.

1606
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,250
(Don't call me)

1607
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:03,118
- Okay.
- Okay.

1608
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,150
- I won't call you.
- I want to call you.

1609
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:08,739
(Yoo Seung Ju, Park Seo Yeon, Amy, Ko A Ra)

1610
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:12,530
(Powerful)

1611
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,090
That's right.

1612
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,000
(It's as if they choreographed the dance together.)

1613
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:22,100
You have to show us more.

1614
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,010
She put her hair down.

1615
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,810
(And)

1616
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,250
(Someone catches the attention of the masters.)

1617
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,420
(It's Ko A Ra of NASA.)

1618
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,860
(Their body control gives us the chills.)

1619
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:39,149
Hey.

1620
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,750
I love Ko A Ra.

1621
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,229
(So charming)

1622
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:47,829
You're doing great.

1623
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,569
(The second freestyle comes to an end.)

1624
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,640
- I saw no one other than A Ra.
- I have a headache.

1625
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,710
(The third group starts their freestyle dance.)

1626
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,038
Let's go.

1627
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:03,215
(Sato Rana, Lee Chae Won, Kim Si Eun, Min Ji Hyung)

1628
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,510
Show us.

1629
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:10,420
(Rana stands out as soon as she starts dancing.)

1630
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,819
Taking her time. That's good.

1631
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:15,289
(Rana slowly moves to the center of the stage.)

1632
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,189
(Marveling)

1633
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,590
(I love it.)

1634
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,470
(And Lee Chae Won, who is just as good as Rana)

1635
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,329
(Charging forward)

1636
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,640
That's right.

1637
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:34,039
(Smiling)

1638
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,479
(The two people's freestyle dance creates amazing chemistry.)

1639
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:40,310
They're doing the same dance.

1640
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,949
(Same, but different)

1641
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:45,319
(Explosive energy)

1642
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,890
Isn't that crazy?

1643
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:48,560
(It isn't over yet.)

1644
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:53,489
(Rana's unrivaled technique)

1645
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:57,630
(She loves it.)

1646
01:09:57,899 --> 01:09:59,100
(Totally satisfied)

1647
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:01,776
(Rana is surprisingly good at dominating the stage.)

1648
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,840
(I won't back down.)

1649
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:05,539
(Excuse me.)

1650
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:08,609
(A glass of lemonade)

1651
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:11,250
(That's cute.)

1652
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,609
- I love you.
- Okay.

1653
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,089
(The masters marvel and applaud them generously.)

1654
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,220
That was no joke.

1655
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,789
(Who will be Team BEBE's final 7 dancers?)

1656
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:27,329
We...

1657
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:30,529
selected final members.

1658
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,699
(It's a moment when they're nervous the most as they worked hard.)

1659
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,738
I think I was secretly anticipating them...

1660
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:38,340
to call my name.

1661
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,180
Okay. The first dancer...

1662
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,310
Team BEBE chose is...

1663
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:49,319
(Doing a drumroll themselves)

1664
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
from NASA.

1665
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:53,189
From NASA.

1666
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:56,159
Here it comes.

1667
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,229
(Envious)

1668
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,500
in NASA. Lee Ga Young.

1669
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,829
- Good job.
- Good job.

1670
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,320
(The first member of Team BEBE is Lee Ga Young, the leader of NASA!)

1671
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:09,869
Ga Young.

1672
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,869
- Hey.
- She's cute.

1673
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:17,239
The second dancer...

1674
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:20,710
BEBE picked is...

1675
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,749
(Will it be a member of NASA again?)

1676
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,750
(Or is she from JustJerk Rookies?)

1677
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,159
Park Eun Seo from JustJerk Rookies.

1678
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,390
Park Eun Seo.

1679
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:33,390
Let's go.

1680
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:36,158
(The leaders of each team have met as if they were meant to be.)

1681
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,159
Digidigidi.

1682
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,500
Gang.

1683
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:40,369
- Gang.
- Okay.

1684
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,699
The third dancer I'm going to call...

1685
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:47,309
is Lee Chae Won from NASA. Let's go.

1686
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,630
(Lee Chae Won from NASA is the third member of Team BEBE.)

1687
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:51,250
Congratulations.

1688
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,609
Okay.

1689
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,380
All right.

1690
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:56,861
(There are 4 vacancies on Team BEBE.)

1691
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,920
The fourth dancer I'm going to call is...

1692
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,760
Okay. Rana.

1693
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:07,488
(Rana got to join Team BEBE, which is she dreamed of!)

1694
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,659
She did so well.

1695
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,358
She did a great job.

1696
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,528
Welcome.

1697
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:12,828
Don't cry.

1698
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,069
Rana.

1699
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,710
Congratulations.

1700
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:20,970
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1701
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,879
Yoo Seung Ju from CHARM.

1702
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,680
(Yoo Seung Ju is the fifth member of Team BEBE.)

1703
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:31,389
Ko A Ra from NASA.

1704
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,390
You did it.

1705
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:33,689
You did it.

1706
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:36,059
Okay.

1707
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,496
(As many as 3 members of NASA were selected for Team BEBE.)

1708
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,960
Gosh, this is so fun.

1709
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,359
They picked the good ones only.

1710
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:45,300
Are they not going to call another member of JustJerk Rookies?

1711
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,738
If they don't call another member of JustJerk Rookies,

1712
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,369
I should do it alone.

1713
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:53,039
Will I be able to do it by myself?

1714
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,449
The seventh member,

1715
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:02,180
the last member Team BEBE picked is...

1716
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:13,988
Park Seo Yeon from JustJerk Rookies.

1717
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,236
(Park Seo Yeon from JustJerk Rookies is the last one who is picked.)

1718
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,430
Thank you.

1719
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:19,869
Congratulations.

1720
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:21,269
- Congratulations.
- I'm so relieved...

1721
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,840
that it's the 2 of us, not just 1.

1722
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,840
- We made The Avengers.
- Right.

1723
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:28,339
Only the teams we wanted chose us.

1724
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,109
It gave me assurance that we can work together.

1725
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:33,279
I'm excited.

1726
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,380
You worked hard.

1727
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:38,419
You guys are so cool.

1728
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,549
(We're looking forward to the future...)

1729
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,026
(of the teenage dancers and their growth.)

1730
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,220
It's 1MILLION's turn.

1731
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,960
(The masters are more nervous.)

1732
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,829
(Why are they so nervous?)

1733
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,620
The Impromptu Battle will be fun.

1734
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:52,970
It's a new concept.

1735
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:56,000
(Am I the only one who is shaking?)

1736
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,139
(Team 1MILLION)

1737
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,108
Are you ready, 1MILLION?

1738
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:01,608
- Yes.
- Yes.

1739
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,209
The mission you're given this time...

1740
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:06,010
is Killing Part Choreography Mission.

1741
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:09,379
You're given three song choices: "Maria," "TT," and "Gashina,"

1742
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,980
You can pick one of them for the battle.

1743
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,288
(Among the three songs, they can pick a song for the battle!)

1744
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:15,289
They're masterpieces.

1745
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:18,328
The killing part in a performance is very important.

1746
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,228
I want to make a combination...

1747
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:22,659
of people who are capable of making a killing part.

1748
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,398
But it's hard to create something that is different from the original.

1749
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:29,469
I know. Especially when Lia Kim is the choreographer of the song.

1750
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,030
(She's watching them in the front row.)

1751
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,238
Play the music.

1752
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,140
(The battle of team "Maria" has started!)

1753
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,579
- Let's go.
- You got this.

1754
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:42,979
(Ha Neul is drawing attention with her long limbs.)

1755
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,060
Ha Neul is crazy.

1756
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,720
She knows what to highlight.

1757
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,760
Ha Neul from VENTURE is selected.

1758
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,260
Let's go.

1759
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,228
(The battle of team "TT" has started!)

1760
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:59,770
("TT" by TWICE)

1761
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,499
(Kyung Min is sending a signal with her fierce eyes.)

1762
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,009
(She received the signal.)

1763
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:09,279
I spotted girls who kept looking at us.

1764
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:12,979
Not many of them looked up that much.

1765
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:16,979
Kwon Kyung Min is selected.

1766
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:19,988
(Sim Ha Neul, Kwon Kyung Min, and Choi Eun Kyung were selected.)

1767
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:20,989
And...

1768
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:25,229
the dancer Team 1MILLION picked is...

1769
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,158
(There are four vacancies now!)

1770
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,199
(Who are the dancers who will do a battle next?)

1771
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:35,599
(Yoon In Jung, the leader of VENTURE with the best high school girls)

1772
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,739
(Lee So Min, the only teenage tutter with beautiful, perfect angles)

1773
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,979
(Ok Eun Bin, the leader of Nataraja V, the up-and-coming crew)

1774
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,009
Let's move on to "Gashina."

1775
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:49,349
Ok Eun Bin, Lee So Min, and Yoon In Jung.

1776
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,519
Play the music.

1777
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,550
(They're ready to go.)

1778
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:55,920
("Gashina" by SUNMI)

1779
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,430
(Shouting)

1780
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:03,529
(Are you crazy?)

1781
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,680
(Standing up)

1782
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,340
I got goosebumps.

1783
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,078
(Capturing attention)

1784
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,079
My gosh.

1785
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:22,720
(Turning)

1786
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,489
She's so powerful.

1787
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:32,460
Let's go.

1788
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:33,789
(She stood up again.)

1789
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:35,699
In Jung is doing good.

1790
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,368
Hey. Yes.

1791
01:16:40,369 --> 01:16:42,238
I was full of greed...

1792
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,640
that I will not be eliminated at that moment.

1793
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,810
Look at her face.

1794
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,609
(That look is too good.)

1795
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,289
I should win. I will win.

1796
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:06,589
(Fierce)

1797
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,728
(The performance with the choreography they made...)

1798
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:08,828
(showed the personality of each of the 3 dancers.)

1799
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,059
Okay.

1800
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,270
- That was awesome.
- That was so cool.

1801
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:14,990
- That was awesome.
- That was really cool.

1802
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,970
All of them are good.

1803
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,470
Gosh.

1804
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,170
One more time.

1805
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,010
Nice.

1806
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:24,579
The next dancer...

1807
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,250
(Suggestive)

1808
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,810
is an individual dancer.

1809
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,319
(An individual dancer?)

1810
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,449
It's an individual dancer, Lee So Min.

1811
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:35,060
It's an individual dancer, Lee So Min.

1812
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:37,389
(The fourth member of Team 1MILLION is So Min, an individual dancer.)

1813
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,988
(Bewildered)

1814
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,260
- Oh, my gosh.
- Congratulations.

1815
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,328
- I knew it.
- So Min, I really like you.

1816
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:46,028
I like you too.

1817
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:47,269
(MANNEQUEEN also fell in love with So Min's charms.)

1818
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,439
She's charming.

1819
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:54,169
Ok Eun Bin from Nataraja V is selected.

1820
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,890
(The fifth member of Team 1MILLION is Eun Bin, Nataraja V's leader.)

1821
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,449
(A sigh of relief)

1822
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,880
And...

1823
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:04,549
My name hadn't been called,

1824
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,489
which made me more anxious.

1825
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,590
She's from VENTURE.

1826
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:11,158
(It's a member of VENTURE this time!)

1827
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:12,658
(The sixth member of Team 1MILLION)

1828
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:14,130
Yoon In Jung.

1829
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,429
Congratulations.

1830
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,999
- In Jung.
- Yes.

1831
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,599
- I acknowledge In Jung.
- In Jung.

1832
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,600
I acknowledge her.

1833
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,600
Gosh.

1834
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:22,839
(In Jung from VENTURE finally shows a big smile.)

1835
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,669
(They will announce the last member who made it.)

1836
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,609
(The remaining dancers are nervous.)

1837
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,039
Team 1MILLION picked...

1838
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,250
(Desperate)

1839
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:34,680
a member of Nataraja V,

1840
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:37,118
Lee Ji Sol.

1841
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:38,220
Thank you.

1842
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:43,499
(They're applauding for the dancers who showed talent and passion.)

1843
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:44,959
- You guys worked very hard.
- You did great.

1844
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,590
You did great.

1845
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,328
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1846
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:52,569
(They picked all the dancers to join Team 1MILLION!)

1847
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,639
Hi, everyone.

1848
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,140
Let's start down the line. I want to say hi.

1849
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,239
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hello.

1850
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,469
Oh, my gosh.

1851
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,309
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1852
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,880
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1853
01:19:04,109 --> 01:19:05,209
Hello.

1854
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,379
Hi.

1855
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,509
(She's greeting and meeting eyes with everyone.)

1856
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,719
Hello, ma'am.

1857
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,720
I can't believe it.

1858
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,119
She smells so nice.

1859
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,590
How are you feeling?

1860
01:19:14,789 --> 01:19:16,288
- Good.
- Good?

1861
01:19:16,289 --> 01:19:19,389
We have some news to share.

1862
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,089
For Team JAM REPUBLIC,

1863
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,528
the final battle mission is going to be...

1864
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:26,970
(It's going to be...)

1865
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,100
cover choreography and freestyle.

1866
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,438
A couple of things. I think...

1867
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:33,840
we wanted to see how they would work under pressure...

1868
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,979
and time constraints as well.

1869
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,009
How they pick up choreography,

1870
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,849
but also how they make it into their own.

1871
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:43,020
And how they shine through a choreography given to them.

1872
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:45,619
My turn now. Okay.

1873
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,059
And the person who will be presenting the choreography is...

1874
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,319
(Looking around)

1875
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,689
No way.

1876
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:53,289
No way.

1877
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,129
La Trice.

1878
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:58,199
(La Trice, the Queen of Afro Dance)

1879
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,930
I'm doomed.

1880
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:04,169
No matter how hard I worked to prepare for the audition,

1881
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:07,039
I can't shake my buttocks. I'm doomed.

1882
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,179
It looked very difficult.

1883
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,209
And I didn't know how to pull it off,

1884
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:14,778
but I was confident because I've been dancing...

1885
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,279
for a long time.

1886
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,488
I mainly do popping animation.

1887
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:21,618
But I've done the genre...

1888
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,158
La Trice does a little.

1889
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,089
So I didn't worry.

1890
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:27,760
One of my strong points is choreography,

1891
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,300
so it was a good mission.

1892
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:34,099
(En Beatz was highly praised for their energy, )

1893
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,640
(which was unexpected because of their cute looks.)

1894
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,039
(Ria who dominated the stage with her unique performance)

1895
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:42,739
(Sienna who surprised people with her powerful skills)

1896
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:47,109
(Miyabi who captivated everyone with her fancy and flexible moves)

1897
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:51,148
(NO LIP that got All IN and made everyone stand up...)

1898
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,319
(with their creative and shocking performance)

1899
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,520
(They all picked JAM REPUBLIC.)

1900
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,130
How difficult would it be?

1901
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:01,859
La Trice's choreographies are hard.

1902
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,529
(Shy)

1903
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:07,329
(La Trice, the choreographer, appears on the screen.)

1904
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,670
(I like it already.)

1905
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:11,999
(Her choreography is finally revealed!)

1906
01:21:12,609 --> 01:21:16,539
(It's time to appreciate it.)

1907
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:18,380
How can they copy it?

1908
01:21:19,779 --> 01:21:21,010
It's so hard.

1909
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,220
(La Trice, that's too hard.)

1910
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,448
(So easy)

1911
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:27,589
(They need to cover the choreography in their own styles.)

1912
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:28,960
It's so cool.

1913
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:31,590
(Moving her hips)

1914
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,559
I like it.

1915
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,729
(It's very easy, isn't it?)

1916
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:40,069
(She's indeed good.)

1917
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,800
- Not bad.
- La Trice. Hey.

1918
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,340
She's too good.

1919
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,339
- Thank you.
- Good job, La Trice.

1920
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,010
(Thumbs up)

1921
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,680
I will choose you.

1922
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,550
- You choose me?
- Yes.

1923
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,719
Okay. Let's begin.

1924
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,289
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1925
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,689
- Let's go.
- I think they'll do an amazing job.

1926
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:02,859
I'm so excited about this.

1927
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,189
They'll do so well.

1928
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,889
I can't wait to see how they will dance.

1929
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,960
This group is very strong.

1930
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,499
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1931
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,899
- Let's go.
- You got this.

1932
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:17,600
Let's go.

1933
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go, DJ.

1934
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,809
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1935
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,908
Come on.

1936
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:25,408
(They start with the cover of La Trice's choreography.)

1937
01:22:25,409 --> 01:22:27,409
("Gwara Nao Para" by ASSI and BM)

1938
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:38,159
(The same choreography, different feelings)

1939
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:40,960
- Come on.
- Keep going.

1940
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:45,029
(Ria takes off her jacket?)

1941
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,039
You're doing well.

1942
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:55,909
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1943
01:22:55,939 --> 01:22:57,139
(After the cover choreography, )

1944
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,648
Let's go.

1945
01:22:58,649 --> 01:22:59,978
(it's a freestyle session now!)

1946
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:01,009
(There you go!)

1947
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:06,688
(Look at them!)

1948
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:07,689
(Shocked)

1949
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:11,219
(She points at them.)

1950
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,359
Yes. Dabble that.

1951
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:16,099
- Dance that.
- Let's go, Bella.

1952
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,270
(The freestyle battle continues with intense energy.)

1953
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,229
(I'm Bella.)

1954
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,569
Oh, my gosh.

1955
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,000
(This is insane!)

1956
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,539
- Come on.
- Come on.

1957
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:31,210
(Powerful)

1958
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,656
(She's making her way through NO LIP with powerful moves.)

1959
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,019
(She's killing it with her facial expressions.)

1960
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,020
(They're liking the difficult moves.)

1961
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:38,719
(It's right up her alley.)

1962
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,520
(Impressed)

1963
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,520
(The Cover Choreography and Freestyle Battle ends.)

1964
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,390
- This is it.
- Yes.

1965
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,229
I can't choose.

1966
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,770
I just want all of them to join JAM REPUBLIC.

1967
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:54,919
- I can't pick.
- It was breathtaking.

1968
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,538
It was breathtaking.

1969
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:59,670
- It was breathtaking.
- Seriously.

1970
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:03,379
I almost passed out.

1971
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,509
(JAM REPUBLIC was crazy.)

1972
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,850
What do I do with their confidence?

1973
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,250
They have strong personalities.

1974
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,289
NO LIP did well, but they were overshadowed.

1975
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:15,319
How come all of us lost?

1976
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,889
(NO LIP was showing sharp moves.)

1977
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:21,188
Everyone had amazing hip moves.

1978
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:24,800
I thought dancers from other countries were indeed different.

1979
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,130
(It's Bella again.)

1980
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,340
It did change my opinion.

1981
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,739
NO LIP might not make it.

1982
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,309
All of them could be eliminated.

1983
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:40,210
- NO LIP was so cool, but...
- Yes.

1984
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:42,778
She's got more performance.

1985
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:45,119
She can do choreography and delivered it.

1986
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:48,118
But I don't remember her standing out when she was doing choreography.

1987
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:49,189
Yes.

1988
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:51,859
But obviously, different styles.

1989
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,129
She didn't really stand out that much.

1990
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,529
(What's JAM REPUBLIC's choice?)

1991
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:00,829
Final seven...

1992
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:04,039
for Team JAM REPUBLIC.

1993
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:05,839
(The final 7 for Team JAM REPUBLIC will be revealed.)

1994
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,108
(Anticipating)

1995
01:25:08,109 --> 01:25:10,979
JAM REPUBLIC would like to have...

1996
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:13,250
Miyabi.

1997
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,749
(The first one who was selected is Miyabi, an individual dancer.)

1998
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,920
Yes. Let's go.

1999
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,560
Miyabi.

2000
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:24,960
(Welcome)

2001
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,800
JAM REPUBLIC would like to have...

2002
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:31,130
From Team En Beatz.

2003
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,199
(The second one who made it...)

2004
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,529
Bella.

2005
01:25:33,569 --> 01:25:34,929
(is Bella from En Beatz.)

2006
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,770
Let's go.

2007
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,670
Let's go, Bella.

2008
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,409
Love you.

2009
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:43,978
(She got emotional.)

2010
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:46,049
I'm so proud of you.

2011
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,210
(Bella, I'm so proud of you.)

2012
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:49,978
Team JAM REPUBLIC would like to have...

2013
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,288
(The third one who made it...)

2014
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:53,489
Ria.

2015
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:57,060
(is Ria, an individual dancer.)

2016
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:01,060
They're babies. Oh, my gosh.

2017
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:02,460
She's cute.

2018
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,469
(Contestants from abroad were called one after another.)

2019
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:06,499
(The fourth one who made it...)

2020
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,699
Sienna.

2021
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,499
(is Sienna, an individual dancer.)

2022
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,099
(is Sienna, an individual dancer.)

2023
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,539
Sienna.

2024
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:16,908
So anyone that wants to do one more time?

2025
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:18,139
The floor is yours.

2026
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,778
(Everyone got...)

2027
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,539
(the last chance for the final team trials!)

2028
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:23,880
Yes.

2029
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,619
(Sienna's performance stood out among others.)

2030
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:33,390
(She showed her skills as if she was making up for her mistakes.)

2031
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:40,130
She's cute.

2032
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:42,970
(Among the final 7, 4 of them were revealed.)

2033
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:46,739
(No one from NO LIP was called.)

2034
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,279
JAM REPUBLIC would like to have...

2035
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:52,949
Kim Min Jung.

2036
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:56,920
(The fifth one who made it is Kim Min Jung from NO LIP.)

2037
01:26:57,819 --> 01:26:59,289
(Congratulations)

2038
01:26:59,989 --> 01:27:01,789
- This is new.
- Oh, my gosh.

2039
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,059
(She's having all sorts of feelings.)

2040
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,659
Congratulations.

2041
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:07,329
Nika.

2042
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,799
(The sixth one who made it is Nika from En Beatz.)

2043
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,470
Don't cry.

2044
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,939
Yes. Show them.

2045
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,140
Our final dancer is...

2046
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,239
Who is it?

2047
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,109
The last one?

2048
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,739
From NO LIP.

2049
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:27,149
(Shocked)

2050
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,819
(The last dancer is a member of NO LIP!)

2051
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:37,989
Park Eun Woo.

2052
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:43,929
(The seventh one who made it is Park Eun Woo from NO LIP.)

2053
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,199
My goodness.

2054
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,300
Yes. She has a character.

2055
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:50,339
It was the character and presence. Again,

2056
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,739
that's what we were looking for. We need someone that...

2057
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:56,279
(The final 7 from Team JAM REPUBLIC were selected.)

2058
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,179
- So congratulations to all of you.
- Congratulations.

2059
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:03,579
Hey, yo. Go, JAM REPUBLIC. Let's go.

2060
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:07,350
HOOK.

2061
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:10,858
Let's go.

2062
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:14,260
- You got this.
- Ayo. You guys look cool.

2063
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,500
You got this.

2064
01:28:15,529 --> 01:28:16,729
There are many people.

2065
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:18,129
There are so many of them.

2066
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,446
(Four teenage crews are standing here to be selected!)

2067
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,600
(Brand New Child, the finalist of season 1, is back.)

2068
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,568
(PROWDMON's HAM.G taught them.)

2069
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:27,089
(They're an all-genre crew that showed a unique performance...)

2070
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,079
(and picked Team HOOK!)

2071
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:34,250
(Well Boss showed an incredible performance with fans.)

2072
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,919
(The combination of fan dance and waacking was fresh.)

2073
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,449
(Who are these girls?)

2074
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,020
(Immersed)

2075
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:44,060
(They got a pass with their fierceness.)

2076
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,659
(The return of Wolf'Lo, a street hip-hop crew)

2077
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:49,698
(BOW showed a powerful performance in an old-school hip-hop style.)

2078
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,130
They're so good.

2079
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,029
(The hip-hop dancers were so cool.)

2080
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:57,399
(It's right up her alley.)

2081
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:01,409
(All That Street is the biggest crew on the show with 13 members.)

2082
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:08,010
(They showed a performance on a big scale as a big group!)

2083
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:13,319
(The crews with unique styles gathered for HOOK.)

2084
01:29:13,949 --> 01:29:15,119
I think they'll be strong.

2085
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:16,489
It's going to be fun.

2086
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,189
The theme of HOOK is...

2087
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,859
- What is it?
- What would it be?

2088
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:26,770
Simultaneous Part Battle.

2089
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:28,529
(Simultaneous Battle?)

2090
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,538
I often go to battles. So I was confident.

2091
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:33,019
I was confident about doing a battle.

2092
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:35,538
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2093
01:29:35,539 --> 01:29:37,209
Let's go.

2094
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,449
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2095
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,180
- Kill it.
- Don't lose.

2096
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,020
Let's go.

2097
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:45,549
(Kim Yoon Hye, Cho Ha Yeon, Ahn Ye Jin, Im Ja Yeon)

2098
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,590
(Kim Yoon Hye, Cho Ha Yeon, Ahn Ye Jin, Im Ja Yeon)

2099
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,819
Yes.

2100
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:51,220
Okay.

2101
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:53,130
(It's their cup of tea.)

2102
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,529
That's nice.

2103
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:56,800
Ye Jin.

2104
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:04,069
- Show us more.
- Go.

2105
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:06,710
(Let's go.)

2106
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:08,340
There you go.

2107
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:11,010
She looks relaxed. My gosh.

2108
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:14,009
- Why is Ye Jin so good?
- I know.

2109
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,109
She's so good.

2110
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:16,850
(Exchanging glances)

2111
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,050
(She flew!)

2112
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,619
(Bravo!)

2113
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:23,849
(All of the masters stand up to cheer the dancers on!)

2114
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:26,989
That's it!

2115
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,129
(Staying in it till the end)

2116
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,130
Look at that.

2117
01:30:32,329 --> 01:30:33,369
(Leaving chicly)

2118
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:34,930
(Copying her)

2119
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,840
(She can't hold back her laughter.)

2120
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:39,970
Everyone, out of her way.

2121
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:42,479
That walk was a Yoonji walk.

2122
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:46,209
They must have a Yoonji type. You know what I mean?

2123
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,250
The Yoonji type is good.

2124
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,180
I loved Brand New Child.

2125
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:52,250
All the dancers should now gather in the center.

2126
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,560
Mini Yeni Cho is here.

2127
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:57,358
That's her.

2128
01:30:57,359 --> 01:30:59,658
- And that's Haechi.
- I can't wait for Haechi Wang.

2129
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:01,359
Her hair hasn't died down at all.

2130
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:04,560
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

2131
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:08,100
(Seo Chae Hyung, Chae Hee Sun, Moon Ji Won, Kim Yeon Ju)

2132
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:11,340
- Haechi Wang really stands out.
- Let's go, Haechi!

2133
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,530
(Mini Haechi Wang, Seo Chae Hyung has a standout persona.)

2134
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:21,609
Gosh, that's insane.

2135
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,520
(Another BOW member also stands out distinctly.)

2136
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:26,720
Yeon Ju.

2137
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,419
(Bursting into a wave)

2138
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,420
She's good.

2139
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:33,060
They're so good.

2140
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:35,130
- Right?
- The little tigers are great.

2141
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:37,130
BOW is good.

2142
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,099
The third song is "Cool Off" by Missy Elliott.

2143
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,600
Cool off!

2144
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,340
Cool off! Coughing.

2145
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:46,141
(The original cougher looks forward to this.)

2146
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,515
("Cool Off" by Missy Elliott, simultaneous battle)

2147
01:31:47,539 --> 01:31:49,779
(Ahn Soo Hyun, Seo Eun Chae, Cho Chae Won, Song Da Bin)

2148
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,079
(Moving forward)

2149
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:56,579
(Power waacking)

2150
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,289
Yes, go for it!

2151
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:03,390
Yes!

2152
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:06,260
- Gosh.
- She's so good.

2153
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:09,130
(Kim Su Bin, Song A Yoon, Lee Ga Hyun, Lim Gyu Bin)

2154
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,329
(Powerful popping)

2155
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:15,800
(High-pitched screams galore for the popping)

2156
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:19,770
(Coughing)

2157
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,010
She did a coughing move.

2158
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:23,710
Again!

2159
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:25,750
Gosh.

2160
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,326
(The teen dancers comfort one another for their hard work.)

2161
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,779
How do we pick?

2162
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,589
You guys are really the best.

2163
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:36,159
- That was so much fun.
- If you had fun, that's it.

2164
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,659
I really want to go out again. It's too bad.

2165
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,989
Who are these girls?

2166
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:43,600
- They were insane.
- These two did really well.

2167
01:32:43,899 --> 01:32:46,569
And this person did really well. This person too.

2168
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,198
If we choose this girl, and this one,

2169
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:50,438
I think that's perfect.

2170
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:51,470
Okay.

2171
01:32:52,539 --> 01:32:54,109
Everyone,

2172
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,180
we'll call out the names right away.

2173
01:32:56,609 --> 01:32:59,948
We want at least one person from our crew to make it.

2174
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,449
All five of us have to make it.

2175
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,279
(Who is the first member to make it to Team HOOK?)

2176
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:05,550
All That Street,

2177
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,318
Lee Ga Hyun.

2178
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:10,789
(The first person to pass is Ga Hyun from All That Street.)

2179
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:12,988
Congratulations.

2180
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:14,629
I knew you'd make it.

2181
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,398
Congratulations on making it. You did a great job.

2182
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:19,198
Congratulations.

2183
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,569
(Our leader did a great job.)

2184
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,076
(They keep going to announce the next person to pass.)

2185
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,375
(Will the next person chosen be an All That Street member too?)

2186
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:26,999
(Or will they be from a different crew?)

2187
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,880
Now that we've come this far, we have to pass no matter what.

2188
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:32,449
Brand New Child...

2189
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,380
Brand New Child's Ahn Ye Jin.

2190
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:38,448
(The second girl to pass is Brand New Child's Ahn Ye Jin.)

2191
01:33:38,449 --> 01:33:39,449
You did great!

2192
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,189
The little Yoonji.

2193
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:44,590
Ye Jin, you know what's up.

2194
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:46,989
BOW's Lee Joo Bin.

2195
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,528
Great job.

2196
01:33:49,529 --> 01:33:51,449
(The third person to pass is BOW's Lee Joo Bin.)

2197
01:33:51,529 --> 01:33:52,929
BOW's Seo Chae Hyung.

2198
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:55,211
(Seo Chae Hyung's name is called immediately afterwards.)

2199
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,710
(The fourth person to pass is BOW's Seo Chae Hyung.)

2200
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,469
(Mini Yeni Cho and Mini Haechi Wang both pass!)

2201
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:01,770
- It's Haechi Wang.
- Haechi Wang.

2202
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:04,439
And BOW's Kim Yeon Ju.

2203
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,818
(The fifth person to pass is BOW's Kim Yeon Ju.)

2204
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:12,550
- A lot of girls from BOW made it.
- Yes, they took a lot from BOW.

2205
01:34:12,789 --> 01:34:13,989
I said you'd make it.

2206
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,188
We have two people left, and we debated this for a long time.

2207
01:34:18,189 --> 01:34:20,029
(Will they call another member from BOW?)

2208
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,029
Well Boss' Song Da Bin.

2209
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,699
Well Boss' Song Da Bin.

2210
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,630
(The sixth person to pass is Well Boss' Song Da Bin.)

2211
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:30,869
The last dancer chosen by Team HOOK is...

2212
01:34:31,069 --> 01:34:32,140
(Hurry up and tell us!)

2213
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:34,309
(Who is the passing member?)

2214
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:36,709
I think she'll end up being the baby of our team.

2215
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,710
Well Boss' Bae Soo Yeon.

2216
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:38,978
Well Boss' Bae Soo Yeon.

2217
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:40,010
(Shocked)

2218
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,419
(The seventh person to pass is Well Boss' Bae Soo Yeon.)

2219
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,589
Congratulations!

2220
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:47,689
Congratulations!

2221
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,189
You all worked so hard.

2222
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:53,260
(Just like HOOK, all 7 members have distinctive personalities.)

2223
01:34:53,529 --> 01:34:56,299
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2224
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,859
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2225
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:02,170
(Final results of the Team Trials, 1MILLION, BEBE, HOOK)

2226
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,340
(Final results of the Team Trials, JAM REPUBLIC, LACHICA, MANNEQUEEN)

2227
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,109
Now the Team Trials for Street Dance Girls Fighter 2...

2228
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,210
have concluded.

2229
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,649
Congratulations to the 42 dancers...

2230
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,749
who have survived the Team Trials.

2231
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,879
- Congratulations.
- You worked so hard.

2232
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,379
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2233
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,460
(Hoping only good things are waiting for them ahead)

2234
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:22,920
The real competition begins now.

2235
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,829
- So this is it.
- It's starting again.

2236
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,129
Your first mission...

2237
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,465
(The first mission to be completed in their new teams)

2238
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,000
will now be revealed.

2239
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:32,159
Oh, my gosh.

2240
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:33,569
Please!

2241
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:35,500
They just survived today.

2242
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:37,069
Hold my hand.

2243
01:35:37,369 --> 01:35:38,399
The first mission is...

2244
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:40,438
It feels like I'm the one doing the mission.

2245
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:41,439
(Opening up her ears)

2246
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:44,538
This is your mission.

2247
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:47,149
- What?
- We can't lose this no matter what.

2248
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,750
(After the Team Trials are over)

2249
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,720
In 1, 2, 3.

2250
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:54,649
(Exploding with cheers)

2251
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,389
(Ta da)

2252
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,390
Look at this!

2253
01:35:57,391 --> 01:36:00,729
(Meanwhile, at the JAM REPUBLIC room for those who passed)

2254
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,500
(Speechless from happiness)

2255
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:03,898
(The room for Team LACHICA)

2256
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:06,299
- What is all this?
- It's all pink!

2257
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,869
(The room for Team BEBE)

2258
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:10,439
(The room for Team HOOK)

2259
01:36:11,539 --> 01:36:14,569
It's all yellow.

2260
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:16,478
It was like watching SWF 2.

2261
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,679
(We didn't know what they liked so we prepared it all.)

2262
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,979
(All the dancers who passed are in their team rooms.)

2263
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:28,188
- What is that?
- That's amazing.

2264
01:36:28,189 --> 01:36:29,595
(There's a mysterious paper bag in the team rooms.)

2265
01:36:29,619 --> 01:36:31,889
Everyone, the bags before you...

2266
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:33,828
contain gifts for everyone who passed.

2267
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:34,929
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2268
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,930
(Another surprise for the dancers who worked hard to get here)

2269
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,100
Gosh, thank you.

2270
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,569
(A special gift for those who survived till now.)

2271
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:42,568
It's so cute.

2272
01:36:42,569 --> 01:36:44,999
- It's really cute.
- It's a heart.

2273
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,670
- It's so sparkly.
- It's so cute.

2274
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,510
(An otherworldly cuteness they show off everywhere)

2275
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:51,979
I finally have gems embedded in my lips.

2276
01:36:52,409 --> 01:36:54,449
Wearing this, I'll become a young, popular it-girl.

2277
01:36:54,979 --> 01:36:56,496
Are you going to fall in love with me now?

2278
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,920
- Probably.
- Thank you.

2279
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,419
- How does it look?
- So good.

2280
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,448
- How does it look?
- So good.

2281
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:01,919
(A great reaction)

2282
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,119
It does look good for you.

2283
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:04,960
Should I apply the tinted one above it?

2284
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,229
It's nice.

2285
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:10,999
The colors are so nice.

2286
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,068
It's perfect for daily use. It brightens you up so much.

2287
01:37:14,069 --> 01:37:15,229
(Looking vivacious)

2288
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,499
(Thank you for the gift.)

2289
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,439
- Thank you.
- Let's go!

2290
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:21,715
(After enjoying their happiness at passing, )

2291
01:37:21,739 --> 01:37:23,486
(the six teams return to the Team Trials room.)

2292
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,885
(They look at which dancers are on the other teams.)

2293
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:25,979
(Looking around)

2294
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:28,909
The girl born in 2008 from JustJerk was chosen.

2295
01:37:29,319 --> 01:37:31,119
And three people made it from Nataraja V.

2296
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:33,350
A lot of hip hop dancers made it.

2297
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,220
Everyone here is outstanding.

2298
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:38,590
Now the Team Trials for Street Dance Girls Fighter 2...

2299
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:40,590
have concluded.

2300
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:43,099
Congratulations to the 42 dancers...

2301
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,158
who have survived the Team Trials.

2302
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:47,269
- Congratulations.
- You worked so hard.

2303
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,799
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2304
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,880
(Hoping only good things are waiting for them ahead)

2305
01:37:51,069 --> 01:37:53,369
The real competition begins now.

2306
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:56,210
- So this is it.
- It's starting again.

2307
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:57,538
Your first mission...

2308
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,116
(The first mission to be completed in their new teams)

2309
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,409
will now be revealed.

2310
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:02,879
Oh, my gosh.

2311
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,148
Please!

2312
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:05,949
They just survived today.

2313
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:07,550
Hold my hand.

2314
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,789
The first mission is...

2315
01:38:09,689 --> 01:38:10,936
It feels like I'm the one doing the mission.

2316
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,020
(Opening up her ears)

2317
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,289
(What is it?)

2318
01:38:13,659 --> 01:38:16,130
It's a 1 versus 1 Performance Match Up Mission.

2319
01:38:16,699 --> 01:38:17,728
- What?
- What?

2320
01:38:17,729 --> 01:38:19,049
- It's 1-on-1?
- It's 1 versus 1?

2321
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:22,640
This is a joint mission, with two teams in one performance.

2322
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,639
Are we going to be doing it with another team?

2323
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,600
It's similar to the One Team Performance Mission.

2324
01:38:26,739 --> 01:38:28,109
Starting from this mission,

2325
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:30,640
we will begin the global public evaluation.

2326
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:32,409
(The time has come.)

2327
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,079
So we're competing again.

2328
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:36,095
The curtain has risen on the first act of the competition.

2329
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:37,778
Depending on the results of the global public evaluation,

2330
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:40,489
one of the teams will survive and move on to the next round.

2331
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,960
One team will become a candidate for elimination.

2332
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:44,496
One of the teams up for elimination...

2333
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,889
will become the team to be eliminated that week.

2334
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,930
(Eliminated?)

2335
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:49,829
We can't get eliminated no matter what.

2336
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:52,630
- We can do it, right?
- Of course.

2337
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:53,970
(Let's do this.)

2338
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:58,000
Which team will be the first...

2339
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:00,340
to be eliminated from Street Dance Girls Fighter 2?

2340
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:01,969
It won't be us, no matter what.

2341
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,309
A fiery competition among teens...

2342
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,810
passionate about dance.

2343
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:07,949
This is Street Dance...

2344
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:11,779
- Girls Fighter!
- Girls Fighter!

2345
01:39:11,819 --> 01:39:13,919
(To be continued)

2346
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,358
(The first free time with the masters after teaming up)

2347
01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:18,719
(Dancing)

2348
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,858
(And playing soccer)

2349
01:39:19,859 --> 01:39:21,429
(Showing off talents)

2350
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:23,898
(The 6 teams' different free time with the masters)

2351
01:39:23,899 --> 01:39:26,099
(So much for having fun.)

2352
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,599
(The first mission follows right away.)

2353
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,868
We'll give you 24 hours.

2354
01:39:28,869 --> 01:39:30,068
A K-pop song you want.

2355
01:39:30,069 --> 01:39:32,599
(They must make a 90-second K-pop performance.)

2356
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,608
Starting now?

2357
01:39:33,609 --> 01:39:35,210
You'll be going to rehearse, yes.

2358
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:36,839
(The 6 teams begin practicing.)

2359
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,179
(What kinds of performances will they make within 24 hours?)

2360
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,609
(After 24 hours)

2361
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:44,250
(D-day of the self-produced K-pop performances)

2362
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,349
Girls, we're going to dance here.

2363
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,889
When did they prepare those?

2364
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:49,890
They did well with the outfits.

2365
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:50,890
(On guard)

2366
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,419
We should've brought 1MILLION's towels too.

2367
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,929
Maybe we should've worn 1MILLION's t-shirts.

2368
01:39:53,930 --> 01:39:54,930
Team JAM REPUBLIC's outfits are the least unique.

2369
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:56,828
(All teams are seated within the tension.)

2370
01:39:56,829 --> 01:39:59,259
(Where are the masters?)

2371
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,898
- Where are they?
- Aren't they here?

2372
01:40:00,899 --> 01:40:02,869
Where are the masters?

2373
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,100
(The masters are gathered in the studio next door.)

2374
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:05,868
(Why are they gathered in secret?)

2375
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:07,510
- Is it going in real time?
- Why?

2376
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,640
(Do we just watch them today?)

2377
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:10,639
(The dancers will be evaluating among themselves.)

2378
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,379
It'll be an honest one then.

2379
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,978
That will show how they really see each other.

2380
01:40:14,979 --> 01:40:16,948
(Who will place 1st and 6th?)

2381
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:18,679
I hope my team doesn't place last.

2382
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,589
(The masters are all excited.)

2383
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:21,649
How cute.

2384
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:22,890
I love it.

2385
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,720
This is going to be fun.

2386
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:27,959
(The mid-term mission finally begins.)

2387
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,129
(K-pop Choreography Self-production)

2388
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:32,828
(They're so good.)

2389
01:40:32,829 --> 01:40:33,829
The two of them are real weapons.

2390
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:34,929
(The flashy performance of Team Jam Republic)

2391
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:36,799
(Team 1MILLION's performance follows.)

2392
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,869
They're good.

2393
01:40:39,939 --> 01:40:40,939
(But they keep making mistakes.)

2394
01:40:40,939 --> 01:40:41,939
(Pull yourselves together.)

2395
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,038
I couldn't say their dance was high quality.

2396
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:45,478
(It reminded me a lot of the original choreography.)

2397
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:47,479
(Ga Young of BEBE loses balance while performing.)

2398
01:40:47,649 --> 01:40:49,449
(Bada is shocked to watch their performance.)

2399
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:52,079
It's like a talent show...

2400
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,619
of middle schoolers.

2401
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:57,389
I don't think it was so harmonious.

2402
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:58,889
(Team MANNEQUEEN didn't go well with the genre?)

2403
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,890
(Chae Hyung stands still.)

2404
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,890
(Watching carefully)

2405
01:41:00,891 --> 01:41:02,259
It'll be hopeless if we don't place first.

2406
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:05,198
(Why does Aiki get worked up?)

2407
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,769
- She's making a lot of mistakes.
- She messed it all up just now.

2408
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,770
(Serious)

2409
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,038
(They keep making mistakes on stage.)

2410
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:12,868
(Harsh reviews flood in after each performance.)

2411
01:41:12,869 --> 01:41:16,339
You didn't show what you prepared properly.

2412
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:19,408
(So I have no weaknesses to say.)

2413
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:20,409
(How sharp.)

2414
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,409
(They got torn apart.)

2415
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:22,919
I feel so regretful.

2416
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,119
(What will be the shocking result of the self-evaluation?)
