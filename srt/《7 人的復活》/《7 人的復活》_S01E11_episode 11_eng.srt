2
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,360
   

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,200
   
 Hannah! 

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,070
 Noh Hannah! 

5
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,110
 - Hannah! 
 - Where are you? 

6
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,330
 Hannah! 

7
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,620
 - Hannah! 
 - Hannah! 

8
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,130
 - Hannah! 
 - Hannah! 

9
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,900
 Excuse me. Have you seen a seven-year-old girl around here? 

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,040
 She's about this tall and looks very cute. 

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,610
 Oh, I saw her. Her name is... 

12
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,410
 Hannah. Right? 

13
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:24,650

 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,440
 Why are you hiding, Ms. Go? 

15
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,110
 Not my kids. 

16
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,140
 Don't hurt my kids. 

17
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
 I was also a kid back then. 

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,460
 But why did you hate me so much? 

19
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,480
 I'm sorry. 

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,380
 I'm sorry. 

21
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,710
 I was wrong. 

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Myeong Ji. Myeong Ji!

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,230
What about Hannah?

24
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,420
Did Hannah make it?

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,720
She made it. Don't worry.

26
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,400
Take down Matthew first.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,140
Expose my crimes if you have to.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,420
It's not the time to say that. You need to survive first.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,640
I realized it the moment I was shot.

30
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,950
The reason why...

31
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,980
Geum Ra Hee chose to do that.

32
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't want to do this anymore.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,280
I want to ask...

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,190
Da Mi for her forgiveness.

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,500
Sincerely.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,410
I think this is it for me.

37
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,040
Quit the nonsense. I won't let you die like this.

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,000
Think of Erica and Phillip.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,230
I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,800
I don't want to lose any more people I cherish.

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,450
Myeong Ji.

42
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,190
Myeong Ji. Myeong Ji!

43
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,600
Go Myeong Ji...

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,400
You risked your life for Hannah, who's not even your own child?

45
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,450
Please bring Erica and Phillip to the hospital quickly.

46
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,430
Leave it to me. I'm the expert on kids.

47
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,410
Han Mo Ne, check how Hannah's doing.

48
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,040
Kyeong Soo should have her right now.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,460
Yes. I'll contact him.

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,130
 KI Tak, please find out what Hwang Chan Seong is up to. 

51
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,910
I'll escort them to the hospital and head to the police station.

52
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,290
I'll tell Detective Oh Sang Sik of Gangnam Police Station.

53
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,530
He doesn't accept any kind of bribery. You can trust him.

54
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,190
 I got it. 

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,230
 This is Gangnam Police Station. 

56
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,970
There was an attempted murder.

57
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,500
The former Seoul mayor's wife just got shot.

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,670
The shooter is Matthew Lee, CEO of TikiTaka.

59
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,110
   

60
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,990
One moment.

61
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,770
I trust you'll come back safely.

62
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,030
I won't go anywhere and wait here.

63
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,240
So hang in there.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,090
Please wait here, sir.

65
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,600
   

66
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,790
 I still have so many things I couldn't tell you. 

67
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,530
 So please... 

68
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,330
 Please give me just one chance, Myeong Ji. 

69
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,430
What? Those bastards took Go Myeong Ji?

70
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,860
What about Noh Hannah?

71
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,330
Did you really lose Noh Hannah?

72
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,400
 I apologize. 

73
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,440
You!

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
What use is your apology?

75
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,400
I'm sure they already told the police.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,070
You go hide somewhere absolutely no one knows.

77
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,590
Don't even breathe and lay low!

78
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,670
Luca, delete all recent CCTV records of both indoors and nearby streets!

79
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,200
Delete my call records with Go Myeong Ji, too. Hurry!

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,970
 Yes, Chairman. 

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,410
Min Do Hyeok, no matter what you do,

82
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,310
you'll never link me to Go Myeong Ji.

83
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,330
   

84
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,210
 Chairman Matthew, this is Detective Oh Sang Sik from Gangnam Police Station. 

85
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,570
 We got a report of a gunshot at your house. 

86
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,340
What should we do?

87
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,190
They're moving this quickly?

88
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,930
 Are you home? 

89
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,230
Unless they bring a search warrant,

90
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,440
those bastards can't set foot inside my house.

91
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,830
 Are you home? 

92
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,330
   

93
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,990
   

94
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,050
 I found the bullet. 

95
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,070
Removing it right away. Be prepared for the bleeding.

96
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,730
Yes.

97
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,370
- Hand it to the police. 
 - Yes.

98
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,880
Doctor, there's bleeding.

99
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,830
- Her BP is falling! 
 - Get her BP under control, please.

100
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,970
We were giving blood from the start, but it'll take time for more to arrive.

101
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,130
- Hurry up and start giving her the plates first! 
 - Yes.

102
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,460
How did it go? Is she still in there?

103
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,760
Mom!

104
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,280
Mom, don't die!

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,240
My mom won't die. Right?

106
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,470
My mom's alive. Right?

107
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,470
The surgery will end soon. Right?

108
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,390
Mom won't die.

109
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,920
Nothing's going to happen. I promise.

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,670
Come here.

111
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,550
You're Go Myeong Ji's guardian, right?

112
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,410
Yes. What's the matter?

113
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,300
We're lacking blood, so I'm making an urgent request.

114
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,830
We had many surgeries yesterday and today.

115
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,410
What's Go Myeong Ji's blood type? I'm type O.

116
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,370
I don't have clotting or hemolysis.

117
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,100
You have anemia. I'll give two people's worth.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,110
She's type B, and I'm the same type. Take as much as you need.

119
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,210
- Come this way. Hurry up. 
 - Hold on!

120
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,790
Could you give

121
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,060
this to my mom, please?

122
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,120
She might listen if it's my voice.

123
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,050
So, can you play this for her?

124
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,300
 Mom! 

125
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,960
 This is Erica. 

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,400
 Mom, 

127
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,510
 I'm sorry for everything. 

128
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,010
 You're all I really need. 

129
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,960
 I'm sorry for complaining and giving you a hard time for not having a dad. 

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,090
 I was really happy because you were my mom. 

131
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,240
 We'll be 

132
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
 the ones to protect you now. 

133
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,560
 I'll wait for you, Mom. 

134
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,230
 I'll also wait for you and not cry. 

135
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,710
 Hang in there, Mom. I love you. 

136
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,760
How did it go?

137
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,530
Chairman Matthew isn't home, and

138
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,490
the nearby CCTVs have been out of order for a week now.

139
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,800
He must've erased everything on purpose.

140
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,910
The car at the scene also turned out to be a stolen car.

141
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,070
Unless there's substantial proof Chairman Matthew harmed Go Myeong Ji—

142
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,760
This is the proof.

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,020
It's the witness's black box footage.

144
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,470
His name is Baek Ik Ho. If you look,

145
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,600
you'll quickly realize he's Matthew's henchman.

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,140
- Detective Jeong. 
 - Yes.

147
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,630
Look into Baek Ik Ho and request a warrant for Matthew Lee if there's any connection.

148
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,380
Yes, I got it. Let's go!

149
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,940
 You won't get away with this one. 

150
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,500
Chairman, do you admit to attempting to kill the mayor's wife?

151
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,820
What is your relationship with the mayor's wife?

152
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,290
 Chairman! Chairman! 

153
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,860
Block all articles.

154
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,870
If even a sentence is released, you're out, Attorney Kim.

155
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,430
I'll take care of them for sure.

156
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,670
Hyung, are you ready?

157
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,710
Take down Hwang Chan Seong, too.

158
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,680
I got it.

159
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,010
Let's begin.

160
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,030
Okay.

161
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,310
   

162
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,410
   

163
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,590
   

164
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,850
   

165
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,130
   

166
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,070
   

167
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,480
   

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,410
 [Mo Ne, why did you marry him...} 

169
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,460
What happened?

170
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,250
She passed out on the way home.

171
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,850
The gunshot must've startled her.

172
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,740
Any other symptoms?

173
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,490
She has malnutrition.

174
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,800
It looks like she starved for days.

175
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,980
But is she really my niece?

176
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,600
How am I the only one who didn't know? Did Mom know about this, too?

177
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,840
Be quiet. She's sleeping.

178
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,250
 Hannah, I missed you so much. 

179
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,150
 Open your eyes now and look at Grandma. 

180
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,740
 I've been waiting for you. 

181
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,270
Don't try to feign ignorance!

182
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,770
We also found gunpowder in your hands.

183
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,480
You shot Go Myeong Ji and...

184
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,310
told these people to get rid of her. Right?

185
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,560
I'd like to remain silent.

186
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,380
Please talk to my attorney.

187
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,940
Are you suspecting our chairman because of a mere video like this?

188
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,030
Present clear proof that he's connected to the chairman.

189
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,870
Baek Ik Ho.

190
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,160
There's more than enough evidence that this man is doing Chairman's dirty work.

191
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,190
He's wanted right now, so it's a matter of time until he's caught.

192
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,670
Detective Jeong, how did it go?

193
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,150
None of the CCTVs have footage of Go Myeong Ji.

194
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,350
What about the luminol test?

195
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,880
There's no reaction on fingerprints or blood, either.

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,730
Okay. Let me know as soon as you find something.

197
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,150
Why? There's no proof?

198
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,960
There's no way you'd get anything. Nothing happened in my house.

199
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
Please stop now, Detective.

200
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,810
I won't make an issue out of this one.

201
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,820
Let us leave, Chairman.

202
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,750
Sit back down, Lee Hwi So.

203
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,350
The interrogation is not over yet.

204
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,480
If they didn't find any fingerprints at all,

205
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,980
it means you cleaned the entire house with chemicals.

206
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,780
What were you trying to erase?

207
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,000
Was it Go Myeong Ji's blood?

208
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,340
Contact Hwang Chan Seong right now.

209
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,040
He'll do anything to help me since the merger is completed.

210
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,230
I don't think that's going to happen.

211
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,200
Hwang Chan Seong!

212
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,010
What are you doing here?

213
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,610
Why do you care?

214
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,400
Hwang Chan Seong will be interrogated for domestic violence, too.

215
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,850
I don't think there will be anyone who can help you, Chairman.

216
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,080
Please come to the interrogation room.

217
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,040
What a fucking moron.

218
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,430
You're all I ever thought about.

219
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,950
It must've been so hard to endure that scary place.

220
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,850
I imagined meeting you every night, Grandma.

221
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,430
That's how I was able to endure.

222
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,930
Ahjumma, what about Ms. Myeong Ji?

223
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,480
Ahjumma saved me!

224
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,110
That Chairman uncle hurt Ahjumma. Right?

225
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,760
Because I'm his daughter.

226
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,050
My mom and Ms. Myeong Ji...

227
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,190
both became miserable because of me.

228
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,860
 Calm down, Hannah. 

229
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,940
 I'm not going anywhere. 

230
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,670
 I'll be right by your side, my baby. 

231
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,420
Grandma! What do I do?

232
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,760
I feel so bad for Ms. Myeong Ji.

233
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,760
Mom.

234
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,420
I've lived...

235
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,290
my life all wrong all this time.

236
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,210
 It's my fault. 

237
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,710
 The family was a burden to you. 

238
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm getting punished.

239
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,570
For what I did to Da Mi.

240
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,840
I want to put everything back,

241
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,680
but there's no way to go back.

242
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,030
 No, you already know what to do to be forgiven. 

243
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,920
 You have to stop now, for Hannah's sake. You have to go back. 

244
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,020
 I'm so thankful right now. 

245
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,700
 There are so many people who are protecting Hannah. 

246
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,140
 She's so blessed. 

247
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,600
What do you mean she's blessed?

248
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,800
With a dad who's dying to kill her

249
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,540
and a trashy mom like me?

250
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,060
 It's the first time you called yourself her mom. 

251
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,950
 It's the first time you called yourself her mom. 

252
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,990
 Only mom knew. 

253
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,070
 I know that you're already Hannah's mom. 

254
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,220
Why did I live so wrong?

255
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,290
When did I become like this?

256
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,610
Why did I become this monster?

257
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
How did the surgery go?

258
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,540
   

259
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,510
My wife is okay, right? She's fine, right?

260
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,200
We had a problem because of a cardiac arrest,

261
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,040
but the patient hung in there, and the surgery ended successfully.

262
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,710
Thank you. Thank you so much.

263
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,290
However, the bullet wound was right next to her heart.

264
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,090
I can't guarantee what will happen from here.

265
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,300
She could get sepsis right now.

266
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,970
She might need a heart transplant.

267
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,990
For now, we can only keep our eye on her condition.

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,350
If breaking that hand will cure Go Myeong Ji, I won't stop you.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,940
Protect Go Myeong Ji and the kids

270
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,280
with that desperation.

271
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,350
How is Go Myeong Ji?

272
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,690
They can't guarantee when she'll wake up.

273
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,300
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

274
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,540
It'd be game over if she just woke up and testified.

275
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,360
We've got 40 hours until K leaves the lockup.

276
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,980
We must get Baek Ik Ho and his men before then somehow.

277
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,210
How can we catch him when even the police couldn't?

278
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,610
I'll reveal it.

279
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,930
That I gave birth to K's child, and that Matthew is K.

280
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,930
I should've revealed it seven years ago.

281
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,770
Had I done so, we wouldn't have ended up here.

282
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,920
Let's do it together, then.

283
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I'll also reveal it.

284
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,340
That I'm Seongchan Group's son.

285
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,640
Let's use everything we can to prove K. Whatever that may be.

286
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,790
What the heck! I'll also come out.

287
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,230
I can't live like this.

288
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,630
I'll deal with my past deeds, and I'll clean up the mess I made.

289
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,730
I may not look it, but I'm the police of Korea. Top of the class at that.

290
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,620
Okay! Count me in.

291
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,210
Let's do whatever we can while Matthew's locked up.

292
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,030
Even Go Myeong Ji, who only cares about her kids, risked her life for someone else's kid.

293
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,580
We can do anything.

294
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,600
   

295
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,340
 Geum Ra Hee, this is the seed you sowed. 

296
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,930
 Watch and see how we 

297
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,080
 take down K. 

298
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,540
For the next 40 hours,

299
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,440
let's each think of a way to take down K.

300
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,720
Ki Tak, please find a place to host a press conference.

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,070
Yes. Anything else?

302
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,740
We have to let the world know what happened to Go Myeong Ji.

303
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,770
None of the reporters are writing about her.

304
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,180
It means Matthew's power has reached that deep into our society.

305
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,380
We can write the articles ourselves.

306
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,240
   
   

307
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,220
   

308
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,080
   

309
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,230
   

310
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,840
 S Talk has revealed the alleged shooter of Seoul Mayor's wife. 

311
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,870
 The suspect S Talk identified was CEO Matthew Lee of TikiTaka. 

312
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,180
 It was confirmed he's currently under investigation 

313
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,240
 by the police following an emergency arrest. 

314
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,380
 Chairman Matthew Lee and the victim, Ms. Go, don't have any known connections. 

315
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,300
 But Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo and Chairman Matthew Lee 

316
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,010
 were suspected to be colluding in the past. 

317
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,360
 Everyone decided to give their all to catch K. 

318
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,150
 We will support you from the back, 

319
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,900
 so do anything you can, Yang Jin Mo. 

320
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
You'll hang in there. Right?

321
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,330
You win the fight against yourself.

322
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,110
I'll win my fight.

323
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,210
Let's get this war over with

324
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,970
and go back to our kids.

325
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,200
Please let me keep the first promise..

326
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,450
I made as a dad.

327
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,550
Bring me the list of owners of Gagok District!

328
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,160
We'll root out this rotten scheme even if we have to work all night.

329
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,150
Search for those who only lent their names here.

330
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,770
Tell them whoever tells the truth will be treated with mercy.

331
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,400
So, who are you saying is the actual owner?

332
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,300
There is only one person who owns this land.

333
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,210
Matthew Lee.

334
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,290
   
   

335
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,390
I wondered when you'd ask.

336
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,600
You really took your sweet time, my nephew.

337
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,450
Can I borrow Seongchan's power to take down K?

338
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,790
Borrow?

339
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,770
What are you going to borrow?

340
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,150
All of this belongs to you.

341
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,910
I tried to sell off Seongchan and flee overseas.

342
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,370
I beg of you.

343
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,240
Please make sure to catch that ruffian, Shim Joon Seok.

344
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,220
I can't stand to watch that ungrateful bastard have his way

345
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,890
when he killed his mom and dad, who raised him!

346
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,290
What do you need? Use everything you can.

347
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,810
The chairman's position?

348
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,620
You can have that, too.

349
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,640
Oh, right.

350
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,430
You don't know what that lunatic would do to Go Myeong Ji.

351
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,330
Let's double up the security at the hospital first.

352
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,080
Hold on. What else could I do?

353
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,810
Thank you.

354
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,710
How awkward.

355
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,700
Is it so hard to call me aunt?

356
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,380
Only if my brother and his wife could see you now.

357
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,200
I won't run away anymore.

358
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,180
I'll accept that Seongchan is my root...

359
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,790
Aunt.

360
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,750
I found where Baek Ik Ho is.

361
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,010
- Hurry up and go. 
 - I'll be back.

362
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,020
There's no time.

363
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,560
My man.

364
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,900
He's so cool.

365
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,840
Where's this bastard? We don't know what he might do.

366
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,920
We have to find him!

367
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,330
   

368
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,200
It's about time I got out of here.

369
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,020
Korea is a total mess without me.

370
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,610
Please just give the order.

371
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,670
You have to clean up the mess you made.

372
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,490
   

373
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,730
Write down the amount you want.

374
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,800
I'll take care of your family for life.

375
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,770
So, show me your loyalty has been a sincere one

376
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,640
all this time.

377
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,380
 Please let me go! 

378
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,020
 Please help. 

379
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,950
Do Hyeok.

380
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,820
Do Hyeok!

381
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,060
 Please spare my life! 

382
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,280
Why are you doing this to me?

383
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,840
The reason you need to die is

384
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,860
because you've got a terrible name.

385
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,480
   

386
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,800
Drop your gun, or we'll open fire!

387
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,670
 I'll take the fault for all crimes. 

388
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,140
 Could it have been on purpose? 

389
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,450
You'll continue to remain silent, huh?

390
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,070
Let's go back to square one.

391
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,850
You shot Go Myeong Ji in your house. Right?

392
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,910
Why did you do that?

393
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,790
You're an attempted murderer right now,

394
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,170
but you'll be a murderer if Go Myeong Ji doesn't wake up!

395
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,820
If this is how you want to play it, I'll have to release this video.

396
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,030
The video of Baek Ik Ho's men dragging away Go Myeong Ji.

397
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,970
What's this?

398
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,960
Where did it go?

399
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,910
Detective Oh!

400
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,630
Baek Ik Ho was arrested just now.

401
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,010
   

402
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,490
 What should I tell Baek Ik Ho? 

403
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,270
Tell him to take a break in the prison for a while.

404
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,340
And that I'll pay him back for today in time.

405
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,980
Shit. The black box evidence that was here disappeared!

406
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,150
Min Do Hyeok!

407
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,340
There was a gunshot at Gangnam Station just now.

408
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,200
Baek Ik Ho is the culprit, and he was arrested at the scene.

409
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Baek Ik Ho?

410
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,660
I'm sure Matthew plotted this.

411
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,120
He ordered this murder to prove his innocence.

412
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,820
No way.

413
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,640
This can't be.

414
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,170
What happened?

415
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,890
You fired a gun?

416
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,740
Yes. I also shot the Seoul mayor's wife.

417
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,310
You're not the culprit, though!

418
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,990
Why would you hurt Go Myeong Ji? What do you gain by this?

419
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,600
Because Mayor Yang ruined my plan.

420
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,140
I went all-in to make some money with Gagok District,

421
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,650
but I lost it all because he changed his mind.

422
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,980
At least, I could take it out on his wife, don't you think?

423
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,860
But why would you shoot an innocent person? Why?

424
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,750
Because her name was Go Myeong Ji, too.

425
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,570
I was going to kill all Go Myeong Jis in this world.

426
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,120
What a terrible name it is. Go Myeong Ji.

427
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,210
Stop lying.

428
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,540
Chairman, I'm so sorry!

429
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,380
You crazy son of a bitch! You're not the culprit.

430
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,740
- You're not the culprit! 
 - Detective Oh! You need to calm down.

431
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,250
Detective, this gun was found at the scene.

432
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,760
For now, I'll hand over the gun to the NFS.

433
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,630
Take him away.

434
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,170
What did you say?

435
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,940
The landowners of Gagok District seem to have assembled themselves and claim that the land is theirs.

436
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,350
Rather, they'll sue you and Seoul city for a large amount of compensation for causing property speculation.

437
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,730
They're lying.

438
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,070
They've all been bought out by Matthew.

439
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,380
Mayor Yang.

440
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,620
They caught the culprit who shot your wife.

441
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,370
What?

442
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,250
 The culprit responsible for shooting the Seoul Mayor's wife was arrested. 

443
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,720
 The criminal confessed to committing a series of crimes because he was enraged  

444
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,920
 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government's announcement that the Gagok district would not be developed. 

445
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,000
 As the bullet found at the Gangnam Station incident site  

446
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,340
 was found to be the same as the bullet used against Seoul Mayor's wife Go Myeong Ji— 

447
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,910
It's as we expected.

448
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,100
Baek Ik Ho took the blame instead of K.

449
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,730
This puts Matthew at a huge advantage.

450
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,970
He won't be released right away, right? Baek Ik Ho works for Matthew.

451
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,220
He'll be released soon since the culprit was caught.

452
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,510
They'll release the culprit they already captured?

453
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,110
How can they do that?

454
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,230
Matthew must have a helper inside the police station.

455
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,940
Otherwise, how can he pull this off behind bars?

456
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,300
Matthew has been released.

457
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,420
He went back to his chairman position when he was released.

458
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,640
So soon?

459
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,870
Matthew must be furious.

460
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,940
What's going to happen to us now?

461
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,190
There he is! 
    

462
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,270
Chairman, how does it feel to be cornered as a murder suspect again?

463
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,710
It's devastating.

464
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,630
Go Myeong Ji, the victim, was Da Mi's homeroom teacher and

465
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,670
one of the people who sincerely mourned for Da Mi's death.

466
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,330
How could I do such a terrible thing to a person like her?

467
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,530
What will you do to Min Do Hyeok of S Talk, who spread fake news?

468
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,530
How did your relationship with him go sour?

469
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,430
I'm sure...

470
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,500
only Min Do Hyeok would know the reason.

471
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,780
 I'm warning Seongchan Group, who's being stubbornly unapologetic. 

472
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,760
 I, Lee Hwi So, will seek legal consequences to the end 

473
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,480
 as Da Mi's dad and TikiTaka's leader. 

474
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,940
What a load of bullshit.

475
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,390
That fucking lunatic is playing politics again!

476
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,600
He's just a criminal.

477
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,010
Our stock price will take a dive again.

478
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,440
Why would our stock price fall?

479
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,900
I'll use everything I own to get rid of that asshole.

480
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,480
Tell him to be prepared.

481
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,530
I'll show him what the Shim Family's anger is like with no mercy.

482
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,240
Thankful, right?

483
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,500
If I didn't bribe Detective Jeong,

484
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,380
you'd be heading to prison for sure.

485
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,330
It was also my idea to stream it live on the display board at Gangnam Station.

486
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,530
Brag all you want.

487
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,330
I'll hear you out just for today.

488
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,230
I only want two things.

489
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,600
Luca...

490
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,790
and Min Do Hyeok.

491
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,310
I'll kill that bastard with my own hands for sure.

492
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,380
As long as you don't betray me,

493
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,630
I'll gladly let you.

494
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,930
However, don't forget.

495
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,410
You're still accused of domestic violence.

496
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,681
Let's move up the press conference.

497
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,951
Didn't you hear? Matthew was released.

498
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,901
He'll stop the press conference any way he can.

499
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,441
Are you saying you'll give up?

500
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,201
Are you afraid to tell the truth?

501
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:07,181
The truth? What's the truth—

502
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:10,781
Oh, how I falsely said Bang Da Mi was pregnant?

503
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:13,511
How this man locked up Lee Hwi So by drugging him?

504
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,611
Include how I spread false news through Joo Hong Letters.

505
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:20,701
I'm already prepared to reveal everything.

506
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:33,131
I'll reveal how Min Do Hyeok is Chairman Shim Yong's biological son.

507
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,121
We've already finished the DNA testing.

508
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,261
How did you know to come here?

509
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:40,001
How can I be absent?

510
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:43,651
K, that bastard is turning me into a crazy bitch ever so sincerely.

511
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:48,641
I have to go all-out crazy to meet his expectations.

512
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,801
Don't forget.

513
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:54,381
Do Hyeok, you're Chairman Shim Yong of Seongchan's biological son.

514
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,881
Matthew, that bastard, is a fake.

515
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,151
Stop! Stop. Hold on.

516
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,261
Honey, I don't think this will work.

517
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,081
- We'll have to use that method. 
 - What?

518
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:07,251
He snuck into the police station last night and collected Matthew's hair.

519
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:10,251
With that, we can still prove that Matthew is Hannah's birth father

520
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,201
without revealing our crimes!

521
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:16,141
That means it'll naturally be revealed that he's a fake Lee Hwi So.

522
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:19,991
Cha Joo Ran, don't bring Hannah into this.

523
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:23,441
Are you trying to put a label on that young girl as serial killer K's daughter?

524
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:27,081
Is that the issue now? We're all about to die at this rate.

525
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:30,251
If anyone is to die, that should be Matthew...

526
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:32,001
and Mo Ne.

527
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,641
All of this started because of you two.

528
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:36,341
Am I wrong, Han Mo Ne?

529
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,191
Honey!

530
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,861
I don't care what happens to me.

531
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,681
Stay out of it. I'll do it alone.

532
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,081
Didn't you all join this cause to atone for your sins?

533
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:53,281
Shut your mouth if you're indebted to Lee Hwi So.

534
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,361
Yang Jin Mo, are you okay with losing your mayor position?

535
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:01,681
It took so much for you to get here. Yet, you'd throw it away yourself?

536
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:04,851
There's no higher place or things I want.

537
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,681
What's there to hesitate?

538
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:09,541
We've got nothing to lose now!

539
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:18,591
We killed people!

540
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,581
Did you forget?

541
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:24,241
Did you forget that horrible incident in Jeju?

542
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,181
Matthew has the footage of that incident.

543
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:38,321
The moment we tell the truth,

544
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:40,691
he'll blow all of our covers.

545
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:50,151
I know you're angry because of Go Myeong Ji. I also got carried away.

546
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,651
But think realistically.

547
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:55,351
At this rate, we'll all end up behind bars.

548
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:58,891
Do you want to make the twins end up orphans like you?

549
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:00,851
So what?

550
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:06,981
Will you just watch K unleash his evil deeds?

551
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,281
You can say that crap because you've got nothing to lose!

552
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,871
Rather, you're the one who made K into Lee Hwi So.

553
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:18,631
If you validated him in the first place, it wouldn't have come to this. But...

554
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:21,991
you want us to take responsibility for everything now?

555
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:26,321
What kind of bullshit logic is that?

556
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:29,621
Are you saying all of this ruckus is Vice President Kang's fault?

557
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,161
It's all of your fault!

558
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,401
You were blinded by the gain in front of your eyes.

559
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:38,941
It's your fault for standing on his side, knowing he was a demon!

560
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:49,281
Anyhow, I'd rather die than do this!

561
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:52,481
I don't want Matthew to kill me, either! I don't want to go to prison, either.

562
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:55,181
So, you guys do it if you want to.

563
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:56,681
I'm staying out of this.

564
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,591
Honey. Honey!

565
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,661
Hey, Cha Joo Ran!

566
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:11,181
I'm with Joo Ran.

567
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:13,891
Sorry.

568
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,281
What are you going to do now?

569
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,381
Nothing's changed.

570
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:29,881
We need to set things straight before it's too late.

571
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:33,481
I agree with you.

572
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:36,591
Hwang Chan Seong must be out, too. He's done with the police investigation.

573
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,951
It's highly likely he joined forces with K.

574
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:42,341
I'm not afraid of Hwang Chan Seong anymore.

575
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:45,771
I'll think about how to live as humanely as possible,

576
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:47,951
even if only for a day.

577
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:51,701
   

578
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:55,871
- It's so delicious. 
 - Yes.

579
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:59,721
I strangely craved octopus and boiled pork every night these days.

580
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:01,451
I have such an appetite.

581
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:03,581
Is it that good?

582
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:07,351
You're stressed, right?

583
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:10,001
You tend to eat away your stress.

584
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:15,491
I'm sure you must be bothered about refusing those people.

585
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,821
What do you mean?

586
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:19,571
The pangs of conscience?

587
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:23,281
It's way better than going to prison.

588
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,041
I have a lot on my mind. Go if you'll spout nonsense.

589
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,541
I'll finish this alone.

590
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,351
Let's eat.

591
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,091
It's delicious.

592
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:34,951
Honey—

593
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:41,081
Why are you crying?

594
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,011
I'm scared.

595
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,771
Of what?

596
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:03,131
That I have to admit how much of a bitch I have been.

597
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:08,241
I had lived diligently at one point.

598
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:12,091
I valued life more than money...

599
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,701
and I considered it my mission.

600
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,551
 How can we haggle over life? 

601
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:19,931
 I'll never give up. 

602
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:22,901
 Pull yourself together. Hang in there. 

603
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,121
 Please hang in there. 

604
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:35,241
 My name is Nam Cheol Woo, stationed at Seokang Police Station starting today! 

605
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,751
 I'll become the best policeman! 

606
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,431
 Loyalty! 

607
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,731
How did I end up like this?

608
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,941
How on earth?

609
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,591
Come here.

610
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:00,841
You do as you wish.

611
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:03,661
No one's forcing you.

612
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:16,981
What did you come here for?

613
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:20,971
I'd like to pay Ms. Go Myeong Ji's medical bills in their entirety.

614
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:22,831
What right do you have?

615
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,511
Get out of here!

616
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:27,211
Calm down. Many people are watching you.

617
00:43:27,211 --> 00:43:29,331
It'll only work against you.

618
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:33,241
Please accept the money as it is a show of my sincerity.

619
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:36,171
Da Mi would want that since she was Da Mi's favorite homeroom teacher.

620
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,761
Cut the bullshit.

621
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,031
She hears and feels everything!

622
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:44,731
Stop bothering her when she's already fighting hard, you asshole!

623
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:47,481
Go Myeong Ji!

624
00:43:56,341 --> 00:44:01,801
 Code Blue. Code Blue. Patient Go Myeong Ji in ICU requires CPR. 

625
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:08,121
 Code Blue. Code Blue. Patient Go Myeong Ji in ICU requires CPR. 

626
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:16,081
Reporters, please wish Ms. Go Myeong Ji a swift recovery as well.

627
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:25,451
 I won't have to get my hands dirty since Go Myeong Ji will be gone forever. 

628
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,301
- Charge 100 joules. 
 - Charge 100 joules.

629
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,081
Stand back now.

630
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,511
One, two, three. Shot!

631
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:40,051
- Charge 200 joules. 
 - Charge 200 joules.

632
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:41,811
Stand back.

633
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:05,341
Please contact your family.

634
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:10,231
You'll have to prepare to say farewell.

635
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:27,441
Myeong Ji...

636
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:41,401
Honey, hurry up!

637
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:44,721
I got it! I'm coming!

638
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:47,231
Mom.

639
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:49,401
 Mom. 

640
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:52,611
Mom. Mom.

641
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:56,821
Go Myeong Ji is in a critical state.

642
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,411
What?

643
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:00,321
Is that true?

644
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:03,401
Ms. Myeong Ji won't wake up?

645
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:08,111
I want to see Ms. Myeong Ji.

646
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:10,021
Please let me meet her.

647
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:12,711
   

648
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:20,131
Mom! We're here.

649
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:22,111
C-Can you hear me?

650
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:26,651
Mom! Hang in there. Don't die!

651
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:29,821
Mom, hurry up and wake up!

652
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,651
Let's go home now.

653
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:35,941
I'll listen to you from now on.

654
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:40,871
I'll eat little, and I won't fight with Sister anymore.

655
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,881
I don't even know how to read yet.

656
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:46,871
You have to teach me how!

657
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:50,841
I can't do it by myself!

658
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,631
Kids, come to Daddy.

659
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:21,321
 Ahjumma, if you haven't changed your mind, 

660
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:26,221
 I want to be your daughter. 

661
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:42,981
   

662
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:55,651
We really don't have time.

663
00:47:55,651 --> 00:48:00,311
We have to hold the press conference while Go Myeong Ji is alive.

664
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,861
You two are staying out. Right?

665
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,401
It doesn't matter. Do as you wish.

666
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:13,711
Let's hurry up and get to it.

667
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,861
I'll do it, too.

668
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,751
The press conference.

669
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:23,651
Hannah.

670
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,051
I'm the proof.

671
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:33,921
The proof that he's a really bad person.

672
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:38,331
Because I'm that mister's daughter.

673
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:40,381
Hannah, that's not it.

674
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,371
I know it.

675
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:47,631
The person who did that to Ms. Myeong Ji.

676
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:53,241
 Oh, you didn't put nail polish today. 

677
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,511
 - Hannah! 
 - Those crazy bitches! 

678
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:00,781
 Hannah, hurry! 

679
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,061
 Mom! 

680
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:14,001
 Mom! 

681
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:19,861
I'll say it in front of everyone.

682
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:25,801
So, take me to the press conference, too. Please?

683
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:30,891
You can't stop me this time, Ahjussi.

684
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:34,491
I want to do it for Ahjumma.

685
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:37,691
The bad guy who harmed Ahjumma...

686
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:41,261
I really want to catch him.

687
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:02,301
It's all our fault for leading terrible lives.

688
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:11,421
 N-No, we'll never do that again. 

689
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:14,911
 We swear. Our lives are yours from now on, Chairman. 

690
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,111
 100 million won for each of you. 

691
00:50:32,651 --> 00:50:34,791
 The reason why... 

692
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:38,441
 Geum Ra Hee chose to do that. 

693
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:44,361
 I realized it the moment I was shot. 

694
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:48,771
 I don't want to do this anymore. 

695
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,471
 I want to ask... 

696
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:55,261
 Da Mi for her forgiveness. 

697
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:08,251
Hey, Noh Hannah. Kids shouldn't butt into adults' affairs, peanut.

698
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:11,211
Adults are supposed to take responsibility for these things.

699
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,791
That's what adults do.

700
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:15,041
Don't be silly.

701
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:20,291
Honey, did you change your mind?

702
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:25,281
- This is why I love you! 
 - Geez! Watch the belly.

703
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:29,121
We'll invite the fewest number of executive-level reporters only.

704
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:31,331
The location and time will be undetermined.

705
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:34,861
We'll keep things as spontaneous as possible for security.

706
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:36,971
The only unchanging factor is...

707
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:41,021
that we'll hold the press conference, no matter what.

708
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:43,881
    
 And our sincerity.

709
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:47,951
We must rule out reporters who are friendly toward K and TikiTaka.

710
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:52,231
Also, the reporters who copy Save's articles as they are.

711
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:56,581
   

712
00:51:56,581 --> 00:52:00,081
Be sure to get back up, Go Myeong Ji.

713
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:04,291
I won't let it go if you just die.

714
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:08,611
You'll be standing in front of a camera for the first time in a while.

715
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:12,621
Let's show off that beautiful face of yours.

716
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:14,181
Come this way.

717
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:18,471
Have a seat, Madame.

718
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,421
- Ta-da! 
 - Fine.

719
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:26,131
Good luck comes to those who smile.

720
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:29,321
Let's be optimistic about things.

721
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:32,981
What do you think? Do you think I'll look good on TV?

722
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:34,931
Of course.

723
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:37,191
You have a heart of gold, so—

724
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:40,421
Oh, my eyes! Gosh.

725
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:42,061
Your face absolutely dazzles.

726
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,081
Sparkle, sparkle!

727
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:46,601
 A list of the reporters has been drawn up. 

728
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,981
 Only 10 reporters who's been validated 

729
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:51,681
 may enter the conference room. 
   

730
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:56,381
 You must eat well to face something important. 

731
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:12,441
I haven't had your food in ages.

732
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:14,661
 Eat a lot. 

733
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:20,221
It's strangely quiet.

734
00:53:21,091 --> 00:53:26,721
Go Myeong Ji is dying, but those animals are staying quiet?

735
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:32,351
 You're receiving a video call from CEO Hwang Chan Seong. 

736
00:53:32,351 --> 00:53:34,181
Put him through.

737
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:37,311
What is it? Did you call me to brag again?

738
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,041
 Something's off about the reporters. 

739
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,801
What's so suspicious?

740
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:44,371
 Some reporters meeting with my marketing team left the meeting. 

741
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:47,191
 As if they were contacted by someone. 

742
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,741
 Could it be Yang Jin Mo's side? 

743
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,021
Hold on a second.

744
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:54,251
Luca, find out what Yang Jin Mo is doing right now.

745
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:55,981
 Yes, Chairman. 

746
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:58,761
 He's preparing to host an emergency press conference. 

747
00:53:58,761 --> 00:54:00,121
Where?

748
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:01,531
 Seongchan Group. 

749
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,231
- When? 
  - It can't be confirmed. 

750
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:06,011
 You must stop it. 

751
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:09,801
Luca, send the slaughter video of Jeju-do to Min Do Hyeok, Han Mo Ne,

752
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:12,731
Yang Jin Mo, Cha Joo Ran, and Nam Cheol Woo right now!

753
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:20,841
 If you join my side now, I'll save Go Myeong Ji's life. 

754
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,491
 I can even forgive you for all your past sins. 

755
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:27,151
What?

756
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:28,511
   

757
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:32,481
What? B-Bullshit?

758
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:34,851
Whoa, shit.

759
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,831
Look at those bastards.

760
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,401
   

761
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:48,001
Whoa, it's a workout for sure.

762
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:55,851
   

763
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:58,391
   

764
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:00,661
Man, this little bastard.

765
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:04,671
Honey, Matthew sent a video!

766
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:08,281
Tell him to look for someone else if he's that bored.

767
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:10,491
Who'd ever be afraid of this crap?

768
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:12,181
Right?

769
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:16,171
- It's time. We need to go. 
 - Yes.

770
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:19,641
It's really refreshing!

771
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:23,611
It feels like I've become 10 years younger!

772
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:32,601
   

773
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:38,521
I'll apologize with my actions.

774
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:42,371
Please watch...

775
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:45,881
what I'm about to do, Da Mi.

776
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:53,371
And also, CEO Geum Ra Hee. 
    

777
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,141
Are you sure you won't regret this?

778
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:12,401
Money? Fame?

779
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:15,371
I've had my fair share of those.

780
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:24,271
I'll really be free in just a few hours.

781
00:56:24,271 --> 00:56:26,141
Right?

782
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:33,081
Let's go.

783
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:39,201
   

784
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:50,621
Safe! Whoa, you came right on time!

785
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,381
The press conference is exactly 10 minutes away.

786
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:58,281
Joon Seok, I'm so sorry to tell you this.

787
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,161
Unfortunately, you got the wrong address.

788
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:03,281
The press conference isn't happening here.

789
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:06,881
How does it feel to be played by fake information?

790
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:14,441
   

791
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,301
    
 This way, please.

792
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:25,481
   
   

793
00:57:46,181 --> 00:57:47,511
   

794
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:48,541
   

795
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,541
 [Press conference starting in 00:03 

796
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:50,501
   

797
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,541
   

798
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:52,291
   

799
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:55,731
   

800
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:21,781
We're here today to turn the lie that's been continuing

801
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:26,681
from seven years ago into truth.

802
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,981
To be exact, it started about 30 years ago

803
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:37,481
when Chairman Shim Yong of Seongchan's child was switched at the hospital.

804
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,271
I was that child who was switched,

805
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:44,501
the biological son of Chairman Shim Yong of Seongchan.

806
00:58:48,231 --> 00:58:51,311
 I'll guarantee what he said. 

807
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:58,681
 We've got the DNA testing results here as well. 
   

808
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:01,551
 If you want, I'll let you test me 

809
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:05,491
 as many times as you want until all my blood is drained. 

810
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,381
Why is Mo Ne here?

811
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:13,141
Why are others here?

812
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:18,101
I'll start my actual story now.

813
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,231
Seven years ago,

814
00:59:21,181 --> 00:59:24,481
the person who gave birth at Myeongju Girls' High School...

815
00:59:26,431 --> 00:59:28,421
was me, Han Mo Ne.

816
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:31,501
Bang Da Mi wasn't the one who gave birth?

817
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:36,591
 I became pregnant with Shim Joon Seok's baby at the age of 20 back then. 

818
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:39,991
 But I had to hide giving birth to become a star. 

819
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:43,381
 What do I need to do? 

820
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:45,281
 Meet me at the park behind the school. 

821
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,851
 You can't get caught. 

822
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,881
 Hurry up and go. 

823
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:04,081
The baby's father is K, Shim Joon Seok.

824
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,351
And then,

825
01:00:10,951 --> 01:00:14,681
 I noticed Da Mi, a powerless transfer student. 

826
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:16,521
 You're Bang Da Mi. Right? 

827
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,171
 Do you want to be friends? 

828
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,031
 With me? 

829
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:22,321
 Why would you? 

830
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:27,471
 I came up with a plan to frame Da Mi for everything. 

831
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:31,631
 What happened? 

832
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:34,681
 Did you give birth to this baby? 

833
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:37,381
 Da Mi, what do I do? 

834
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:39,311
 I saw Bang Da Mi giving birth. 

835
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:41,231
 Bang Da Mi giving birth. 

836
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:45,451
My wife, Go Myeong Ji, lied to the school,

837
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:48,261
saying she saw Da Mi give birth.

838
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:50,581
And I produced...

839
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:55,181
fake news about her having a sugar daddy and giving birth as a minor,

840
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:57,781
and made a lot of money.

841
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:06,751
 Hey, I thought of a way to earn a lot of money. 

842
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:08,901
 Fake news. 

843
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:12,411
 Make fake news on an online MyTV broadcast. 

844
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:13,981
 Joo Yong Joo and Hong Man Doo. 

845
01:01:13,981 --> 01:01:17,661
 How about we take your last names and call it Joo Hong Letters? 

846
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:22,941
 It's perfect, Hyungnim! 

847
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:28,011
 We should make it as shocking as possible. Right? 

848
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:32,341
 The first target is a high school girl who gave birth. 

849
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:40,871
   

850
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:44,021
 There are traces of her having given birth. 

851
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:45,621
 What are you saying? 

852
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:47,441
 No, it's not true! 

853
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,861
 Do the test again! Do it again! 

854
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:52,931
 Why is everyone doing this to me! 

855
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:55,561
 To be honest, there's something I haven't told you, Chairman. 

856
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:59,641
 Da Mi had come to visit my hospital recently. 

857
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:02,391
 Here. I even have the chart. 

858
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:06,261
 Damn you! You disgraceful wretch! 

859
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:09,481
I also used my job as a gynecologist and

860
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:15,961
falsely notified Da Mi's grandfather that Da Mi had given birth.

861
01:02:15,961 --> 01:02:20,951
If I had told him the truth,

862
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:24,401
Chairman Bang would've...

863
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:28,721
been on Da Mi's side right away.

864
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:32,921
 You've been through a lot. It was tough, huh? 

865
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:36,191
 Here, drink one of these. 

866
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:45,541
 To turn Lee Hwi So into the culprit, I drugged him. 

867
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:50,341
I was the one who conspired as a senior inspector at Deokseon Police Station.

868
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:53,381
I'm Nam Cheol Woo.

869
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,751
That's how our lies gathered and built up

870
01:02:56,751 --> 01:03:02,541
to shatter a loving family into pieces.

871
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:55,221
Lee Hwi So became Matthew Lee through plastic surgery.

872
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:59,861
However, Matthew Lee isn't Lee Hwi So.

873
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:02,091
Matthew Lee isn't Lee Hwi So?

874
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:04,821
What do you mean?

875
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:09,601
Everything you saw and believed all this time is fake.

876
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:11,761
Then, who is Matthew Lee?

877
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:14,541
Shim Joon Seok.

878
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:16,191
He's K.

879
01:04:16,191 --> 01:04:18,141
- What? 
 - What's he saying?

880
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:19,831
- K... 
 - Does that make sense?

881
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:23,981
Everyone, what he said is true.

882
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:29,481
We also cooperated so Matthew Lee could become a national hero.

883
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:33,261
 We sought after the fame and wealth he offered. 

884
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:38,251
 I endlessly created fake news and fooled everyone. 

885
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:43,731
I was only a lowly thug, but I was able to become the Seoul mayor

886
01:04:43,731 --> 01:04:48,371
all because Shim Joon Seok, K, had sponsored me.

887
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:56,161
Please look at the truth now.

888
01:04:56,161 --> 01:05:00,321
Please look at our faces.

889
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:02,531
We're the real offenders...

890
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:06,881
who looked away from the truth of the Pom Girl incident,

891
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:10,981
consistently lied, and made K, the serial killer,

892
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:13,601
into a national hero.

893
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:23,181
Today, I will retire permanently from the entertainment industry, and

894
01:05:23,181 --> 01:05:26,831
I'll humbly accept any punishment

895
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:29,391
for the crimes I committed.

896
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:49,641
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

897
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,331
   

898
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:12,711
 Humans have always been weak to fake news. 

899
01:06:12,711 --> 01:06:15,391
 Because it's more stimulating and thrilling! 

900
01:06:15,391 --> 01:06:18,051
 It's up. The article on Min Do Hyeok and Han Mo Ne's affair. 

901
01:06:18,051 --> 01:06:20,931
 Surrender now before you lose everything. 

902
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:23,401
 I can give her a heart. 

903
01:06:23,401 --> 01:06:27,271
 Wouldn't you like a chance to swear your loyalty to me? 

904
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:28,781
 Min Do Hyeok is really pissed off. 

905
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,581
 He'll screw you big time soon, so be prepared. 

906
01:06:32,581 --> 01:06:38,011
 Because Shim Joon Seok is a complete idiot.
