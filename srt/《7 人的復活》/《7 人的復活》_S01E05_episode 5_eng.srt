1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,110
   

2
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,430
   

3
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,340
    
 Do you remember this path?

4
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,030
Yes. Why did you want to come here?

5
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,850
So you could take a breather.

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,770
You've been sitting in front of the computer for days now.

7
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,740
You don't even eat or sleep.

8
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,530
What's wrong?

9
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,480
Is it because of Han Mo Ne?

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,090
Because Han Mo Ne's mother passed away?

11
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,280
When I look at Han Mo Ne,

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,550
it always feels like I'm looking at myself.

13
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,250
I really hadn't done anything good for my mom when she was alive.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,370
I always complained,

15
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,090
lashed out at her, stayed outside all day,

16
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,480
and made her worried sick.

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,110
So, I thought about what I had done to make her happy, but...

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,490
there was nothing.

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,890
I just had that thought.

20
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,110
The thought Han Mo Ne would...

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,500
probably be feeling the emotions...

22
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,050
I had felt in the past by now as well and such.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,570
Hannah's grandmother was a good person.

24
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,840
Just like your mother.

25
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,520
Your aunt will finish up talks about S-Talk with Matthew.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,310
Then, a large sum for the contract will be deposited.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,160
And we need to use Lee Hwi So's fingerprints to take it.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,080
When?

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
Today's Han Mo Ne's engagement ceremony, so K won't be home and

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
the guards will also be loosened.

31
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,540
Are you feeling all right today?

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,770
I'm okay.

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,580
That's good.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,690
Congrats, Mo Ne!

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,120
You look so pretty today.

36
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,520
You're a fantastically good-looking couple.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,030
Thank you.

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,560
Thank you for hosting this luxurious engagement ceremony for my daughter, CEO Hwang.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,210
To thank you, I'd like to hold an after-party at my house today.

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,820
You'll attend with Mo Ne. Right?

41
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,610
If that's what Mo Ne wants.

42
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,490
Sure. I'll prepare the wine and food.

43
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,310
Oh, my. He's even taking care of us, too.

44
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,080
CEO Hwang is such a romanticist.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,260
Welcome to the family of TikiTaka, CEO Hwang.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,410
I can now skip the honorifics. Right?

47
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,760
Mo Ne, you're so beautiful today.

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,760
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,200
Did you see Mo Ne's ring?

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,490
- The diamonds... How many carats do you think? 
 - I can tell it's over 10 carats.

51
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,170
That foxy wench.

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,590
If that's her engagement ring, her wedding ring will be out-of-this-world.

53
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,970
Honey! Don't you feel anything after seeing that?

54
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,340
She's a celebrity. I'm sure she got it sponsored by someone.

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,270
Didn't you hear they didn't accept any sponsors?

56
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,920
They said he paid for everything.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,250
Anyhow, those who propose without a ring should all be buried in the sewers.

58
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,130
Hey, Deputy Mayor.

59
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,450
Do fake marriages also come with fake rings?

60
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,820
What the heck are you saying?

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,200
What's wrong with this guy, seriously?

62
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,170
See? We're still better than a show window couple.

63
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,720
Since our love is real, not a fake love, you know?

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,930
Don't you agree, Darling?

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah, right.

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,250
Get away from me! It's hot!

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,010
Since Mo Ne is a celebrity, I'm cautious about everything.

68
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,850
I ask that you write many good articles for us.

69
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,260
Have you proposed to her officially?

70
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,380
Yes, I did.

71
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,010
How about having children?

72
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,300
I think it's a little early for children.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,640
 Han Mo Ne, you've become a conglomerate family's daughter-in-law. 

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,530
 How did you meet CEO Hwang Chan Seong? 

75
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,950
Did you come to meet your sister?

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,360
 TikiTaka and Saver make the ultimate match. CEO Hwang... 

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,450
I was going to call you over once.

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,880
I'd like to make an offer you can't refuse.

79
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,470
Shall we have a talk?

80
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,310
   

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,540
Please enjoy your time.

82
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,330
Isn't this the wine the British Royal Family drinks?

83
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,470
As expected, his class is unmatched.

84
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,730
Whoa, going this far to treat us...

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,700
He's a character I want to befriend so badly!

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,550
You're smiling ear to ear, seriously.

87
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,610
You just love it if it's free.

88
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,320
Hwang Chan Seong doesn't seem as rude as the rumors say.

89
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,880
Seeing how he fell for Mo Ne, doesn't it make him more of a naïve sweetheart?

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,510
This was the only way for Han Mo Ne to survive, so she managed it for her life.

91
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,880
Don't look down on other people's love.

92
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,610
I believe in pure love.

93
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,460
Look at me!

94
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,660
I've only got eyes for you, who's got two kills on you.

95
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,340
I said it's not two kills! Both of them were attempts only.

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,590
Do you want a fact check?

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,880
Just how much is this? We should open it up right now

98
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
if we're to bring the flavor out later.

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,730
Put it back down.

100
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,170
Don't even think about drinking, and go get Lee Hwi So.

101
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,730
You're all well-fed these days, huh?

102
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,060
A corrupt teacher, a corrupt entertainment agency, a corrupt cop, and a corrupt doctor!

103
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,850
Did you forget how much money I spent to get rid of your corruption histories?

104
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,090
If you don't bring me Lee Hwi So, I'll have you all locked up, so prepare yourselves.

105
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,060
What's wrong with the mood on a joyous day like this?

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,950
Welcome, CEO Hwang.

107
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,330
This is more or less Mo Ne's parents' house.

108
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,680
So you can feel at home and drink comfortably.

109
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,350
All right. Attention, everyone.

110
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,870
To congratulate their engagement today, I'll give a toast—

111
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,150
I'm sick of toasts.

112
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,370
I think we've had enough.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
O-Oh, shall we?

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,740
In that case, I'll first introduce our inner circle's members—

115
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,110
Let's have us introduce ourselves.

116
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,060
You're Seoul's State Affairs Deputy Mayor. Right?

117
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,540
Yes. The name's Yang Jin Mo.

118
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm Go Myeong Ji, his wife. We've been married for a year now.

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,980
This is his first marriage, but I had a previous marriage with two kids—

120
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,940
Oh, yes. That's TMI.

121
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,620
You're Children Home's General Manager, right?

122
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,890
O-Oh, yes.

123
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,470
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Joo Ran.

124
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,890
I'm actually a SNU College of Medicine graduate, but I somehow ended up working in AI—

125
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,030
Oh, TMI.

126
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,150
I'm Captain Nam Cheol Woo of Gyeonggi's Special Crimes Unit.

127
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,150
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,160
Mo Ne's glass is empty.

129
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,760
- Mo Ne, are you okay? 
 - CEO Geum!

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,520
Are you okay?

131
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,680
- I'll go get changed. 
 - Okay.

132
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,080
You'll help, CEO Geum. Right?

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,480
Of course!

134
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,320
CEO Hwang, let us take a shot.

135
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,470
All right! Shall we all take a shot?

136
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,060
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

137
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,890
Cheers!

138
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,070
 - Cheers—  
 - I'll wait until Mo Ne comes back.

139
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,200
Sure thing.

140
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,830
Yes.

141
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,650
What do you think you're doing? We've got guests.

142
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,140
Did you think I wouldn't know if you hid them like this?

143
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,710
Quit spying on me and threatening me.

144
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,340
I won't hold back anymore, either.

145
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,480
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,940
Hurry up and get changed first.

147
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,530
I'm trying to show Chan Seong you're watching every single thing I do.

148
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,150
You can't.

149
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,280
It's too late.

150
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,330
 Mo Ne, what's wrong? 

151
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,070
 Mo Ne! 

152
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,190
What happened to your face?

153
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,290
It's nothing.

154
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,520
It's nothing? You mean this isn't the first time...

155
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,270
such violence happened.

156
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,390
CEO Hwang, it's a misunderstanding.

157
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,370
- It wasn't me. It was Mo Ne— 
 - That mouth.

158
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,190
Please shut it.

159
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,090
What are you hiding behind your back?

160
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,330
It's nothing.

161
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,990
I don't think it's nothing, though.

162
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,700
Aren't they cameras and bugs?

163
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,210
Hand them over to me.

164
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,750
 I think I told you to hand them over! 

165
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,910
Explain to me why these things are in Mo Ne's room.

166
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,660
Were you monitoring Mo Ne like this while pretending to be a good mother on the surface?

167
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,150
Did you know, Chairman Matthew?

168
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,650
Did the monitoring take place under your silent permission?

169
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,750
I-I really didn't know.

170
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,470
C-CEO Geum, what's going on here?

171
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,220
You won't even try giving an excuse, huh?

172
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,860
The family of a victim whose rights were violated by Shim Joon Seok

173
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,680
was making a victim out of someone else?

174
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,410
This is really absurd.

175
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,390
If people find out about this fact, what will they think?

176
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,180
CEO Geum, hurry up and apologize.

177
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,750
Mo Ne, I really didn't know.

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,650
You should've told me if something like this was happening.

179
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,430
Not knowing about it is also a crime.

180
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,230
This can't be overlooked since I found out.

181
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,970
Treating my fiancée like this is the same as insulting me.

182
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,920
Mo Ne, let's go.

183
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,850
CEO Hwang!

184
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,950
CEO Hwang!

185
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,390
You monitored Mo Ne even at home?

186
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,960
It's punishment for a traitor.

187
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,570
Whoa, how on earth?

188
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,570
Is she listening in on us, too?

189
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,980
Of course, she is.

190
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,680
CEO Hwang. CEO Hwang!

191
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,980
CEO Hwang! You can't. H-Hold on, let's—

192
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,250
What were you thinking? Why did you install CCTVs in her room?

193
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,840
You told me to monitor Mo Ne.

194
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,600
You shouldn't have been caught, then!

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,840
What are you going to do if Hwang Chan Seong exposes this matter?

196
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,670
What are you going to do if Mo Ne can't bring Save's security program?

197
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,870
That will never happen.

198
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,230
She won't behave that stupidly.

199
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,960
Let me make it clear to you.

200
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,550
Mo Ne is the one who's most useful to me right now, not you.

201
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,250
No matter what happens, bring me Mo Ne.

202
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,140
Otherwise, you'll be the first one to go. Do you understand?

203
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,450
To log in to Luca, we need to enter the secret room.

204
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,610
That's where Luca's main body is.

205
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,750
We need to first find out how to open that door.

206
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,650
Hurry up, Do Hyeok.

207
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,210
 Lee Hwi So. 

208
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,420
 Please help. 

209
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,250
 Yes, Lee Hwi So. 

210
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,440
 Lee Hwi So has logged in. 

211
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,650
This is Luca?

212
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,750
What Yang Jin Mo said was right.

213
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,350
K constructed enough database to turn an angel into a demon.

214
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,250
And Children Home is its peak.

215
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,380
Luca?

216
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,800
Who's operating Luca right now?

217
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,930
    
 Luca. Luca!

218
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,920
Could it be Lee Hwi So?

219
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,750
Luca. Luca!

220
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,750
There's footage of Lee Hwi So.

221
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,210
Park Nan Young's in it, too. Play it.

222
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,950
 Mom, 

223
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,150
 I feel sorry for Medusa. 

224
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,650
 Medusa used to be really pretty. 

225
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,320
 But she was cursed, and her hair turned into snakes. 

226
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,050
 - But still, she scared people and did bad things.  
 - Medusa...

227
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,450
- Da Mi is talking about Medusa. 
  - It's because she was too lonely. 

228
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,400
- What about it? 
  - She hid because she was so shy. 

229
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,450
Luca. Luca!

230
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,450
Show me the home CCTV right now!

231
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,150
Luca!

232
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,530
I've been getting

233
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,760
intel from someone called Medusa.

234
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,650
Their condition was that I don't tell you, Hyung.

235
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,390
We share the same goals. K and Geum Ra Hee's death.

236
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,410
What?

237
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,310
I knew Hannah's location, thanks to Medusa, and

238
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,320
I also knew Yoon Ji Sook was in danger.

239
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,780
How did that person know these things?

240
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,450
I don't know.

241
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,450
I only know they contact me through Save's server.

242
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,320
Save?

243
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,150
Are you saying Medusa and Hwang Chan Seong are linked?

244
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,120
Perhaps it's someone linked to Da Mi.

245
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,850
 Who accessed my CCTV? 

246
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,440
 Is it you, Lee Hwi So? 

247
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,250
Luca, block off Matthew's access. 
    

248
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,950
 Yes, Lee Hwi So. 
   

249
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,350
What the fuck!

250
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,450
I'm going to kill Lee Hwi So!

251
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,950
There's not much time.

252
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,750
K will barge in here soon.

253
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,350
Luca, transfer all information related to Lee Hwi So to my server.

254
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,950
Including Lee Hwi So's fingerprints.

255
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,620
 Yes, Lee Hwi So. 

256
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,460
   

257
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,350
Did I fall asleep?

258
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,050
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,980
You were exhausted from dealing with people today.

260
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,950
You were even talking in your sleep.

261
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,450
Earlier, you said, "Chan Seong, I miss you."

262
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,450
You even know how to joke?

263
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,860
Thank you for accepting my request earlier.

264
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,480
Also, for snapping outrageously.

265
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,850
I was sincerely angry.

266
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,750
I also meant it when I said I can't leave you in that house.

267
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,110
I'll find you a temporary place to stay. Get out of there right away.

268
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,000
It's fine.

269
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,290
I'm sure CEO Geum can't have her way with me now.

270
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,220
Because you've got my back, Chan Seong.

271
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,370
Why do you have to bother living in that house?

272
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,660
Because I need to get my revenge.

273
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,720
For my mom.

274
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,870
Do you want to step outside for a minute?

275
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,950
It's fine now.

276
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,500
M-Mom.

277
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,100
You didn't get to say bye to your mother properly.

278
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,380
I prepared this, praying she'll end up in a better place.

279
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,750
You can be sad all you want.

280
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,940
Mom.

281
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,770
Isn't it cold?

282
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,470
No child of yours is breaking your heart there. Right?

283
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,320
Don't break your heart because of someone like me.

284
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,750
Don't even think of me as your child.

285
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,540
Don't ever forgive me.

286
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,590
By the way, who on earth could Medusa possibly be?

287
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,430
Even in Lee Hwi So's footage earlier, Medusa was mentioned.

288
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,350
That means...

289
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
they remember Da Mi's childhood.

290
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,980
But Lee Hwi So's already dead.

291
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,920
Hyung, in a very unlikely case, what if Park Nan Young is still alive?

292
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,490
No way.

293
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,530
She passed away during the fire six years ago.

294
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,560
I know it makes no sense.

295
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,110
But I want to confirm it.

296
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,210
We couldn't even find her corpse because the entire house burned down.

297
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,520
As long as she's alive, regardless of what shape...

298
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,360
That's absolutely impossible.

299
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,580
We should meet Hwang Chan Seong first.

300
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,360
It might be an important clue that Medusa uses Save's server.

301
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:55,510
It's now time that you show me you're a highly necessary person for me.

302
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,260
Bring me Save's security program right now.

303
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,840
This suddenly?

304
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,130
Haven't I already waited a very long time?

305
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,760
That's a promise. Right?

306
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,060
If I bring the security program, you'll give me Geum Ra Hee's life.

307
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,080
This will kill you in one minute after drinking it.

308
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,270
The cause of death will be processed as a simple heart attack.

309
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,910
Okay?

310
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,390
Leave it to me.

311
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,360
I already secured the security program's password yesterday.

312
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,450
Noona, congrats on getting engaged!

313
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,860
What brings you here?

314
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,350
You didn't hear from CEO Geum?

315
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,710
I'm your road manager starting today.

316
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,550
What?

317
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,830
I found out that CEO Geum and I have one thing in common.

318
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,000
That we both find Han Mo Ne an eyesore.

319
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,100
Do you even know what kind of a person CEO Geum is?

320
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,770
- She's the one who killed our— 
 - I don't care!

321
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,670
I only need to get you.

322
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,110
Let me warn you. Don't ever talk about Mom again.

323
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,130
If you run your mouth one more time,

324
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,850
I'll take it as a sign you want me to kill you.

325
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,970
 Geum Ra Hee, I'll kill you. 

326
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,670
   

327
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,440
 CEO Hwang is in a meeting right now. 

328
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,390
Is he expecting you?

329
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,380
No, it seems he didn't have breakfast. So I brought him a sandwich.

330
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,140
Please don't mind me. You can get back to work.

331
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,880
Outsiders aren't allowed alone in any of Save's inner spaces.

332
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,100
CEO Hwang is meticulous when it comes to security.

333
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,410
Please don't be offended.

334
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,210
I see.

335
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,550
In that case...

336
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,660
I'll get going, so please tell him to enjoy it later.

337
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,270
Will do.

338
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,120
   

339
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,410
Why did the national hero want to see me?

340
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,050
I'll get to the point and ask you.

341
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,270
Have you heard of the name Medusa?

342
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,300
Medusa?

343
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,550
Could it be the witch with snake hair who comes out in Greek mythology?

344
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,780
I was wondering if you contacted me using Medusa as your alias.

345
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,020
I don't know why you're asking me this.

346
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,110
Excuse me.

347
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,920
I sincerely hope...

348
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,350
you're not a bad person with all my heart.

349
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,940
 Medusa, Min Do Hyeok was here. 

350
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,710
 He asked me if I was Medusa. 

351
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,820
 I pretended not to know. 

352
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,130
   

353
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,210
Did you come to meet Hwang Chan Seong?

354
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,850
Is there a reason I should answer you?

355
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,850
Are you okay?

356
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,450
Regarding your mother, I'm—

357
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,510
I didn't ask you because I had high hopes. Don't worry about it.

358
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,520
Don't give me those eyes with pity, either.

359
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,920
I'll be happy going forward as well.

360
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,730
I will live, no matter what.

361
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,910
    
 The day to sell off S-Talk has finally come.

362
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,950
Please review the contract one more time.

363
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,380
I already reviewed it at least 1,000 times.

364
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,890
   

365
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,870
   

366
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,960
What's this?

367
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
Did you add a zero by mistake?

368
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,980
I didn't make any mistakes.

369
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,920
Please read article 3, item 7.

370
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,040
"In cancellation of this contract, the responsible party pays five times the down payment,

371
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,390
which incurs one trillion won for the penalty."

372
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,120
You can't change your mind later. It'll be exactly an even split.

373
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,070
Of course.

374
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,850
This is really all I need to do to get that fake nephew bastard...

375
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,320
   

376
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,790
who killed my brother and brought about

377
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,190
the downfall of Seongchan. Right?

378
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,790
Yes.

379
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,170
Hurry up and dry.

380
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,780
- Manager Jo! 
  - Yes! 

381
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,420
Yes, Chairwoman!

382
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,060
Distribute the press release right now.

383
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,370
We're selling S-Talk to TikiTaka.

384
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,120
Yes!

385
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,070
Now, then. Shall we head to TikiTaka?

386
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,720
What's this?

387
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,080
What's going on here?

388
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,830
   

389
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,770
   

390
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,610
   

391
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,860
What's wrong?

392
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,530
Can't you see? My bank accounts are getting robbed right now!

393
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,350
Lee Hwi So that bastard must've logged in with his fingerprint.

394
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,960
What the fuck!

395
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,250
Ten billion won has been withdrawn already!

396
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,520
What about TikiTaka's business bank account?

397
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,320
   

398
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,910
   

399
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,600
That lunatic is selling off all my stocks!

400
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,150
It's not working. Damn it!

401
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,760
I'll head to your principal bank.

402
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,520
We need to suspend all of our bank accounts.

403
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,320
Damn it!

404
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,170
That crazy bastard!

405
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,730
Chairman, this is bad!

406
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,920
What are you running around for? I'm already about to lose my mind!

407
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,890
Seongchan Group announced they're selling S-Talk to TikiTaka.

408
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,060
What kind of bullshit is that?

409
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,550
I'm still contemplating whether to raise the price or not!

410
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,790
   
   

411
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,600
For the price of 2 trillion won?

412
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,660
What are you people doing here? Get out!

413
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,090
As expected, Chairman Matthew!

414
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,090
You sure are generous.

415
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,090
You're buying a 100 billion won company for 2 trillion won.

416
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,410
Shin Mi Young!

417
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,580
When did I ever sign such a contract?

418
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,530
What are you saying?

419
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:58,840
As you can see, the contract certainly exists. 
    

420
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,410
Do you want to go to jail for the forgery of private documents?

421
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,120
Why would I ever go to jail?

422
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:14,690
Lee Hwi So definitely came to my company and signed the contract.

423
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,990
I guess you've got a lot of money, Chairman Matthew.

424
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,110
The penalty for canceling the contract is one trillion won.

425
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,550
To be paid in cash on the same day!

426
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,720
You're going to rob me using a deep fake voice?

427
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,810
Call the security right now and drag out this crazy woman, and

428
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,010
announce in the media that it is unfounded.

429
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,560
Yes.

430
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,750
What will you tell the media?

431
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,430
Will you deny signing that contract when it even has Lee Hwi So's fingerprint?

432
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,690
Should we have the Financial Supervisory Service appraise it properly?

433
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,930
What did you say?

434
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:53,200
Are you going to say Lee Hwi So's fingerprint is fake,

435
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,610
Joon Seok?

436
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,840
You might've fooled the nation, but you are finished since I found out.

437
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,690
You can't say that contract is fake even if you were to die.

438
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,090
Because that'd be evidence you're fake.

439
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,640
You fucking bastard who killed his parents who raised you.

440
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,130
You fucking thief who took his parents' entire company!

441
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,460
You're fucking crazy!

442
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,380
What do you say? I'm a crazy bitch who takes on crazy assholes!

443
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,110
You handle a crazy dog with a good beating!

444
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,030
Don't you agree, Joon Seok?

445
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,690
If you want to cancel the contract, bring one trillion won.

446
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,850
If you want to keep it, bring two trillion won.

447
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,600
Send the money today if you don't want to take it to court.

448
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,520
Han Mo Ne, there's no more time to waste.

449
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,180
Bring the security program right away. Right now!

450
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,500
It's impossible right now.

451
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,960
Please wait until nighttime.

452
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,670
I'm not in a position to care about your circumstances right now!

453
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,150
Lee Hwi So, Lee Hwi So, Lee Hwi So!

454
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:21,491
   

455
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:38,511
   

456
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,531
   

457
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:50,221
   

458
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:15,501
   

459
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,081
   

460
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:20,431
   

461
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,951
Hello.

462
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,611
 There's an intruder in the server room! 

463
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,791
   

464
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:22,041
- What is it? 
 - I think it's a simple error.

465
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,061
Hurry up and get the power back first.

466
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,181
 Yes! 

467
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:28,171
   

468
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,631
Come out now.

469
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,271
This is what you needed?

470
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:19,301
You told me to use you if necessary. Right?

471
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:23,051
You told me to use you all I want and do as I please.

472
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:27,041
I need Save's security program right now.

473
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:30,721
You should've asked me for it instead of trying to steal it.

474
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,781
   

475
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:52,551
Go now. Take it to Chairman Matthew.

476
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,511
You knew all along?

477
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:59,911
However, you stole this from me, Mo Ne.

478
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,711
Do you understand what I mean?

479
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:07,941
   

480
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:20,101
 Hwang Chan Seong, what kind of a person are you? 

481
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,941
 Luca's system will be booting soon. 

482
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,461
How would you know that?

483
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:32,991
 Before Luca boots, delete Children Home's database first. 

484
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,861
Hold on.

485
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:38,861
Could you be Park Nan Young, Bang Da Mi's adoptive mother?

486
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:42,081
Answer me.

487
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,661
Hello—

488
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,291
Chairman!

489
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:02,251
This is from Han Mo Ne.

490
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:09,261
I knew she'd pull it off.

491
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:17,851
- Luca, log in! 
  - Yes, Chairman. 

492
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,541
Download Save's security program.

493
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,951
 Download is starting. 

494
00:41:22,951 --> 00:41:25,181
 There's a new accessor. 

495
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,051
Who is it?

496
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,181
 It's Lee Hwi So. 

497
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,921
Track his location using his IP address.

498
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,181
 Yes, Chairman. 

499
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:35,481
Start a video call with Geum Ra Hee, Cha Joo Ran, Yang Jin Mo, Go Myeong Ji, and Nam Cheol Woo.

500
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,521
Lee Hwi So showed himself.

501
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,051
Everyone get ready to take down Lee Hwi So.

502
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,881
 Lee Hwi So's location has been identified. 

503
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:44,461
 He's in the Mayor's Office, Seoul City Hall. 

504
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,771
It's the Mayor's Office. Lee Hwi So is in the Mayor's Office.

505
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,261
Yang Jin Mo, get moving right now!

506
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:59,591
There's no one here.

507
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:02,251
W-What— Identify Lee Hwi So's location again!

508
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:04,831
 Lee Hwi So's location has been identified. 

509
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,371
 He's in Go Myeong Ji's store. 

510
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:08,441
Go Myeong Ji, Lee Hwi So's there!

511
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:12,411
   

512
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,511
I'm the only one here.

513
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,441
 Lee Hwi So's location has been identified. 

514
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:19,861
 He's in the Office of Children Home, TikiTaka. 

515
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:23,221
 Children Home's app database is in the process of getting deleted. 

516
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,971
What did you say? Luca, stop it!

517
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,661
Do whatever it takes to stop it!

518
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,861
 It's not possible in the current situation. 

519
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,711
   
 - Entry has been blocked.  
 - Damn it!

520
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:35,491
What are you all doing? Run to Children Home right now!

521
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,921
- Stop! 
 - Stop there!

522
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,171
T-That's—

523
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,531
Who are you?

524
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:51,811
Where's Lee Hwi So?

525
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:54,571
Where are you hiding Lee Hwi So?

526
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,831
Min Do Hyeok?

527
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:09,231
Where could he be?

528
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,521
Why don't you take a guess?

529
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:17,371
Lee Hwi So isn't anywhere!

530
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,941
Why do you keep looking for Lee Hwi So?

531
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:23,031
Do you remember the day you shot me in the stomach?

532
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:28,811
The one who died in the gallery explosion was Lee Hwi So.

533
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:33,531
So, you've all been chasing after something of an illusion.

534
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,971
No, an illusion isn't quite correct.

535
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,721
It was me.

536
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:41,741
It wasn't Lee Hwi So.

537
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,071
But it was you?

538
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,801
What about the one I saw at the vacation home?

539
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:52,501
 Lee Hwi So! 

540
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:54,251
 Son of— 

541
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:01,061
 It was me. 

542
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,881
- Right, Joo Ran. 
 - Yes?

543
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,631
Could you hold this for a moment, please?

544
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:11,521
All right.

545
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,521
   
   

546
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,201
   
   

547
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:23,101
   
   

548
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:24,731
- Hey! 
 - What?

549
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,621
- Have you gone mad? 
 - I must've gone mad.

550
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:31,341
Oh, no! Children Home's database has been permanently deleted. You can't recover this. Right?

551
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:33,591
S-Save the data— What do I do...

552
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:35,771
No, this can't be. Please, please!

553
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:38,811
Everyone is living such tiring lives, aren't they?

554
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:43,031
You're all scared and panicking because of someone

555
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:45,401
who doesn't even exist in this world.

556
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:50,351
Joon Seok, this is only the beginning.

557
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,661
I can become Lee Hwi So, at any given moment

558
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:56,931
and Shim Joon Seok as well.

559
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:00,531
Looks like you'll become very busy from now on, Joo Ran.

560
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,361
Because you'll have to take care of the press conferences.

561
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:07,581
Seventy percent of the entire nation's DNAs were deleted at once.

562
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:10,471
Doesn't this basically mean for you to die?

563
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:16,691
So he wasn't an idiot but a genius—

564
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:21,651
How dare you deceive me?

565
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:23,371
You dared—

566
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:26,651
You're fired as of today!

567
00:45:26,651 --> 00:45:29,211
That's what I hoped for.

568
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:31,671
   

569
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:41,301
Breathe, breathe. Go ahead and breathe.

570
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:44,331
Hey, you look like a boy scout. You can keep that.

571
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:48,011
Min Do Hyeok, that son of a bitch!

572
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,411
Hey!

573
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:53,691
C-Chairman, what do we do about this?

574
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:56,821
 Mission accomplished. 

575
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,281
Good job.

576
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:02,661
Those fools know what you're capable of, so they'll be on guard from now on.

577
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:03,891
Be careful.

578
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:06,011
Tell them to come at me all they want.

579
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:08,311
I'll take on all of them.

580
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:19,411
 Min Do Hyeok, job well done. 

581
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:30,001
Congrats on a mission success.

582
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,491
Shall we grab a drink to celebrate?

583
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:37,911
Shall we?

584
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:41,561
I was craving some hard liquor.

585
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:10,111
 This will kill you in one minute after drinking it. 

586
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:13,961
 The cause of death will be processed as a simple heart attack. 

587
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,191
As expected, my daughter is something else.

588
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:28,071
You didn't even hesitate to manipulate Hwang Chan Seong or

589
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:30,521
bring the security program.

590
00:47:36,391 --> 00:47:38,791
All right. Cheers.

591
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:50,491
Nice.

592
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:53,191
One more glass.

593
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,511
Geum Ra Hee.

594
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:03,151
What you drank just now isn't a hard liquor but poison.

595
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:06,301
You'll die within a minute if you drink it.

596
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:13,781
I've been waiting for this moment.

597
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:20,001
Killing my enemy who killed my mom in agony in front of me!

598
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:25,241
Let me see you begging for your life.

599
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:30,911
You'll regret this.

600
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:35,331
I finished regretting when my mom died already!

601
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:39,181
Don't be too upset about this.

602
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:42,141
I already talked it over with Matthew, too.

603
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:55,651
Why did you do it?

604
00:48:55,651 --> 00:48:58,911
Why did you kill that poor woman?

605
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:02,571
You should've killed me instead if you hated me!

606
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:28,491
You're paying for your sins.

607
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:30,331
Farewell.

608
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:45,611
Could you be thinking you won?

609
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:05,011
Hey, did you really think that medicine was really poison?

610
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:07,911
Matthew might be young,

611
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:12,011
but he's not dumb enough for you to play him.

612
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:15,111
Matthew, that son of a bitch.

613
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,161
Matthew never keeps a traitor alive.

614
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:22,671
There's only one reason why he keeps you alive.

615
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:25,921
It's because I still approve of your usefulness.

616
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,311
That means your life is in my hands.

617
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:30,311
Do you understand?

618
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:39,701
You're a demon.

619
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:42,161
You're not any different.

620
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,911
 We're all demons. 

621
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:51,811
 Demons who killed Da Mi. 

622
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:57,911
If Park Nan Young is Medusa, I'm sure she came to visit Da Mi.

623
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:06,211
Hyung, someone was here.

624
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:08,011
 Did you really go there? 

625
00:51:08,011 --> 00:51:09,611
What is it you want to know?

626
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:13,031
There's a fish decoration on each branch.

627
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:14,711
Fish?

628
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:16,811
 I heard it from Lee Hwi So. 

629
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:20,811
He had presented Da Mi with an aquarium because she liked fish.

630
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:24,131
But if Park Nan Young is really Medusa,

631
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:26,251
why wouldn't she show herself?

632
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,581
Because she's a dead person, officially.

633
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:32,191
Or there can be some other reason.

634
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,411
I'll call you back later.

635
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:39,811
Excuse me.

636
00:51:39,811 --> 00:51:41,611
Sir!

637
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:44,811
Could I ask you one question, please?

638
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:50,381
Sir, did you see the person who visited that tree by chance?

639
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:53,611
Oh, are you talking about that person?

640
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:57,411
I looked because she had her face wrapped up so thick, and it was weird.

641
00:51:57,411 --> 00:52:00,321
She comes at dawn sometimes and tidies up the place.

642
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:04,161
She also places decorations like those.

643
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:08,931
By the way, I think that woman has a limp.

644
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:11,321
How long has it been?

645
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:16,211
Not sure. About a month, maybe?

646
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:29,611
 Medusa contacted me around then, too. 

647
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:34,611
 Park Nan Young is alive. 

648
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,601
I'm Cha Joo Ran, Manager of TikiTaka's Children Home.

649
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:03,611
A critical error occurred in the Children Home's app, which was developed for public service.

650
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:06,311
And its entire database has been deleted.

651
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:12,241
As such, we've decided to discontinue Children Home's services.

652
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:13,821
Don't you have any backup data?

653
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:18,711
We set it up not to create backup data since it's valuable personal information.

654
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:21,101
How did the data end up getting deleted?

655
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:23,321
Our investigations confirmed it was due to

656
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:28,211
a spyware Shim Joon Seok installed while registering Noh Hannah's location.

657
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:30,061
Don't you think your security is too weak?

658
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:32,121
 - Please answer! 
 - Please give us a word! 

659
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,551
 Don't you think your security is too weak? 

660
00:53:33,551 --> 00:53:35,101
 Isn't that being too irresponsible? 

661
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:38,591
 Don't you think you're being irresponsible? 

662
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:41,401
The bastard who was standing before me was Min Do Hyeok.

663
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:44,281
The bastard who broke into my home was also Min Do Hyeok.

664
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:47,511
That asshole is screwing with me over and over.

665
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:51,211
Just what are the limits of his abilities?

666
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:27,561
 What Yang Jin Mo said was right. 

667
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:34,531
 K constructed enough database to turn an angel into a demon. 

668
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,431
 And Children Home is its peak. 

669
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:54,041
Grandmother, thank you for having taken care of me.

670
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:58,681
Let's meet again in heaven.

671
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,381
Grandmother.

672
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:12,801
Take off your bags and wash your hands first. Okay?

673
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,571
Yes.

674
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,351
Hey, Go Phillip!

675
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:24,341
Do you know how often the directors contact me

676
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:27,411
because they want to do a drama with me?

677
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:34,211
But I decided to go with "Escape," the movie TikiTaka is producing.

678
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:37,011
Oh, I'm sorry.

679
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:39,811
You don't know English. Right?

680
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:43,521
"Escape" means to get out of.

681
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:48,361
Listen to me properly!

682
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:50,571
Why did you hit me?

683
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:55,171
Whenever you brag about yourself,

684
00:55:56,201 --> 00:55:59,601
I feel so sleepy, Sis.

685
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:04,961
Hey, practice the lines with me.

686
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,941
I can't read Korean yet.

687
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:12,891
Gosh, you idiot. Is there anything you can do?

688
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:14,891
In that case...

689
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:18,961
should I help you with the practice?

690
00:56:18,961 --> 00:56:21,121
Can you do it, though?

691
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:23,241
Acting is a really hard thing.

692
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:26,051
You can teach me since I don't know how.

693
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,621
You're a top star.

694
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:30,251
Fine.

695
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:34,211
Watch what I do and try your best, then. Okay?

696
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:36,621
I'm the daughter, and you're the mom.

697
00:56:36,621 --> 00:56:38,741
Here we go.

698
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,951
- Kids, let's have snacks. 
 - Snacks?

699
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:45,781
Whoa, there are snacks!

700
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:04,411
 Everyone must come to TikiTaka's movie theater. 

701
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:08,221
 I'll present you with the best movie. Matthew. 

702
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:15,101
We just recovered 50 million won of the penalty Chairman Shim Yong received from K.

703
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:18,541
We've emptied K's bank accounts and stock brokerage accounts.

704
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,231
But we haven't even gotten half of Chairman Bang's money.

705
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:23,461
We don't need to rush. We've got a lot of time.

706
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:27,661
I just want to recover all that money before meeting Park Nan Young.

707
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,531
 It's about time for us to meet. 

708
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:38,831
 Come to Yongin's public parking lot by 7:00 p.m. sharp. 

709
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:41,871
 I'll tell you the location once you get in the designated vehicle. 

710
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:44,101
 Come with Kang Ki Tak. 

711
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:46,531
 I'm looking forward to our meeting. 

712
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:48,381
Hyung.

713
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,681
Medusa contacted me.

714
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:52,851
He wants to meet us.

715
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:55,801
Welcome!

716
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:03,931
Why are we suddenly watching a movie?

717
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:06,311
The special election for the Seoul mayor starts soon.

718
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:09,691
Think of it as an inaugural ceremony for Deputy Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

719
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:12,381
What does becoming a mayor have to do with a movie?

720
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:13,961
Thank you, Chairman.

721
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:17,451
My Jin Mo is fully prepared.

722
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:19,971
Thank you. I'll do my best to win.

723
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:23,171
All right. Shall we have a toast first?

724
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,511
Cheers to the new mayor of Seoul!

725
00:58:26,511 --> 00:58:28,641
 Cheers! 

726
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,531
The movie will start soon.

727
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:38,691
You may look forward to it.

728
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:48,881
I don't think it's a movie.

729
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:54,741
No, it'll be a great movie with lots of thrill.

730
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:07,051
Wait, they're—

731
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:12,211
Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak.

732
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:13,641
What's happening?

733
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:16,381
Just keep quiet and enjoy.

734
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:28,441
 You can meet me if you come to where the navigation guides you. 

735
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:33,071
We're also looking forward to meeting you, Medusa.

736
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:37,861
Medusa?

737
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:39,931
What's Medusa?

738
00:59:39,931 --> 00:59:44,531
All this time, Min Do Hyeok has been getting intel from someone called Medusa.

739
00:59:44,531 --> 00:59:49,981
He was able to move a step ahead of us, all thanks to Medusa.

740
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:53,601
Are you saying Min Do Hyeok has another helper?

741
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:56,971
It seems Min Do Hyeok doesn't know who the helper is, though.

742
00:59:56,971 --> 00:59:59,401
If you don't know, just keep quiet.

743
00:59:59,401 --> 01:00:03,741
Chairman Matthew is trying to get Min Do Hyeok by using Medusa.

744
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,761
How did you find out about Medusa?

745
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:08,521
It's thanks to Min Do Hyeok, who accessed Luca's system.

746
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:12,651
I might have lost Children Home, but I gained something else.

747
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:16,131
 This is Luca? 

748
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:19,891
 I've been getting intel from someone called Medusa. 

749
01:00:19,891 --> 01:00:23,841
 Their condition was that I don't tell you, Hyung. 

750
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:27,551
 We share the same goals. K and Geum Ra Hee's death. 

751
01:00:27,551 --> 01:00:28,551
 What? 

752
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:31,411
 I knew Hannah's location, thanks to Medusa, and 

753
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:34,491
 I also knew Yoon Ji Sook was in danger. 

754
01:00:35,471 --> 01:00:39,431
Today will be Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak's memorial day.

755
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:47,731
All right.

756
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:56,861
All right! The real movie will begin now.

757
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,111
Go on and take your seats.

758
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,121
   

759
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:39,971
Why did you stop?

760
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:42,691
No, H-Hyung, I didn't stop—

761
01:01:59,951 --> 01:02:02,661
- What's wrong, Do Hyeok? 
 - Hyung, the car isn't—

762
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,251
K.

763
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:18,901
 Nice to meet you! What a tough life, isn't it? 

764
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:26,111
Unfortunately, you won't ever get to meet the Medusa you wanted to meet so badly!

765
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:32,071
I can't undo the seat belt!

766
01:02:36,941 --> 01:02:39,061
The window won't break, either.

767
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:46,321
All right.

768
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:53,141
Look! Look!

769
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:05,171
 This is nuts. 

770
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:06,981
 He's not in his right mind. 

771
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:08,611
 Is he laughing right now? 

772
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:11,181
 He finds this fun? What a nutcase. 

773
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,831
 Is murder a joke? Crazy bastard. 

774
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,421
 He isn't even human. 

775
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,851
 No, I've got to stop him by any means. 

776
01:03:45,441 --> 01:03:47,401
What is that?

777
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:59,431
 You can struggle all you want, but it's no use! 

778
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:03,901
The only thing waiting for you two is sweet death!

779
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,671
   

780
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:14,731
You've all gone mad! You crazy lunatics!

781
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:25,691
What the hell! I was having so much fun!

782
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:32,921
We need to get out of here now.

783
01:04:35,061 --> 01:04:37,931
- What's going on? 
 - Huh?

784
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:43,511
What's going on here? Is there a fire?

785
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:45,771
What fire out of nowhere?

786
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:48,711
I think it's malfunctioning!

787
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:53,031
No, I'm getting out of here. I need to be careful right now.

788
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:57,031
Where are you all going?

789
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:59,071
Come back and sit down, you idiots!

790
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:02,281
Unless you all want to die with Min Do Hyeok!

791
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:04,691
I'm going to end it.

792
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:25,451
 Unlocked. Escape. 

793
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:27,071
Hyung, Medusa is helping us.

794
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,761
What's this? Medusa?

795
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:32,091
Hyung, jump!

796
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,081
What the fuck!

797
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:51,621
How dare you ruin my plan?

798
01:05:51,621 --> 01:05:53,701
Don't move.

799
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:56,131
Medusa is among you lot.

800
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:58,011
Which one of you is Medusa?

801
01:05:58,011 --> 01:06:00,491
Who's the traitor?

802
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:14,031

 I'll let you live if you do! 

810
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,071
 You're Medusa? 

811
01:06:46,071 --> 01:06:47,701
 Why did you help us? 

812
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:50,361
 A punishment for what I've done to my daughter. 

813
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:53,731
 I'll destroy what each of you cherish, one by one. 

814
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:55,821
 What if Mo Ne is on the same side as Medusa? 

815
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:58,271
 That child resembles Mo Ne for some reason. 

816
01:06:58,271 --> 01:07:00,241
 Of course, we'll kill them! 

817
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:03,311
 I've been checking the facts on Bang Da Mi's case. 

818
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,761
 Won't you fight Matthew with me? 

819
01:07:08,101 --> 01:07:10,891
♫  Oh, let's burn down  ♫
