1
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:50,220
   

2
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,790
   

3
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,372
 Unlocked. Escape. 

4
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,852
Hyung, Medusa is helping us.

5
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:04,032
Hyung, jump!

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,690


7
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:20,442
They survived.

8
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:25,382
What the fuck!

9
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:29,562
How dare you ruin my plan?

10
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,832
Medusa is among you lot.

11
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,362
Which one of you is Medusa?

12
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,792
Who's the traitor?

13
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:42,722
   

14
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:53,572
Do Hyeok! Do Hyeok!

15
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,532
Do Hyeok!

16
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,272
The fucking rat who dared to fool me, pretending to be on my side to leech off of me,

17
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:20,102
and enjoyed wealth and fame they don't deserve!

18
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:25,722
Pressing the emergency alarm and using my tablet to save Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak,

19
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:29,452
the fucking lunatic who lost all sense of fear!

20
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,662
Which one of you is Medusa?

21
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:37,982
I-I only found out about Medusa just now.

22
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:39,622
I-It's the same for me.

23
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:41,822
Don't give me that bullshit!

24
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:45,572
Find out who Medusa is, and I'll let you live!

25
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:48,442
Nam Cheol Woo, do something. You're a cop.

26
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:50,732
Why do I need to?

27
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,122
Wait.

28
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:56,032
Why don't you check the tablet PC for fingerprints?

29
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:06,272
 If I get caught here, all of my plans will be for nothing. 

30
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:13,472
You said Medusa wants to kill you and me. Right?

31
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:17,862
Who'd want to kill us the most among these people?

32
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:23,192
The person who'd want revenge the most.

33
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:33,182
If I were Medusa, I'd already have killed you.

34
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:35,292
It's not me!

35
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:40,602
In that case, what about the chance the tablet PC was hacked?

36
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,172
Hacked?

37
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:46,032
 I knew Hannah's location, thanks to Medusa, and 

38
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:48,192
 I also knew Yoon Ji Sook was in danger. 

39
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,002
 How did that person know these things? 

40
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,732
 I don't know. 

41
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,632
 I only know they contact me through Save's server. 

42
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,492
Save...

43
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,942
Hwang Chan Seong?

44
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,672
Did you say Hwang Chan Seong?

45
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:10,442
Medusa contacted Min Do Hyeok through Save's server.

46
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,782
That means Hwang Chan Seong is Medusa!

47
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:18,722
Save publicly criticized and mocked you from the beginning!

48
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,662
It's also suspicious how he made Min Do Hyeok into a national hero using Save's polls!

49
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,752
I'm sure Hwang Chan Seong rigged it.

50
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:29,822
That's right. Hwang Chan Seong is either Medusa or Medusa's helper, most likely!

51
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:33,972
What if Mo Ne is on the same side as Medusa?

52
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:38,372
Mo Ne is the closest one to Save out of all of us.

53
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:47,202
As expected, you're the only person who'd scheme something like this.

54
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:51,162
You've lost your mom. Right?

55
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:54,162
I said I don't know a thing about Medusa!

56
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:59,092
But anyone can be a traitor.

57
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:04,832
Because we'd shake hands with the demon if it's for our benefit.

58
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,562
Don't trust me, either.

59
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,292
Doubt me again and again.

60
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:17,112
Gosh! I'm so sick of all this doubting.

61
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:23,002
This situation might be Medusa's big picture, too.

62
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:25,962
An impure attempt at trying to divide us.

63
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:29,672
She's right! The seven of us need to unite together.

64
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:33,332
We can't be played by Medusa, whom we don't even know.

65
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:37,332
As Jin Mo said, it makes the most sense to say that the tablet PC was hacked.

66
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,162
We'll find out if we dig into Hwang Chan Seong.

67
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:46,052
Han Mo Ne!

68
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:49,112
Your second mission has been decided now.

69
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,882
Go and find out!

70
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:55,222
If Hwang Chan Seong is Medusa or if he's simply a helper...

71
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:59,872
If you fail to find out, you'll be the first one to die.

72
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,722
What if Hwang Chan Seong is Medusa?

73
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,662
Of course, he needs to be killed!

74
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:30,492
Do Hyeok, are you awake?

75
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,782
Hyung, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

76
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,992
Just some muscle aches.

77
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,062
And are you okay?

78
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,122
Hyung...

79
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,712
Hyung, I'm sorry.

80
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:50,072
I was only focused on wanting to meet Medusa.

81
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,402
I should've doubted them first.

82
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,252
From the moment they told me to come with you.

83
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,522
Don't blame yourself.

84
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:02,732
What's important is Matthew also knows about Medusa.

85
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:04,772
And we missed that.

86
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:07,872
It's okay. It's okay.

87
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,122
What is it?

88
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,422
CEO Hwang is the one who brought us here.

89
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:23,352
Had I arrived any later, it would've been very bad.

90
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:34,162
Wait, hold on. How did you know we were there?

91
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,682
That we were in an accident?

92
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:44,662
Looks like I'll have to tell you in the end.

93
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,802
I'm Medusa.

94
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,352
Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak have already disappeared.

95
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,892
Gosh, those bastards are so fucking lucky.

96
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:16,652
All right.

97
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:27,722
Why didn't you discuss this matter with me?

98
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,462
That Medusa is after my life, too!

99
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,782
I also have a right to know!

100
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,682
You didn't go home just to whine about that?

101
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,322
You and I both need to avoid getting killed like dogs.

102
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,662
We'll keep having deserters.

103
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:44,082
That will never happen.

104
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,272
Because I'm going to get it moving seriously now.

105
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,402
What are you talking about?

106
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:52,132
Obtaining Save?

107
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,042
Before that, I need to make Yang Jin Mo the mayor of Seoul.

108
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,572
So we can win the bid for Gagok District's redevelopment.

109
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:03,232
After that, Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak can fuck around all they want.

110
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:06,352
But they will never be able to beat me.

111
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:13,012
Why is Gagok District so important?

112
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,902
As for that...

113
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:24,322
You told me to doubt you again and again. Right?

114
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:30,542
Until I catch Medusa, I won't trust anyone at all.

115
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,502
You're Medusa?

116
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,282
You said you were definitely not back then.

117
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:39,912
When did you find out we came back?

118
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,482
Why did you help us?

119
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:48,072
Are you aware Save's security program was installed on Matthew's system?

120
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,272
Let me answer the first question first.

121
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,932
I've been checking the facts on Bang Da Mi's case.

122
00:09:54,932 --> 00:10:00,332
When I found out K showed up at the premiere of the movie "To D,"

123
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:03,382
I instinctively knew you had come back.

124
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:08,922
Because Matthew is K.

125
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:13,392
You knew about this?

126
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:15,682
The real identity of Matthew?

127
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,522
Everyone stamped Chairman Shim Yong's sincerity as false,

128
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:24,362
but I believed in what the Chairman said at the end.

129
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:29,782
That's why I analyzed Matthew and Lee Hwi So with Save's big data.

130
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:33,032
The results came back as a mismatch.

131
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,952
Why did you go that far?

132
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:37,172
Do you have a grudge against K?

133
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:40,852
I guess this will be the answer to your second question.

134
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,902
I had once been a victim of Shim Joon Seok's lies in the past.

135
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,832
What's certain is that

136
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:52,602
we share the same goal.

137
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:56,292
The death of K.

138
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,212
I'm going to kill K with my own hands for sure.

139
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:04,062
It's more than possible without your help.

140
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,602
I'll answer your third question now.

141
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:12,942
I'm the one who handed over Save's security program through Mo Ne.

142
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:17,742
Of course, K was told Mo Ne had stolen the security program.

143
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,692
It's for Mo Ne's safety.

144
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,272
For her safety?

145
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:28,192
Luca is a masterpiece of the century Lee Hwi So created.

146
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:33,652
Taking away such a weapon from K is the same as saving humanity.

147
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,612
The secret key to Luca...

148
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,532
You know what it is. Right?

149
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:50,432
It's time for us to join forces and bring Luca right now.

150
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,062
As such,

151
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:56,872
I want to scout you to Save, Min Do Hyeok.

152
00:11:56,872 --> 00:12:01,942
Won't you fight Matthew with me?

153
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:40,362
   

154
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,292
   

155
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,822
Min Do Hyeok. Kang Ki Tak.

156
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:48,712
I helped you out, and you get played by Matthew so stupidly, huh?

157
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,292
I warned you not to tell Kang Ki Tak.

158
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:56,352
And you believed the message Matthew sent!

159
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,972
I don't need you two anymore.

160
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,312
I'm going to do it alone.

161
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:16,622
Ki Tak, how much do you believe what Hwang Chan Seong said?

162
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,922
To a degree.

163
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:23,042
If we join forces with Hwang Chan Seong, we can bring Luca sooner.

164
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,282
Do you really think Hwang Chan Seong is Medusa?

165
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,572
I don't really know about that.

166
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,702
I don't really know, either.

167
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:33,062
The part where he said he's been watching us

168
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,242
and how he wanted to join forces with us.

169
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:40,902
Do you still think Park Nan Young is Medusa?

170
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,432
The woodland burial site employee clearly said it was a woman.

171
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:50,012
She was limping and had her face wrapped around in something.

172
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:55,062
What's certain is that it has something to do with Da Mi.

173
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,272
Do Hyeok, hold on.

174
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:18,002
Could it be...

175
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:19,712
Why?

176
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:23,662
Never mind. It's nothing.

177
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,530
Min Do Hyeok.

178
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:41,630
Why didn't he accept my offer right away?

179
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,830
It's his best chance at twisting Matthew's neck.

180
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,802
   

181
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:57,902
   

182
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,030
   

183
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,430
I'll destroy everything each of you cherish, one by one.

184
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,802
    
 Children Home and Gagok District for Matthew.

185
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,822
Her mom for Han Mo Ne.

186
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:16,422
It's your turn next, Cha Joo Ran.

187
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:19,352
My gosh! I really don't deserve this.

188
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,530
Matthew causes trouble every time, and I have to clean it up after.

189
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,130
He should've at least made me a president, not a manager, to put me through this!

190
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,930
Hey, watch where you're going!

191
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,730
You're not allowed to drive your car here!

192
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,130
Well, you've got a cool car.

193
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,530
Joo Ran!

194
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,530
Cha Joo Ran!

195
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,630
This voice is...

196
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,492
Joo Ran.

197
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,642
I missed you, Honey.

198
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,232
   

199
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:24,232
I said it's dangerous here right now.

200
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,582
People have gone mad altogether.

201
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,592
If you want to leave...

202
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,030
You can leave alone, Mom.

203
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,492
I'm going to s-stay here.

204
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:39,430
You're going to die if you stay here!

205
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,330
Everyone got bewitched by something and became weird.

206
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:47,122
We need to run away.

207
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,272
Erica!

208
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,282
Mom!

209
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,930
Gosh, how was it going?

210
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,130
Erica, the election campaigns for Seoul's Mayor will begin soon.

211
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,330
Can you help out Dad once it starts, Erica?

212
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,672
Of course, I'll help out if it's for Dad.

213
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:11,542
Dad will be the Mayor of Seoul, and I'll be a top star.

214
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,122
One second.

215
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,492
You're Noh Hannah, right?

216
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:21,530
Yes, she is. She's Noh Hannah.

217
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,530
She lives with us at our house.

218
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,862
Do you mind if I take a picture?

219
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,942
My cousin is a big fan of yours.

220
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:32,832
- Come. Let's take a picture. 
 - I want to take it, too.

221
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:34,730
One, two, three.

222
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,062
- One, two, three. 
 - Seriously?

223
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:39,822
- How dare she act cute right now? 
 - One, two, three.

224
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,362
One, two, three.

225
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:44,122
Mom, let me borrow your shoes.

226
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,962
What? Why do you need my shoes?

227
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:48,542
Gosh, hurry up!

228
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:55,282
Unni! Oppas! Thank you for your help.

229
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,442
    
 Have some drinks before you—

230
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,830
- It hurts! I think I'm going to die! 
 - Erica!

231
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,342
- It hurts! I think I'll die! 
 - Where does it hurt? Is it here?

232
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:10,162
Where is it? Is it here?

233
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,952
I'm going to die!

234
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:15,292
I can tell she sprained her ankle. Hurry up and take her to the hospital first.

235
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,302
What about the shoot? Today is the first shoot for the movie.

236
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:20,282
We'll have to find a replacement.

237
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,002
Gosh, where will we find a child actor, though?

238
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,830
Oh, there's Hannah. I saw her practicing the script with Erica earlier.

239
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,130
She's just as good as an actor.

240
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,482
No way! I'm going to do it.

241
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:33,862
I'm going to act.

242
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:38,802
Noh Hannah, don't you dare try to take it from me!

243
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,330
I won't let you be!

244
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,330
Please help us here. It's urgent!

245
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,862
Please help!

246
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:48,130
No, I'm going to do it! It's mine!

247
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,530
- Please take care of Hannah. 
 - Y-Yes.

248
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,482
Phillip, let's go!

249
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:56,382
- I'm not going! I'm going to do it! 
 - Erica, calm down!

250
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,542
Do you have a reservation?

251
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,830
It's for Kim Do Jin.

252
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,030
Did you come with CEO Kim?

253
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,022
She's CEO Kim's guest.

254
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:17,112
- Hello, ma'am! 
-  Hello, ma'am! 

255
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:20,632
Joo Ran! Honey!

256
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:34,912
Hello, CEO Kim.

257
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,372
Hi. She's my wife.

258
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:42,562
Please forgive me. Let me take you to a private room.

259
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,152
Please enjoy your time!

260
00:19:55,982 --> 00:20:00,630
Please be extra careful today since I'm with a special guest today.

261
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,752
Also, please start preparing the meal 10 minutes later.

262
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,572
Yes, CEO Kim.

263
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,422
You can leave.

264
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,330
I was dying to do this with you the moment I saw you.

265
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,362
Stop your snout right there.

266
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,902
You can fool me once, not twice.

267
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:35,362
Whoa! Joo Ran, you didn't age at all.

268
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:38,102
You're full of strength.

269
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:42,142
This reminds me of the good old days.

270
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,952
When we used to live together,

271
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,030
we danced like this so often.

272
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,562
Cut your bullshit!

273
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:05,412
Just tell me why you wanted to meet me.

274
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,932
What are you trying to gain from me this time?

275
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:10,430
I'm a sinful man.

276
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,630
I totally understand why you'd react this way.

277
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,942
I wanted to meet you to give you this.

278
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,952
What's this?

279
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,130
The money I stole from you before the divorce.

280
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,622
I included some interest, too.

281
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,542
How many zeros is this? One, two...

282
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,572
Two billion?

283
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,522
I regretted it a lot.

284
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:46,382
I worked like a dog to come back to you blameless.

285
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:49,142
I even hit off a business in Dubai.

286
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,352
This is all thanks to you, Honey.

287
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,672
I said to cut the bullshit!

288
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:55,952
Anyone can fabricate this shit.

289
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,932
What kind of a world do you think we live in?

290
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:01,730
And I even have a boyfriend.

291
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,630
A boyfriend?

292
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,052
I'm glad.

293
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,832
I thought you'd hate men because I hurt you.

294
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:14,102
In that case, it means I still have some hope.

295
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,492
Hope for what?

296
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,530
The hope that my Joo Ran can become mine once again.

297
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,342
Joo Ran.

298
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,272
Let's get back together.

299
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:33,592
I started a construction business in Korea and received tons of investment.

300
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,372
Soon enough, in the Gagok District—

301
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:37,772
Gagok District, my foot!

302
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:40,002
So that's what you were after, huh?

303
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:42,392
Don't you think you showed your intention too soon?

304
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:45,542
How much will you rob me after giving me a mere two billion won?

305
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,022
Hope? Get back together?

306
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:51,492
Give me a freaking break, seriously!

307
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:57,772
I really don't have any interest in your money.

308
00:22:57,772 --> 00:23:02,312
I've got loads of people who want to invest.

309
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:09,412
Come find me whenever your anger is gone.

310
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:14,262
I'm leaving in three days, so I hope you won't come too late.

311
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:17,762
I want to see you smile again.

312
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:22,122
Think about what I said and contact me.

313
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,562
   

314
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:35,682
What kind of a business can he possibly be doing?

315
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:01,302
Is the reunion with your ex-wife going well?

316
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:04,002
I've wronged her a lot, so it's not easy to change her mind.

317
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,482
I see.

318
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,012
What about the client?

319
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,930
She's waiting in the private salon.

320
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,330
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

321
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,762
Excuse me! Pardon—

322
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,302
I'm sorry, but...

323
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,672
The man just now— Kim Do Jin.

324
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,672
Oh, are you talking about CEO Kim?

325
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,642
Yes, CEO Kim.

326
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,862
I've got a business with him.

327
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:39,302
Gosh, I'm sorry.

328
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:44,142
CEO Kim said he won't be having any more investor meetings.

329
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:46,762
As the general manager, I'd like to make a polite request.

330
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:50,832
Please get out of our hotel now.

331
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:54,412
- Get out— 
 - Please escort her.

332
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:56,802
W-Who do you think I am to treat me like a peddler?

333
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:59,102
I'm CEO Kim Do Jin's...

334
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,632
wife! I'm his wife!

335
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:04,962
Goodness— My goodness, please forgive me.

336
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,432
I'm really sorry.

337
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:10,202
P-Please don't mention this to CEO Kim.

338
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:12,522
I'm really sorry.

339
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,062
I'm really sorry.

340
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:22,542
He's right over there.

341
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:33,382
This laughter belongs to...

342
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:38,332
- Don't worry too much. 
 - Yes.

343
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:44,112
Geum Ra Hee? Why's that bitch here?

344
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,282
It's perfect.

345
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:49,232
Thank you so much.

346
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:55,772
You have to keep this investment a secret as well.

347
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,192
Even to Chairman Matthew.

348
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:59,962
Gosh, of course.

349
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:03,382
The list of investors won't be exposed.

350
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:06,362
This isn't our first time doing business.

351
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:10,892
Just like last time, I guarantee a 300% return.

352
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:15,542
I'm counting on you, CEO Kim.

353
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,022
- Please rest assured. 
 - Has that bitch gone mad?

354
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:20,652
Why the heck is she holding a taken man's hand?

355
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:23,382
- Shall we get going now? 
 - Yes.

356
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:26,262
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

357
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,732
300%?

358
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:42,892
Yeah!

359
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:46,970
   

360
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,550
   

361
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:53,862
 It's time for you to leave. 

362
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,352
Yes. Thank you.

363
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:02,322
My skin looks so much brighter.

364
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,150
   

365
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:28,632
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

366
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,362
   

367
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,982
Gagok District.

368
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:36,492
Gagok District.

369
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:39,772
The place where Bang Chil Seong, that old fart, died.

370
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:47,612
   

371
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,662
   

372
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:54,122
What he said was true!

373
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,642
How much did she invest?

374
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,782
   

375
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,152
    
 10 billion won.

376
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,842
Total?

377
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:03,762
10 billion won?

378
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:07,552
 I'm going to be a bit late because I forgot to bring a document. 

379
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:30,872
Geum Ra Hee, that sly bitch.

380
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:34,152
You're going to make a fortune for yourself, huh?

381
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:37,632
You'll never be taking it all for yourself.

382
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,352
What's the result?

383
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:46,022
There weren't any fingerprints found besides yours, Chairman.

384
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:48,012
- However... 
 - However?

385
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:50,362
There was a trace of someone erasing their fingerprints.

386
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:55,222
They even erased their fingerprints in that split moment?

387
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:58,322
Keep looking until you find something more.

388
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,612
- It doesn't matter how long it takes. 
 - Okay.

389
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:05,902
Oh, and let's keep this between us.

390
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:09,152
Absolutely keep it a secret from Cha Joo Ran, too.

391
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:11,502
Yes, Chairman.

392
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:17,292
I'll also consider your promotion if you bring me a meaningful result.

393
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,442
Thank you. Loyalty.

394
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,692
Loyalty!

395
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,252
Joo Ran! Ooh, ah!

396
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:28,692
Promotion!

397
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:31,512
Yes, yes, yes.

398
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:34,092
Yes, yes, yes!

399
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,122
What brings you here?

400
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:43,722
Just saying hi to the Chairman while passing by.

401
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:47,992
Well, what about you, Honey?

402
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,802
Weren't you taking a break from work?

403
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:54,312
Oh, there were things to wrap up at Children Home.

404
00:29:56,262 --> 00:30:00,102
Oh, that's right! You didn't forget about tonight's dinner plans. Right?

405
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:03,862
We're going to a luxurious place, so make sure to dress up beautifully.

406
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:07,352
Gosh, what do I do? Something important came up suddenly.

407
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:08,912
Sorry. Please cancel it right now.

408
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:14,752
I can't! I already paid for the place with full options.

409
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:18,302
Don't tell me you were going to propose to me and shit?

410
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:21,922
Gosh, how did you know?

411
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:27,202
Since things came to this, I can't wait any longer.

412
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,430
   

413
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,762
Honey, will you marry me?

414
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,632
I'll make you really happy.

415
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:42,522
I might become Seoul's Chief of Police.

416
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:52,322
It's pretty, and the gem's big, too.

417
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:57,372
 Come find me whenever your anger is gone. 

418
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:02,302
 I'm leaving in three days, so I hope you won't come too late. 

419
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,672
I'm going to decline.

420
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:11,952
I'm going to leave Korea.

421
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:15,232
How much longer do I have to live in fear as Matthew's dog?

422
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:19,172
It's okay for me to live happily now. Right?

423
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,572
W-Why are you doing this so suddenly?

424
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:27,242
Could it be you've got another man?

425
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:31,402
I did. A great and competent man.

426
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:36,232
He knows not a thing about my past and will walk me down a flowery future.

427
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:41,362
I'm also going to live a great life this time.

428
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:44,612
Forget about a bitch like me, Nam Cheol Woo.

429
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:50,022
Honey... Cha Joo Ran!

430
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:55,012
That child will be playing my daughter?

431
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,832
Oh, Erica had to quit due to an injury.

432
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:01,232
That girl, Hannah, is an acting genius.

433
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:02,542
Is that so easy for you, Mom?

434
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,482
She already memorized her lines, too.

435
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:07,452
The director gave her an okay with one go as well.

436
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:13,052
Is it easy for you to leave this place since you abandoned me, too?

437
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,652
Mo Ne!

438
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,052
When did you come?

439
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,702
Of course, I should come since it's your first shoot.

440
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:26,802
As a surprise, I'm paying for the food truck, too.

441
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:29,462
- I'm already excited. 
 - Thank you for the meal.

442
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:31,662
- Please take good care of my Mo Ne. 
 - Mo Ne's the best!

443
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:34,352
- Please take good care of her. 
 - Thank you!

444
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:40,192
Is that girl the one playing your daughter?

445
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,092
She's Noh Hannah.

446
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,332
The one who came out on the news. Right?

447
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:56,092
Yes, she's probably the one.

448
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:01,142
I sense a great mother-daughter chemistry.

449
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:04,322
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

450
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:08,462
That child resembles Mo Ne for some reason.

451
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,862
Especially her eyes.

452
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:12,522
Sorry?

453
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:35,202
Thank you for dropping me off today.

454
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:38,972
I want to have some tea together inside.

455
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:41,532
Next time.

456
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:45,852
Sure. You must be tired, so I'll hold back.

457
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:52,072
One moment.

458
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:03,582
What's your decision, Min Do Hyeok?

459
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:07,682
I'll decline your offer.

460
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,272
Decline, you say?

461
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,842
If that's what you want, I understand.

462
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,382
Let me know if you change your mind.

463
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,672
When did you come out?

464
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,462
Just now.

465
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,032
Who was it, by the way?

466
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:55,102
It was for business. The news wasn't fun to hear though.

467
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:03,352
It's a shame to let you go like this.

468
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:12,972
I'm sorry. I know you're a good person,

469
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:15,462
but I'm not ready yet.

470
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:18,202
It's not your fault.

471
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,552
I was being too hasty.

472
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,452
I'll contact you tomorrow.

473
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,852
Get home safely.

474
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:50,412
 Could I really trust Hwang Chan Seong? 

475
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:58,472
 Yes, he even handed over the security program for me. 

476
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:01,272
 I need to trust him right now. 

477
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:11,022
 But what did Min Do Hyeok decline? 

478
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,012
Hyungnim, long time no see.

479
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:27,672
- Hey. 
 - I was thinking of contacting you.

480
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,742
By the way, who's this?

481
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:33,702
He works with me. You can relax and talk.

482
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:36,262
I'm Han Kyeong Soo.

483
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:41,262
Those bastards all gathered last night to watch a movie.

484
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:42,932
But I don't know what movie it was.

485
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,662
- They watched a movie? 
- Yes.

486
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,922
But the theater's fire alarm suddenly went off, and it was crazy.

487
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:52,002
The important thing is that they didn't even evacuate, let alone budge.

488
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,922
Do you remember what time it was?

489
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:59,412
The movie started at 7 o'clock, so I think it was about 20 minutes later.

490
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,922
7:20 p.m.

491
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:04,872
 Unlocked. Escape. 

492
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,362
 Hyung, Medusa is helping us. 

493
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:16,842
You're sure all seven of them were there. Right?

494
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:19,282
Yes. I confirmed with my own eyes.

495
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:22,322
In that case, Medusa is one of the seven.

496
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:26,102
Also, there's one more thing.

497
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:30,272
Noh Hannah will be appearing in Han Mo Ne's movie.

498
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:42,115
Say, "Ah."

499
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:44,925
No matter how upset you are, you need to eat.

500
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:47,065
No, I'm not eating!

501
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,565
I don't like that girl, Noh Hannah.

502
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,435
Why did we have to live with that garbage?

503
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,055
She took my role and attention from me!

504
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,785
Hey, you're pretending to be pitiful on purpose. Right?

505
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,025
You're trying to take even my dad from me!

506
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:14,645
Hannah, leave that and go outside.

507
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,455
Who'd take your dad from you, Erica?

508
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:22,925
 I don't like you being nice to Hannah, either. 

509
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,035
 I don't like Dad looking at Hannah, too. 

510
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:27,655
- Mister. 
  - I hate everything that has to do with Hannah! 

511
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:30,045
 - Kick her out right now!  
 - I'm okay.

512
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,935
I can understand why Erica would be upset.

513
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:37,255
Hannah, I'm sorry.

514
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:42,815
Mister was being greedy and brought you here unnecessarily.

515
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:45,035
Not at all.

516
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:51,785
If I didn't have you, I'd have been really alone.

517
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,245
Thank you.

518
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,645
I-I'm going to go read some books.

519
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:19,795
Don't even think of lecturing Erica.

520
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:24,675
Even if it's you, I won't be seeing someone who hurts my child.

521
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:33,835
Even if it's an act, is it so hard to say a kind word to Erica or give her a hug for once?

522
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:35,565
Is it really that hard?

523
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:39,135
It's too cruel for that child who's only looking at you!

524
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:41,565
Being a dad wasn't part of our plan from the beginning.

525
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,915
Our plan didn't include having Hannah live here, either.

526
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,105
Do you think I accepted Hannah because I like her?

527
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:48,065
It's because you wanted to.

528
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:50,115
Because she's the daughter of the woman you loved!

529
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:52,725
- Go Myeong Ji! 
 - Yes, Yang Jin Mo!

530
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,505
You're not the only one holding back.

531
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:57,255
I'm also holding back!

532
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:03,515
So, I hope you'll put as much effort into Erica and Phillip as I'm with Hannah.

533
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:11,569
   

534
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:14,785
Hey.

535
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:17,035
What was our love to you all this time?

536
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:18,755
Were you playing with me?

537
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:21,595
- I'm asking if you were using me. 
 - Were you even worth using—

538
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,885
Well, fine. Let's just say I was playing with you.

539
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:30,185
If that's what you want to hear, I'll say it as many times as you want.

540
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,525
This is the last time.

541
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:39,795
If you go in like this, you won't ever see me again.

542
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:44,595
Can you live without me? You're okay with that?

543
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:47,075
Are you okay with that?

544
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,505
 - You were making a wish. 
 - Yes. 

545
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:54,975
 We haven't gone on a proper date since we've met. I'm sorry. 

546
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,085
 Let's go on a luxurious date later. 

547
00:40:57,085 --> 00:41:00,985
 I'll treat you to a full course. 

548
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:03,195
 Honey, run! 

549
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,275
 Honey! 

550
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,985
 Why are you suddenly so cool? 

551
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:12,595
 I can't live a day without you. 

552
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:16,745
Why couldn't I live without you? Our love wasn't that great.

553
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:19,255
You're only a junkie.

554
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,805
I really quit.

555
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:25,155
It was for you.

556
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:28,085
Is that so? How respectable.

557
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,585
But I'm not interested.

558
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,105
Honey. Cha Joo Ran!

559
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:38,415
Joo Ran! Cha Joo Ran!

560
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,445
Sir, you can't do this here.

561
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:43,455
H-Honey! Cha Joo Ran...

562
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:47,085
Cha Joo Ran, you can't do this to me. Why are you doing this...

563
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:49,055
Honey! Joo Ran!

564
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:51,865
 Cha Joo Ran, how can you do this to me? 

565
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:54,835
 - This can't be happening! 
 - You can't be doing this here. 

566
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,965
 Please calm down. 

567
00:41:56,965 --> 00:42:00,325
Cha Joo Ran will be there. Be ready.

568
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:04,235
Okay. I got it.

569
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:10,195
 Are you the woman who wanted to see me? 

570
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,975
 What do you want from me? 

571
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:13,995
 You need money. Right? 

572
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:16,405
 Then, seduce Cha Joo Ran. 

573
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:20,725
 If you take all of her assets within a week, 

574
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:22,685
 I'll give you one billion won. 

575
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:28,185
 One billion won? One billion won, really? 

576
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,985
 The former State Affairs Deputy Mayor Yang Jin Mo is with us today. 

577
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:39,055
You recently resigned from the

578
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:42,705
state affairs deputy mayor position to run for the Seoul mayor position.

579
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:45,375
Is it true you're running as an independent candidate?

580
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,205
Yes. I deemed it impolite to run for the position with the support of the party

581
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:52,965
when the Mayor who appointed me dropped out of it.

582
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:56,305
Not because you're not confident about winning the nomination?

583
00:42:56,305 --> 00:43:00,995
Not at all. I believe a mayor ought to be the people's servant.

584
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,545
I will not serve the party.

585
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:06,095
If so, may I ask you an aggressive question?

586
00:43:06,095 --> 00:43:07,385
Sure.

587
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:12,205
Professor Choi Mi Nam of Seoul University's School of Law you'll be facing as a candidate has

588
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:15,655
raised issues over your educational background as a middle school graduate.

589
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:18,605
Would you like to refute this statement?

590
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:21,295
No, I don't.

591
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:26,095
I dropped out of high school and started making money before others due to family finances.

592
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:28,215
Is that illegal?

593
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:31,165
Is it a reason I cannot become the mayor?

594
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:33,395
I used to be an entertainer.

595
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:37,695
But I don't beg for votes pathetically with a diploma from Seoul University like somebody.

596
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:41,035
Whoa, you've got the guts.

597
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:45,815
It looks like that must be why this person fell for you.

598
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:49,605
We'll now reveal the secret guest.

599
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:51,755
Please come out!

600
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,605
Honey!

601
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:58,715
Surprised?

602
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:05,805
I'm still happy to see you even though I saw you this morning.

603
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:09,135
This is my beloved wife, Go Myeong Ji.

604
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:10,445
Welcome.

605
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:13,195
- Thank you for inviting me. 
 - We should be thanking you.

606
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:14,375
Pleased to meet you.

607
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:17,485
You used to be a high school art teacher. Right?

608
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:18,475
Yes.

609
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:23,395
The viewers are dying to know your love story.

610
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:25,905
Who was the first one to propose?

611
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:27,885
He proposed to me.

612
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:30,365
She must've been exhausted to raise a twin by herself.

613
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:34,965
When I saw her taking care of even the orphanage kids while volunteering together,

614
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,465
it was love at first sight.

615
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:41,265
   

616
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:45,335
- Thank you for your time. 
 - Thank you.

617
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,895
Great acting.

618
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,275
Speak for yourself.

619
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,265
What brings you here?

620
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:06,475
Of course, I came to cheer for Yang Jin Mo, the future mayor of Seoul.

621
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,055
Did you find Medusa?

622
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:11,675
It'll be revealed when the time comes.

623
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:16,905
Can you leave us alone for a moment?

624
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:31,145
Once you become the mayor, promote Gagok District as a government project.

625
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,465
So that TikiTaka can rent it for 1,000 won per pyeong. 
  (1 pyeong = 35 sq. ft.) 

626
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,469
Government subsidies are easy money. Right?

627
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,069
Do you think that makes sense?

628
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:43,875
That's why I'm trying to make you the mayor of Seoul.

629
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:48,555
You just need to say TikiTaka is the best company for futuristic city development

630
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:50,669
at the public bidding.

631
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:53,269
What are you going to build here?

632
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:58,369
I'm planning to build the best data center complex in the world.

633
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,569
A data center complex?

634
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:05,635
TikiTaka, Save, Seongchan.

635
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:10,445
All data of our most prominent corporations will be gathered here.

636
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,069
I'll then be able to obtain the greatest power and intel.

637
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:19,935
It's a dream even my father failed to achieve.

638
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:23,505
What do you say? Work on this with me.

639
00:46:24,335 --> 00:46:26,635
It'd be an honor for me.

640
00:46:29,575 --> 00:46:31,555
 Once I get what I want, 

641
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:36,665
 you and that child are both out forever, Yang Jin Mo. 

642
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:39,525
 You think I'll be satisfied with merely being Seoul Mayor? 

643
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:41,915
 I'll become bigger and rise higher. 

644
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:45,055
 So you can never mess with Hannah. 

645
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:53,825
Please withdraw from all of these accounts.

646
00:46:53,825 --> 00:46:55,605
I'm in a rush, so please speed it up.

647
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,225
Yes.

648
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:59,569
- The deposit has been completed. 
 - Okay.

649
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:02,869
Thank you for using Eutteum Bank.

650
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:08,435
Oh, my. It's a big loss to sell it so urgently like this.

651
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:10,875
Mind your business, and please quickly process the cancellation fee.

652
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,025
   

653
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:13,265
   

654
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,669
You don't have more?

655
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:24,445
You play at such a petite scale.

656
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,555
More.

657
00:47:28,669 --> 00:47:32,269
Well, can you really handle this?

658
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:25,225
All right! Here's the money.

659
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:27,535
It's a total of 30 billion won.

660
00:48:28,145 --> 00:48:30,285
Thirty billion won?

661
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:35,569
Honey, did you forget what I said last night?

662
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:38,625
I told you I can't take more than 10 billion won.

663
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,105
Are you really going to do this to me?

664
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,295
Don't be like that and just take it, please.

665
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:45,269
Where did you even get this much money?

666
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:51,969
I raked them in from people I know, the banks, private loans, and loan sharks!

667
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:56,195
Right! I even used this month's credit card cash loan.

668
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:58,705
Why did you get carried away?

669
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:02,235
I really don't want to get money involved with you.

670
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:04,245
You wanted to get back together with me and leave.

671
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:06,705
Then be quiet and go make this money grow.

672
00:49:06,705 --> 00:49:10,455
You promised a 300% return guarantee.

673
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:14,505
Don't worry.

674
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:19,925
Let's have fun and party hard. All right?

675
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:22,265
Oh, yeah!

676
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,955
- Just wait for me right here! 
 - Okay!

677
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,295
I'll go bring champagne and some food!

678
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,395
Great!

679
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:37,445
Thirty billion won?

680
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:40,915
Cha Joo Ran, this woman is completely mad for money.

681
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:43,655
She even got a private loan.

682
00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:46,355
- Well done. 
  - By the way, 

683
00:49:46,355 --> 00:49:51,635
 no matter what I think, one billion won is too little for this job for me. 

684
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:52,925
You should spend a bit more.

685
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:58,365
I barely smuggled you in when you were a scum wanted by Interpol.

686
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,495
Do you have a death wish?

687
00:50:00,495 --> 00:50:03,195
W-What?

688
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:04,785
Have you gone mad?

689
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:10,125
Even a penny is too much for trash like you.

690
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,169
What's this?

691
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:22,169
Take the money.

692
00:50:24,665 --> 00:50:27,769
What are you guys doing? Huh?

693
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,169
Hey, why are you guys doing this?

694
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:36,405
Gosh— Hey, stop there! Shit!

695
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:40,069
Hey! Hey—

696
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:41,969
My one billion won—

697
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:43,735
One billion won is mine!

698
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:46,305
   

699
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:54,069
The picture came out so well.

700
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:57,195
It's thanks to you, Reporters.

701
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:09,355
If you need anything else again, please let me know anytime.

702
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,975
We'll give you all of our support.

703
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:14,855
We'll spread some good stories in mom cafes next week.

704
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:17,865
Gosh, I'd appreciate it.

705
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:21,835
I'll arrange a luncheon meeting soon.

706
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:23,975
I called the rides for you, so take them home.

707
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:26,369
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

708
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:30,769
Take care. Please write many good articles!

709
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:38,755
Shall I see the popularity vote on candidates for Seoul mayor?

710
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,065
   

711
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,615
   

712
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:44,995
   

713
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:48,375
W-What's going on here?

714
00:51:49,295 --> 00:51:51,815
There's no way this is happening.

715
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,769
Where did he hide it?

716
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:27,285
   

717
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:39,105
   

718
00:52:40,975 --> 00:52:43,645
How did you know Hwang Chan Seong would come?

719
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:48,095
Someone was following us on the day I met Hwang Chan Seong.

720
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:53,975
As expected, Hwang Chan Seong is after Lee Hwi So's USB.

721
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:56,669
We almost got fooled.

722
00:52:56,669 --> 00:53:01,369
 I'm the one who handed over Save's security program through Mo Ne. 

723
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:06,255
 Of course, K was told Mo Ne had stolen the security program. 

724
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:09,295
 It's for Mo Ne's safety. 

725
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:11,225
 It wasn't for Mo Ne's safety. 

726
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:14,645
 Hwang Chan Seong is trying to use Mo Ne. 

727
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:16,969
I'll be out for a moment.

728
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,869
Do Hyeok!

729
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,175
Are you going to Han Mo Ne?

730
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:26,305
Han Mo Ne also needs to know what kind of a person Hwang Chan Seong is.

731
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:29,015
Seeing how he approached us pretending to be Medusa,

732
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:33,715
I'm sure he's also plotting something terrible against Han Mo Ne.

733
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:37,369
I also have something to look into.

734
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:39,955
I'll let you know.

735
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:42,325
   

736
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:51,985
 Hello. 

737
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:54,365
This is Min Do Hyeok. Where are you right now?

738
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,269
What do you care?

739
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:59,469
Let's meet right now. I have to tell you something important.

740
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:07,769
Did the guest in this suite go somewhere?

741
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:09,665
He already checked out.

742
00:54:09,665 --> 00:54:12,565
No way. We agreed to meet here.

743
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:27,585
 The phone is turned off. After the beep... 

744
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:31,165
Please let me see the general manager right now.

745
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:34,569
T-The general manager with a weird mustache.

746
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:37,669
Our hotel policy doesn't allow our employees to grow mustaches.

747
00:54:37,669 --> 00:54:40,969
Bring me the general manager right now!

748
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:44,169
Bring him right now! Tell him to come right now—

749
00:54:44,169 --> 00:54:46,869
Gosh, seriously. I said to bring him!

750
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:50,669
How may I help you? I'm the general manager of this hotel.

751
00:54:50,669 --> 00:54:53,005
Why would you be the general manager? Bring me the real—

752
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:58,169
Other guests might feel uncomfortable, so let us go talk elsewhere.

753
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,669
That was...

754
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:02,355
There's no way.

755
00:55:02,355 --> 00:55:04,885
Huh? I—

756
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,969
Geum Ra Hee?

757
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:10,765
 You have to keep this investment a secret as well. 

758
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,115
 Even to Chairman Matthew. 

759
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:14,885
 Let's get back together. Soon enough, in Gagok District- 

760
00:55:14,885 --> 00:55:16,905
 Gagok District, my foot! 

761
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:18,045
   

762
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:20,585
 Gagok District. 

763
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:25,269
It was Geum Ra Hee's scheme. Geum Ra Hee...

764
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:27,869
Geum Ra Hee!

765
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:31,969
Open the door, please. We've got a report on drugs.

766
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:34,169
We'll force it open.

767
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:49,165
Nam Cheol Woo, you're under immediate arrest for drug use.

768
00:55:49,165 --> 00:55:51,315
Thank you for your cooperation.

769
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:53,105
Let go!

770
00:55:53,105 --> 00:55:54,995
- Hey, you idiots. 
 - What's this?

771
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:57,585
We're on the same side!

772
00:55:57,585 --> 00:55:59,375
I'm a detective.

773
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,555
Yes, I'm a detective, too. Hey, hold him!

774
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:04,405
I-I'm...

775
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:11,569
My woman, my love, Cha Joo Ran.

776
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:14,169
J-Joo Ran...

777
00:56:27,405 --> 00:56:29,065
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

778
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,085
Are you really sure nothing is wrong?

779
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:33,525
I told you not to care about my business.

780
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:35,725
It only makes me miserable to be involved with you.

781
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,785
Hey, watch out for Hwang Chan Seong. He's dangerous.

782
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,905
You're the most dangerous one to me!

783
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:42,695
My mom wouldn't have died like that if you weren't here.

784
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:45,545
You could've saved my mom if you saved Hannah.

785
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:47,805
You said Medusa had contacted you.

786
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,795
Why couldn't you save her?

787
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:52,335
Why couldn't you save her?

788
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:25,265
 Thank you again for protecting my Hannah. 

789
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:32,385
 I realized leaving Mo Ne and Hannah is for the best for my daughter and granddaughter. 

790
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,745
 Please stop barging into my life. 

791
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,485
 What happened this time was your fault! 

792
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:39,445
 Please just leave me alone! 

793
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:42,665
 Stop showing up in my life! 

794
00:57:45,735 --> 00:57:50,515
 One day, I'll get to meet Hannah and Mo Ne again. 

795
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,725
 I'll wait for that day. 

796
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:56,275
M-Mom—

797
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:05,525
M-Mom was there to see me.

798
00:58:05,525 --> 00:58:08,655
She was there to see me before leaving.

799
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:12,585
What have I done to her?

800
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:15,965
What have I done to your mom, Han Mo Ne?

801
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:44,087
Thank you for giving me Mom's last letter.

802
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:53,277
   

803
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,527
 Yes, Chan Seong. 

804
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:00,997
What are you doing right now?

805
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:04,397
I came out for a short walk near my house and to get a look at the script.

806
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:06,097
I see.

807
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:09,527
By yourself?

808
00:59:09,527 --> 00:59:11,137
Yes.

809
00:59:12,827 --> 00:59:14,737
Do you want to have dinner together?

810
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:17,397
You won't decline again. Right?

811
00:59:17,397 --> 00:59:21,787
I'll come. Where shall we meet?

812
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:24,627
Okay. I'll see you later.

813
00:59:25,847 --> 00:59:29,547
Don't go. End things with him right now.

814
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:12,397
CEO Hwang, Han Mo Ne has arrived.

815
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:28,617
Took you longer than I expected.

816
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:31,537
Was it hard to find this place?

817
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:35,987
There was some traffic.

818
01:00:35,987 --> 01:00:38,117
I see.

819
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,667
The dinner is ready. Come this way.

820
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:23,987
Mo Ne, are you afraid of me?

821
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:28,347
You're shaking right now.

822
01:01:39,677 --> 01:01:41,417
No way.

823
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:44,157
Is it because it's chilly today?

824
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,317
Let's hurry up and eat.

825
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:58,657
I hope to have some rules in our relationship from now on.

826
01:02:00,277 --> 01:02:02,547
No lying.

827
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:04,357
Also,

828
01:02:06,357 --> 01:02:09,017
don't meet Min Do Hyeok.

829
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:16,797
Min Do Hyeok is an extremely dangerous person.

830
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:27,837
Let me ask you again now.

831
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:32,127
Who were you with earlier?

832
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:01,547
Let me ask you one last time.

833
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:05,647
Why did you meet...

834
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,077
Min Do Hyeok?

835
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:15,937
You were following me?

836
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:29,337
That's not an answer.

837
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:54,427
All right. Let me tell you our rules again. Number one.

838
01:04:06,037 --> 01:04:07,937
Get up.

839
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:45,737
Ra Hee!

840
01:04:54,927 --> 01:04:56,787
You...

841
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:03,527
You were...

842
01:05:04,907 --> 01:05:07,377
You were Medusa?

843
01:05:07,377 --> 01:05:10,867
Tell me. You're Medusa, right?

844
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:14,607
Answer me. I know you are!

845
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:23,247
What on earth were you thinking while doing all this?

846
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:24,957
Why did you approach Do Hyeok?

847
01:05:24,957 --> 01:05:27,637
How did you access Save's information?

848
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:33,987
It's none of your business whether I'm Medusa or not.

849
01:05:33,987 --> 01:05:36,097
You go your way.

850
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:39,387
And I'll go my way.

851
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:43,337
What the heck are you thinking, Geum Ra Hee?

852
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:46,237
Don't tell me...

853
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,747
Did you watch Da Mi's footage from that day?

854
01:05:53,547 --> 01:05:55,997
The last moments of that child...

855
01:05:56,897 --> 01:05:59,587
K had in his possession?

856
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:07,137
Why do you bother even asking?

857
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:12,597
A punishment for what I've done to my daughter.

858
01:06:22,407 --> 01:06:23,707
Ra Hee!

859
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:27,727
Don't touch me. I don't need your help.

860
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:36,967
I'm Geum Ra Hee.

861
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:40,917
I don't bleed or cry.

862
01:06:41,837 --> 01:06:43,827
I'm Geum Ra Hee.

863
01:07:20,017 --> 01:07:22,837
   

864
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,257
 Is it recording? 

865
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:40,947
 Hello, Mom and Dad! 

866
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:46,377
 I was going to call you, but I thought you'd want to see me. 

867
01:07:47,177 --> 01:07:51,367
 Look. I'm doing great here. Right? 

868
01:07:52,687 --> 01:07:57,607
 Look at my chubby cheeks from eating and sleeping so well. 

869
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,627
 My mom here is really good at cooking. 

870
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:05,387
Even yesterday, she made me my favorites, stir-fried anchovies, and jangjorim. 
  (Soy-braised beef) 

871
01:08:05,387 --> 01:08:08,337
They were so delicious.

872
01:08:08,977 --> 01:08:14,537
So, you can stop sending me side dishes. Okay?

873
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:19,927
My mom is a really great person.

874
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:24,567
She's hardworking and passionate.

875
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,197
I want to help her in any way I can.

876
01:08:27,197 --> 01:08:30,227
But I'm still so inadequate.

877
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:34,607
But I, Bang Da Mi, will make sure to become a lovable daughter!

878
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,807
Right, the aquarium.

879
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:39,377
 Thank you so much for the aquarium. 

880
01:08:39,377 --> 01:08:42,267
 I'm so happy to have little ones. 

881
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:48,817
Stop worrying about me now and make sure to live happily, Mom and Dad. Okay?

882
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:51,637
You trust me. Right?

883
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:08,367
Geum Ra Hee.

884
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:12,587
You've got no right to cry.

885
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:21,527
You've got no right to punish.

886
01:09:27,437 --> 01:09:30,247
You've got no right to live.

887
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:38,507
You don't even have the right to die.

888
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:44,797
You...

889
01:09:49,717 --> 01:09:52,717
Because you're not human.

890
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:04,867

 Geum Ra Hee was Medusa.

 Geum Ra Hee is planning to destroy us all.

 That woman has our twins!

 Geum Ra Hee and Hwang Chan Seong are plotting something.

 If you keep violating the rules, I don't know what I'll do.

 Your mom died because you abandoned her.

 Let me kill Geum Ra Hee with my own hands.

 Great job finding your way to come all the way here.
