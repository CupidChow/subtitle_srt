1
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,430
   

2
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,670


3
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,040
   

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,980
 My goal has been set. 

5
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,120
 It's now time to punish the people who drove Da Mi to her death. 

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
 No one is allowed to be happy, including myself. 

7
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,260
 From now on, 

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,390
 that story will unfold. 

9
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,400
   

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
 You're so cool! 

11
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,850
Looks good.

12
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,000
   

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,630
   

14
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,120
- Hello! 
  - Hello! 

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,950
- Nice to meet you all! 
 - Come here!

16
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,990
Oh, my. Gosh, how lovely.

17
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,020
- Goodness, goodness. 
 - So sweet.

18
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,270
Eat a lot. Okay?

19
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,210
- Whoa, take this. 
 - This much?

20
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,580
There.

21
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,490
- Wait, take this, too. 
 - There.

22
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,900
What's the reason you continue to volunteer for children?

23
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,360
The children are our future.

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,330
Whether they have parents or not,

25
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,700
children must be protected by the system.

26
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,460
We, TikiTaka, only help construct the said system.

27
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,640
Hence, TikiTaka developed an application

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,400
called Children Home, which is used to find missing children.

29
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,450
We can prevent missing children by inserting a GPS chip through a simple surgical procedure.

30
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,530
It's unfortunate as there isn't much promo for it.

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,640
    
 Wishing no other parent will live in agony after losing their child like me,

32
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,170
TikiTaka will pay all fees for its services.

33
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,530
Cut!

34
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,970
We'll call it a day here. Thank you for your work.

35
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,620
- Thank you for your work. 
  - Thank you for your work. 

36
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,490
Thank you for your work.

37
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,310
Gosh, thank you.

38
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,670
A world-renowned director like you is participating in our documentary.

39
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,580
Of course. It's also an extension of my work with my movie, "To D."

40
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,390
You're right. It's coming out soon. Right?

41
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,660
Yes, the first teaser will soon come out.

42
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,050
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

43
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,170
Mom!

44
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,340
- Did you have fun today? 
 - Yeah.

45
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,760
- Did you eat your meal? 
 - Yes.

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,350
Huh? It's a clown!

47
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh, it's a clown!

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,540
Please make me a sword!

49
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,290
Make me a sword!

50
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,830
Mom, I got this from him.

51
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,300
It's great. What about Erica? What did Erica get?

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,810
Phillip, where's Erica?

53
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,340
I don't know.

54
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,580
- I want to go get one more— 
 - Wait!

55
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,690
You were with your older sister just now.

56
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,060
Where did your older sister go?

57
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,220
 Please make me a puppy! 

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,410
 I want an axe! 

59
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,390
   

60
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,610
An app for missing children isn't actually much different.

61
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,400
It registers children's fingerprints and automatically reports to the police

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,680
once they're reported missing.

63
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,310
If TikiTaka were the one who made it, the subscription rate would be high.

64
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,530
And wouldn't it also boost public confidence in Seoul's bidding?

65
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,290
"Hello to Korea" has been chosen for this matter already.

66
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,070
The Mayor also agreed that it was an innovative idea.

67
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,560
That's not an innovative technology.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,080
TikiTaka even has the ability to link CCTVs nationwide through the Internet of Things.

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,550
This bid is decided entirely from the perspective of the citizens—

70
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,390
I'm the executive deputy mayor.

71
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,920
This matter isn't your business, State Affairs Deputy Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,880
Did "Hello to Korea" ask for a special favor or something?

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,360
Everyone knows that the Executive Deputy Mayor's son received a scholarship from "Hello to Korea"—

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,180
You're being ridiculous!

75
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,630
Please make the final say, Mayor.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,440
I agree with the Executive Deputy Mayor's opinion.

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,650
Proceed with "Hello to Korea".

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,580
I apologize. Please excuse me.

79
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,620
 H-Honey! 

80
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,710
I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later.

81
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,940
 Erica disappeared! 

82
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,610
What?

83
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,550
She must've been kidnapped in front of the kindergarten!

84
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,840
Where are you right now?

85
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,330
Deputy Mayor Yang, where are you going in the middle of a meeting?

86
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,240
My daughter went missing. I'll be right back.

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,090
- Did you report her missing? 
 - Missing?

88
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,290
 Breaking news. State Affairs Deputy Mayor Yang Jin Mo's daughter has been abducted. 

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,860
 The abducted child is known as a lead role child actress. 

90
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,750
 It was confirmed the abductor demanded two billion won from her family as ransom. 

91
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,390
 The police are currently tracking the abducted child's location 

92
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,030
 using Children Home, developed by TikiTaka. 

93
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,530
It's Seoul Culture Forest. An abduction case is over if you miss the golden time.

94
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,080
Everyone, move out. Get on it!

95
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,520
 - Yes! 
 - Yes! 

96
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,630
This is Captain Nam Cheol Woo of the Special Crimes Unit.

97
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,600
I just confirmed the location of the abducted child in front of the International School.

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,960
   

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,490
Turn right 1 km from here.

100
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,540
I got it.

101
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,060
I beg the person who took Erica out of a momentary bad decision.

102
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,000
Please send Erica back.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,690
You shouldn't do anything bad to an innocent child.

104
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,070
I beg of you. All children in the world are our children.

105
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:59,210
I'd like to ask for everyone's attention and cooperation so that Erica can return safely to her parents.

106
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,170
   

107
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,580
 - We found her!  
 - Mom!

108
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,630
Hey, move aside!

109
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,110
I'm a policeman. It's okay.

110
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,490
I'll free you right now.

111
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,910
Let's go. I'm a policeman.

112
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,090
- Gosh! 
 - Mom!

113
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,670
Erica...

114
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,860
Erica!

115
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,410
- Mom! 
 - Erica!

116
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,350
Mom!

117
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,230
Are you okay? N-Nothing happened, right?

118
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,910
Did you get hurt?

119
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,900
I-I fell asleep, so I don't remember anything.

120
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,510
I was so scared.

121
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,630
Please give us a word.

122
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,810
Deputy Mayor, a word, please!

123
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,930
How does it feel to reunite with your daughter?

124
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,800
 Abducted daughter of the State Affairs Deputy Mayor of Seoul, Erica, 

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,070
 came back safely in half a day. 

126
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,330
 The swift tracking of Children Home by TikiTaka 

127
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,390
 made a decisive contribution in rescuing Erica. 

128
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,070
 After Erica's abduction, 

129
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,770
 the number of Children Home's subscribers went up by more than 30 times today. 

130
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,320
 Children Home registers children and their parents' DNAs and fingerprints 

131
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
 through a simple procedure to guarantee safety. 

132
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,210
 It's also expected to help greatly in long-term disappearance cases. 

133
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,180
 Blue House's spokesperson officially announced that they'd collaborate with TikiTaka 

134
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,060
 and nationally develop an AI-based disappearance platform for public safety. 

135
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,350
All right!

136
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,510
Cheers!

137
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,270
-  Cheers!  
 - Cheers.

138
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,750
With this project, TikiTaka's stock price hit an all-time high in a long time.

139
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,430
We also got the bid for Seoul.

140
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,100
Erica's abduction gave the public a reason to want Children Home.

141
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,050
The incentive would also be just as flashy. Right?

142
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,740
What are you doing?

143
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,260
The least you could do was not mess with my child.

144
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,700
How could you do such a thing without even telling me?

145
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,700
So, did Erica get hurt or something?

146
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,240
Was she traumatized or something?

147
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,090
Erica is the one who willingly agreed to do it.

148
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,890
As expected, are you the one who lured her in?

149
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,440
Did you forget the kind of woman I am?

150
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm a crazy bitch who abandons the child she gave birth to if it's for success.

151
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,790
What can't such a person do in this world?

152
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,230
Da Mi and my children are different. Don't compare them!

153
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,180
How are they different?

154
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Your children's mother is just as trashy.

155
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,740
See? You agree, as well.

156
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,350
How laughable.

157
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,980
Where are you going? I'm not done talking!

158
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,040
H-Hey, Myeong Ji, take it easy.

159
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,700
There's no need to get worked up.

160
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,300
Erica only went for a drive with me safely and ate delicious food, too.

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,020
She said it didn't scare her at all, thinking it was only an act.

162
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,810
From now on, don't even think about messing with my kids or using them!

163
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,770
I won't cooperate even if it's your order, Matthew.

164
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,160
Rather, I will bring it all down!

165
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,150
Go Myeong Ji!

166
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,870
Keep this hand to yourself from now on.

167
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,330
I'll let you go once, but I won't hold back a second time.

168
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,520
You must be mistaken, but I'm not your real husband.

169
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,660
For the same reason, Erica and Phillip aren't my kids either.

170
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,250
So don't cross the line.

171
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,540
Yang Jin Mo!

172
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,730
Why did you do that? What good would it do to annoy Matthew?

173
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,730
We're living in the golden age right now.

174
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,950
Look the other way once, and this is the paradise.

175
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,880
Still, Yang Jin Mo was against this plan to the end.

176
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
That's why we left him out and proceeded.

177
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,870
He was probably just as scared as you were earlier.

178
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,350
I think he was also confused if it was real or not.

179
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,690
- Let's go. 
 - We'll go ahead.

180
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,830
 The least you could do was not mess with my child. 

181
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,350
 How could you do such a thing without even telling me? 

182
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,940
 From now on, don't even think about messing with my kids or using them! 

183
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,440
Noh Hannah, are you alive?

184
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,440
 She's probably out of money. Why isn't she contacting me even once? 

185
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,940
 Are you dead or alive? 

186
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,440
 Nothing terrible happened to you by chance. Right? 

187
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,840
 Please be okay. 

188
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,040
Dad, did you sleep well?

189
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes.

190
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,860
You were worried a lot yesterday. Right?

191
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,810
I sleep well, and I'm totally fine.

192
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,740
Erica. Phillip, it's time for breakfast!

193
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,240
It's duck meat, my favorite!

194
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,520
I got a bit carried away yesterday.

195
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,690
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,870
I messaged you today's schedule.

197
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,040
In the evening, there's a couple's thing at Sian Gallery—

198
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,940
You can go alone.

199
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,440
What about breakfast?

200
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,460
What did you talk about with Dad?

201
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,190
We didn't talk about anything.

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
He didn't even ask you if you were okay?

203
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,540
It's so tacky to ask such things.

204
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,440
He can just tell I'm okay at a glance.

205
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,630
I'm really happy you married Dad, Mom.

206
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,050
I'm happy my dream came true.

207
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,990
By the way, would Dad think so, too?

208
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,770
Why? Do you think Dad doesn't?

209
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,930
N-No reason. He always seems to be thinking about something else.

210
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,870
 I married you as Matthew ordered. 

211
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,370
 But we can never become a real family. 

212
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,110
 There's no need to continue the show at home, too. 

213
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,590
 You don't need to care about me, and I... 

214
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,640
-  Go Myeong Ji.  
 - Yes.

215
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,940
 Did you forget to report to me about Yang Jin Mo? 

216
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,990
He just left for work.

217
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,560
He's not doing anything suspicious yet.

218
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,660
One, two, three!

219
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,770
It's tiring, right?

220
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,730
Fighting!

221
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,340
Why is a day so long?

222
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,540
They annoy me so much by pointing cameras and taking pictures starting from the early morning breeze.

223
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,440
Are you trying to visit every single orphanage in the country?

224
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,540
It's what Lee Hwi So had promised to do.

225
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,140
That damned Lee Hwi So! Lee Hwi So! Lee Hwi So!

226
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,140
 Quite hellish, isn't it? 

227
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,880
 But you'll have to keep feeling this. 

228
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,350
 The chains of Lee Hwi So you created yourself. 

229
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,390
I'm curious about something.

230
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,370
What's the real reason you developed the Children Home app?

231
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,240
Why are you curious about that?

232
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,330
Because it really doesn't suit you.

233
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,740
What more are you trying to gain with everyone's fingerprints and DNA?

234
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,140
You'll find out if you just wait and see. Right?

235
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,240
   

236
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,140
The teaser for "To D" is finally released.

237
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,170
   

238
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,700
   
 It seems Ms. Bang, known for the Pom Girl incident, has been just gunned down. 

239
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,690
 Everyone, Min Deul Re's the one who gave birth! 

240
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,770
 I'm sorry I couldn't keep your secret to the end. 

241
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,040
 That's not the point right now— 

242
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,150
   

243
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,590
   

244
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,940
- What's the matter? 
 - Let me talk to Matthew.

245
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
Put Matthew on the phone right now!

246
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,740
He's not someone you can order around.

247
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,440
 He had quite the schedule today. 

248
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,240
If you've got something to say, come here and talk to me.

249
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,640
 Hello? 

250
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,160
Hello—

251
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,040
   

252
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,040
Michelle, I told you.

253
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,480
Matthew is K, Shim Joon Seok.

254
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,240
Right now, you're helping your sister's killer.

255
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,560
You still want me to believe that?

256
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,800
You had deceived me to save yourself.

257
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,510
The movie contains everything you did to Da Mi and Ji Ah.

258
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,430
I hope you'll be trembling with a thankful heart.

259
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,790
Cut the crazy nonsense. I'll stop it by any means.

260
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,910
That's what you wish you could do.

261
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,770
The premiere will be streamed globally through global OTT as soon as it is over.

262
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,840
Aren't you looking forward to the aftermath?

263
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,440
Your enemy is K.

264
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,230
Why are you so set out to kill me?

265
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,340
Michelle, I'll help you expose that Matthew is K.

266
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,640
If what you're saying is true, prove it yourself.

267
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,040
Bring in your daughter and compare her DNA with Chairman Matthew.

268
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,340
I'll believe you after that.

269
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,290
The child disappeared. I don't know where she is, either.

270
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,610
I don't have anything more to say, then.

271
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,520
Michelle! Michelle!

272
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,640
You should watch where you're going!

273
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,660
Aren't you the one who wasn't looking?

274
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,760
Han Mo Ne?

275
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,440
I won't ask for the laundry fee, so get lost.

276
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,540
Should I just buy you a new one?

277
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,240
Contact me instead of complaining about it later.

278
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm Hwang Chan Seong.

279
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,650
What took you so long?

280
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,440
Whoa, see how elastic it feels.

281
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,140
What?

282
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,640
Did something happen?

283
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,340
Matthew promised to stop the movie from releasing.

284
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,540
But why did a teaser come out?

285
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,140
Matthew probably couldn't help it, either.

286
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,040
It's up to the director.

287
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,310
Don't talk like it's got nothing to do with you.

288
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,220
Aren't you my agency's CEO?

289
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,220
Hey! Your attitude is getting on my nerves.

290
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,630
How you act like you're second only to Matthew.

291
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm sorry for rebelling against you all this time, CEO Geum.

292
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,460
Please bring down the teaser.

293
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,110
No, please stop the movie from opening.

294
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,960
If it was made to screw over Seongchan Group in the first place, there's no point anymore.

295
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,940
If you save me just this once, I'll do everything you say.

296
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,140
Dramas, commercials... All of them!

297
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,760
Can you really do that?

298
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,280
Yes, I promise.

299
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,090
Okay, I'll try talking to Matthew.

300
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,640
If the movie comes out, neither of us have anything to gain.

301
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,940
Instead, try not to let Matthew catch you for a while.

302
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,140
Thank you, CEO Geum.

303
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,340
I can really trust you, CEO Geum. Right?

304
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,680
Of course.

305
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,580
You're my daughter, after all.

306
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,200
 Kick Han Mo Ne out. 

307
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,070
Do you mean it?

308
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:47,100
After the teaser was released, people are already asking if Mo Ne is Min Deul Re.

309
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,870
Her Myeongju Girls' High School classmates are also making their move.

310
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,930
Once the movie comes out, even more people will say Mo Ne is Shim Joon Seok's woman.

311
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,880
If Mo Ne gets attacked,

312
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,240
we'll also be in the line of fire for accepting Mo Ne as TikiTaka Studio's actor.

313
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,520
We can just say we were deceived, too.

314
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,400
That we found out the truth only later.

315
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,380
We were planning to cast Mo Ne, the offender, for the movie

316
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,320
and dramatically expose her at the premiere.

317
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,590
Geum Ra Hee, at times like this,

318
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,050
you're even more ruthless than I am.

319
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,470
We can't let a brat like Han Mo Ne trouble us.

320
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,210
We'll have her buried properly this time.

321
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,940
Right. How's the meeting with CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save coming along?

322
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,230
Even today, they posted an article blatantly dissing me on their main page. 
    

323
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,370
It's not so easy.

324
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,550
He's so rude and haughty that I can't even reach him.

325
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,410
You said you'll bet your life on my image-making.

326
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,350
But you still haven't brought Hwang Chan Seong to me?

327
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,920
 Save takes up 95% of the portal service market. 

328
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,690
 They've got more influence than TikiTaka since our main platform is SNS. 

329
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,880
 It's really unpleasant and extremely annoying. 

330
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,190
If I can get Save somehow and merge it with TikiTaka's app,

331
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:22,090
I can get a hold of the weaknesses of every single person on this planet.

332
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,880
After that, I don't need to bother becoming a president who only serves for five years

333
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,570
to put South Korea entirely under my feet.

334
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,080
 That's what you wanted, huh? 

335
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,210
I can finally see the picture now.

336
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,660
The reason your obsessed over Children Home.

337
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,690
You need the entire Korean population's information. Right?

338
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,240
I'll help you realize that dream soon.

339
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,370
So far, you were the only thing I sought after...

340
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,810
but couldn't get.

341
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,648
Grandma!

342
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,398
Did you wait for me? Aren't you hungry?

343
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,298
Hannah wants to eat pumpkin pancakes.

344
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:51,368
That's why I harvested a lot of pumpkins and potatoes.

345
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:56,328
Whoa! Grandma, you're the best. Whoa!

346
00:25:56,328 --> 00:26:00,918
Oh, I drew your face because I was bored.

347
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:07,288
Ta-da.

348
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,588
You think Grandma's this pretty?

349
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,798
Of course.

350
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,678
You're the prettiest after my mom.

351
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:27,588
Where did you get this?

352
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:32,698
I don't know. Someone left it here.

353
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:41,208
The sketchbook has a really nice scent.

354
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:46,678
You can't run into anyone!

355
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:50,438
If someone comes to the house, make sure to hide! Okay?

356
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:52,868
Don't worry, Grandma.

357
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,468
I'm smart.

358
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:12,328
   

359
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:15,878
   

360
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,808
 Min Deul Re's the one who gave birth! 

361
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:21,788
 Please believe what I'm about to tell you! 

362
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,318
   

363
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,348
He's not available for a call today, either?

364
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:37,938
Chairman Matthew really wishes to meet CEO Hwang Chan Seong.

365
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:41,118
We're okay with whichever time he chooses.

366
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,158
Please tell CEO Hwang Chan Seong.

367
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:48,388
It's definitely not a loss for Save.

368
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:50,488
Yes, thank you.

369
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:54,028
- What's the matter? 
 - You said you'd take down the teaser.

370
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:57,028
But you let the second teaser come out as well?

371
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:04,648
I'm realizing how naive you are.

372
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:08,378
Why would Matthew stop the movie when he went through so much to become Lee Hwi So?

373
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:13,378
To Lee Hwi So, this movie is the best way to publicize how unjustly his daughter was treated.

374
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,158
Don't you think so?

375
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:20,088
You were lying when you said you'd help me from the get-go?

376
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:23,738
All of your Myeongju Girls' High School classmates remember what happened that day.

377
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:27,198
Da Mi called you out as the one who gave birth and died.

378
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:30,338
So how can I silence 500 people?

379
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,988
Leave the country while you can.

380
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:35,258
I'm going to talk to Matthew myself.

381
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,258
It's no use.

382
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,748
Because Matthew won't meet with you.

383
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:52,108
CEO Geum, do you think I'll just go down easy?

384
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:57,558
I'll expose what kind of a mother you were to Bang Da Mi.

385
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,988
How?

386
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,008
Do you have proof?

387
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:15,408
Who would believe you when you're the offender?

388
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:19,278
No matter how much you bark or dare,

389
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,988
you're no match for me.

390
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:28,228
Goodbye, my daughter, Mo Ne.

391
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,808
I'll never go down alone.

392
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:03,408
 Hey, Mo Ne. Is there something you want me to do? 

393
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,398
You know where Michelle's staying. Right?

394
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,268
Find everything about Ji Ah there.

395
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:12,278
Bring me everything like diaries!

396
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,898
If you don't, we're all dead.

397
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,508
 Chairman Matthew really wishes to meet CEO Hwang Chan Seong. 

398
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:31,408
 We're okay with whichever time he chooses. 

399
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,598
 Hwang Chan Seong? 

400
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:40,858
   
 Save... 

401
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:50,978
I knew it. The heavens are still on my side.

402
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:59,748
What kind of manner is it to come to someone's home like a stray cat

403
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,868
in the middle of the night?

404
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:05,828
This was the only way to meet you.

405
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:10,228
Cancel the opening of the movie.

406
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:15,038
Why would I do that?

407
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:24,068
Michelle knows you're Shim Joon Seok.

408
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:27,198
That you killed Song Ji Ah.

409
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:29,518
I told her everything.

410
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:33,028
Geum Ra Hee's foresight is impressive.

411
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,908
As expected, you were betraying me.

412
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:41,338
However, nothing will change even if Michelle knows.

413
00:31:41,338 --> 00:31:44,608
The image of Lee Hwi So I've been building up

414
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:47,378
won't crumble so easily.

415
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,958
I'm Lee Hwi So.

416
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:53,258
The national hero, Lee Hwi So.

417
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:56,638
Wasn't it strange a master like Michelle would waste her time

418
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,928
filming a documentary on Lee Hwi So?

419
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:05,688
She's been at your side 24/7 to film everything you do to get the proof you're Shim Joon Seok.

420
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:10,138
Michelle's been observing me, huh?

421
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,098
That's simple, then!

422
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:23,328
I can just kill her along with you, who ran her mouth off the wrong way.

423
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:32,908
You came to see me at this late hour just to talk about this?

424
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:38,178
If you've got nothing more to say, stop wasting my time and go sleep.

425
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:47,098
What if I'll let you meet CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save?

426
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:57,828
You will? Even Geum Ra Hee couldn't do that.

427
00:32:57,828 --> 00:33:00,148
I'm Han Mo Ne.

428
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:02,988
I can even let you right now.

429
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,541
   

430
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:21,978
 Yes, Mo Ne. I've been waiting all evening since you said you'd call. 

431
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,998
I'm sorry, Chan Seong.

432
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:26,678
 Do you have time tomorrow? Let's meet. 

433
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:29,968
Gosh, I don't think I have time tomorrow.

434
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,218
One second.

435
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:35,581
   

436
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,488
I'll get rid of Director Michelle for you.

437
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:50,628
Seriously, where is it?

438
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:03,298
Did Han Mo Ne tell you to steal Ji Ah's diary?

439
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:07,188
Kim So Yeon!

440
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,888
 How did it go? 

441
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:36,098
Of course, we succeeded.

442
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:37,638
Good job.

443
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:41,108
By the way, why did you want Michelle?

444
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:44,648
I just made my move before Mo Ne could.

445
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:51,048
We can't trash TikiTaka Studio's first blockbuster just because of Mo Ne.

446
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,248
Do you intend to get rid of Mo Ne?

447
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:55,588
Han Mo Ne is a school violence offender.

448
00:34:55,588 --> 00:35:01,208
It's not fair for trash like her to live in this society acting all innocent.

449
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:05,928
 Keep Michelle until tomorrow and just bring her safely to the premiere. 

450
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:10,758
So that Michelle can expose her properly,

451
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:14,658
I'll only set the mood for her.

452
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,868
She gets scarier the more you know her.

453
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,028
Why does CEO Geum hate Mo Ne so much?

454
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:25,788
Geum Ra Hee hates everyone.

455
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:30,918
What the heck?

456
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:37,798
- What's this? 
 - What?

457
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:39,568
What the hell is this? What?

458
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,508
Hey!

459
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:44,028
- What is this! 
 - I can't see!

460
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,098
What is this!

461
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:50,048
   

462
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,198
   

463
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:59,878
Gosh, the windshield broke.

464
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:05,678
No, the side view mirror!

465
00:36:05,678 --> 00:36:09,658
Hey, you crazy punk! How dare you drive like this?

466
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:13,258
Do you know who I am? I'm the captain of the Special Crimes Unit!

467
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:14,568
Who the hell are you?

468
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:17,978
Hey, you better apologize and take off your helmet!

469
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:21,588
You asshole— Hey, you!

470
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:24,258
W-What are you— Whoa!

471
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,248
Get out of the way!

472
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:30,138
What are you doing? Get the hit-and-run criminal!

473
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:32,358
That asshole!

474
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,948
Damn it! He's dead!

475
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:37,238
Honey, get in!

476
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,038
What's this?

477
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:42,018
H-Honey...

478
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:45,158
Michelle d-disappeared.

479
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:48,478
W-What—

480
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:52,328
- She was just here. 
 - Hurry up and call CEO Geum.

481
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:54,028
What are you doing? Call her right now.

482
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,148
We can't.

483
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:59,798
We'll get an earful anyway. Why let her in advance?

484
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:04,708
Don't answer CEO Geum's calls for a while, and we'll stay out of this matter.

485
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,528
Yeah?

486
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,698
 Min Do Hyeok, protect Michelle. 

487
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:26,858
 That's how you can come out into the world. 

488
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,628
   

489
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:47,438
   

490
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,421
   

491
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:37,868
Min Do Hyeok?

492
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:45,008
What's going on here?

493
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:47,938
You were almost kidnapped.

494
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:51,578
Han Mo Ne ordered Kim So Yeon to steal Ji Ah's diary.

495
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,708
She was trying to blackmail you.

496
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:59,758
So that she could use it to expose that you were the one who killed your father, not Ji Ah.

497
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:01,568
I don't care.

498
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:05,808
If Han Mo Ne's crime could be revealed, she could go ahead.

499
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:08,878
But there are too many people who are after you right now.

500
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:10,798
It's better for you to get out of this now.

501
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,528
I don't want to do that!

502
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:16,508
I'm also going to be a part of your plan to the end.

503
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,928
It's an edited copy of the documentary.

504
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:23,888
Play this at the premiere.

505
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,558
I'll lure Matthew.

506
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:32,508
Fine. The D-day is tomorrow, the day of the premiere.

507
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:35,408
As long as this plan succeeds,

508
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,708
you can come back out into the world.

509
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:47,488
 K, when we meet again, 

510
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,008
 what will your face look like? 

511
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:58,699
   

512
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:03,479
   

513
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,859
   

514
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:11,419
Fill up the first row with Myeongju Girls' High School graduates.

515
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,439
Yes, CEO Geum.

516
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,299
You still don't know where Michelle is?

517
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,219
I think she went into hiding on purpose.

518
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:24,149
 She must be planning to hide somewhere and go straight to the premiere. 

519
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,519
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

520
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,679
I already have people deployed at the premiere. So she'll get caught soon.

521
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,869
I already have people deployed at the premiere. So she'll get caught soon.

522
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:37,679
I don't think I told you to sit.

523
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:42,829
Did you want to see me because of what happened last time?

524
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,519
I do admit I stepped out of line, but it was too harsh of you to use my child.

525
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:54,159
Don't you know who got rid of your label as a corrupt teacher?

526
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,309
If I didn't launder your identity,

527
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:01,129
do you think you’re going to turn a blind eye and live your life pretending to be a human being?!

528
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:03,639
That's why I did everything you told me to do, Chairman!

529
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,319
I'm faking a marriage to Yang Jin Mo and monitoring him to report to you every day!

530
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:14,239
To ignore what happened, left too big of a scratch on my pride.

531
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,519
So, I'd like you to show me that you are clearly

532
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:27,079
submitting to me.

533
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:08,219
Hello. Thank you, everyone, for attending today's premium premiere of "To D."

534
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:11,802
    
 The case of Bang Da Mi, which saddened the nation in the past, as a motive...

535
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:13,902
Looks like Chairman Matthew isn't here yet?

536
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:15,169
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

537
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:17,799
You know he's always punctual.

538
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:21,802
Oh, my. You didn't know, huh?

539
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:24,502
I just talked to him on the phone.

540
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,949
- He said he'd be about 10 minutes late because of traffic. 
 - Before we begin,

541
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:30,079
let me introduce CEO Geum Ra Hee, who produced the movie "To D."

542
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,579
Please welcome her with a big round of applause.

543
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,759
 The movie won't be showing today. 

544
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:37,369
 Because Matthew will stop it. 

545
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:42,902
Don't put on a brave face.

546
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,809
You'll crash today.

547
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:50,719
 You probably can't even fathom what's waiting for you. 

548
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:01,402
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes.

549
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:16,902
I'm ready, Hyung.

550
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:21,519
Let's go.

551
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:28,892
   

552
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,369
Take Michelle away if you see her, so she can't come near the premiere.

553
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:40,399
Yes, I understand.

554
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:52,102
Director Michelle?

555
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:54,039
Did you come to the premiere?

556
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,849
 Of course, I came to get you, K. 

557
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:00,002
What?

558
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:03,002
   
 Come to the hallway on the fourth floor alone. 

559
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:08,199
Otherwise, the viewers will get to watch the video proof that you're Shim Joon Seok.

560
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,402
 Nice to meet you. 

561
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:26,402
Thank you, everyone, for spending your precious time to be here.

562
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:32,299
The movie "To D" was created based on a true story.

563
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:39,909
It's the story of my daughter, Da Mi, who was used by Shim Joon Seok of Seongchan Group.

564
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:41,829
Also...

565
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,819
it's a movie that exposes a cruel school violence offender.

566
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,189
Before I'm a producer,

567
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,519
I'm also an ordinary mother.

568
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,789
And at this moment,

569
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:04,602
I'm overcome with so many feelings.

570
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:20,879
K...

571
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,619
Huh? Who?

572
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:27,859
Oh, never mind. I must've been mistaken.

573
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,219
Who is that?

574
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:38,002
It's him, right?

575
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,702
It's Shim Joon Seok, Seongchan Group's son!

576
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:43,602
I do think it's him, but that doesn't make sense.

577
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:45,402
Matthew is Shim Joon Seok.

578
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,949
How could there be another Shim Joon Seok?

579
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,469
Am I wrong? H-Hey! Hey!

580
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:52,469
H-Hey, Yang Jin Mo!

581
00:45:58,329 --> 00:45:59,559
W-Wait—

582
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,709
W-Wait, that's him. Right?

583
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:04,229
Get him. Get him!

584
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,802
Stop right there!

585
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:19,719
   

586
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:32,619
How gutsy of you to come alone like this to meet me.

587
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:35,079
You said you even know who I am.

588
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,619
Are you trying to avenge Song Ji Ah or something, Song Ji Seon?

589
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,002
I'm warning you.

590
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:45,102
Don't say my sister's name with your filthy mouth, you crazy psychopath.

591
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,559
It must've been hard to hold back your murderous urge.

592
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,802
So try to kill me like you killed my sister.

593
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:55,402
Hurry up and kill me. What are you waiting for?

594
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:57,809
Kill me!

595
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,939
It's hilarious to be provoked like this.

596
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:07,749
It looks like I'm supposed to try to kill you in your scenario.

597
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:10,702
But do I look that stupid to you?

598
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,402
Huh?

599
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:34,202
Da Mi's Myeongju Girls' High School alumni are also here today.

600
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:36,729
Could you stand up, please?

601
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,769
Da Mi's friends who plucked up the courage to willingly attend,

602
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:49,509
thank you so much.

603
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:55,589
All right, now. I'd like to introduce Chairman Matthew Lee of TikiTaka and

604
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,839
the producer of this movie.

605
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,369
Please welcome him with an applause.

606
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:16,359
Chairman Matthew? Have you not arrived yet?

607
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:20,369
Could I say a word instead of the Chairman, please?

608
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:34,202
Oh, sure.

609
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:42,809
I apologize. Chairman Matthew is in too much of a shock right now.

610
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:45,702
So I have to stand here in his place.

611
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:52,502
Right. I'm Go Myeong Ji, Da Mi's homeroom teacher at Myeongju Girls' High School.

612
00:48:54,169 --> 00:48:58,219
 You're telling me to insult my student again? 

613
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,502
 I'd rather die than do that. 

614
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,602
 You can't do it? 

615
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:10,529
 In that case, divorce Yang Jin Mo and return all the money you got from me so far. 

616
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:15,229
 You and your brats will have to go on the streets to pay for the interest, too. 

617
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:17,929
 Will you be okay? 

618
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:23,929
The Chairman and I found out a crucial fact today.

619
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:29,602
We finally found who framed Da Mi and actually gave birth

620
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:32,602
to Shim Joon Seok's child.

621
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:38,202
The bully of Myeongju Girls' High School and Da Mi's school violence offender.

622
00:49:38,202 --> 00:49:41,202
It was a student named Song Ji Ah.

623
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:46,902
 Did you see that? You can never beat me, CEO Geum. 

624
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,929
 Because Matthew is ultimately on my side. 

625
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:54,709
 Han Mo Ne, is this really all you prepared? 

626
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:02,669
What's more shocking is that Director Michelle is Song Ji Ah's older sister.

627
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,529
- What? 
 - It's Director Michelle?

628
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:07,499
That's not all.

629
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:10,402
Director Michelle had murdered her own father in the past

630
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:16,202
and framed her juvenile sister, who was 13 years old at the time, in her place.

631
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:21,902
She even laundered her identity by getting adopted by American parents, ever so shamelessly.

632
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:25,702
Song Ji Ah's flawed personality that made her play bully at school

633
00:50:25,702 --> 00:50:30,039
was also caused by the trauma of getting abandoned by Director Michelle.

634
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:42,789
You're a trashy son of a bitch, even to the end.

635
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,789
I wasn't going to show this movie in the first place.

636
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:52,002
I was after securing the proof that you're Shim Joon Seok.

637
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:56,502
Fortunately, the documentary I filmed recorded a lot of your true colors.

638
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:59,769
Fuck this. You fucking bitch!

639
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:07,939
Therefore, Chairman Matthew decided to cancel the showing of the movie "To D"

640
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,619
which cost 100 billion won without hesitation.

641
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,649
He clearly expressed his will to

642
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:19,789
throw away the movie, even if it'll cause him a great financial loss.

643
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,802
Somebody help! Please save me!

644
00:51:25,802 --> 00:51:30,502
Please help! Shim Joon Seok is trying to kill me!

645
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:32,402
Get away from me!

646
00:51:32,402 --> 00:51:34,299
Michelle?

647
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:45,069
 Congrats on becoming the main character of my posthumous work, K. 

648
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:16,239
 This wasn't a part of my plan. 

649
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:22,919
 What's going on? 

650
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:25,139
 Look over there! 

651
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:28,359
Hey, that really is Chairman Matthew!

652
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:30,539
This is insane!

653
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,829
 Mister, this is the yuzu tart we made. 

654
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:40,869
 Gosh, what's all this about? 

655
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:43,879
 It's really tasty. Give it a taste. 

656
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:46,499
 I told you to get lost! 

657
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,919
Gosh, Lee Hwi So, you had to fucking bother me in your grave.

658
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:02,899
 You're a murderer! 

659
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:16,769
What the heck?

660
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:20,569
No way.

661
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:22,809
How am I...

662
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:31,679
Wait—

663
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:39,339
 It's a trap. There's a bastard going around with Shim Joon Seok's face in here. 

664
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:41,459
 Catch him! 

665
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:50,889
   

666
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:54,579
 I saw him, too. It was K, without a doubt. 

667
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,489
 K? No way! 

668
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,339
 I thought Matthew was K. 

669
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,679
 I saw him, too. He disappeared without a trace. 

670
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:02,839
 No way. What happened to Michelle? 

671
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,989
 I'll see for myself if Michelle is dead or not. 

672
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,799
What on earth?

673
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,239
Michelle disappeared!

674
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:23,879
What the? What happened?

675
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:47,099
How may I help you?

676
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,889
Serial killer Shim Joon Seok has appeared.

677
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:52,529
I need the CCTV footage.

678
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,199
You lost a lot of blood.

679
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,299
I'm okay.

680
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:06,409
Why'd you act out of our plan?

681
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:09,939
You said you'd drag it out for the video to be played.

682
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,289
What if you had died?

683
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,909
This was the best I could do.

684
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:27,699
 Hey, Chairman Matthew! 

685
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,869
 This is insane! 

686
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:41,212
 He escaped! 

687
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:47,209
 Please call the ambulance! 

688
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:54,269
Even if I die, I won't regret it.

689
00:55:54,269 --> 00:56:00,119
Today's mission was my last act as a director.

690
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:07,489
Ji Ah asked for Da Mi's forgiveness in her own way.

691
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,739
You can also...

692
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:15,089
put down the burden you were carrying.

693
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:23,569
I want my lawyer. I said it wasn't me.

694
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,459
I said it wasn't me!

695
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:27,119
I really didn't do it! Wait!

696
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,179
Hey! Gosh, seriously.

697
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:32,429
 Hurry up and take him! We saw him! 

698
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:34,499
 He killed her! 

699
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,719
Hey, it's Chairman Matthew!

700
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:44,809
 Here comes Chairman Matthew! 

701
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:47,989
Don't just drag me! Bring in my lawyer!

702
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:52,349
Lee Hwi So, Shim Joon Seok wasn't found at the scene.

703
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:55,639
You're under emergency arrest as the culprit of a murder right now.

704
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:57,879
Are you really Lee Hwi So?

705
00:56:57,879 --> 00:57:00,539
Director Michelle referred to you as Shim Joon Seok.

706
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:01,999
Do you have anything to say?

707
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:03,839
Shouldn't we check his identity again?

708
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,759
She clearly called him Shim Joon Seok.

709
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,329
I guess he's really a murderer.

710
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:10,199
A serial killer!

711
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,929
There he is!

712
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,099
One moment!

713
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:19,579
Chairman Matthew isn't the culprit.

714
00:57:28,259 --> 00:57:31,199
As Michelle pointed out, Shim Joon Seok is the culprit.

715
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:32,849
It's not Chairman Matthew.

716
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,649
You'd know if you checked the CCTV yourself.

717
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:39,279
This is the footage taken moments ago.

718
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:51,039
Shim Joon Seok was here to kill Director Michelle in person.

719
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:53,729
So he can stop the movie from being shown.

720
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:58,549
He killed Michelle and moved her elsewhere.

721
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,549
We saw Shim Joon Seok with our own eyes.

722
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,439
Isn't that right?

723
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,539
Yes, she's right! I saw him, too.

724
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:16,799
At today's premiere, the real Shim Joon Seok showed up.

725
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,429
However, it was his original face without any plastic surgery.

726
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:22,609
I saw him, too!

727
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:26,049
I'm State Affairs, Deputy Mayor. I saw him clearly, too.

728
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:29,839
I'm the captain of the Special Crimes Unit. I saw him as well.

729
00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:34,849
Is he the man you saw, Chairman Matthew?

730
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:38,339
Yes, he was clearly Shim Joon Seok.

731
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:41,179
The original Shim Joon Seok without plastic surgery.

732
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:47,489
I'm just devastated that I couldn't stop the murder even though I was at the scene.

733
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:53,429
It seems we were mistaken.

734
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,359
I apologize.

735
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:02,279
What about the video from earlier?

736
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:05,119
The documentary footage Director Michelle seemed to have filmed.

737
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,629
That's a deepfake video, not the one filmed by Director Michelle.

738
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:14,839
Shim Joon Seok tried to make me out to be Shim Joon Seok once again today.

739
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:16,439
Just like what Chairman Shim Yong attempted.

740
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:23,009
Then, are you taking back the statement that Shim Joon Seok got surgery to look like Min Do Hyeok?

741
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:26,649
Yes, I'll acknowledge that.

742
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:30,589
I also fell for the fake news.

743
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:34,829
Shim Joon Seok didn't get any plastic surgery at all.

744
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:37,189
Min Do Hyeok is not guilty.

745
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:41,119
I'm very sorry.

746
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:47,679
 Min Do Hyeok, this is the end of what I can do for you. 

747
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:53,819
Chairman Matthew, what would you tell Min Do Hyeok, who's been on the run and mistaken for Shim Joon Seok?

748
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:57,489
I have nothing else to say but that I'm sorry.

749
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:01,039
If Min Do Hyeok is hiding out somewhere,

750
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,689
I'll help him clear his name and use all of TikiTaka's powers

751
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:08,759
to support his safety and livelihood.

752
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:15,259
 He's been long dead anyway. 

753
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:20,859
 Serial Killer Shim Joon Seok committed another crime after one year. 

754
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:25,949
 Contrary to what is known, he appeared at the movie "To D" premiere without any plastic surgery. 

755
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:30,169
 He pushed Director Michelle off over the railing and disappeared. 

756
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:32,439
 The police are looking at the several murders and... 

757
01:00:32,439 --> 01:00:34,899
Who the heck was that bastard?

758
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:36,929
No way.

759
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:40,699
Come on, now.

760
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:49,489
That fucking lunatic.

761
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:17,199
Who the hell dares to pretend he's Shim Joon Seok?

762
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:39,389
K, long time no see.

763
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:42,999
Thanks for your work

764
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,369
on bringing me out into the world.

765
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,409
It really was you, huh?

766
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:52,839
You're the only bastard who'd scheme something like this.

767
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:55,419
You managed to survive, Min Do Hyeok.

768
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:59,089
♫  Let's burn down  ♫

769
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:05,259
♫  Oh, let's burn down  ♫

770
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:12,909
♫  You can't shoot me down with your arrows of lies  ♫

771
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:18,039
♫  ‘Cause I’m killer. I’m the winner in this war  ♫

772
01:02:21,459 --> 01:02:24,909
♫  I'll let you burn down  ♫

773
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:45,139
 Mom, 

774
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:48,429
 I feel sorry for Medusa. 

775
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:52,099
 Medusa used to be really pretty. 

776
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:57,039
 But she was cursed, and her hair turned into snakes. 

777
01:02:57,699 --> 01:03:02,419
 But still, she scared people and did bad things. 

778
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:05,189
 It's because she was too lonely. 

779
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:08,249
 She hid because she was so shy. 

780
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:12,039
 I, for one, won't hate her. 

781
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:24,102


782
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:02,379
 Min Do Hyeok. 

783
01:04:02,379 --> 01:04:04,409
 Get moving. 

784
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,049
 You're the only one who can still punish us. 

785
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:17,679
   

786
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,399
 Min Do Hyeok was alive! 

787
01:04:19,399 --> 01:04:21,169
 There's a traitor among us. 

788
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:22,679
 Is it you? Or is it you? 

789
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,019
 Congrats on making it out alive. 

790
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:26,199
 - Who are you? 
 - Medusa. 

791
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:30,029
 Min Do Hyeok, our secret cooperation begins now. 

792
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:32,169
 I don't know how Chairman Matthew knew, but... 

793
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:34,129
 He said he'll take responsibility for my life. 

794
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:36,569
 That asshole! He's toying with me right now! 

795
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:40,799
 Seongchan Group heir's entrance is already different. 

796
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,309
 Don't panic, you bastard.
