1
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,990
   

2
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,300
   

3
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,260
Don't move!

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,000
Min Do Hyeok isn't a murderer.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,950
I swear on our baby.

6
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,820
Yang Jin Mo sacrificed himself to protect his family.

7
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,330
It's also a pure lie the police are protecting Yang Jin Mo's kids.

8
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,760
The kids have been with us the entire time!

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,380
We only follow orders from our higher-ups.

10
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,400
You're under arrest for obstruction of justice.

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,350
Do you really think Min Do Hyeok is a murderer?

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,880
You all had this thought, too. You had your doubts!

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,710
That Min Do Hyeok isn't the culprit.

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,730
That Matthew might be Shim Joon Seok.

15
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,580
That we might've been fooled. Am I wrong?

16
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,440
Why do you blindly follow those absurd orders?

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,020
Why won't you do anything?

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,190
Do we have any power?

19
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,300
We have to follow the orders since we're an organization!

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,880
That's why Bang Da Mi died!

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,010
Because no one stopped a bastard like me when I went crazy and did as I please!

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,060
Because no one defended her!

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,570
How painful must it have been?

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,270
All alone.

25
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,290
She was all alone like that. Shit!

26
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,550
At this rate,

27
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,500
Min Do Hyeok will also die like Bang Da Mi.

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,660
We'll be taking an innocent life yet again.

29
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,300
Is that really what you want to do?

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,610
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,890
 As we're about to start the grand project, we'll have 

32
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,760
    
 a ribbon-cutting ceremony prior to the main event.

33
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,110
Three, two, one!

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,600
   
   

35
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,850
It's this way.

36
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,750
I've got a job for you.

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,140
After I enter the presentation forum,

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,970
please upload the videos on this laptop in order.

39
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,640
I got it.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,270
 A grand project Korea and TikiTaka are working on together. 

41
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,170
We'll now begin its long-awaited first moment right now.

42
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,450
He's the person who worked the hardest for this moment.

43
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,250
The word "pioneer" fits him better than anyone else.

44
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,510
Please welcome Chairman Matthew Lee!

45
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,610
   
   

46
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,900
Thank you for spending your valuable time to be here today.

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,060
I'm moved to see those who helped with Gagok District's national project

48
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,140
from the stage like this.

49
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,320
This is justice and a miracle.

50
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,270
I'll keep it short.

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,530
I'll repay you with the results.

52
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,920
There's TikiTaka's pride I've been hiding all this time, so I can introduce it here at this gathering.

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,590
I'd like to introduce to you for the first time today.

54
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,480
This is TikiTaka's AI, Luca.

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,910
   

56
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,670
The AI that never makes mistakes.

57
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,270
The one and only AI in this world.

58
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,490
Luca, the AI developed by TikiTaka and watched by the entire world,

59
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,670
will show you the blueprint of Gagok District's high-tech city herself.

60
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,870
   

61
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,310
   
 The people who move Korea are all gathered here, huh? 

62
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,610
   
 If you're the Trillion Family, does it mean Gagok District's cartel's size is one trillion won? 

63
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,630
What's going on?

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,380
   

65
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,730
Prime Minister,

66
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,430
please explain that video.

67
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,380
I'd like an answer from

68
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,440
Chairman Matthew Lee and the entire Trillion Family!

69
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Please explain!

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
Commissioner General!

71
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,630
 Please explain to us! 

72
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,110
 - Please explain the video! 
 - Please explain! 

73
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,480
 Prime Minister! 

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,640
 - Please explain! 
 - What's the meaning of this? 

75
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,630
 Prime Minister, please explain! 

76
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,630
Well,

77
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,950
we have nothing to do

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,210
with this video, officially.

79
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,100
 What are you saying? 

80
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,870
Son of a bitch.

81
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,730
I shouldn't have partnered with you.

82
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,130
Do you want an internal war among us?

83
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,460
This isn't my doing.

84
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,940
Where do you think you're going?

85
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,980
No one's leaving without my permission.

86
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,980
How dare a murderer come in here!

87
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,490
Did you escape again?

88
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,960
Take him down right now!

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,130
Let me ask all of you here.

90
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,030
Am I the murderer who killed Yang Jin Mo?

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Please answer, Prime Minister.

92
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,270
Commissioner General.

93
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,890
Hurry up.

94
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,740
What are you doing? Hurry up and come inside!

95
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,310
 Everyone, sit down! 

96
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,610
 - Sit down! 
 - Sit down! 

97
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,540
 Everyone, sit down! 

98
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,940
 Sit down! 

99
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,460
 Sit down! 

100
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,440
 I'm broadcasting the current situation live. 

101
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,420
 I hope the truth will be revealed this time without fail. 

102
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,010
 All evidence is proving you're a murderer! 

103
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,810
How can a criminal who should be doing on-site verification show up here?

104
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,920
What are you all doing? Hurry up and take away the murderer!

105
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,750
You fabricated that video, too, didn't you?

106
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,880
Min Do Hyeok, you've lost your mind.

107
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,220
You went so far as to do something like this to cover up your murder.

108
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,150
Don't you fear the people's wrath?

109
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,140
The people's wrath?

110
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,030
That's what I wish for the most.

111
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,710
Once they find out what you all did so far,

112
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,620
they'll be furious from a sense of betrayal.

113
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,050
I'm very curious to find out what people will think about that video.

114
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,690
Chairman Matthew, tell me with your own mouth.

115
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,870
Exactly, how did I kill Mayor Yang Jin Mo?

116
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,490
You said you're a witness.

117
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,930
Then, you can explain it all in detail.

118
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,830
If you can prove it properly,

119
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,450
I'll also admit to everything.

120
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,950
 Yang Jin Mo's corpse was cremated anyway. 

121
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,340
 No matter the lie I tell, he has no way to prove it otherwise. 

122
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,190
I clearly saw it with my eyes.

123
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,880
I saw him pushing off Mayor Yang over the cliff and

124
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,050
even gouged out Mayor Yang's eyes with a devilish face.

125
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,850
This is a hate crime.

126
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,040
If Mayor Yang hadn't sacrificed himself,

127
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,190
his children would've been killed brutally.

128
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,450
Min Do Hyeok, how are you going to prove you're not a murderer?

129
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,620
You killed CEO Hwang Chan Seong,

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,890
in addition to Mayor Yang Jin Mo!

131
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,100
The police already secured the video of you intruding into CEO Hwang's house

132
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,310
after breaking out of the jail cell!

133
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,100
 Did you really kill your husband, Han Mo Ne? 

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

135
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,960
I stabbed Hwang Chan Seong with this.

136
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,960
Min Do Hyeok has nothing to do with Hwang Chan Seong's death.

137
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,240
He's been falsely accused.

138
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,360
The person who

139
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
gave birth at Myeongju Girl's High School six years ago

140
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,030
was also me.

141
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,310
Bang Da Mi was falsely accused, just like Min Do Hyeok is now.

142
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,750
I...

143
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,390
falsely accused Da Mi on purpose.

144
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,470
The baby's father...

145
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,110
is Shim Joon Seok.

146
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,700
Chairman Matthew Lee, that is.

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,250
You're not lying to me right now, are you?

148
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,740
I swear to the heavens.

149
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,340
None of the things I said are lies.

150
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,980
 Da Mi, I'm sorry. 

151
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,440
 I know it's too late. 

152
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,880
 But I'm really sorry. 

153
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,890
Why would I need to prove myself?

154
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,510
Cornered as a murderer,

155
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm the one who should be defended.

156
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
Even after

157
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,360
Bang Da Mi died six years ago,

158
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,280
we didn't change one bit.

159
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,690
Because the guilty wasn't punished.

160
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,490
This is the Secret Talk between the Prime Minister and Matthew.

161
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,220
 I plan to turn Min Do Hyeok into 

162
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,080
 another Bang Da Mi, another Lee Hwi So. 

163
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,870
 You'll turn him into a target of hate and criticism? 

164
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,750
 There's no better end for Min Do Hyeok than this. 

165
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,120
 - Is that video... 
 - Please explain! 

166
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
Turn this off right now!

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,590
Turn it off!

168
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,940
We can't be played by that criminal!

169
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,020
What are you all doing? Hurry up and arrest him!

170
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,550
- Prime Minister, explain yourself! 
 - Get Min Do Hyeok!

171
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,030
No, you won't!

172
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,740
You evil bastards!

173
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,720
We'll protect Min Do Hyeok!

174
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,250
As long as we're here, no one's taking him away!

175
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,450
What are you doing to an unarmed civilian?

176
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,340
Lower your guns right now!

177
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,620
Do you really not know what you're doing right now?

178
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,620
They're the ones you should be pointing your guns at!

179
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,680
Min Do Hyeok, continue.

180
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,250
Don't leave a single thing out, and reveal everything clearly.

181
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,860
Only if we had fulfilled our assigned duties properly,

182
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,650
what would the world have been like?

183
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,160
Deputy Chief, please help me so I can arrest Shim Joon Seok!

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,940
I can't stay like this, because my ego is bruised!

185
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,730
Even civilians are fighting back with their lives on the line.

186
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,740
It's too embarrassing for prosecutors who get paid with tax money!

187
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,950
 - Go ahead. &lt; br&gt; - Gosh— What?

188
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,580
 I said, go ahead. We've got our pride as prosecutors. 

189
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,380
 I'll get the arrest warrant for you. 

190
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,750
Thank you, Sir!

191
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,940
   

192
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,310
We must hurry. Min Do Hyeok's in danger.

193
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,260
Detective Oh, you'll be in danger if you go right now.

194
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,890
- Please follow the procedure— 
 - It'll be too late, then.

195
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm only going to focus on arresting Shim Joon Seok for now.

196
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Let's go.

197
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,250
Let me ask you one more time.

198
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,200
Am I really the murderer who killed Yang Jin Mo?

199
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,280
Did you really see me gouge out Yang Jin Mo's eyes?

200
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,390
Answer me if you can,

201
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,810
Shim Joon Seok.

202
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,010
Yes, I saw it.

203
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,720
I saw you brutally ending Yang Jin Mo's life for sure.

204
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,270
Yang Jin Mo's screams are still ringing in my ears.

205
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,310
   

206
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,550
 Hey, Do Hyeok, don't be surprised and listen. 

207
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,300
 We just found a heart donor. 

208
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,790
 It's a complete miracle! 

209
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,020
 Go Myeong Ji can make it alive now. 

210
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,010
 Hurry up and head to Somang Hospital. Manager Jo is waiting. 

211
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,540
The patient was just pronounced brain-dead.

212
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,770
His heart can still be transplanted.

213
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,650
Yang Jin Mo is brain dead.

214
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,980
Please proceed with the heart transplant for Go Myeong Ji, who's hospitalized at Yehyeong Hospital.

215
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,450
I got the authorization from her family.

216
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,870
 Yang Jin Mo must stay a dead person for now. 

217
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,180
 Please make no mistakes. 
   

218
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,610
   

219
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,230
I guess they couldn't completely remove all foreign particles from his heart.

220
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,450
It looks like they just closed him up because his body wouldn't be able to endure the surgery.

221
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,120
Does that mean he can die like this?

222
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,040
We'll have to leave it to the heavens now.

223
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,460
 Who is this? 

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,220
Jin Mo!

225
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,490
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,700
Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo!

227
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,180
Yang Jin Mo was alive!

228
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,420
He's alive!

229
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,910
Chairman Matthew, what's the meaning of this?

230
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,620
Didn't you say you clearly saw it with your eyes?

231
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,090
You said Min Do Hyeok killed Mayor Yang and even gouged his eyes out!

232
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,250
However, why is he fine?

233
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,230
Why are his eyes still there when they were gouged out?

234
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,850
This is nonsense.

235
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,480
I didn't die.

236
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm alive, as you can see.

237
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,400
In other words,

238
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,490
Min Do Hyeok's murder can't be established.

239
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,070
The one who tried to kill me wasn't Min Do Hyeok.

240
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,350
It was Matthew Lee or Shim Joon Seok, rather.

241
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,630
He's right. The one who tried to kill me was Shim Joon Seok, too!

242
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,910
You've been tricked by Shim Joon Seok's lies so far!

243
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
What the hell!

244
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,160
 Is what he said true? 

245
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,450
 Continue what you were saying! 

246
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,550
 Didn't you say he died? 

247
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,420
No.

248
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,600
This can't be happening.

249
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,610
 I can't listen to this anymore. 

250
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,850
 You want us to believe what you said? 

251
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,410
 Matthew, you're a total maniac. 

252
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,760
   
   

253
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,190
   
   

254
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,520
I'll kill all of you.

255
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:04,080
   

256
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,200
   

257
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,870
 - Hey, hurry up and get moving! 
 - Yes! 

258
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,320
Hurry! Hurry!

259
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,050
Hurry!

260
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,260
   

261
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,200
Are you okay? Huh?

262
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,170
What?

263
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,190
Honey.

264
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,830
Why...

265
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,770
do I feel so sleepy?

266
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,080
Don't sleep. You can't go to sleep.

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
You can hear me, right?

268
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,520
Honey, look at me.

269
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,130
Look at me, please.

270
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,760
Honey, you're the prettiest and...

271
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,310
the greatest person in this world.

272
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,250
Y-You'll...

273
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,730
become the greatest mom.

274
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,030
For our baby.

275
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,970
And you're going to become the greatest dad.

276
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,060
So, please.

277
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,330
Don't give up... Hold on.

278
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,840
I...

279
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,790
really...

280
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,080
put up a great fight.

281
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,500
I...

282
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,960
paid back Lee Hwi So for...

283
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,680
what I owe him with this.

284
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,470
Stop being so weak.

285
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,250
Don't cry, Joo Ran.

286
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,820
I know...

287
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,330
 Matthew needs to log into Luca. 

288
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,270
 Otherwise, there could be great chaos soon. 

289
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,020
 Hurry up and log in. Stop Luca! 

290
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,080
 Why would I? 

291
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,560
Tell that high and mighty Min Do Hyeok to stop her.

292
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,980
You're the one who had Min Do Hyeok—

293
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,060
Well, he was asking for it.

294
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,840
If I don't log in, Luca will infiltrate every network in this country

295
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,380
and reveal everyone's chat history.

296
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,390
And Korea will be in utter chaos.

297
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh, there's less than a minute left.

298
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,100
   
   

299
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,410
   
   

300
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,780
Log in. I said to log in!

301
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,620
I can't go down all alone, can I?

302
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,180
   
   

303
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,900
 What's that for? 

304
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,280
   
   

305
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,610
   
   

306
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,070
 Luca is an AI developed by Lee Hwi So to provide convenience to you. 

307
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,940
 Shim Joon Seok attempted to collect the entire nation's DNA with Children Home. 

308
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,150
 But he failed. 

309
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,790
 Additionally, he has been viewing your Secret Talks without permission 

310
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,540
 to collect, store, and digitalize other people's information. 

311
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,770
What's this? What's going on here?

312
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,790
What the hell is she saying right now?

313
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,820
Poor you. It looks like Min Do Hyeok already dealt with it.

314
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,740
We must first get rid of the system link between K and Luca.

315
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,380
No way.

316
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,640
How can you betray me?

317
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,970
How can you abandon me?

318
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,140
No way. This can't be.

319
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,910
Min Do Hyeok, that son of a bitch!

320
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,240
 The world where personal information gets protected. 

321
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,460
 The world where fake news isn't created. 

322
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,900
 That was the future Lee Hwi So had wished for. 

323
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:51,210
 Thus, I'm automatically deleting all data besides records regarding Shim Joon Seok. 

324
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,080
 Farewell forever. 

325
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,750
No, this can't be.

326
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,670
No way.

327
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,680
This can't be.

328
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,040
In the end, you're getting destroyed by Luca.

329
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,010
Because Luca only remembers your crimes.

330
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,700
There's no one on your side now.

331
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,870
No way.

332
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,090
 Following the creation of Shim Joon Seok Special Investigation Team, 

333
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,790
 Mr. Shim's crimes are getting discovered one after the other. 

334
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,200
 Save, which has been a leader in public opinion manipulation, 

335
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,290
   
 has terminated its services today after a search and seizure. 

336
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,870
 The collusion between Shim Joon Seok and the political field 

337
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,830
 called the Trillion Family, was discovered, 

338
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,830
 leading to the complete resignation of the cabinet. 

339
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,830
 Meanwhile, the congress passed Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Act. 

340
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,720
   

341
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,050
 [Attorney's 

342
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,360
   

343
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,220
Everyone, please rise from your seats.

344
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,390
Everyone, please sit down.

345
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,710
We'll now begin the trial of the defendant, Shim Joon Seok.

346
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,050
Your Honor,

347
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,990
may I please tell you one thing for the last time?

348
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,830
You may go ahead.

349
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,350
I'm deeply regretting my past wrongdoings.

350
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,630
I'm also prepared to humbly accept any punishment.

351
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,190
I've had lots of thoughts at the detention center for three months.

352
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,380
How I became the monster I am and...

353
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,830
   

354
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,030
...what could've been my life if I had been raised normally

355
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,390
without abuse from my father.

356
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,020
Your Honor,

357
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,650
please have pity on me.

358
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,230
 Do you even hear yourself right now? 

359
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,320
Has he gone mad?

360
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,310
He killed all those people, and he's asking to be pitied?

361
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,930
Silence, please!

362
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,500
   

363
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,160
You may continue.

364
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,340
There's a fact that hasn't been known to the world yet.

365
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,360
So I'd like to tell you.

366
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,430
I've got a child

367
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,620
who was born eight years ago.

368
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,890
That child...

369
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,130
is still alive.

370
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,730
His child was alive? Is it Han Mo Ne's child?

371
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,490
Where's he saying that child is?

372
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,650
Her name is Noh Hannah.

373
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,080
She's the child Yang Jin Mo adopted.

374
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,760
I love that child,

375
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,920
but I never got to live with her.

376
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,320
If I'm only remembered as an evil dad in her memory,

377
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,260
what a sad thing would that be?

378
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,730
Your Honor,

379
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,190
please give me one last chance.

380
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,030
I'd like to sincerely seek the child's forgiveness and

381
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,600
give her a precious memory as her dad.

382
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,510
Are you even human, you asshole?

383
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,430
How can you mention Hannah's name?

384
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,020
You!

385
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,870
I can't die alone, you know.

386
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,620
I'm going to kill you for sure.

387
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,950
Go back to your seat!

388
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,040
Otherwise, I'll have you removed from this court.

389
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,800
   

390
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,620
Please delete the defendant's last statement from the records.

391
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,760
The reporters are also not to publish articles on it.

392
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,610
What kind of bullshit is this?

393
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,340
Why would you delete it?

394
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,170
The people have the right to know, too.

395
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,160
All of this is a case that started because of that one child!

396
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,660
I'm not curious.

397
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,240
I don't want to know!

398
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:24,250
Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Act was passed today at the regular session of congress.

399
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,190
I also had a lot of thoughts.

400
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,800
Where did it first go wrong?

401
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,470
Why couldn't anyone protect that young girl?

402
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,660
What did we do at the time?

403
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,720
I'll now read the verdict.

404
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,490
This incident started from the fake news on the allegations

405
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,520
on Myeongju Girls' High School's Bang Da Mi giving birth.

406
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,050
One man's lie kept growing in size as other people's lies joined,

407
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,470
creating a social monster called Joo Hong Letters in the end.

408
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:15,380
Views and money mattered more to Joo Hong Letters than the truth.

409
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,380
All of us can't deny the fact we're the defendant's helper, for we believed it,

410
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,320
distributed it and enjoyed it.

411
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,180
However, the biggest problem is...

412
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:36,050
the defendant was protected by authority and avoided getting punished for a long time.

413
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,150
If the teacher had protected her student,

414
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,650
the doctor her patient,

415
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,890
and the police, the civilian back then,

416
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,020
wouldn't we have prevented the atrocity that took Bang Da Mi's life?

417
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,840
The law is the last measure of protection for the downtrodden.

418
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Human rights can only be claimed when you respect others' rights.

419
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,510
Hence, this is the verdict.

420
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,980
The court orders...

421
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,470
the defendant the death sentence.

422
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,250
Nonsense.

423
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,790
I'm going to appeal. Why should I die?

424
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,970
The verdict isn't over yet.

425
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,030
The defendant's crime isn't light at all and

426
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,630
he has been showing false regrets all this time.

427
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,550
As he has even mocked his own child at court, displaying extremely evil behavior,

428
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,990
all appeals from the defendant are to be denied.

429
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,850
Is this even allowed?

430
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,030
I also have a right to be protected!

431
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,280
Lastly, though it's too late,

432
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,880
I sincerely apologize as an adult for having failed

433
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,680
to help Bang Da Mi.

434
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,340
I'm going to appeal! This can't be allowed!

435
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,940
I'm going to appeal. I'm going to appeal for sure!

436
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,430
You can't stop me. I have my rights, too!

437
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,260
   

438
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,970
- What are you doing? 
 - Sorry?

439
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,690
O-Oh, the thing is...

440
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,550
Are you really going to expose Shim Joon Seok's child?

441
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,430
The people also have a right to know, don't they?

442
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,690
Didn't the judge tell us?

443
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,400
The people don't want to know!

444
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,190
I won't even ask you to be righteous.

445
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,240
Let's stop living shameful lives now.

446
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,170
 Dear Hannah. 

447
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,130
 This is my 11th letter to my daughter. 

448
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,420
 I'm reminded of you more often these days. 

449
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,030
 I miss you a lot. 

450
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,600
 Could you come for a visit just once, please? 

451
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,110
 I've got so many things I couldn't tell you. 

452
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,130
 I'll be waiting. 

453
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,170
None of you can ever win against me.

454
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,820
The one who survives in the end is the winner.

455
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,150
The death sentence won't ever be executed.

456
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,390
I'll harass you until I die of old age.

457
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,580
Who's there?

458
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,580
Who the fuck are you?

459
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Where did they all go?

460
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,310
Warden.

461
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,780
Warden. Warden!

462
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,000
Gosh, those crazy assholes.

463
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,160
 It was decided from the beginning. 

464
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,350
 That my death will be in vain. 

465
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,380
 Just like Da Mi, who died from a bullet through her heart. 

466
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,320
 Just like Park Nan Young, who burned to death. 

467
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,580
 Just like Lee Hwi So, who was ripped apart by the bomb. 

468
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,550
 Will God... 

469
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,530
 allow me to take my revenge? 

470
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,220
What's this?

471
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,350
Gasoline?

472
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,950
What is it? Are you going to kill me or something?

473
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,830
   

474
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,530
   

475
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,100
Hey, Yang Phillip!

476
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,770
Your sisters are in a fight again!

477
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,480
What?

478
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,640
Hey, you know your parents are ex-convicts!

479
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,030
The main culprits of the Bang Da Mi case.

480
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,780
They apparently lived a few years in prison.

481
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,180
Go on and say it's not true if it's the case.

482
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,280
    
 Yes, you're right.

483
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,500
Did I say you were wrong?

484
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,690
See? She said you're right.

485
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,570
You're finally admitting it.

486
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,360
Don't be full of yourself just because you have a pretty face and you're good at studying.

487
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,910
You're only ex-convicts' kids.

488
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,500
    
 Hey, be honest here.

489
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,060
You're angry your boyfriend asked Erica out, right?

490
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,790
Your boyfriend's the one you should be mad at.

491
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,340
Why are you bothering us here?

492
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,010
Erica flirted with him first.

493
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,210
I did? I care an awful lot about a guy's face.

494
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,080
I've got no interest in a kid who's uglier than my dad.

495
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,020
You scratched my pride!

496
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,360
Hey, don't do it, Erica.

497
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,450
Hey, he's just a player.

498
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,680
A player who asks out every girl he sees.

499
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,950
Get your acts together.

500
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,160
Let's go.

501
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,540
Why bother talking to people who can't even understand?

502
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,390
The show's over!

503
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,790
Who are you to be lecturing me?

504
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,960
You two aren't even real sisters.

505
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,260
Hannah, you don't even know who your real mom is. Right?

506
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,050
Your biological mom is also an ex-convict. Right?

507
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,130
This is bad. It's my sister's frenzy button.

508
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,950
Erica, let it go.

509
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,210
I can let go of everything, but not fake news.

510
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,820
Did you see it? Did you?

511
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,920
Can you take responsibility if someone dies because of your insulting words?

512
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,690
How dare you speak baseless rumors?

513
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,710
Hannah's biological mom is a beauty and an angel.

514
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,960
You two are dead today, according to the Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Act.

515
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,340
   

516
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,840
Honey!

517
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,390
Two jjajangs and one jjamppong for the real estate agency. Right?

518
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,100
Of course, we'll give you fried dumplings on the house.

519
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,870
Thank you for your order!

520
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,600
- Honey! 
 - Yes.

521
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,040
It's two jjajangs and one jjamppong.

522
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,580
Let's make this today's last order.

523
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
We only have ingredients left to bring to the orphanage.

524
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,560
I got it.

525
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,180
I like this moment the most.

526
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,140
Me, too.

527
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,610
We have a call.

528
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,320
This is Kitty Chinese Restaurant.

529
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm sorry, but we ran out of ingredients today—

530
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Sorry? Erica and Hannah did?

531
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,770
Gosh, I'm sorry.

532
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,860
Gosh, I told them not to cause any trouble!

533
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,200
Those two are dead to me.

534
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,390
Goodness, H-Honey!

535
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,460
Take a deep breath before you go! Honey!

536
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,310
My dad used to be a policeman.

537
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,910
He met my mom at Jeju Island for the first time.

538
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:15,540
Mom and Dad hated each other's first impression and fought.

539
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,900
But they apparently grew feelings for each other as time went by.

540
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,900
Mom and Dad were a fantastic couple who even liked each other's faults—

541
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,180
By the way,

542
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,650
what were your faults?

543
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:44,380
 He's too young to learn what an ex-convict is. Right? 

544
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:51,100
I'll tell you that when you grow up a bit more, my son.

545
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,770
When you can understand your mom's everything.

546
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,420
I can do that, right?

547
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,910
Our son's already 10 years old.

548
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,150
He's looking more and more like you.

549
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,290
His appetite and his sleeping habits, too.

550
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,380
I'm sorry I couldn't come often.

551
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,620
You'll at least show up in my dream tonight. Right?

552
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,710
Please show up.

553
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,460
I miss you so much.

554
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,160
- Mom, hurry up and come! 
 - Huh?

555
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,500
Hurry up!

556
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,400
Mom, this lady said she's about to give birth!

557
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,980
Son, call the ambulance first.

558
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,900
The baby is about to come out right now.

559
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,820
However, you can take your time.

560
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,300
My mom is a professional at delivering babies.

561
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,710
It's not my due date yet.

562
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,900
- Oh, let me tell you where this is. 
 - Don't worry about a thing.

563
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,400
I used to be a gynecologist in the past. Please lie down that way.

564
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,310
All right. We'll start with a deep breath.

565
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,380
If you have to choose between my baby and I,

566
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,040
please choose to save my baby.

567
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,400
I refuse! Such things will never happen under my supervision.

568
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,160
I save both the baby and the mother.

569
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,130
So hang in there.

570
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,430
I also gave birth at an old age, but I had my son through natural birth.

571
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:36,070
 These things happen to me from time to time after that day from 10 years ago. 

572
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,480
 I don't ever refuse to help. 

573
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:46,370
 Thinking this is the reason I'm staying in this world after committing an unforgivable sin. 

574
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,370
This is a new menu I made. How is it?

575
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,720
It's delicious!

576
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,940
Oh, Honey!

577
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,860
Dad, I'm so embarrassed because of Mom.

578
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,150
Look what she did to our hair.

579
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,340
You two better thank Mom for letting it go with this.

580
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,130
You're always on Mom's side.

581
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,890
You think we fought for no good reason?

582
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,250
We had our reasons.

583
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,420
Still, how can you hit your friend?

584
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,700
I told you to call me right away whenever anybody says something.

585
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,740
Why would you two get involved?

586
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,500
I would've beaten proper sense into them.

587
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm going to get rid of any and all who mess with my daughter!

588
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,190
This is why we deal with them.

589
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,300
Because you might get all worked up and cause trouble.

590
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,500
It's harder to take care of that.

591
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,970
It's not like we were born yesterday.

592
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,860
When did I ever get worked up?

593
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,110
I'm the most calm and rational person.

594
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,760
Wait! What's up with your faces?

595
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,490
Oh, Ms. Go's emotional level is rising as I speak!

596
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,340
Shall we have a talk for a second?

597
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,300
- Do you want to? 
 - N-No, Honey!

598
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,050
Sit right here!

599
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,830
Gosh, no one's as rational as you!

600
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,550
Erica, don't you ever do that again.

601
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,710
Hurry up and sit. Eat the fried dumplings.

602
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,650
Yes.

603
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,790
Huh? The person holding those flowers was there at the fight, too.

604
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,540
What?

605
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,390
   

606
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,520
 You'll come back for sure, right? 

607
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,070
 How pretty. 

608
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,030
I'm sorry for coming late.

609
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,190
I made you wait, right?

610
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,120
Aren't you hungry?

611
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,120
 You brought flowers! 

612
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,860
 Hannah used to love flowers. 

613
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,390
You forgot everything, but you remember Hannah.

614
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:52,740
 Because Hannah looks a lot... 

615
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,980
 like my daughter. 

616
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,010
Look this way.

617
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,040
Mom, one second.

618
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,180
Ta-da.

619
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,580
It's a gift.

620
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,740
Mom, be careful!

621
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,560
Mom!

622
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,480
This is the list of children the Bang Chil Seong Foundation will be sponsoring this time.

623
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,060
Hyung, how's this?

624
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,270
I want to sponsor more children this time. Would it be too much?

625
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,360
Well, the board members might disagree.

626
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,600
But this is the reason we grew Seongchan Group.

627
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,040
- So it's not a problem. 
 - Thank you, Hyung.

628
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,710
In addition...

629
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,640
   

630
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,480
I'm going to quit working here now.

631
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,400
I stayed way longer than planned.

632
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,770
The company's stabilized now, too.

633
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,680
You and Aunt are here as well. So I think it'll be okay.

634
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,680
Have you made up your mind?

635
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,950
I packed all my stuff, too.

636
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,680
I don't need shares or money.

637
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,800
I'm going to go back to being Min Do Hyeok, the natural person.

638
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,440
Min Do Hyeok, are you arrogantly deciding on your own and giving me a notice right now?

639
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,620
I need to give you a beating today.

640
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,110
Hyung, I'm still the chairman.

641
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,410
- I'm a chairman who's good at fighting. 
 - You!

642
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,650
W-Whoa, Hyung!

643
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,810
H-Hyung, I'm about to fall!

644
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,590
Hey— W-Whoa!

645
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,710
Wait, it's not what you think.

646
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,510
- He's mine! 
 - Sorry?

647
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,360
Take a look at this.

648
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,530
It's Mo Ne. Han Mo Ne showed up.

649
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,290
It looks like she showed up at a hospital somewhere with her mom.

650
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,620
How long has it been?

651
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,930
She completely hid away for five years after she got out of prison.

652
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,250
People took pictures and posted them.

653
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,970
But the comments are full of insults and curses.

654
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,030
Where is this?

655
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,760
Where was it again? It's some hospital at Sampyeong.

656
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,200
I heard it's deep in the countryside in Gangwon Province.

657
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,280
Sampyeong.

658
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,230
- Yoon Ji Sook's guardian? 
 - Yes.

659
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,510
Thank you.

660
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,380
It's Han Mo Ne. Right?

661
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,780
I guess she really lives in our neighborhood.

662
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,480
How can she live on after killing her friend?

663
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,830
Right, she even killed her husband.

664
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,890
She lives on because she's shameless like that.

665
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,880
Gosh, shouldn't we kick her out of our neighborhood?

666
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,380
How can we live in the same neighborhood with a murderer?

667
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,810
Things are bound to get noisy once word gets out.

668
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,570
W-What is it?

669
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,390
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

670
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,800
It's true you're a murderer!

671
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,680
Yes, I am. I'm really sorry.

672
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,410
However, my mom loves this neighborhood so much.

673
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,800
Please, just don't kick me out.

674
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,150
I beg of you.

675
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,040
Mom.

676
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,690
Are you happy?

677
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,960
 Yes, I'm happy. 

678
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,370
 Yes, I'm happy. 

679
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,410
 You told me this in the past. Right? 

680
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,510
 That you live because of me. 

681
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,970
 It's the case for me now. 

682
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:03,340
 You're the only reason I go on. 

683
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,680
You're not cold, right?

684
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,920
We're going to go pick some wormwood tomorrow morning.

685
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,840
I'll make soybean paste soup with your favorite wormwood.

686
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,080
 Mo Ne. 

687
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,120
Mom.

688
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,750
Can you tell who I am?

689
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,590
 How can I not know my own daughter's face? 

690
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,520
 Mom's giving you such a hard time, am I not? 

691
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,540
No, I'm so happy.

692
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,720
Why didn't I realize?

693
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,180
Living together with you is the happiest thing in the world.

694
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,490
Waking up together every morning, eating together,

695
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,880
and going to sleep together

696
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,250
are such wonderful things.

697
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,050
Kyeong Soo's coming to Korea soon, too.

698
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:23,010
He's working ever so hard.

699
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,880
He sends money every month so I can buy you good food.

700
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,280
He's all grown up now, isn't he?

701
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,290
 How fortunate. 

702
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,470
 I'm so happy. 

703
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,390
 This is enough for me. 

704
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,030
 I'm happy now. 

705
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,790
Mom.

706
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,340
Keep in touch with me.

707
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,150
Let me know whenever you want to come back.

708
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,820
I don't think that will ever happen.

709
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,470
Hey, your aunt will be upset to hear that.

710
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,520
I don't want to. I won't let you go. I can't let you go!

711
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,250
How can I live without you?

712
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,950
Are you going to let your only aunt get old and die alone?

713
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,890
Aunt!

714
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:54,160
I'll come to see you often. Okay?

715
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,710
You'll keep your promise. Right?

716
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:02,720
I'm really going to cry every day if you don't!

717
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,130
Stop!

718
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,050
You're all I have now!

719
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,130
Did Phillip and Erica go out to play again?

720
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,300
I wonder if they'll even go to college.

721
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,020
They've reserved the last place in the entire school, one after the other.

722
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,120
Did you pack a lot of delicious food?

723
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,200
The kids are going to love it.

724
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,910
Let me come to the orphanage with you next time.

725
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,200
Sure. We're going now!

726
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,450
I'm getting my ID Card any day now. Get going.

727
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,990
- We'll be back. 
 - Take care.

728
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,340
- Yes. 
 - We'll be back.

729
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,060
- Take care. 
 - Yes.

730
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,020
Yes, this is Kitty Chinese Restaurant.

731
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,790
Hello?

732
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,060
What do you need? You can tell me.

733
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,480
It's me.

734
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,170
I know you.

735
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,740
Have you been doing well?

736
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,420
 Yes. 

737
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,870
Grandma...

738
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,950
passed away.

739
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,640
I thought you should know, too.

740
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,260
Grandma did?

741
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,590
G-Grandma...

742
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,800
She passed away in peace as if falling asleep.

743
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,960
Even until the moment she passed, she forgot everything else,

744
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,520
but she remembered you.

745
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,000
She didn't forget her memories with you.

746
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,070
Are you okay, Ahjumma?

747
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,820
You're all alone.

748
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,510
I'm okay.

749
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,180
I think I can put everything down now.

750
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,020
Put everything down? What do you mean?

751
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,300
H-Hello? Hello?

752
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,850
Hello, Ahjumma?

753
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,880
Hello.

754
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,270
Hannah, I meant to stop by, too.

755
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,550
I'm going to Ms. Mo Ne right—

756
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,320
 Ahjussi! 

757
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,360
I got a call from Ms. Mo Ne.

758
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:10,810
She said Grandma passed away.

759
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:15,770
 But Ms. Mo Ne's voice sounded weird. 

760
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,080
She sounded like she was saying her last farewell.

761
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,660
She said she could put everything down now.

762
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:25,850
I'm so anxious and worried.

763
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,030
 I need to go to Sampyeong. 

764
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,680
I don't think we should leave Ahjumma alone.

765
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,610
Hannah, I'll be there soon, so wait just a bit. Okay?

766
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:36,790
I'll be there soon.

767
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:51,320
   

768
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:05,808
I don't see her.

769
01:02:05,808 --> 01:02:07,848
She cleaned up all her belongings, too.

770
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:11,848
Hannah, for now, let's look for her separately. You can do it, right?

771
01:02:11,848 --> 01:02:13,748
I'll go this way.

772
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:15,718
Okay.

773
01:02:20,098 --> 01:02:22,518
 Grandma! 

774
01:02:27,858 --> 01:02:29,588
 Did you wait for me? Aren't you hungry? 

775
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:32,528
 Hannah wants to eat pumpkin pancakes. 

776
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:36,428
 That's why I harvested a lot of pumpkins and potatoes. 

777
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:40,228
 Whoa! Grandma, you're the best. 

778
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:41,558
 Whoa! 

779
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:45,998
 Oh, I drew your face because I was bored. 

780
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:51,638
 Ta-da. 

781
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:55,268
 You think Grandma's this pretty? 

782
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:57,308
 Of course. 

783
01:02:57,308 --> 01:03:02,258
 You're the prettiest after my mom. 

784
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:13,978
 Grandma. 

785
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:20,238
Han Mo Ne!

786
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:23,238
Han Mo Ne!

787
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:25,468
Ahjumma!

788
01:03:28,198 --> 01:03:30,448
Ahjumma!

789
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:40,338
Han Mo Ne!

790
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:42,638
Ahjumma!

791
01:03:43,478 --> 01:03:45,648
Ahjumma!

792
01:03:54,348 --> 01:03:56,498
Ahjumma!

793
01:04:07,128 --> 01:04:09,078
Hannah?

794
01:04:59,878 --> 01:05:02,498
I don't hate you.

795
01:05:03,678 --> 01:05:06,078
I don't resent you.

796
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:08,148
So, please.

797
01:05:08,898 --> 01:05:11,958
Please don't die.

798
01:05:26,968 --> 01:05:30,108
Do you know how worried I was?

799
01:05:30,878 --> 01:05:34,198
Who hangs up a phone call like that?

800
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,508
I called your name so many times.

801
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:40,188
I've been looking for you for so long.

802
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:43,168
Why didn't you answer?

803
01:05:45,068 --> 01:05:46,938
I'm sorry.

804
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:52,918
I was getting flowers for Grandma's grave.

805
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,958
Did you come because you were worried about me?

806
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:01,628
Of course.

807
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,888
You're...

808
01:06:05,738 --> 01:06:08,678
You're my mom, Ahjumma.

809
01:06:11,378 --> 01:06:13,998
I missed you.

810
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,018
I missed you so much.

811
01:06:43,228 --> 01:06:45,558
 I missed you. 

812
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:49,978
 Mommy.
