1
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,790
   

2
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,560
   

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,130
Let me ask you again now.

4
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,890
Who were you with earlier?

5
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:13,730
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

6
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,790
Let me ask you one last time.

7
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,170
Why did you meet...

8
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,450
Min Do Hyeok?

9
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,940
You were following me?

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,800
All right. Let me tell you our rules again.

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,870
Number one.

12
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,300
Get up.

13
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,510
What are you doing to my man?

14
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,130
Even a thug would know better!

15
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,360
Are you okay?

16
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,580
You're bleeding.

17
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,610
I told you not to show up in front of me.

18
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,740
Should I sue you for stalking and trespassing?

19
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,660
Must you be humiliated to wake up?

20
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,410
You're the one who needs to wake up.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,450
I'm sorry for ruining our dinner.

22
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,080
I'll make it up to you next time.

23
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,190
If you show up one more time,

24
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,800
it won't end with just a slap, then.

25
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,040
Min Do Hyeok, get away from me.

26
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,340
That's how you can help yourself and me.

27
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,920
What the heck are you thinking, Geum Ra Hee?

28
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,020
Don't tell me...

29
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,310
Did you watch Da Mi's footage from that day?

30
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,450
The last moments of that child...

31
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,820
K had in his possession?

32
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,790
Why do you bother even asking?

33
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,220
A punishment for what I've done to my daughter.

34
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,350
Ra Hee!

35
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,320
Don't touch me. I don't need your help.

36
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm Geum Ra Hee.

37
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,770
I don't bleed or cry.

38
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm Geum Ra Hee.

39
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,880
It was you back then, right?

40
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,340
The one who saved us at K's vacation home!

41
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,170
It was you, Ra Hee! Ra Hee!

42
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,250
 Kang Ki Tak, 

43
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,460
 you'd never know 

44
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,080
   
 how I felt when I started this plan. 

45
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,840
 I can never forget 

46
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,460
 the day I begged and clung to K for my life. 

47
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,330
 That was the beginning of my nightmare. 

48
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,640
 - I crushed and ground my soul to make him a hero.  
 - Matthew Lee.

49
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,350
 Because I had to be right about choosing K. 

50
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,600
 But I happened to see it that day. 

51
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,850
 Inside K's hard disk I had brought, 

52
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,940
 all the information about Lee Hwi So was there. 

53
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,060
 To exact his revenge on Shim Yong for abandoning him, 

54
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,010
 K had to steal Lee Hwi So's power and 

55
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,690
 turn him into a criminal. 

56
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,480
 That's why he killed Da Mi, too. 

57
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,890
   
 I shouldn't have watched it. 

58
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,390
 Rather, I should've destroyed it right away. 

59
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:33,220
 I was still happy I could see my mom again. 

60
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,760
 I missed her. 

61
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,590
 However, 

62
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,090
 I couldn't do that. 

63
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,200
 - S-Spare my mom's life, please.  
 - Because I couldn't...

64
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
 forget those eyes. 

65
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,250
 I wanted to die. 

66
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,480
 I thought someone like me should die. 

67
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,250
 But before that, I had to kill K first. 

68
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,240
This is Da Mi's last moment.

69
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,940
 - But you were there...  
 - I can't believe he filmed this.

70
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,340
 - at that place, Kang Ki Tak.  
 - What a trashy bastard.

71
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,070
 You were alive and watching Da Mi. 

72
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,010
 Da Mi's last moments. 

73
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,590
 You didn't even know that Da Mi was your daughter. 

74
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,940
 But you were crying. 

75
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,120
 Just like fate. 

76
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,690
 I thought I had to save you. 

77
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,740
 I begged to God. 

78
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,740
 "Please don't take me 

79
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,740
 until I kill K." 

80
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,690
 That was my last wish remaining for me 

81
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,260
 who isn't human. 

82
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,710
 This much pain is nothing. 

83
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,060
 Compared to Lee Hwi So, who pulled the trigger on his daughter's heart. 

84
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,710
 Compared to Park Nan Young, who lost her husband and child, and burned to death. 

85
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,830
 This much is nothing for me. 

86
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,940
 I had to get up, walk, and run in a short time to fool K. 

87
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,960
 I endured again and again as if my life depended on it. 

88
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,540
 And I decided to make CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save my ally. 

89
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,680
   

90
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,690
What brings you here?

91
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,570
I know you want TikiTaka.

92
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,640
If you help me, I'll give you TikiTaka,

93
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,110
including all of my shares.

94
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:56,180
Instead, hand over all the information Save can offer me.

95
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm sure it's not a losing trade for you.

96
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,720
But it's not really a desirable trade, either.

97
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,800
One more thing.

98
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,460
Add Han Mo Ne to the list.

99
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,930
Then, I'll think about it.

100
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,640
 I couldn't help but choose the lesser of the two evils, 

101
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,060
 though Hwang Chan Seong may be a demon. 

102
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,910
 That's how I became Medusa. 

103
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,060
 Showing up in front of Min Do Hyeok, acting as Park Nan Young, 

104
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,290
 I hoped Min Do Hyeok would punish them and me. 

105
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,330
 Because Geum Ra Hee doesn't have the right to exact revenge. 

106
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,220
   

107
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,240
   

108
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,520
 Matthew. 

109
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,410
Hey, did you see the news?

110
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,700
    
 Nam Cheol Woo doing drugs is all over TV.

111
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,770
    
 And Save exposed scandals on Yang Jin Mo and TikiTaka.

112
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,100
That's not the problem.

113
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,080
Cha Joo Ran was involved in an investment fraud on Gagok District.

114
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,390
What did you say?

115
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,580
If this is revealed,

116
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,560
it'll be hard to win the bid for Gagok District.

117
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,000
Because TikiTaka will be under fire, and

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,750
you'll also be in the line of fire.

119
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,470
Whoa, this is nonsense.

120
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,080
How can all of this blow up at once?

121
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,200
It was Medusa's doing.

122
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,870
 Medusa must've joined forces with Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak. 

123
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,220
And Hwang Chan Seong is their helper.

124
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,640
For now, distance yourself from them and don't do anything.

125
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Whether by blackmailing or bribing the reporter, I'll try to stop it.

126
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,710
You can make sure to handle this matter. Right?

127
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,110
 Everything is going as I want them to. 

128
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,170
Thank you for waiting, all of you.

129
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,920
   

130
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,460
You can look forward to it.

131
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,020
 Hey, Geum Ra Hee! 

132
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,970
There's a fucking thief who lives in this house!

133
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,320
Everyone, she's a horrible thief who stole all my money!

134
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,870
Hey, come out right now before I set your entire house on fire!

135
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,980
Hey, Geum Ra Hee!

136
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,510
It was you, right? It was all your doing.

137
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,040
Dragging that bastard into this and meeting him in front of me,

138
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,240
you were acting so I'd see. Where's my money?

139
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,270
Give back all my money you stole, you evil bitch!

140
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,770
Do you have time for this?

141
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,940
You'll have to work yourself to death, even in hell, to pay back all that debt.

142
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,140
Why are you doing this to me?

143
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,040
What did I do so wrong to you?

144
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,810
We got along okay. Right?

145
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,750
Gosh, seriously.

146
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,550
You were dying to take down Mo Ne. Is it my turn now?

147
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,490
I see. You'll give everything to Matthew and live a good life alone?

148
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,820
You evil bitch!

149
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,980
You've been sitting in a seat that was unfitting for you.

150
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,840
It's time to get back to being the penniless Cha Joo Ran.

151
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,780
The pathetic Cha Joo Ran

152
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,940
who struggled with debt and worried sick

153
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,930
the debtors might find you.

154
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,870
Hey, you! How much did you borrow from private lenders again?

155
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,700
It's going to be a very long night.

156
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,310
Make sure she doesn't act out ever again.

157
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,740
- Let's go. 
 - Hey, let go.

158
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,070
Geum Ra Hee. Geum Ra Hee, I'll kill you.

159
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,100
I'll rip you apart with my own hands!

160
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,470
Geum Ra Hee! You—

161
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,830
Hyung, what's wrong?

162
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,910
Is something wrong?

163
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,460
Do Hyeok.

164
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,250
I found out who Medusa is.

165
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,010
What?

166
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,840
It was Geum Ra Hee.

167
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,550
Hyung, what are you saying?

168
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,160
It was also Geum Ra Hee who helped us at K's vacation home.

169
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,140
It looks like she severely injured her leg back then.

170
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,010
Why is Geum Ra Hee helping us?

171
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm sure she had an ulterior motive.

172
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,290
Geum Ra Hee even got Hwang Chan Seong involved in this.

173
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,920
What if she's regretting?

174
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,150
What if that's why she contacted you?

175
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,380
Geum Ra Hee's evil deeds can't be forgiven at this point.

176
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,290
Absolutely not.

177
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,180
 Save exposed the Seoul Mayor candidate Yang... 

178
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,690
- Look at that. 
  - ...used to be a waiter at a bar in the past. 

179
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,600
 - They also suspected a connection between...  
 - No wonder. He's got the looks.

180
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,990
 - ...TikiTaka and Candidate Yang Jin Mo.  
 - If he's a mayor, I could be the president.

181
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,210
 Candidate Yang Jin Mo and TikiTaka haven't responded yet. 

182
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,970
 If Save's disclosure turns out to be true, 

183
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,400
 it will impact the direction of the election greatly for Seoul Mayorship. 

184
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,440
Is the article about Candidate Yang having been a bar waiter true?

185
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,190
It's been fact-checked.

186
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,200
I can even provide additional evidence.

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,110
Is it also true Chairman Matthew placed Candidate Yang as the State Affairs Deputy Mayor?

188
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,140
Finding that out would be

189
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,070
your roles, Reporters.

190
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,300
Now, then.

191
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,410
Are you saying you admit it to be true?

192
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,870
 Please give us one more word! 

193
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,440
 Are you saying you admit it to be true? 

194
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,690
My goodness. All of her old pictures are gone.

195
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,860
Ms. Go used to have a filthy rumor with the director's son, too.

196
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,990
You know, the married gym teacher.

197
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,870
They're soulmates.

198
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,260
We bought so many of Ms. Go's paintings. We spent so much money on her.

199
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,910
 There are rumors her marriage to Yang Jin Mo is contractual. 

200
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,670
 Aren't they a fake couple? 

201
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,150
   

202
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,100
   
   

203
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,230
   

204
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,910
   

205
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,740
   
   

206
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,600
   

207
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,140
   

208
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,140
Why isn't Geum Ra Hee here yet? Call her again.

209
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,090
What took you so long?

210
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,790
Do you want to see us die?

211
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,830
Even my past is getting exposed right now. What do we do?

212
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,170
What's your plan?

213
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,130
Did you even have a plan when you said you could handle this?

214
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,320
For now...

215
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,070
- there will be no response. 
 - What?

216
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,240
This doesn't pertain to you, huh?

217
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,040
I can't trust you. I'll settle this with Matthew in person.

218
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,900
Do you want to die altogether?

219
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,160
If a reporter finds out you're meeting Matthew,

220
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,260
you'll be lighting the alliance theory on fire.

221
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,680
This is why I was against putting a thug like you as the State Affairs Deputy Mayor.

222
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,470
Hey, I could just give up on becoming the Seoul Mayor.

223
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,050
Do you think I enjoy doing this shit?

224
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,070
That's enough. Fighting among us won't solve anything.

225
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,700
This is all Medusa's doing.

226
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,910
Medusa knows everything about us.

227
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,990
Someone just commented on my SNS feed that we're a fake couple.

228
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,480
If the rumors spread like wildfire, our image is done for.

229
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,070
How the hell would they know if we're fake or not?

230
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,960
We even signed the marriage papers and lived like a married couple for a year.

231
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,090
They could've noticed that we were acting!

232
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,490
Hold a press conference right away.

233
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,430
We'll have to use Hannah.

234
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,750
What are you saying?

235
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,630
We'll make Hannah speak at a press conference.

236
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,490
We can have Hannah prove that our family is normal.

237
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm sure everyone will believe Hannah.

238
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,540
Go Myoeng Ji, have you gone mad?

239
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,750
You want to drag Hannah into this filthy mess?

240
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,350
Do you have any other way?

241
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,510
I'm going to protect my children!

242
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,040
If you oppose me, I'll even get a divorce with you.

243
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,660
Are you going to be done as Yang Jin Mo, a former bar waiter,

244
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,500
or are you going to overcome it with me?

245
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,320
Make up your mind.

246
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,080
 As I thought, you guys don't change. 

247
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,190
 Evil only nurtures a greater evil. 

248
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,440
 These are Save's articles regarding Chairman Matthew. 

249
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,640
 Chairman Matthew, Yang Jin Mo's sponsor. 

250
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,210
 The unqualified Candidate Yang 

251
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,670
 became State Affairs Deputy Mayor due to Chairman Matthew's scheme. 

252
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,570
 What's the connection between Chairman Matthew and Candidate Yang? 

253
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,540
 Which government project is TikiTaka after? 

254
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,040
Stop, stop. That's enough!

255
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,960
Hwang Chan Seong, that son of a bitch. I'll kill him.

256
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,440
As soon as you finish checking the facts, post the special article immediately.

257
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,840
 CEO Hwang! 

258
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,960
You can't come in here.

259
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,530
CEO Hwang!

260
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,860
It looks like Chairman Matthew is quite angry.

261
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,840
Please leave us alone for a moment.

262
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,440
It won't take long.

263
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,040
Medusa's fucking lackey!

264
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
Who is Medusa?

265
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,040
Who ordered you to do this shit?

266
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,600
Well, I'm Medusa.

267
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,640
It was an eyesore to see the crazy serial killer, Shim Joon Seok,

268
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,540
getting revered as the national hero, Lee Hwi So.

269
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,340
That's why I decided to get involved.

270
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
Why?

271
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,540
Is something wrong, Shim Joon Seok?

272
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,740
You kept quiet all this time even though you knew I was Shim Joon Seok?

273
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,770
Don't make me laugh.

274
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,040
You're not Medusa.

275
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,640
You're as much of a fucking lunatic as I am.

276
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,640
You're right.

277
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,060
There was a time we used to hang out together, too.

278
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,940
When I had no idea that you were Seongchan Group's fake son.

279
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,240
Why are you bringing up Seongchan here?

280
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,440
Do you think I don't know the real reason why you built a portal?

281
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,570
You're trying to manipulate powerful figures

282
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,200
and reporters while posting articles that fit your vice on your main page.

283
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
Is that a bad thing?

284
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,940
Didn't you create TikiTaka for the same reason?

285
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,550
Trying to use other people's secret messages for your personal gain.

286
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,190
Fine. We always had the same goal.

287
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,840
Money...

288
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,040
and weaknesses of those who can bring me money.

289
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,490
I'll give you what you want.

290
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,340
Regardless of what Medusa offered, I can give you way more than that.

291
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,280
Whether it be shares or whatever.

292
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,540
I refuse.

293
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,970
You're a fucker who never keeps his promises.

294
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,740
A snake-tongued motherfucker.

295
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,180
Secretary Nam.

296
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,550
Secretary Nam!

297
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,230
Yes, CEO.

298
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,660
Our guest is leaving.

299
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,410
If he doesn't leave willingly, you can beat him up as you see fit.

300
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,150
Right. He's an attention seeker, so would having cameras be better?

301
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,190
You'll die if you stay here!

302
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,870
Everyone got bewitched by something and became weird.

303
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,380
Do you want to live in hell where people don't even recognize each other?

304
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,140
We need to run away right now.

305
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,540
Is that so easy for you, Mom?

306
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,830
What?

307
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,700
Is it easy for you to leave this place since you abandoned me?

308
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,610
I told you. I never abandoned you—

309
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,820
You didn't abandon me? Don't go, then.

310
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,380
Protect me here, then.

311
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,140
After you left like that, Auntie, Uncle,

312
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Grandmother, and Grandfather stayed by my side.

313
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,190
I cried every night because I missed my mom!

314
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,750
But you weren't here. Those people here are my family.

315
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,860
There's no time. We'll both die at this rate!

316
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,720
Run!

317
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,980
Mom, now is the time. Let's hurry.

318
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,670
Okay!

319
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,910
Gosh, Hannah, that was great!

320
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,760
Man, you're an acting genius, Hannah!

321
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,450
Reporter Choi, I'm sending you a video.

322
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,280
Please write me a proper article.

323
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,540
The title will be,

324
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,040
"Noh Hannah, who Rose to Be a Genius Child Actor from Being Shim Joon Seok's Victim."

325
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,840
"Candidate Yang Jin Mo for Seoul Mayor was behind her."

326
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,440
You're writing this down. Right?

327
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,730
My husband won't go down so easily.

328
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,840
Never.

329
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,620
   

330
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,480
Don't you have ears?

331
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,960
Fine. I'll really report you for stalking me.

332
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,590
I came to give this to you.

333
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,080
Press it when you're in danger.

334
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,580
I don't need this crap!

335
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,910
Take it back, Min Do Hyeok!

336
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,740
It's troublesome if you keep violating the rules, Mo Ne.

337
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,649
I don't know what I'll do.

338
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,665
   

339
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:34,145
   

340
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:35,835
   

341
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,265
   

342
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:44,945
   

343
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:54,835
It's time for the next step.

344
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:57,335
Prepare for the press conference.

345
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:02,635
Since your residence is clear and it's your first offense,

346
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,335
I'll have you go home for now.

347
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:08,705
Come back for interrogation tomorrow morning by 9:00 a.m.

348
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,955
   

349
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:33,325
 - The customer can't answer the call right now.  
 - Shit.

350
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:38,165
 Something feels off. 

351
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:39,135
 I'm going to decline. 

352
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,935
 - Cha Joo Ran suddenly getting a man is one thing. 
 - Hey. 

353
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:44,005
 Hold on! 

354
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:49,285
 And also that envelope being there right in front of me. 

355
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:55,035
 It feels like someone is manipulating us. 

356
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,915
 Could it be... 

357
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,735
Move. I came to meet the Chairman.

358
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:11,635
Don't you know who I am?

359
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:16,125
Please go back. The Chairman ordered not to let you in.

360
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:19,635
Deliver this to the Chairman quickly.

361
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,335
Tell him I found Medusa.

362
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:24,275
The evidence is in here.

363
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:28,315
If you don't go back, I'll have to call the police.

364
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,845
Mr. Junkie.

365
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:32,335
Hey, take him outside!

366
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,335
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

367
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,145
Hey! H-Hey—

368
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:36,985
J-Just deliver this for me, then.

369
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,735
T-That's all I need. It's an important matter!

370
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:44,035
Hey! I'm Nam Cheol Woo. Let go, you punks.

371
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,335
Geum Ra Hee.

372
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,835
   

373
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:10,325
Captain, why do you keep forgetting your place?

374
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:17,285
   

375
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:20,185
Huh. Not too bad.

376
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:23,035
Did I underestimate you too much?

377
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:27,165
Medusa. You're Medusa, right?

378
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:29,295
Where's Joo Ran?

379
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,765
She abandoned you and chose another man.

380
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,515
But you're still worried about her?

381
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:40,175
Worry about yourself.

382
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:44,225
You've lost everything. Your job, honor, and love.

383
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,835
It's up to me whether to kill her or not.

384
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:49,115
Where's Cha Joo Ran?

385
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,155
And if I tell you?

386
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:57,305
What can you do for me?

387
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,925
What?

388
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:03,285
Give me everything you own.

389
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,755
Your home, building, and bank accounts.

390
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:08,515
I'll let you meet Cha Joo Ran if you do.

391
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,895
I can also have her killed if you want.

392
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:15,035
I'll kill her with my own hands.

393
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:18,105
I'll give you everything you want.

394
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:20,555
So tell me where she is.

395
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:41,005
Stop hitting on my wife, asshole.

396
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:13,715
The feeling of your heart...

397
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,185
ripping apart after losing your mother...

398
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:21,605
You'll never know what it feels like.

399
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,875
Just wait and see, you son of a bitch!

400
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,675
 I miss you, Mo Ne. 

401
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:08,385
 I'll do everything you want. Please answer your phone. 
   

402
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:10,895
What a fucking psychopath.

403
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:17,035
How's the search for Medusa going?

404
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:21,195
I was too busy to ask him yet.

405
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:25,535
Hurry up. You know Matthew doesn't have patience.

406
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:29,065
How is it with Hannah? Do you get along?

407
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:31,555
She resembles you a lot.

408
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:35,315
Her talent and her boldness.

409
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:39,915
Or should I say she takes after K?

410
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,895
Please shut your mouth.

411
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:49,105
She can't even be replaced now since the article about the genius child actor was published.

412
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,415
You've got no way out, Mo Ne.

413
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:53,695
I can just drop out and pay the penalty.

414
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:56,055
Or I can twist my ankle instead.

415
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:59,755
Before that, Hannah might throttle your neck.

416
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:02,025
Because to Hannah,

417
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:07,975
you're the enemy who caused her mom's death.

418
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:11,955
And you're my enemy who killed my mom!

419
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,185
I killed her?

420
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,905
Do you really think so?

421
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:29,005
   

422
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,775
This is...

423
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,235
Did you think I wouldn't know if you hid it away?

424
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,705
You're the one who killed your mom!

425
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:45,645
Your mom died because you abandoned her.

426
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:54,735
Don't— N-No!

427
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:56,695
No!

428
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,515
No, no.

429
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:09,055
No! N-No...

430
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:11,935
I'm paying you back for what happened last time.

431
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:15,305
Clean it up nicely.

432
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:45,095
 Hey! Is anyone there? 

433
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:47,915
Please help. Someone help!

434
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:50,025
Please help.

435
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:54,535
Please help.

436
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:13,955
Cheol Woo?

437
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:16,355
Cha Joo Ran.

438
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,365
I loved you so much.

439
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:21,975
How can you do this to me?

440
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:26,635
Even if I had to crawl like a dog under Matthew and Geum Ra Hee,

441
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:29,755
I was happy because I was with you.

442
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:33,165
So why did you do that to me?

443
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:37,505
Is betrayal the final consequence of my love?

444
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:41,275
I'll never forgive you, Cha Joo Ran!

445
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:46,625
Yes. Don't forgive me.

446
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,785
What I did to you is an unforgivable thing.

447
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:51,345
I deserve to die.

448
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:55,935
If I'm to die by your hands, it's not too bad of a way to die.

449
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,295
Do it.

450
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,535
Cha Joo Ran!

451
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:25,285
Why didn't you dodge?

452
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,535
Why didn't you kill me?

453
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:36,515
H-How can I kill you?

454
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:40,725
If I kill you, how would I live?

455
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:46,245
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-It was all my fault.

456
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,015
I'm so sorry...

457
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:56,205
   

458
00:37:56,205 --> 00:38:00,305
Mo Ne, I'm so happy you came.

459
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:06,035
I'd like to sincerely apologize for last time.

460
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:10,415
I must've gone mad momentarily because I love you so much.

461
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,885
It'll never happen again.

462
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:17,525
What do you mean? I forgot it all.

463
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:23,695
As expected, you're bold and awesome, Mo Ne.

464
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:27,355
Tell me if there's anything you want, like a wish.

465
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:31,685
Anything...

466
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,875
I want?

467
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:38,515
Of course, it's under the premise you'll keep our rule.

468
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,805
If you don't lie and

469
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:43,615
stop meeting Min Do Hyeok.

470
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:49,335
Min Do Hyeok had come to the filming set yesterday.

471
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:53,935
He gave me this, telling me to press it if I'm in danger.

472
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:57,715
Looks like I won't need it now.

473
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:01,545
Of course. You have me.

474
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,445
That fucking lunatic.

475
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,495
You need to listen to my wish first.

476
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,815
   

477
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:18,045
Tell me. What is your wish?

478
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:24,385
Let me kill Geum Ra Hee with my own hands.

479
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:39,135
   
 Hello. 

480
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:41,855
 Oh, hello. 

481
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,555
Are you ready?

482
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:05,785
You just need to do as you're told.

483
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:09,985
Say you're happy with the kindness of my family.

484
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:15,085
Say you're enjoying each day with the greatest mom and dad.

485
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:17,265
Do you understand?

486
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:21,205
Shall we get going now?

487
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,175
You can't. Give this another thought.

488
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,525
I won't make Hannah do this.

489
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:35,225
Hannah, come.

490
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,675
If you don't, our family will be destroyed like this.

491
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,795
You can't live with Hannah, either.

492
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:45,435
She'll be sent to an orphanage or be adopted to another home.

493
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,115
It'd be fine if she meets good parents,

494
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:52,595
but they can try to use her to make money as a genius child actor.

495
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:56,635
You also know how wicked people are.

496
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,295
Just look at us.

497
00:40:58,295 --> 00:40:59,865
Still, this is wrong!

498
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:02,235
You said you want to protect Hannah.

499
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:04,305
You protect her, then!

500
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:07,035
Please don't fight.

501
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:22,535
You and Hannah both can stay out of this. I'll do it alone.

502
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:26,335
Whether I'm covered in shit or treated like a dog, this is solely my lot.

503
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:27,795
Send Hannah home.

504
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:29,895
What are you going to do alone?

505
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:33,265
Jin Mo! Jin Mo!

506
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:47,665
I prepared this gathering to point out the fake news about my family.

507
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:52,445
Firstly, the rumor that I used to be a waiter at a bar

508
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:54,385
is true.

509
00:41:55,695 --> 00:42:00,285
I grew up as an orphan, so I took any job I could get.

510
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,955
In my 20s, I even worked part-time at a bar.

511
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:06,525
However, aren't all occupations equally honorable?

512
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:11,485
I believe the value of my labor shouldn't be discredited just because I worked at a bar.

513
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:16,925
 Secondly, I only worked on the movie, "To D," with TikiTaka. 

514
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,605
 I'm clearly stating that Chairman Matthew 

515
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:23,365
 has nothing to do with how I became State Affairs Deputy Mayor. 

516
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,735
Walking into the swamp on his own...

517
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:29,915
 The rumors about my marriage being fake is a blatant lie. 

518
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,135
 And Noh Hannah is the proof. 

519
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:34,065
- Post Save's notification. 
 - Yes, CEO.

520
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,525
 How could we have thought to foster Noh Hannah if our marriage was fake? 

521
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:39,535
 Don't you agree? 

522
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:44,045
Going forward, I'll take strong legal action

523
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:47,105
against every fake news about my family.

524
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:49,505
There won't be any leniency.

525
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,295
That's all.

526
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:54,875
   

527
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:01,005
 That's Save's notification. 

528
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:04,185
- What's this? 
 - Looks like they're going to play something.

529
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:08,165
 Someone just commented on my SNS feed that we're a fake couple. 

530
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:13,375
 If the rumors spread like wildfire, our image is done for. 

531
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,015
 How the hell would they know if we're fake or not? 

532
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:19,815
 We even signed the marriage papers and lived like a married couple for a year. 

533
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:23,005
 They could've noticed that we were acting! 

534
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:24,935
 Hold a press conference right away. 

535
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,545
 We'll have to use Hannah. 

536
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:30,215
Hello?

537
00:43:30,215 --> 00:43:31,585
 What happened? 

538
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:33,665
Where did the recording come from?

539
00:43:33,665 --> 00:43:36,265
Did you guys really say this, or is it a deepfake?

540
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:39,105
It's Geum Ra Hee. She's the one who recorded it.

541
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:41,845
She's the only one who heard this conversation.

542
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:47,825
Geum Ra Hee...

543
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,975
is Medusa.

544
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:55,225
Geum Ra Hee...

545
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:57,305
What the fuck.

546
00:43:57,305 --> 00:44:00,735
So, I've been played by Geum Ra Hee all this time?

547
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,585
That sly fucking snake.

548
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,125
You leaked the recording, didn't you?

549
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,665
Don't try to get out of it.

550
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,675
There were only three of us at the store then.

551
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:20,285
Poor Erica and Phillip.

552
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,335
Thanks to a bad mom, only the kids will be in a precarious position.

553
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:25,215
What are you saying?

554
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,355
What about my kids?

555
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:30,535
I'm thinking about what to do with Erica and Phillip.

556
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,515
How could I get them to die blaming you?

557
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:35,075
 No! 

558
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,625
What do you want?

559
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,125
What are you trying to do?

560
00:44:40,005 --> 00:44:42,235
Let go of my kids. I'll go there.

561
00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:44,975
Just kill me instead!

562
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:49,285
Then, come to your house now.

563
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:52,355
Geum Ra Hee.

564
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,575
Geum Ra Hee!

565
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:06,445
Geum Ra Hee is Medusa.

566
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:08,395
Geum Ra Hee is planning to destroy us all.

567
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:10,985
That woman has our twins!

568
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:15,035
If something happens to Erica and Phillip, I really can't live!

569
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:18,365
- What about Hannah? 
 - I sent her home.

570
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,275
Hannah is in danger, too.

571
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:28,765
Step aside!

572
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,645
Let's go.

573
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,515
Get us home as quickly as possible!

574
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:56,195
Gosh, please pick up your phone.

575
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:58,885
Nothing's going to happen. Don't worry.

576
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:03,795
I can't do this. I'm going to call the police.

577
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,645
Gosh, I can finally breathe.

578
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:38,965
Oh, right. I found out who Medusa is.

579
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:40,935
It's Geum Ra Hee.

580
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,575
Are you serious?

581
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:47,565
Geum Ra Hee is trying to bring down Matthew and become number one.

582
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:50,645
That's why that rotten bitch took all my money.

583
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:53,475
That woman also took everything from me.

584
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:56,845
I handed over everything to find out where you were.

585
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:58,485
What?

586
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:02,375
You didn't. Right? You've got a secret stash somewhere. Right?

587
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,065
I don't.

588
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:08,915
I took the express bus on the way and spent every penny to buy wild-caught fish.

589
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:10,825
I did well, right?

590
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:14,055
Baby, don't you have anything put away?

591
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:16,875
What could I have? I only have debt.

592
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,895
How are you going to take care of me?

593
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:25,055
Honey!

594
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:27,195
Shit. Be careful.

595
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:28,945
No, you can't.

596
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:39,685
Geum Ra Hee isn't in her office.

597
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:42,255
- Go to that bitch's house. 
 - Got it, sir.

598
00:47:42,255 --> 00:47:44,035
   

599
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,415
   

600
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:51,965
Are Cha Joo Ran, Nam Cheol Woo, Yang Jin Mo, and Go Myeong Ji getting caught like this?

601
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:57,165
We only have Matthew and Mo Ne left now.

602
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,435
How do you plan to get Matthew?

603
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:01,785
None of your business.

604
00:48:01,785 --> 00:48:03,945
You just do what I tell you to do.

605
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:09,215
Then, you can get TikiTaka in its entirety.

606
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:14,425
Oh, can I make you an offer?

607
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,565
Let's switch Han Mo Ne and Min Do Hyeok.

608
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:21,455
We'll save Han Mo Ne and kill Min Do Hyeok.

609
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:25,145
You can do that much for me. Right?

610
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,945
That wasn't...

611
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:31,465
a part of our agreement.

612
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:44,575
Han Mo Ne was my condition for our deal in the first place.

613
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:49,285
If you don't like it, you can say our deal never happened.

614
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:54,345
What's the reason?

615
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,425
Do you really...

616
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,445
love Mo Ne or something?

617
00:49:00,445 --> 00:49:05,715
I totally messed up my style because of Min Do Hyeok, that bastard.

618
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:09,985
You see, I always pay back what I get.

619
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:18,615
Geum Ra Hee and Hwang Chan Seong are plotting something.

620
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:21,465
Save's notification blew up Yang Jin Mo's recording,

621
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:23,795
Nam Cheol Woo was let go due to drug use,

622
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:27,925
and Cha Joo Ran has been missing since yesterday.

623
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:30,765
Things are happening to the seven in consecutive order.

624
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:34,695
Yang Jin Mo, Go Myeong Ji, and who's next?

625
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,165
- Hyung, Han Mo Ne's in danger. 
 - What?

626
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:46,005
Geum Ra Hee and Hwang Chan Seong must've attacked Han Mo Ne, too.

627
00:49:54,485 --> 00:49:57,115
   
   

628
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:58,405
Where's Han Mo Ne?

629
00:49:58,405 --> 00:50:01,485
She's not even answering after ghosting a commercial shoot.

630
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:04,505
Hello? Hyung!

631
00:50:09,685 --> 00:50:14,285
The first one to bring me Geum Ra Hee will get a building from me.

632
00:50:14,285 --> 00:50:15,795
Search every corner!

633
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:17,945
 Yes, Chairman! 

634
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:35,025
Where are you hiding?

635
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:47,535
You were that fucking rat, too?

636
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,455
Gosh, seriously.

637
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:24,135
This is where you were hiding?

638
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:32,715
     

639
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,925
That fucking crazy bitch!

640
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:38,825
This is how you interfered every time!

641
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:50,255
Great job coming all the way here.

642
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,795
You won't need any other explanation. Right?

643
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:54,585
You fucking bitch—

644
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:02,385
Stand up.

645
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:10,215
Come here.

646
00:52:10,215 --> 00:52:12,805
I'm going to kill you.

647
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,335
Take him to Gagok District.

648
00:52:58,135 --> 00:53:05,235
 Are you curious about what I'm trying to do and what I want? 

649
00:53:21,455 --> 00:53:22,495
   

650
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:34,735
 What I'm trying to achieve, even by selling off Min Do Hyeok to Hwang Chan Seong. 

651
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:40,135
   
   

652
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:44,885
   
   

653
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:15,193
   
   

654
00:55:15,193 --> 00:55:18,493
Didn't we watch this last time?

655
00:55:18,493 --> 00:55:20,493
   
   

656
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:23,433
   
   

657
00:55:41,093 --> 00:55:42,993
 My Mom... 

658
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:47,093
 Spare my mom's life, please. 

659
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,643
 He's holding something. 

660
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:51,403
 Isn't that a skull? 

661
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:06,513
 You all need to be punished. 

662
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,143
 And me, too. 

663
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:13,033
 By Park Nan Young, not me. 

664
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:34,693
 If you want to save Min Do Hyeok, you'll have to come on time. 

665
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:47,963
   

666
00:56:49,393 --> 00:56:51,393
   

667
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:54,093
   

668
00:57:16,553 --> 00:57:18,773
Don't do it, Ra Hee.

669
00:57:27,663 --> 00:57:30,063
   

670
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:40,203
   
   

671
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:45,593
   
   

672
00:58:06,393 --> 00:58:08,593
Gosh, my head hurts.

673
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:13,983
What's this?

674
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:23,763
Hey, Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo!

675
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,513
Wake up.

676
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:33,323
   
 ("Joohong" means scarlet) 

677
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:47,063
Cha Joo Ran.

678
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,873
W-Why are we here?

679
00:58:49,873 --> 00:58:51,143
This is—

680
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:53,083
Jin Mo.

681
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:10,793
Who's this fucker now?

682
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:12,593
Why are you here?

683
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:14,493
Where is this?

684
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:15,793
Where's Han Mo Ne?

685
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,873
Do you think I'd know that?

686
00:59:17,873 --> 00:59:20,393
I only woke up just now, too.

687
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:22,893
But this place is...

688
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,493
the underground prison I made.

689
00:59:25,493 --> 00:59:26,763
Prison.

690
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,713
W-Where are you, Jin Mo?

691
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:30,303
Jin Mo!

692
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:32,113
Cheol Woo!

693
00:59:32,113 --> 00:59:34,493
Cheol Woo, where are you?

694
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:35,593
 Honey! 

695
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:37,773
- Someone else is outside. 
  - I'm here! 

696
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:39,773
Honey, are you okay? Are you hurt?

697
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:41,393
This is Geum Ra Hee's doing.

698
00:59:41,393 --> 00:59:43,683
- Geum Ra Hee! 
 - What?

699
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:47,803
What do you want? What are you plotting?

700
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:55,503
All of you will...

701
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,893
die here...

702
00:59:59,353 --> 01:00:01,543
today.

703
01:00:08,593 --> 01:00:10,193
Geum Ra Hee?

704
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:12,633
Geum Ra Hee?

705
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:15,633
Geum Ra Hee, w-where are my kids?

706
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,423
Let me see my kids!

707
01:00:17,423 --> 01:00:20,043
Geum Ra Hee! Where are you?

708
01:00:20,043 --> 01:00:21,813
Why would we die?

709
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:23,493
- Hey, Geum Ra Hee! 
 - This is bullshit!

710
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:25,393
Who's going to die, huh?

711
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:26,493
Geum Ra Hee!

712
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:29,553
Shit. Let me go!

713
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,983
Welcome...

714
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,473
to hell.

715
01:01:31,093 --> 01:01:38,143

01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:56,543
   

717
01:01:56,543 --> 01:01:58,653
 I'll start the survival game now. 

718
01:01:58,653 --> 01:02:00,803
 There's only one bullet, and you have five minutes. 

719
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:03,983
 Are you telling us to shoot each other? 

720
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:06,933
 If you don't shoot within five minutes, you'll all die. 

721
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:10,163
 This was the reason Geum Ra Hee planned a survival game. 

722
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,153
 You said you wanted to kill Geum Ra Hee. Right? 

723
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:13,793
 Today is the day. 

724
01:02:13,793 --> 01:02:16,293
 Ra Hee. Do Hyeok! 

725
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:20,263
 Will God allow me to take my revenge? 

726
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:23,253
 It's time for punishment.
