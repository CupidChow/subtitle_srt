1
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:47,686
   

2
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:50,820
   

3
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,730
   

4
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,490
   

5
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,020
   

6
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,920
Mom, we're back from camping.

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
We ate meat, blew bubbles, and

8
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,700
played with water guns, too.

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,360
It was really, really fun.

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,800
Right, we also met a pretty conglomerate lady.

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,990
She said she was really close to you.

12
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,320
Dad promised, too.

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,400
We'll go camping again with you.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,970
So get better quickly and let's go camping together.

15
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,600
Hey, Noh Hannah, don't you have anything to say?

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,930
My mom's listening to everything.

17
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,530
Ahjumma,

18
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,420
I was really happy when you told me to become your daughter.

19
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,930
I can still become your daughter. Right?

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,760
Hey, you can't!

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,930
You can't become my mom's daughter.

22
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,440
That'd mean you and I can't get married.

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,670
Hey, being a family is way better.

24
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,780
You can see her for life.

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,450
For life?

26
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,750
Really?

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,840
We're going to live with Hannah for life?

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,880
Whoa, that's great!

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,060
Hey, Noh Hannah, you can be my mom's daughter!

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,010
Whoa, I'm so excited!

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,940


32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,220
 What do you think about officially adopting Hannah? 

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,350
 Hannah needs to start school soon, too. 

34
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,310
 So let's raise her as our child. 

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,270
 I think I can really become a good mother. 

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,880
Hurry up and get better so we can share this happiness together.

37
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,360
Kids, show Mom what you practiced.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,610
 Yes. 

39
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,180
♫  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh  ♫

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,160
♫  O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way  ♫

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,880
♫  Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright  ♫

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,900
♫  What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  ♫

43
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,540
Ki Tak, our plan will continue...

44
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,440
with everyone's heart in it.

45
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,220
We need to first get back the name, Lee Hwi So.

46
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,310
K will become even busier.

47
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,070
There's already an organization demanding the truth from Matthew.

48
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,610
He'll be anxious to prove he's Lee Hwi So.

49
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,260
Our app is complete, too.

50
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,070
It's about time to expose the truth of TikiTaka's Secret Talk.

51
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,420
Did you decide on a name for the app?

52
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,800
S-Curi.

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,870
Using this app, you can find out right away if your Secret Talk is being spied on.

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,900
The moment you recognize a breach, you can block the hacker, too.

55
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,570
S-Curi is finally coming out into the world.

56
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,060
Great work, Do Hyeok. I mean...

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,440
CEO Min.

58
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,610
You're so silly.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm really...

60
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,390
proud of you.

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,230
I didn't do anything, Hyung. It's all thanks to Lee Hwi So.

62
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,790
I only deciphered Lee Hwi So's Secret Talk processor.

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,070
I hope the entire world will know what a great and talented person he was.

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,250
As well as,

65
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,560
what a great dad he was.

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,010
Hyung, you can't be getting teary already.

67
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,270
It's only the beginning.

68
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,260
There's something I couldn't tell you.

69
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,790
Da Mi...

70
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,590
is my daughter I had with Geum Ra Hee.

71
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,410
What are you saying, Hyung?

72
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,360
H-Hyung, Da Mi is Chairman Bang's granddaughter. Right?

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,550
I only found out recently, too.

74
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,920
After Geum Ra Hee died...

75
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,450
Does that mean Geum Ra Hee deceived Chairman Bang?

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,630
That was probably her only option back then.

77
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,910
She desperately needed money,

78
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,870
but she probably couldn't find any way to make money.

79
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,540
- Hyung. 
 - I know it, too!

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,460
That Geum Ra Hee can't be forgiven.

81
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,330
I know the elder would say she deserves to die.

82
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,660
However, I'm worse.

83
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,090
I'm the one who turned Ra Hee to be so vicious.

84
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,860
All of this started because of me!

85
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,690
If only...

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,790
I had lived properly—

87
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,250
Hyung, don't blame yourself. T-This isn't your fault.

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,330
While she was alive,

89
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,170
I never even got to meet her.

90
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,700
I've never called her by her name,

91
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,250
ate a meal together,

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,740
or even held her hands.

93
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,060
All I saw was...

94
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,660
her last moments when she was

95
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,480
dying a lonely death with no one to help her.

96
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,260
Ki Tak.

97
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,480
The Bang Da Mi I remember was

98
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,590
a very energetic girl.

99
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,700
She was very confident and

100
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,130
she knew how to speak for herself.

101
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,920
And she was very kind.

102
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,090
Just like you, Hyung.

103
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,620
Do Hyeok,

104
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,030
since you saw it all, please tell me.

105
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,180
That Da Mi's life wasn't entirely unfortunate.

106
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,180
That she had more happy days.

107
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,240
That it was fortunate for her...

108
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,480
to meet the greatest dad in the world

109
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,800
like Lee Hwi So.

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,000
Even if I had raised her,

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,390
I couldn't have loved her like he did.

112
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,830
   

113
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,480
   

114
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,890
I'm sorry I invited you so late, Uncle.

115
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,540
Have you been doing well?

116
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,070
Please let me bow first.

117
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,450
Gosh, y-you don't have to!

118
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,960
Gosh, thank you for reaching out to me.

119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,660
I was sad we lost touch after my parents passed away.

120
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,570
It's so great we got to meet like this.

121
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,620
It was really lonely without any family or relatives.

122
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,660
I didn't even do my job as an uncle.

123
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,550
It's so shameless of me.

124
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,640
I can die without any regrets now.

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,340
Please don't say such things.

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,960
We finally reunited, so you should live long.

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,100
He has cancer.

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,260
He's been fighting it for 10 years now.

129
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,220
That's why we sold all our farmland and

130
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,360
we have more than 100 million won in debt for the hospital fees.

131
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,860
Please don't worry. I'll take care of it all.

132
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,460
Secretary Chae, pay off all their debts with my personal funds right now

133
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,030
and buy them the best apartment complex near their house.

134
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,710
Yes, I'll do that.

135
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,710
M-My goodness! Are you sure?

136
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,910
Gosh, I'm so thankful.

137
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,040
These kids over there are our children.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,340
They're incredibly smart but couldn't get a job yet.

139
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,660
Do you happen to have some decent jobs to offer here?

140
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,430
Of course.

141
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,470
Oh, and also, our youngest is getting married next month.

142
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,270
Congratulations.

143
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,440
I guess she is a lucky girl.

144
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,220
She met a conglomerate brother like you right before her wedding.

145
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,860
Secretary Chae will also take care of the wedding.

146
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,710
I'm actually thankful to you for giving me a chance to fulfill my duties.

147
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:39,740
In that case, can I also ask you to take care of our Lee Clan of Myeongju?

148
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm going to be dead soon,

149
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,740
but it weighs heavily in my heart how our clan declined.

150
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,780
Our ancestral burial mountain is about to be foreclosed, too.

151
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,770
 Damn it. Is today the day? 

152
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,680
 Why do you want so many things when you'll die soon? 

153
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,720
 You're less than a stranger if you had cut ties for 40 years. 

154
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,360
Of course, I should take care of the clan matters.

155
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,400
Should I build a new clan hall while I'm at it?

156
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,870
He's our father's first cousin's third son.

157
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,680
He's a four-time repeater for college.

158
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,850
- Also, that one is my nephew's second son. 
 - Hello.

159
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Goodness, right! Kids, come over here.

160
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,820
Hurry up and say hi. Quickly now.

161
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,440
All right. Come here.

162
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,380
There, there. Stand.

163
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,400
 - Hello.  
 - Hi.

164
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,980
You can go over there and play.

165
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,350
- Goodness, go play. 
 - Hello.

166
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,000
Write an article for every single thing.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,080
That Lee Clan of Myeongju is passionately supporting Chairman Matthew.

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,650
Yes, I understand.

169
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,720
   

170
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,470
   

171
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,700
   

172
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,830
   

173
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,160
Bang Da Mi Scholarship will start at Myeongju Girls' High School, my daughter's alma mater

174
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,970
and it'll be expanded to the entire country.

175
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,590
I plan to provide all financial support and shelter from now on.

176
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,550
The Bang Da Mi incident was six years ago.

177
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,980
Why suddenly start sponsorship?

178
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,640
Is it a counterattack on CEO Min Do Hyeok, who said you're the fake Lee Hwi So?

179
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,440
Even after six years, fake news and school violence still thrive.

180
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,340
The world becomes more violent by the day

181
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,280
and the predators are becoming more evil.

182
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,870
Innocent victims deserve to be protected.

183
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,620
I'll do all I can within my power to help.

184
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,080
In the name of my daughter, Da Mi.

185
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,540
Lee Hwi So, I'm rooting for you.

186
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,260
Thank you, Chairman Matthew!

187
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,760
As expected, he began using Da Mi's name.

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,560
He'll be using all the money he can until the official verification day.

189
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,040
Because that's the only way he can prove himself.

190
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,110
I'm doing the final maintenance on S-Curi right now.

191
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,710
Hyung, are you okay?

192
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,560
Yes, I'm okay.

193
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,580
I'll proceed to the next plan.

194
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,210
 We have a new student who transferred to our school. 

195
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,500
 Hi, I'm Bang Da Mi. 

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,460
 I used to attend Deokseon Girls' High School, 

197
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,880
 but I'm new to this area, so I don't know anything. 

198
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,980
 Let's be good friends. 

199
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:09,350
   

200
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,460
 I won't lie or exaggerate anything. 

201
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,690
 The one who gave birth was Han Mo Ne! 

202
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,730
 I had been keeping quiet to keep Mo Ne's secret, 

203
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,260
 but I couldn't stay silent when my dad was being misunderstood by others. 

204
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,420
 Let me tell the truth! 

205
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,610
 - Please, let go of me!  
 - Da Mi!

206
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,800
 It really wasn't me! 

207
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,400
   

208
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,190
Da Mi.

209
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,380
Are you going somewhere?

210
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,370
To Chairman Matthew's house.

211
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,670
Today is the day Lee Hwi So is getting verified.

212
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,580
Oh, that's right.

213
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,690
But will he make it through the verification this time?

214
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,380
DTM is raising its voice, and the controversy is quite serious. 
    

215
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,590
I think they'll be quite particular in verifying.

216
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,490
Don't worry.

217
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,320
Matthew has a helper you can't even imagine.

218
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,810
I'll be back.

219
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,810
Hold on.

220
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,660
You won't be coming home too late. Right?

221
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
I want to have dinner together.

222
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,590
We're finally feeling like newlyweds.

223
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,920
I won't be late. I'll call.

224
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,440
 Hwang Chan Seong just left for Matthew's house. 

225
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,930
 I put a bug on him, so I'll tell you right away if I get anything. 

226
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,090
You're looking quite nervous.

227
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,200
I guess even the thousand-faced Matthew Lee is scared, huh?

228
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,800
As if.

229
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,400
As long as I have Luca, I can't lose this game, even if I want to.

230
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,100
Why would you need me, then?

231
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,530
When you're so confident.

232
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,090
It's very simple.

233
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,060
While I'm getting the physical verification,

234
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,110
keep your eyes on Luca so Min Do Hyeok doesn't access her.

235
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,030
Can Min Do Hyeok even get through to Luca?

236
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,080
Of course, it's impossible.

237
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,990
But I must prepare for the unlikely case.

238
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,480
Because they'll be coming at me with a deathly resolve, too.

239
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,430
This game will be a matter of speed.

240
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,630
As long as Luca operates properly, it's game over.

241
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,210
Okay.

242
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,990
My role is quite important, huh?

243
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,510
It'll be fun.

244
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,770
You're absolutely not to take your eyes off of Luca.

245
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,280
If she senses anything, she'll give you a warning message.

246
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,920
Block him off right away, then.

247
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,110
Don't worry.

248
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,050
I'm the one who created Save.

249
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm the expert on this matter.

250
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,130
Luca,

251
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,170
allow Hwang Chan Seong to control the entire system without needing permission from now on.

252
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,970
 K is also preparing in case Luca's system gets breached. 

253
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,290
 Hwang Chan Seong will stop you from accessing Luca in any way. 

254
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,220
 I think we'll need to find another way. 

255
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,060
   
   

256
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,840
The National Verification Team will start the Lee Hwi So verification process now.

257
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,640
Our team is made up of experts and representatives, randomly selected today.

258
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,250
And I inform you we had no prior contact with Chairman Matthew.

259
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,200
All right. Please exchange greetings.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,480
Also, the entire verification process is broadcast on live TV, and

261
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,930
the livestream absolutely can't be fabricated.

262
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,140
 Before the verification process begins, 

263
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,950
 - I'll give Chairman Matthew a chance to speak.  
 - Honey, come here. Quickly!

264
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,550
The jangjorim is done.

265
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,320
Phillip says my jangjorim tastes the best in this world.

266
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,970
Kids don't lie about their taste, you know?

267
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,160
Smart women are even good at cooking, too.

268
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,110
All right. The Lee Hwi So verification show finally began.

269
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,230
Nice! We need to get to our positions, too.

270
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,180
Hurry up and get changed. O-Oh!

271
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,500
You reviewed the mission thoroughly. Right?

272
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,050
I reviewed it more than 100 times.

273
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,950
- How many tour buses was it again? 
 - 15 buses.

274
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,370
It'll take forever just to check them over.

275
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,560
- Let's hurry up and go. 
 - Yeah!

276
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,870
This is an emergency!

277
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,440
All right.

278
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,610
 Firstly, I sincerely apologize for causing a national controversy. 

279
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:42,200
I never even imagined I'd have to verify myself once again.

280
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,810
 I was able to endure the heartbreaking pain and stay convicted to avenge my daughter 

281
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,290
 solely thanks to my resolve to catch Shim Joon Seok. 

282
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,360
 But to say that I'm Shim Joon Seok... 

283
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,100
 I feel overwhelmingly sorry for Da Mi as her dad 

284
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,370
 and ashamed beyond words. 

285
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:10,050
 However, I'll accept all of this as my calling and 

286
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:17,060
 righteously prove I'm Lee Hwi So right in front of the nation. 

287
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,390
 We'll first perform the fingerprint verification. 

288
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,540
   
   

289
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,040
Gosh, what a fucking lunatic!

290
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,400
You endured the heartbreaking pain and stayed convicted to avenge your daughter?

291
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,230
That bastard will easily take first place in a lying competition.

292
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,490
It'll show up as a 100% match.

293
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,660
Because he must've fabricated fingerprints,

294
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,090
blood type, hospital records, and even the DNA using Luca.

295
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,530
Yes. The fingerprints match 100%.

296
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:55,160
Next up is dental verification based on dental history.

297
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,650
Yes. Dental verification is also a match.

298
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,350
It's fine. The real game starts now.

299
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,850
We'll make him pay for running his mouth the wrong way.

300
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,100
It's our turn now. What do I need to do?

301
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,220
Right at 12 o'clock, distribute S-Curi for free to people and

302
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,170
promote how they can protect their personal information.

303
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,870
- I'll get right to it. 
 - I'll go to TikiTaka.

304
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,980
What about me, then? What should I do?

305
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,360
As Seongchan Group's advisor,

306
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,990
please reveal TikiTaka's Secret Talk is a complete lie, Aunt.

307
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,340
Right now.

308
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,570
TikiTaka's Secret Talk actually isn't so secret.

309
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,800
The secret chat messages are erased only on your devices.

310
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,740
They're encrypted and stored on the server permanently.

311
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,880
 Therefore, the admins can view them all they want. 

312
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,390
 If you want to protect your personal information, 

313
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,520
 make sure to install S-Curi. 

314
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,990
Right now!

315
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,850
   

316
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,820
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

317
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,450
Why isn't he answering?

318
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,390
   

319
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,950
What's the matter? I'm kind of busy.

320
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,540
Are you too busy?

321
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,620
Should I save it for later?

322
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,250
No, what would come first before you, Mo Ne.

323
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,760
Go ahead.

324
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,090
I called to ask for a favor.

325
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,300
Could you give me Reporter Noh Sang Woo's number?

326
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,380
Reporter Noh? Why?

327
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,610
Did that bastard write another absurd article?

328
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,310
I think Reporter Noh just posted another video slandering me on MyTV.

329
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,450
He even mentioned Min Do Hyeok and made up stories.

330
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,760
Gosh, I'm so tired of rumors like this.

331
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,150
I'll make him take down the video right now.

332
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,740
Just give me a second. Yes.

333
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,350
Hey, Secretary Nam, you know Reporter Noh Sang Woo. Right?

334
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,490
Send me the phone number of his media company CEO.

335
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,420
   
   

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,810
   

337
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,990
   

338
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,700
 Mo Ne, don't worry. I took care of it. 

339
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,260
   

340
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,470
The verification isn't done yet, so outsiders can't enter.

341
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,310
These people aren't outsiders.

342
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,490
They're essential people for the Lee Hwi So verification.

343
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,450
Let's go.

344
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,990
The verification team,

345
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,380
after precisely verifying his fingerprints, blood type, and the DNA,

346
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,200
has officially and finally verified that Chairman Matthew is Lee Hwi So.

347
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,420
With this, I hope there won't be any more arguments

348
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,560
about Chairman Matthew being Shim Joon Seok.

349
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,170
   
   

350
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,800
Thank you.

351
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,040
The verification isn't over yet!

352
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,730
The actual Lee Hwi So verification starts now.

353
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,770
These people are Lee Hwi So's old acquaintances.

354
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,820
If Chairman Matthew is truly Lee Hwi So, he'll surely recognize them.

355
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,730
Get yourself a personal verification, Chairman Matthew.

356
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,300
Gosh, seriously!

357
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,210
   

358
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,350
Gosh, CEO Min, why are you so good with words?

359
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,250
He's looking even more handsome today!

360
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,590
- Welcome! 
 - Thanks!

361
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,770
Could you tell me how you're related to Lee Hwi So?

362
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,660
I was in the same class in third grade.

363
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,550
You brought the picture you took with Lee Hwi So. Right?

364
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,820
Yes, I did.

365
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,610
This is the picture we took on a spring picnic.

366
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,440
I wonder if he'll recognize my face.

367
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,180
It doesn't matter.

368
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,900
- Thank you for coming. 
 - Gosh, thank you!

369
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,070
- This way, please. 
 - Yes, yes.

370
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,570
Here you go.

371
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,640
I'm Hwi So's mother's second cousin.

372
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,350
I was at Hwi So's first birthday party.

373
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,200
Look. This is Lee Hwi So. Right?

374
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,250
I don't really know what he looked like as a baby.

375
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,760
For now, you can go!

376
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,690
Is it really true Lee Hwi So will pay 100 million won as long as I show a picture?

377
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,280
100 million won isn't the end.

378
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,380
If you say the right thing, he'll even buy you a house—

379
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,440
Oh, didn't you see how generous he was with his clan?

380
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,770
I see!

381
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,090
- You can go that way. 
 - Yes, yes.

382
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,810
Yes.

383
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,110
Honey, Honey! What are you doing? Another bus came.

384
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,920
- It's here now. Hurry. 
 - Oh, I'm coming. I am!

385
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,830
- I'm coming right now! 
 - Gosh, hello.

386
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,430
- I'm in-laws' third cousin once removed... 
 - Yes.

387
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,510
 Show me he's not Lee Hwi So, Min Do Hyeok. 

388
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,280
 It seems things went south. 

389
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,210
 Lee Hwi So's acquaintances barged in. 

390
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,890
 Identify them and send me their information quickly. 

391
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,370
Be on guard. Min Do Hyeok is plotting something.

392
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,080
He just launched a security app for Secret Talk.

393
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,020
Blackmailing using Secret Talk might not work anymore.

394
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,320
A security app?

395
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,810
For now, buy yourself some time.

396
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,180
And don't hang up the phone.

397
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,600
Please send Min Do Hyeok out of the verification site right now.

398
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,870
He's going to absurdly claim I'm Shim Joon Seok again.

399
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,260
I have no reason to be humiliated like that again now that the verifications are done.

400
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,110
I'd like to ask you politely.

401
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,040
We have already concluded that Chairman Matthew is Lee Hwi So.

402
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,700
Personal verification was adequately done through his uncle's family and his clan.

403
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,160
Verification Leader, this is the final process.

404
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,610
Lee Hwi So's old friends want to see their friend.

405
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,280
There'd be no reason to avoid them if he's confident. Right?

406
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,180
Fine, then. You can come up.

407
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,530
Luca, analyze the faces in the monitor.

408
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,190
 Commencing analysis. 

409
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,670
 What are you doing? Hurry up and find them! 

410
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,560
Min Do Hyeok,

411
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,190
you're delusional to think I'm Shim Joon Seok.

412
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,320
You should get treated if you're ill.

413
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,850
I'll be more than happy to help.

414
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,270
Do you know the greatest mistake Chairman Shim Yong made among many?

415
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,880
Because of his affection from raising you,

416
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,610
he didn't imprison you.

417
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,360
A hopeless psychopath like you.

418
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,220
I'll still give you one last chance.

419
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,230
If you recognize the gents I invited here,

420
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,400
I'll never raise questions about your identity again,

421
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,630
whether you're a murderer or not.

422
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,190
Tell me who I am.

423
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,980
 Hwang Chan Seong, hurry up and get to it! 

424
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,320
 I found it! They're his club members from college. 

425
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,670
The club's name is Maxa.

426
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,630
From the left, their names are Lee Jong Dae, Cheon Ho Young, and Han Seok Min.

427
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,480
Since it's come to this, I can't let my friends just stand there too long.

428
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,640
Lee Jong Dae, Cheon Ho Young, and Han Seok Min.

429
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,140
Long time no see.

430
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,530
You remember us?

431
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,040
Of course, we spent so much time together at Seoul University's student club, Maxa.

432
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,730
Do you remember this scar?

433
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,420
 It's a scar he got from playing soccer with Lee Hwi So. 

434
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,060
Of course I do.

435
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,190
I accidentally hurt you while playing soccer.

436
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,970
I'm sorry.

437
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,490
What are you saying?

438
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,790
I got this scar because I got drunk and fell off the rails!

439
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,700
 What's going on? 

440
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,620
 There's no way Luca would make a mistake. 

441
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,450
I must've been confused because it's been so long.

442
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,350
Not at all. You can never be confused.

443
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,560
Because Lee Hwi So never met Lee Jong Dae in the first place.

444
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,530
They don't know each other at all.

445
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,920
 If K is using Secret Talk's information, 

446
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,490
 we just need to turn it against him. 

447
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,680
 How? 

448
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,130
 We'll plant fake information in Luca. 

449
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,140
 I can make that much happen remotely. 

450
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,740
 However, there's one problem. 

451
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,760
 The warning messages will be prompted for a minute. 

452
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,360
 A minute, huh? 

453
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,130
 Leave it to me. I know the right person. 

454
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,240
 Now is the time. 

455
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,220
 I distracted Han Mo Ne and Hwang Chan Seong. 

456
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,760
   

457
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,380
   

458
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,520
What's wrong, Joon Seok?

459
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,220
Did Luca give you the wrong information or something?

460
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,210
Do you remember who I am, huh?

461
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,530
Come on. You said we're friends!

462
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,430
Hey, dear friend who claims to be friends with me.

463
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,500
Do you happen to remember my face, too?

464
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,070
Gosh, sir! Pleased to meet you!

465
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,190
Do you happen to know me?

466
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,970
Chairman, my foot.

467
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,710
Everyone, all I did was get plastic surgery and

468
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,670
built a company for my daughter, Da Mi.

469
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm sure Da Mi is also angered by

470
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,150
this ridiculous situation from the heavens.

471
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,920
I refuse to be verified any further.

472
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,030
Chairman! Chairman!

473
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,610
- Please give us a word! 
 - How can you refuse the verification?

474
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,720
   

475
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,980
I'm your opponent from now on.

476
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,850
Stand up.

477
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,930
Stay out of this if you have nothing to do with this!

478
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,150
What if I have something to do with it?

479
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,200
   

480
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,580
Hyung, let's leave for now.

481
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,190
Don't ever utter Da Mi's name with your filthy mouth.

482
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,330
It won't end with an arm next time.

483
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,370
I'll make sure to break your neck.

484
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,310
It won't take long.

485
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,820
Kang Ki Tak! Min Do Hyeok!

486
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Matthew, it's me!

487
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,710
We're here!

488
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,540
    
 Gosh, my junior!

489
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,050
   

490
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,740
Thank you very much!

491
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,050
100 million won.

492
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,230
Thank you so much. Here's my 100 million won!

493
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,650
   

494
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,900
On three!

495
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,560
   

496
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,670
Chairman, the prime minister is calling.

497
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,240
So what?

498
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,790
You think I can answer a phone call right now?

499
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,050
Tell them I'll call them back later.

500
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,250
Yes, I understand.

501
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,190
This is Secretary Chae Jong Woo of TikiTaka's CEO.

502
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,410
The chairman said he'd call you back soon.

503
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,440
I apologize.

504
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
Where were you while I was getting wrecked?

505
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,610
Are you that bad at your job?

506
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,640
I apologize.

507
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,030
Min Do Hyeok!

508
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,460
How's Matthew doing?

509
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,080
It looks like he worsened the suspicions by trying to do something.

510
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,470
I couldn't see him, so I just came back.

511
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,180
Chairman Matthew is laughable right now.

512
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,150
Mo Ne, what's wrong?

513
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,630
Is it because of the rumor?

514
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,150
I told you I took care of that!

515
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,140
I'm afraid Matthew will go berserk again.

516
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,250
Go berserk again?

517
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,430
Hannah and I are Matthew's greatest weaknesses.

518
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,670
If he's cornered again like now, he'll try to kill us again.

519
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,010
That's nonsense.

520
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,910
Who would dare kill you?

521
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,280
Do you think I'll just watch?

522
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,390
Or do you not trust me enough?

523
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,110
TikiTaka was merged with Save.

524
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,160
In the end...

525
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,160
you'll also side with Matthew, Chan Seong.

526
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,860
I'm so afraid of...

527
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,780
that the people I cherish will be getting hurt again.

528
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,800
If you cherish them, I'll cherish them as well now.

529
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,020
I admit I was harsh to you and your mother.

530
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,600
However, my feelings for you are sincere.

531
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,000
If you want me to,

532
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,680
I'll stop getting involved in the fight between Shim Joon Seok and Min Do Hyeok.

533
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Promise me.

534
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,870
That you'll protect Hannah and me until the end.

535
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,770
I promise.

536
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,590
No one can lay a finger on you.

537
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,700
Only I can love you and

538
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,590
only I can harass you.

539
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,720
I'll show you that I'm way stronger than Matthew.

540
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,350
Thank you.

541
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,820
I trust you'll defeat Matthew.

542
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,380
 Your enemy has to be Shim Joon Seok now, not Min Do Hyeok. 

543
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,470
Ho Rang.

544
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,680
Why did you come here? Did you come to kill me?

545
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,500
No.

546
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,270
I came to give you a chance.

547
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,950
Show me you're different from K.

548
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,150
Your testimony is all we need.

549
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,500
Testify that Matthew attempted to kill Go Myeong Ji.

550
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,410
Then, I won't give you a hard time anymore.

551
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,250
Ho Rang, evil is mundane.

552
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,650
Quit the pathetic lecturing!

553
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,660
I don't want you getting punished for something you didn't even do!

554
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,750
It's not too late

555
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,180
to testify who really attacked Go Myeong Ji.

556
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,750
I'll also help you, then.

557
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,950
Chairman Matthew will find me and kill me, no matter where I hide.

558
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,850
We can strike him first before that.

559
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,350
No. You have no idea, Hyungnim.

560
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:58,650
Just how strong Matthew's power is and how widespread it is!

561
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,390
As long as they exist, I'm bound to die.

562
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,560
There's more than one chain of evil.

563
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,250
So, if you want to live, don't oppose Matthew.

564
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,850
This is my last piece of advice.

565
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,810
Ho Rang.

566
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,550
I got the money for Mom's surgery. Don't worry.

567
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,550
I can also send you your tuition and living expenses this week.

568
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,120
I'll take care of it all.

569
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,320
Who are you?

570
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,970
- I'm going to yell. 
 - Go ahead.

571
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,550
Who would come, then? Will Matthew come?

572
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,750
Do you think Matthew can help you?

573
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,890
I know you obey Matthew because of the money for your mom's surgery.

574
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,910
But you're wrong.

575
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,750
As much as you cherish your mom, Go Myeong Ji is also someone's mom and wife.

576
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,980
Is this all you can do when you wish for your mom to live?

577
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,750
What am I supposed to do, then?

578
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,050
I don't have the money even if I were to die!

579
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,080
What would your mom say if she found out?

580
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,930
If she's cured with that evil bastard's money, will she be thankful?

581
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,960
What about your younger siblings?

582
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,350
Would they be happy to study and live a good life with a murderer's money?

583
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,480
I hope you're not a total lost case.

584
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,130
 Baek Ik Ho refused to testify. 

585
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,000
 The housekeeper agreed to testify. 

586
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,920
 Aunt is protecting her right now. 

587
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,740
 Even now, I'm sure K is taking advantage of 

588
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,450
 someone's weakness to survive. 

589
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,360
 We must find out how far his web of evil has reached. 

590
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,950
The recent verification won't be a big problem, Prime Minister.

591
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,550
You know how competent I am.

592
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,980
So what is it you want?

593
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,150
Please make the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport

594
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,370
promote Gagok District a national project

595
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,680
and have the government guarantee my identity.

596
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,010
I can ask this of the president directly,

597
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,230
but I'm telling you first for formality, Prime Minister.

598
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,400
Must you take it this far?

599
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Yes. I must go this far.

600
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,220
Because I'm about to die right now.

601
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,050
The higher-ups knew I was Shim Joon Seok, not Lee Hwi So.

602
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,150
But they still asked me for

603
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,250
their opposing candidates' weaknesses during every election.

604
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,570
I'm giving you a chance to repay the one who contributed to establishing the current regime.

605
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,380
Watch what you say.

606
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,730
Who do you think you are to blackmail me?

607
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,650
I'm saying we're accomplices.

608
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:16,550
Without my help, you or the president wouldn't be sitting here right now.

609
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,650
I doubt you wish to sit behind bars with me,

610
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,230
wearing the same uniform in the future. Right?

611
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,050
Promote Gagok District as a national project?

612
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,500
The regime shouldn't interfere with the city's affairs.

613
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,720
This is an abuse of power.

614
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,350
This is a direct order from the prime minister.

615
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,020
If you don't accept it,

616
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,230
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport will make you.

617
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,850
You must restate you'll make Gagok District into a high-tech city as planned.

618
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:57,240
Could it be you're also on Matthew's side, Secretary?

619
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,250
Please follow your orders, Mayor.

620
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm telling you this to save your life.

621
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,020
Did you do it on purpose?

622
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,730
You told me incorrect information.

623
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,180
What are you saying?

624
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,860
I'm the one who squeezed his brain to resolve the problem.

625
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,250
I guess Luca suddenly became a fucking idiot.

626
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,550
Luca would never do that.

627
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,270
There has never been a single error!

628
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,950
If Min Do Hyeok hacked it, there must've been a warning message.

629
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,550
There wasn't anything like a warning message.

630
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,980
I only told you what Luca told me.

631
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,240
If you're innocent, show me the proof.

632
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,300
Share all information about Save with TikiTaka from now on.

633
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,050
I'll believe your words, then.

634
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,770
Why should I do that?

635
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,790
I refuse. I don't care if you believe me or not.

636
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,000
We had the merger!

637
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,320
Before Min Do Hyeok interferes with his security app,

638
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,950
we've got to take over everything we can!

639
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:03,250
Until the hacking network installed at Gagok District becomes perfect,

640
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,120
we must help each other!

641
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,870
Hacking network?

642
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,750
 Help each other when we can't even trust each other? 

643
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,450
Did you forget?

644
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,660
I've got the prime minister behind me.

645
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,440
I even have the prime minister's weakness.

646
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,980
That's how I can take Gagok District.

647
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,410
I'll show you.

648
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,620
Gagok District absolutely won't fail this time.

649
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,700
Matthew installed a hacking network in the Gagok District.

650
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,300
I think the prime minister is behind him.

651
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,990
As expected, there was someone behind him.

652
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,450
Thank you. I'll talk to you again.

653
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,290
Do Hyeok,

654
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,740
we've got the evidence.

655
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,370
It's under the Gagok District.

656
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,850
K installed a hacking network there.

657
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,360
Hyung, are you sure?

658
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,770
I'm sure.

659
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,860
You contact Yang Jin Mo just in case.

660
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,920
I'll go to Gagok District right now.

661
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,330
We have to secure the evidence quickly.

662
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,290
I got it, Hyung.

663
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,850
   

664
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,280
You can't talk to Min Do Hyeok.

665
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,210
Chairman Matthew will be here soon.

666
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,530
Be on standby until then.

667
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,870
This isn't who you are.

668
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,250
How can you do this when you get paid by the government?

669
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,650
You're working for a bastard like him just for money?

670
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,550
If it was just for money, I would've quit this shitty job a long time ago!

671
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,600
He's threatening to harm my family.

672
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,460
So, how can I endure it?

673
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,370
I bought snacks for the kids.

674
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,500
Kids!

675
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
There.

676
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,390
Ta-da.

677
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,390
Kids, Ahjumma is very tired today.

678
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,400
So could we eat takeout food just for today?

679
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,850
Of course we can!

680
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,750
We've been eating jangjorim for days now,

681
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,990
so I was about to die.

682
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,160
What's on the menu?

683
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,180
Gosh, you piggy!

684
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,860
Ahjumma will be upset if she hears this.

685
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,270
That's why I bought us your favorites,

686
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,590
pizza, chicken, and hamburger you love, Phillip.

687
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,850
 You're the best! 

688
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,090
You're really the best!

689
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,450
I love it!

690
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,560
All right. Let's dig in.

691
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,790
Hey, Detective Oh, what's the occasion?

692
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,080
This is bad. I think the bodyguards have been bought out by Chairman Matthew.

693
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,750
The kids are in danger. You must get out of that house right now.

694
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,150
Nothing seemed to be off even until just now.

695
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,150
What should we do?

696
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,770
Escape with the kids right away.

697
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,810
I'll send you the address, so you can go there.

698
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,860
 You must leave through the backdoor so the bodyguards don't find out. Okay? 

699
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,620
I got it. I'll get moving right away.

700
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,520
Hurry up and pack the kids' clothes.

701
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,170
Kids, shall we go somewhere else for a moment?

702
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,580
Let's go now.

703
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,850
Yes. It's okay.

704
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,050
Let's go, let's go.

705
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,490
Is your family doing all right?

706
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,200
Your wife is still sleeping?

707
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,960
I'll make this clear. My stance on Gagok District won't change.

708
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,280
Whether the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport or the president orders me,

709
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,850
I'll fight to the end. So get lost.

710
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,890
Aren't you too serious about playing the mayor?

711
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,630
Think about your family.

712
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,300
What did the kids do wrong?

713
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,430
They have to run away here and there.

714
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,050
What?

715
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,540
Hey, Detective Oh, let me talk to the kids.

716
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,230
Yes.

717
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,220
D-Dad!

718
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,670
- Yang Jin Mo. 
 - Ahjussi!

719
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,260
 - Ahjussi!  
 - Erica!

720
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,050
 We're all together. 

721
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,530
- Yang Jin Mo- Y-Yang Jin Mo! 
 - D-Dad!

722
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,840
- Dad! 
 - Ahjussi!

723
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,140
Dad.

724
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,770
Hey, Detective Oh.

725
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,130
Please let the kids go.

726
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,370
Two of us are enough as hostages.

727
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,030
How can you deceive me?

728
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,480
You were born to be a policeman.

729
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,000
How can you betray me?

730
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,440
I couldn't help it, either!

731
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,210
To protect my family!

732
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,460
This fucking bastard!

733
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,020
If anything happens to my kids,

734
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,360
I'll chew you up for sure.

735
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,680
Worry about saving your life.

736
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,570
Oh, don't resent your secretary too much.

737
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,100
Who wouldn't be afraid of his weakness?

738
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,390
All right, Mr. Mayor.

739
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,250
You should listen to me now. Right?

740
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,160
Bring Gagok District back to me.

741
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,670
There's no other compromise.

742
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,260
There's no time for this. I said the kids are in danger.

743
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,510
Hurry up and decide.

744
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,000
 The customer is not... 

745
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:18,120
Do Hyeok, Cha Joo Ran and Nam Cheol Woo disappeared with the kids!

746
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,030
- When? 
 - I don't know.

747
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,850
It was too quiet, so the bodyguards went inside and

748
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,840
they had disappeared without a trace.

749
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,220
What is all this!

750
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,130
Could it be the two of them betrayed us?

751
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,890
No, definitely not. I'm sure something happened to them.

752
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,600
 CEO! 

753
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,360
CEO, there is a rumor Seoul city is

754
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,180
going let TikiTaka take the right to develop Gagok District!

755
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,930
They announced they'll hold an urgent

756
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,330
press conference soon.

757
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,310
A press conference out of nowhere?

758
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,380
The housekeeper is with me, too.

759
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,510
Did you hear anything from Yang Jin Mo?

760
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,190
No, he's been unreachable for a while now.

761
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,960
It's K's doing.

762
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,990
K must've kidnapped the kids to blackmail Yang Jin Mo.

763
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,490
Fine.

764
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,320
I'll do as you say.

765
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,040
Instead, I must see the kids' faces and check if they're fine.

766
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,620
I don't trust you.

767
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,500
I won't agree to the press conference unless I see them with my own eyes.

768
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,670
That's not a big deal.

769
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,830
Let him have a video call.

770
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,680
 Kids, you're okay. Right? 

771
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,400
 Wait just a moment. Dad will... 

772
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,460
 Dad will come get you soon. 

773
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,660
Dad, you should be careful, too.

774
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,210
 We're here together, but you're alone. 

775
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:57,780
 I'm not scared at all because I'm with Ahjussi and Ahjumma. 

776
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,600
 You know how brave I am. Right? 

777
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,650
Ahjussi, you have to stay safe, too.

778
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,970
We can meet soon. Right?

779
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,710
Of course, we'll meet.

780
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:12,220
Don't worry. We'll meet soon.

781
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,950
14 Yangju Bridge, Cheoltap Factory.

782
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,630
Hang up now!

783
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,380
 This is the kids' location. 14 Yangju Bridge, Cheoltap Factory. 

784
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,160
 Hurry. 

785
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,900
I found them.

786
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,690
Aunt, I'm going to take off now.

787
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,100
I'll call Ki Tak, so please take care of Gagok District in his place.

788
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,940
I got it. Leave it to me.

789
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,220
Don't you get injured!

790
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,100
Gosh, I'm pretty sure it's around this area.

791
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,030
This is nuts.

792
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,250
Doodeoji.
  (Mole in Korean.) 

793
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,090
O-Oh, Hyungnim!

794
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,020
Long time no see.

795
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,000
What brings you here?

796
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,320
Do you still rob graves these days?

797
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,120
Let me ask you for a favor.

798
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,330
I need you to do some digging.

799
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,300
You have to find a communications network.

800
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,180
They're probably connected as one.

801
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,530
- If you find it, you get one billion won. 
 - O-One billion won?

802
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,790
Just leave it to me.

803
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,500
Where are you, my billion won?

804
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:58,320
 Min Do Hyeok, please rescue the kids. 

805
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,210
 Please. 

806
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:04,340
The press conference will begin in 30 minutes.

807
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,440
They're preparing without a problem.

808
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,260
Great going.

809
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,940
Shall we get to the conference room now?

810
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:19,060
   

811
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,050
Yes, Prime Minister.

812
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,160
Chairman Matthew,

813
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,750
is it true you installed a hacking network in Gagok District?

814
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,720
What do you mean by that?

815
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,990
 Don't even try to lie! 

816
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:36,450
 I've got the picture evidence in front of me! 

817
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,710
 This was the reason you were dying to get Gagok District? 

818
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,760
Give up on Gagok District now.

819
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,860
The press conference will be canceled, too.

820
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm going to stop it.

821
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,810
Prime Minister. Hello? Prime Minister!

822
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,000
Why? I guess it didn't go as you wanted, huh?

823
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,890
You bastards.

824
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,040
What did you have Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak do?

825
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,930
Fine, you sons of bitches.

826
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,350
Let's see the end today.

827
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,440
Thank you, Prime Minister.

828
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,450
Your work is very thorough.

829
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,760
Cutting ties with Matthew

830
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,010
as soon as possible is how you can protect the regime.

831
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,060
What are you doing? Stop them!

832
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,090
You!

833
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,490
Huh? N-No!

834
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,210
Hey, Oh Sang Sik. You...

835
00:55:53,614 --> 00:55:55,614
Did you hear about it?

836
00:55:56,464 --> 00:55:58,654
The Gagok District announcement was suddenly canceled.

837
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,924
What happened?

838
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,884
Mo Ne, calm down and hear me out.

839
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:05,844
I found out about this just now, too.

840
00:56:05,844 --> 00:56:08,284
Matthew kidnapped Hannah.

841
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:11,794
What did you say?

842
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:15,484
Where's Hannah right now?

843
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:17,104
I don't know that much yet.

844
00:56:17,104 --> 00:56:18,864
However, I can find her in no time.

845
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:22,294
I'm using all the methods I can use.

846
00:56:30,284 --> 00:56:33,174
Shim Joon Seok, that fucking lunatic!

847
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:35,104
I'm going to kill that bastard.

848
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:37,504
Calm down, Mo Ne!

849
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:42,724
I'm sorry. I should've paid more attention.

850
00:56:43,414 --> 00:56:46,204
Shim Joon Seok is my enemy from now on.

851
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:51,384
I'll trample on the bastard who messed with my family.

852
00:57:06,974 --> 00:57:08,664
What happened here?

853
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:11,204
I'm sorry, Chairman. I lost them.

854
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:13,614
Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak somehow found out and came here.

855
00:57:13,614 --> 00:57:16,714
What fucking moron! How can you lose them?

856
00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:20,114
What about the location tracker? Did you put it on the kids?

857
00:57:20,114 --> 00:57:22,174
Yes, I snuck it in without them knowing.

858
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:23,914
I'll go after them right now, Chairman!

859
00:57:23,914 --> 00:57:26,784
Forget it. I'll take over now. You stay out.

860
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:28,454
Chairman!

861
00:57:43,304 --> 00:57:46,024
Do Hyeok. Nam Cheol Woo.

862
00:57:49,954 --> 00:57:52,364
 It's me. K's going after your car. 

863
00:57:52,364 --> 00:57:54,764
And I'm going after him.

864
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:00,104
Oh, I see him.

865
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:02,574
Yang Jin Mo, are you okay?

866
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,574
L-Let me talk to him, too.

867
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:07,104
I want to talk to Dad.

868
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:09,714
I want to hear Dad's voice, too.

869
00:58:09,714 --> 00:58:12,554
Yang Jin Mo, wait. The kids want to talk to you.

870
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,004
- Here. 
 - A-Ahjussi.

871
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:19,104
Kids, are you all okay?

872
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:21,254
Ahjussi.

873
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:22,364
- Dad. Dad! 
 - Dad!

874
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:23,814
- Y-Yang Jin Mo. 
 - Ahjussi!

875
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:26,564
- Yang Jin Mo! 
 - Ahjussi!

876
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:29,884
Hello? Hello!

877
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:38,814
It's okay. H-He'll be okay.

878
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:42,234
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

879
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:49,474
Min Do Hyeok, I'll fucking kill you.

880
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:53,374
Why do I have such a bad feeling about this?

881
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:56,714
He's way too close to us.

882
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:03,634
Yang Jin Mo, that son of a bitch.

883
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,814
- Do Hyeok! 
 - Hyung, take off right away.

884
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,694
Do Hyeok!

885
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,354
Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo!

886
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:51,974
Yang Jin Mo.

887
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:54,694
H-Hey, you're fine. Okay?

888
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,154
You're okay, and I called the ambulance.

889
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:01,634
I called the ambulance, so l-let's hang in there for a minute. Okay?

890
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:05,804
I'm glad I saved you and the kids.

891
01:01:05,804 --> 01:01:09,204
I almost lost my chance to even go to hell.

892
01:01:16,474 --> 01:01:19,544
Why am I so foolish?

893
01:01:21,104 --> 01:01:23,614
I'm always late.

894
01:01:23,614 --> 01:01:27,534
Paeng Hee, Myeong Ji,

895
01:01:27,534 --> 01:01:30,134
and the kids, too.

896
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:36,694
I should've opened up to them a bit sooner.

897
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,534
Yang Jin Mo.

898
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:41,504
It's still not too late.

899
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:45,664
I was just an orphan.

900
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:49,084
But I have a family I want to protect.

901
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:56,434
And I got a precious comrade by my side.

902
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:00,424
I finally succeeded right before death.

903
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:04,454
Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo!

904
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:08,154
Hyung, stay with me. Jin Mo!

905
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:10,154
Do Hyeok.

906
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:13,734
I'm sorry.

907
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,244
What I did to your family...

908
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:21,524
I didn't know what it meant to...

909
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:25,334
take away someone's family

910
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:27,734
back then.

911
01:02:27,734 --> 01:02:30,334
 Shall I leave Min Do Hyeok's house alone? 

912
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:33,144
 Take care of both houses. 

913
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:43,064
Don't ever forgive me.

914
01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:44,914
Live.

915
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:47,434
Live, Yang Jin Mo.

916
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:50,934
S-Survive this and...

917
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,704
get your punishment alive.

918
01:02:57,344 --> 01:03:00,304
Step over me and move on now.

919
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:03,074
Just think about yourself only.

920
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:05,554
Also...

921
01:03:05,554 --> 01:03:08,084
I want to...

922
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,754
give my heart to Myeong Ji.

923
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:14,534
Please help me out.

924
01:03:15,684 --> 01:03:18,394
So I won't be late this time.

925
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,834
Do me a favor, Do Hyeok.

926
01:03:23,204 --> 01:03:26,344
Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo!

927
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,214
Yang Jin Mo!

928
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:31,654
Please insert blood cardioplegia.

929
01:04:31,654 --> 01:04:34,354
   

930
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:40,934
I'm removing the heart now.

931
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,784
   

932
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:57,134
Myeong Ji.

933
01:05:59,834 --> 01:06:02,584
Can you tell who I am?

934
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:11,414
Do you remember?

935
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:15,684
Myeong Ji, your heart was severely injured

936
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:19,534
because Matthew shot you with a gun.

937
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:21,834
I remember it.

938
01:06:26,424 --> 01:06:28,764
What about the kids?

939
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:32,034
What about him?

940
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:41,334
Yang Jin Mo is...

941
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:45,074
together with you.

942
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:52,234
Together with me?

943
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:08,944
 Thank you 

944
01:07:08,944 --> 01:07:12,204
 for letting me live as a dad in this life. 

945
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:14,524
 - Dad!  
  - Dad! 

946
01:07:14,524 --> 01:07:16,604
 Hey. 

947
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:17,774
 Goodness gracious. 

948
01:07:17,774 --> 01:07:20,634
 Good night! 

949
01:07:20,634 --> 01:07:24,034
 Yes. Have a good night. 

950
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:27,534
 Kids, let's go to sleep. I'll read you a bedtime story. 

951
01:07:27,534 --> 01:07:30,244
 Huh? If you don't come right now, 

952
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:33,834
 Mom will tell you scary stories tonight! 

953
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:37,574
 I'm coming for Erica and Phillip! 

954
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:44,634
 I was truly happy because my wife was Go Myeong Ji. 

955
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:50,134
 Dad, have a good night! 

956
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,354
 Dad! 

957
01:07:52,354 --> 01:07:54,764
 Let's go to bed now. 

958
01:08:24,994 --> 01:08:27,674
 We'll take the picture in a minute. 

959
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:39,734
 Huh? Mom's face got red. 

960
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:57,744
   

961
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:03,484
   

962
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:10,564


963
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:18,034
 I love you, my dear family. 

964
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:31,944
♫  Like shadows in the dark  ♫

965
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:39,124
♫  Stolen nights that hid the truth  ♫

966
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:43,234
   

967
01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:46,234
 Yang Jin Mo's cause of death will be fabricated. 

968
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:49,334
 Save will have to manipulate the public opinion for me. 

969
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:51,634
 I already decided on the culprit. Min Do Hyeok. 

970
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,534
 I'll help K have his dream come true. 

971
01:09:53,534 --> 01:09:56,494
 Are you crazy? Are you saying you'd go to jail or something? 

972
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:58,234
 Welcome to the Trillion Family. 

973
01:09:58,234 --> 01:10:00,634
 Because we're bound by money, which is thicker than blood. 

974
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:02,944
 This makes the job become way too easy. 

975
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:05,134
 If you're angry and frustrated, survive. 

976
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,734
 Surviving is winning. 

977
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,934
 We'll now begin turning Min Do Hyeok into a murderer. 

978
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:10,034
 Don't do anything. 

979
01:10:10,034 --> 01:10:12,934
 The moment Hwang Chan Seong doubts you, everyone will be in danger. 

980
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:17,034
 Mo Ne, you know I love you a lot. Right? 

981
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:20,164
♫  The day I'll be sending you off  ♫
