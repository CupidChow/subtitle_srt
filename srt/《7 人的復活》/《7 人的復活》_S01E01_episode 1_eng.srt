00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,290
♫  Happy birthday, Dear Da Mi  ♫

4
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,130
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

5
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,940
 Happy birthday, Da Mi. 

6
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,970
 Happy birthday, Da Mi. 

7
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,750
 Thank you for being born as my daughter. 

8
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,630
 When did our daughter grow up so much? 

9
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,430
 Thank you. 

10
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,870
 Mom and Dad. 

11
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,690
 Honey, did you hear that? Da Mi called me "Mom." 

12
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,800
 What do you mean? She called me "Dad." I heard her clearly. 

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,200
 No, I'm telling you, she said, "Mom." 

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,710
 Come here, my Da Mi. 

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,960
♫  I'd love it if I was on TV  ♫

16
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,900
♫  I'd really love it  ♫

17
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,960
 Da Mi, you're doing great! 

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,050
   

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,150
   

20
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,750
 What did Mom tell you? 

21
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,820
 Listen to what the teacher says. 

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,970
 Be nice to my friends. 

23
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,530
 Don't follow strangers. 

24
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,340
 Gosh, our Da Mi is so smart. 

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,380
 Honey, we have nothing to worry about. 

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,630
 - Da Mi, fighting! 
 - Fighting! 

27
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,180
 I'll be back! 

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,140
 Da Mi! 

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,010
 Da Mi... 

30
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,976
 Dad... 

31
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,376
 Please... Please spare her. 

32
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,000
 Da Mi... 

33
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,820
   

34
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,600
   

35
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,690
Do Hyeok...

36
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,530
Hyung...

37
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,150
You're really Ki Tak.

38
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,740
It wasn't a dream.

39
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,860
Thank you, Do Hyeok.

40
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,150
You did well.

41
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,190
You really hung in there.

42
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,210
Hyung...

43
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,290
Lee Hwi So was...

44
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,220
Lee Hwi So was...

45
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,100
 So, you are Min Do Hyeok. 

46
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,630
 Thank you so much for protecting Da Mi to the end. 

47
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,680
 And I have a major debt to repay your mother and younger brother. 

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,420
 We have to hurry! We have to escape this building quickly! 

49
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,360
 Kang Ki Tak, all the data about Luca is in this USB. 

50
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,470
 You have to get out of here quickly! 

51
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,410
 Those bastards will only be reassured Min Do Hyeok died after a corpse is found here. 

52
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,690
 Hurry. You have to leave! Hurry! 

53
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,280
How many months was I unconscious?

54
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,160
You almost died many times.

55
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,130
But you overcame and survived each time miraculously.

56
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,720
Hyung...

57
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,620
Madam Noh died.

58
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,590
I know.

59
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,120
I also looked for Hannah, but she disappeared without a trace.

60
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,260
   

61
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,000
What the heck is that?

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,060
How is that bastard Lee Hwi So?

63
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,680
The world was turned upside down.

64
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,320
K really became Lee Hwi So with Geum Ra Hee's support.

65
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,430
    
 The entire country is crazy for the hero, Matthew Lee, at the moment.

66
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,400
   

67
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,590
   

68
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,780
K stole Lee Hwi So's findings regarding the secret chat.

69
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,600
Including the tattoo on his chest, his fingerprints, dental history, and iris recognition,

70
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,020
he even manipulated the police's database

71
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,650
and perfectly proved that he was Lee Hwi So.

72
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,380
   

73
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,390
   

74
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,490
He made the entire nation believe he was Lee Hwi So with a tearful performance and...

75
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,820
he eventually stole Chairman's Bang's money as well.

76
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,570
Who is Min Do Hyeok?

77
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,560
 Who is he? Who is he? 

78
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,580
    
 You became a wanted criminal as Shim Joon Seok.

79
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,900
The entire country is attacking Seongchan Group right now.

80
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,260
The entire nation fell for such a fake show?

81
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,870
That's Luca's power.

82
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,850
The Luca Lee Hwi So created.

83
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,830
Luca?

84
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,310
This is what Lee Hwi So left for you.

85
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,700
He said it contains all the information regarding Luca.

86
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,070
Unfortunately, I couldn't open it yet because I don't know the password.

87
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,120
We need to crack it.

88
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,550
One way or the other.

89
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,700
You're a wanted criminal right now.

90
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,240
You can't meet anyone, nor should you move about carelessly.

91
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,510
We desperately need help from this person.

92
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,160
We're on the way to meet her right now.

93
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,010
You're here?

94
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,450
You look quite similar to this man.

95
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,390
He was so tacky and liked soju.

96
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,420
When he was a conglomerate.

97
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,840
He was once famous for being a math and physics genius; a rare find in the business world.

98
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,370
But so what?

99
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,160
He was killed by the hands of a monster he raised.

100
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,800
I wasn't that close to your father.

101
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,030
We were just real-life siblings.

102
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,170
However, I had the best time in the world with your mother.

103
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,580
The adult I respect the most, you could say.

104
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,630
That's why I'm helping you.

105
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,730
So you can comfort your mom's spirit.

106
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm sorry but I don't have the resources to care for Seongchan right now.

107
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,190
That's better for me.

108
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,240
I can just take over Seongchan in its entirety.

109
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,580
But you'll have no choice but to cooperate.

110
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,940
What do you mean by that?

111
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,410
Because I saved your life.

112
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,420
Not anyone can get a wanted criminal treated safely at a hospital.

113
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,210
So, whether you want to or not, including Seongchan and

114
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,380
your parents who gave birth to you in your list of future avenging.

115
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,800
This is an order, not a negotiation.

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,170
TikiTaka continues to buy out Seongchan Group's subsidiaries.

117
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,830
I'm sure their capital is Chairman Bang's money.

118
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,800
Do Hyeok, it's your turn to act now.

119
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,560
Here. Take this.

120
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
It's the proceeds from selling off the company.

121
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,210
Of course, it doesn't mean I acknowledge you as my nephew.

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm investing everything I own, trusting the anger within your heart.

123
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,050
You need capital to do whatever it is you want to do, including revenge.

124
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,290
I won't accept it.

125
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,710
You won't? Why?

126
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,430
You can manage the company's capital on your own.

127
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,420
However, right now, K, who killed my mom and younger brother,

128
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,830
the six people who betrayed me,

129
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,780
and TikiTaka, which was established with stolen assets from Chairman Bang and Lee Hwi So,

130
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,340
I only want to focus on bringing them down.

131
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,990
I'll proudly get Seongchan Group back after all that.

132
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,720
I'll get the payment then.

133
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,910
The payment for my biological parents' lives.

134
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,500
Do you want me to get you a new identity, then?

135
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,840
You can't just go sneaking about everywhere.

136
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,970
No.

137
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm going to go back with my name, Min Do Hyeok.

138
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,630
Also, you can hand over all the other subsidiaries,

139
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,030
but make sure to keep S-Talk by any means.

140
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,290
It's the heart of Seongchan Group.

141
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,390
We can use it to shake up K at the right time.

142
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,340
 Achieving legendary company establishment from being an innocent death row convict. 

143
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,370
 The interest in TikiTaka's Chairman Lee Hwi So is explosive. 

144
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,910
 He recently acquired major subsidiaries of Seongchan Group, such as construction, trading, and hotels. 

145
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,000
 Please give a word to our viewers first. 

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,070
 My daughter, Da Mi, was a victim of deepfake technology. 

147
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,640
 Korea's broadcasting system is currently hanging by a thread. 

148
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,780
 The press are reporting fake news without any verification 

149
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,370
 and the masses are only reacting to stimulation. 

150
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,580
To celebrate becoming Lee Hwi So perfectly,

151
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,320
I'll give each of you a reward of five billion won.

152
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,100
I laundered your history spotlessly clean as well.

153
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,940
Five billion— Is this a dream?

154
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,010
Whoa.

155
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,380
You two are exempt.

156
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,330
Where will you run off to again with this money?

157
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,130
N-No—

158
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,740
You can't trust people who betrayed you once.

159
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,480
N-No, we'll never do that again.

160
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,370
We swear. Our lives are yours from now on, Chairman.

161
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,540
That should be enough. They're really scared.

162
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,530
Thank you!

163
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,060
Thank you so much!

164
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,400
Why aren't you two saying anything?

165
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,340
Do I have to be moved as well?

166
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,990
Five billion won is what I make by shooting a few commercials.

167
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,720
Don't be so arrogant.

168
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,540
If it wasn't for Chairman Matthew, your acting career would've long been over.

169
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,750
You said great wealth and fame would be a bonus.

170
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,860
But our dreams...

171
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,200
really came true, huh?

172
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,300
Thank you.

173
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,800
 I can't show hostility right now. 

174
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,760
 I must act like I'm on that f***er's side until I find Hannah, even if it makes me want to puke. 

175
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,650
There's more fortune to come.

176
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,870
Yang Jin Mo, prepare to become the deputy mayor of Seoul.

177
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,910
With a clean-cut face like yours, you'll also work well in the political arena.

178
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,710
The Deputy Mayor?

179
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,720
Go Myeong Ji will be Yang Jin Mo's partner.

180
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,610
Do your best to support the Deputy Mayor from now on.

181
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,300
S-Support him?

182
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
It means you two will be married.

183
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,700
Of course, you have to live together as well.

184
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,900
This is CEO Geum's idea.

185
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,180
A married couple? That's too—

186
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,280
To repeat myself, you can't refuse any of my orders.

187
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,390
When I summon you, come within 30 minutes by any means, whether it's day or night.

188
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,510
Don't question or bark. You understand?

189
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,800
Why are you making me wait for an answer?

190
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
 - Yes!  
 - Yes.

191
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,510
Create the image of a perfect family.

192
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,280
Don't let anyone find out your marriage is fake.

193
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,880
If you get found out, you'll be punished right away.

194
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Paeng Hee, I'm getting married.

195
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,360
Funny, isn't it?

196
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,300
 Jin Mo... 

197
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,510
 Please take care of... 

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,340
 our Hannah. 

199
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,800
 You are a good person. 

200
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,800
 I know it. 

201
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,410
I'm not a good person.

202
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,200
I still haven't...

203
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,900
granted your request.

204
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,530
I can't find Hannah.

205
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,400
No matter where I look,

206
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,560
I don't see her.

207
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm sorry, Paeng Hee.

208
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sorry, Paeng Hee.

210
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,660
Hello? I picked up before it even rang twice—

211
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,420
What the hell? Who the hell spam calls at this hour?

212
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,000
How did you get my personal information?

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm a police. Answer me right now.

214
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,440
Hey, tell me where you're from!

215
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,980
Hello? H-Hello— Hello!

216
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,530
You've got an illness. Okay?

217
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,240
It's telephobia.

218
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,430
Can't you just leave your phone off at this hour?

219
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,760
How can I turn it off when I don't know when and how Matthew will summon me?

220
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,040
Gosh, the anxiety is seriously killing me.

221
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I mean...

222
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,150
you exchanged your freedom for money, so what can we do?

223
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,930
However, we're rich. So let's enjoy the moment.

224
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Everyone! It'll be on this rich unni today!

225
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,930
Order everything you want to eat!

226
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,550
Get all the drinks! Get all the food! Get everything!

227
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,130
Bring us more beef here, too!

228
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,110
I'm the landlord of this territory!

229
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,570
 Bravo! 

230
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,110
 We have enough money to idle away the rest of our lives. 

231
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,000
 But why do I feel so empty inside? 

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,900
 As if there's a big hole. Right? 

233
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,810
 We're K's slaves. Slaves with a lot of money. 

234
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,300
 What we need is freedom, you know. 

235
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
Tastes awful.

236
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,170
   

237
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,150
   

238
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,440
   
   

239
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,370
 Hey, Min Do Hyeok! 

240
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,500
 I won't regret it. 

241
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,300
I couldn't help it to survive.

242
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,910
There was no other way.

243
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,500
   

244
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,330
   

245
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,450
 Thank you. 

246
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,690
   

247
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,100
 Grandma! 

248
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,270
 Goodness! How did you carry this? 

249
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,800
Grandma, I'm stronger than you.

250
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,500
- Hannah? 
 - I eat more than you.

251
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,060
Make sure to call me when you need me. Okay?

252
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,700
Why is that girl with you?

253
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,370
What happened?

254
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,100
 I'm taking care of her briefly because she has nowhere to go. 

255
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you even know who that girl is?

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,670
 Why? 

257
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,520
 Is she your daughter or something? 

258
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,820
Don't even bring up nonsense.

259
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,850
Why would she be my child?

260
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,530
 She looks just like you when you were young, 

261
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,480
 and she'd turn off the TV crying when you come out. 

262
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,150
 She's my granddaughter. Right? 

263
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,120
Who are you calling your granddaughter?

264
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
She's got nothing to do with us.

265
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,010
 Acting like you don't know me is okay, but 

266
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,400
 I won't stand you denying your own child! 

267
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,390
 Heaven will punish you! 

268
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,270
You'll be in danger if you keep that girl with you.

269
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,380
Hurry up and send her to an orphanage.

270
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,300
Otherwise, we'll all die!

271
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,740
 We'll hide away real good until we die, so don't worry and go! 

272
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,150
 I won't call you even if I die, so go! 

273
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Can you keep your promise?

274
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Can you keep your word?

275
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,500
No matter what happens, you can't let other people see her.

276
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,560
You can't even speak our names.

277
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,880
Not my name, nor Hannah's name.

278
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,100
Can you do that?

279
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,230
 I'm able to live because of that child these days. 

280
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,630
 Just don't take her away from me. 

281
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,430
 Please. 

282
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,040
   

283
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,590
 Please select the amount you want to withdraw— 

284
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,630
   

285
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,070
 Thank you so much. 

286
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,180
   

287
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,330
   

288
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,980
 Mom! Mom, open the door! 

289
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,820
I brought the money! Open the door!

290
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
   

291
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,400
 Mom! I'm sorry. Open the door! 

292
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,410
Mom...

293
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm sorry.

294
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,200
   

295
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,910
Welcome!

296
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,250
I hope you like the hideout.

297
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:29,130
This is where Lee Hwi So's father used to run his electronics business.

298
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,590
It might look really shabby on the outside,

299
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,410
but I prepared the computer with the highest specs.

300
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,640
Oh, I also sold off all the subsidiaries that consistently returned losses to TikiTaka, as you said.

301
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,630
For triple the price, at that.

302
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,690
Great job.

303
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,960
Ta-da.

304
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,430
Will this really give us the password to the USB?

305
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,880
Lee Hwi So didn't tell us a password,

306
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,070
which means it's an obvious story anyone would know.

307
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,290
Lee Hwi So, Park Nan Young, and Bang Da Mi.

308
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,610
One, two, three, four, seven, seven, seven, seven.

309
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,670
You said you tried them all, but none worked.

310
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,850
We need to approach Luca quickly, too.

311
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,580
K is stealing countless personal and corporate information through the black hacker he hired.

312
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,390
- He's planning to acquire unmatched power through Luca. 
 - Luca.

313
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,630
Start the update.

314
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,170
I'm sure he's updating it continuously to prevent other people from approaching it.

315
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,270
I can't even fathom the limits of Luca's power.

316
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,970
Hyung, I think I'll have to log into Luca's system directly with this.

317
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,360
We just might be able to get a clue.

318
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,340
To break through the security, K's vacation home will be better than his home.

319
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,550
He doesn't seem to be going to the vacation home these days.

320
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,470
Let's get on the move tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m.

321
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,130
Okay.

322
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,260
All right. Open your eyes.

323
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,460
This will be our store starting today. How is it?

324
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,350
I love it!

325
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,460
It's really luxurious!

326
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,940
Mom, I really love it!

327
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,640
I will make a lot of money and raise you two to be the best.

328
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,750
So no one can look down on you.

329
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,100
You trust Mom, right?

330
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,150
- Yes. 
 - Yes!

331
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,450
Also, you two will soon get a dad.

332
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,000
A dad? Who?

333
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,390
Is it someone I know?

334
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,770
I hope he's handsome, if possible.

335
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,970
Just like me.

336
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,440
It's CEO Yang Jin Mo.

337
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,560
C-CEO Yang?

338
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,990
R-Really?

339
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,220
I love it!

340
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,890
He's the dad I've always dreamed of!

341
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,400
Mom, you're the best!

342
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,760
You're the best!

343
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,860
Mom, I love you!

344
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,310
I love you!

345
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,970
 As long as you two are happy, I'm happy, too. 

346
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,350
It's my first time wearing a wedding dress.

347
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,280
It feels awkward to wear it at this age.

348
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,550
Gosh, you're just as pretty as any!

349
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,210
Who'd ever say you're a mom with kids?

350
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,860
Also, you're not the only one wearing this for the first time.

351
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,270
The one over there didn't get to wear one, either.

352
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,990
It's not that I couldn't. I didn't.

353
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,990
Watch what you say so as not to create weird rumors.

354
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,420
She acts so haughty that it's making my eyes sore.

355
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,950
Oh, right! I heard that Mr. Nam is being reinstated in the Special Crimes Unit.

356
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,450
Oh, Matthew made it work somehow.

357
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,520
He told me to work at TikiTaka, too.

358
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,780
Oh, my. Congrats.

359
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,430
What's your position?

360
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,950
At least a vice president. Right?

361
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,290
Who knows? It's up to Matthew.

362
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,900
It's not like I can get what I want.

363
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,790
You're also shooting the wedding pictures as soon as he ordered you to get married.

364
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,860
I can't tell what Matthew's thinking.

365
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,180
The fake marriage makes sense for business purposes.

366
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,610
But how can he think of making a thug like him the deputy mayor of Seoul?

367
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,500
What do you mean?

368
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,170
What's wrong with Jin Mo?

369
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,270
You're already defending him?

370
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,120
You're only acting to be a married couple. It's not even real.

371
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,680
Anyhow, it looks bad to talk about people behind their backs.

372
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,310
Please refrain from calling my husband a thug and the like from now on.

373
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,560
Yes, I understand, Deputy Mayor of Seoul's wife.

374
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,240
 Mom! 

375
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,500
We're not late. Right?

376
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,510
You're so beautiful today!

377
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,690
You're so beautiful, just like a princess.

378
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,240
He's such a little cutie.

379
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,950
Hey, you're a giddy one, aren't you?

380
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,020
Are you good at studying?

381
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm a precious one, not a giddy one.

382
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,260
Also, please don't touch me without permission.

383
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,710
My cheeks are only for my mom to touch.

384
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,510
What a temper for a small one!

385
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,310
I'm everyone's drum to beat, seriously.

386
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,280
They sure make a childless woman feel so sad.

387
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,350
Ju Ran, calm down.

388
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,000
If you're sad, you can just make one for yourself.

389
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,110
How would I do that?

390
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,690
How can I explain it in words? Huh?

391
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,610
You're so silly.

392
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,550
Gosh, I'm so jealous of Go Myeong Ji.

393
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,260
Whether fake or not, she's got a husband and

394
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,940
she got a family she dreamed of.

395
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,750
You can't even buy that with money.

396
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,240
I wish I also had children like her.

397
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,430
All right, we'll start the photo shoot!

398
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,510
Gosh, you're so pretty.

399
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,070
You look great together!

400
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,790
Give me a big smile, please.

401
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,570
Look at your bride with loving eyes, please.

402
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,920
Smile wide.

403
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,700
Thank you!

404
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Thank you.

405
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,500
I'll go ahead since the photo shoot is over. Matthew wants to see me.

406
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,730
Let me introduce him to you. This is CEO Yang Jin Mo, whom I told you about, Mr. Mayor.

407
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,970
I'm pleased to meet you.

408
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,790
Nice to meet you.

409
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,360
I heard you used to run an entertainment business.

410
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,410
What kind of work do you wish to do as the deputy mayor?

411
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,280
I won't wish for anything.

412
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,040
I'll only follow your orders, no matter what, Mayor.

413
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,590
He produced many famous actors, so he'll be quite useful.

414
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,470
He's also interested in social minorities like you.

415
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,450
He'll be the best partner you can ask for.

416
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:48,160
I'll take your word since you're recommending him, Chairman Matthew.

417
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,000
If I don't trust a man who waited five years

418
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,990
to avenge his daughter and even succeeded in his business,

419
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,420
who else could I trust?

420
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,860
Come here! You can come this way!

421
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,370
I'm not sure if the food will be to your liking.

422
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,030
If there's something you want to eat, feel free to tell me.

423
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,980
My mom is really good at cooking.

424
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,720
Try this one.

425
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,060
It's braised short ribs, my mom's ambitious work.

426
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,650
The japchae, too.

427
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,200
She just made the shrimp pancake, too.

428
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,100
No, you should eat mine first.

429
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,440
Go ahead and eat, you guys.

430
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,450
Jin Mo.

431
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,010
I married you as Matthew ordered.

432
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,530
But we can never become a real family.

433
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,200
There's no need to continue the show at home, too.

434
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,600
You don't need to care about me, and I...

435
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,560
I have a request.

436
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,400
Don't be mean to the kids.

437
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,570
That's all I need.

438
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,740
You can use the closets here.

439
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,570
I'll use the living room. That's comfortable for me.

440
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,829
   

441
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:25,709
Oh, how was the talk with the mayor?

442
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,289
Well, so-so.

443
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,819
Getting the deputy mayor position won't be a problem.

444
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:33,049
But something's still bothering me.

445
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:36,829
Yang Jin Mo, that bastard. As they say, once a traitor, always a traitor.

446
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:39,949
He's bound to show his hidden claws one day.

447
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,199
What's to worry when you've got a monitor by his side?

448
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,739
Go Myeong Ji?

449
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,859
Go Myeong Ji is a woman who will do anything for her children.

450
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,999
You just need to use her feelings.

451
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:57,129
True. She's the complete opposite of Geum Ra Hee, who abandoned her daughter.

452
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,409
Isn't that why you need me?

453
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:18,289
Project "Making a Hero out of Lee Hwi So."

454
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,649
Do you want to hear me out?

455
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:27,629
   

456
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:33,799
My daughter, Da Mi, was a victim of Shim Joon Seok and fake news.

457
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,719
My daughter, who died because of fake news,

458
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,409
would root for me, her father.

459
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,869
Cry.

460
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:53,379
From now on, as Lee Hwi So, Da Mi's father,

461
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:59,549
I hereby declare a war on fake news.

462
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:11,719
Bravo!

463
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,679
It's perfect. I love it!

464
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,309
It's the best project!

465
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:21,409
I'm happy you're overjoyed.

466
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:23,479
I can do anything for your sake.

467
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,839
Your business trip to the States is tomorrow. Right? Are you ready to go?

468
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,249
I need to start now.

469
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:30,979
I'll take a look at all the global content producers while I'm there.

470
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:33,579
I'm looking to stay for about two weeks.

471
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:35,029
But it might take me longer.

472
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:37,999
Do as you see fit. Thank you so much for the presentation.

473
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:41,409
As a bonus, I'll give you 10 billion won.

474
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,449
Really?

475
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,579
Ten billion won, huh?

476
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:07,659
It's the best day of your life,

477
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,509
Geum Ra Hee.

478
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,829
 - Hurry up! 
 - Yes, sir! 

479
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,159
 - Hurry in! 
 - Yes, sir! 

480
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,319
   

481
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,939
   

482
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,229
 What's all this about? 

483
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:08,749
   

484
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,609
   

485
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:17,329
   

486
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,439
   

487
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,819
   

488
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:33,709
   

489
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,579
 Bang Da Mi. 

490
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:44,099
 You saw, right? Your adoptive father's the one who killed you. 

491
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,669
 What do you say? You want me to kill him? 

492
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,939
 No. 

493
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:57,989
 Don't do anything to my dad. 

494
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:00,869
 I can get rid of your birth mother, too. 

495
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,989
 I can kill Geum Ra Hee for you. 

496
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:07,079
 You can't. 

497
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,449
 Why are you pretending to be kind-hearted? 

498
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,629
 It's that woman's fault you ended up like this. 

499
00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:23,229
 She abandoned and used you for money. 

500
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:27,719
 The one who tried to kill you by framing you with a nasty crime is who your birth mother is. 

501
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,749
 All parents are hypocrites, with no exception. 

502
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,079
 My mom... 

503
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,319
 isn't a bad person. 

504
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:43,479
 H-Her life probably... 

505
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:46,439
 Her life probably was just too harsh on her. 

506
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:49,609
 Shut your mouth! That bitch deserves to die. 

507
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:52,359
 You also loathe Geum Ra Hee. Right? 

508
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,059
 Say you want me to kill that bitch first now! 

509
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:09,179
 This is your last chance. Say it. 

510
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:11,809
 Please don't do that. 

511
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,959
 I was still... 

512
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:22,579
 happy I could see my mom again. 

513
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,009
 I missed her. 

514
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,269
 I-Instead... 

515
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,909
 j-just take my life and... 

516
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:43,279
 s-spare my mom's life, please. 

517
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,249
 Just die, then. 

518
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:31,679
Why would you beg that bastard?

519
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,179
For what?

520
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,699
Why?

521
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,399
Why?

522
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:27,299
 Mommy. 

523
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:39,389
 You like this? 

524
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:44,669
 Huh? Oh, my. How lovely. 

525
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:46,569
 A kiss. 

526
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,259
♫  By the window of a small house in the forest  ♫

527
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:55,659
♫  A small child stood up  ♫

528
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:59,879
♫  A rabbit came running  ♫

529
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:03,549
♫  Knocked on the door and said  ♫

530
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:07,419
 "Please save me. Please save me. 

531
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,459
 If you don't save me..." 

532
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,589
 Mom? 

533
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,589
 Mom? 

534
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:22,399
 Mom, where are you? 

535
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:29,439
 M-Mom... 

536
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:32,909
 Why are you doing this to me? 

537
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,729
 Why? 

538
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,159
 I shouldn't have given birth to you. 

539
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,449
 It was you, right? 

540
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:53,139
 Mom, please save me! 

541
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:56,719
 Just this once, be my mom. 

542
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,869
 What the hell are you saying right now! 

543
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,569
 Even if it means killing her. 

544
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:05,399
 Don't do this... 

545
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:08,789
 I was still happy I could see my mom again. 

546
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,809
 I missed her. 

547
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:17,109
 I-Instead, j-just take my life and... 

548
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:22,479
 s-spare my mom's life, please. 

549
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:25,819
 Sure. 

550
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,499
 How could you do that? 

551
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:42,499
 To your own daughter, how... 

552
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:44,909
 You loved her so much. 

553
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,599
 How could you do that to her? 

554
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,629
 See? 

555
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:53,309
 Da Mi tried to protect you even as she died. 

556
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:56,629
 You abandoned her many times. 

557
00:44:56,629 --> 00:45:00,179
 Yet she died while protecting you because you're her mother. 

558
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:04,949
 Why on earth did you hate Da Mi so much? 

559
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,199
 Why? 

560
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,159
Because that child...

561
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:13,689
resembles that man way too much.

562
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:17,309
Trusting people and being nice to no end.

563
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:20,639
Not to mention, she liked fish just like him!

564
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,279
It drove me crazy whenever I saw Da Mi because she reminded me of him!

565
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:28,049
 That's your excuse? 

566
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:30,799
It doesn't matter, even if it's an excuse.

567
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,379
I...

568
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:37,689
I wanted to be successful so much.

569
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:40,859
I wanted to live the good life anyone would envy!

570
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,719
What should I have done?

571
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:48,149
I've never once received a mother's love in my life!

572
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:50,329
What was I supposed to do?

573
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,279
 Look at Park Nan Young and Noh Paeng Hee. 

574
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:55,669
 Look how they raised their children who were not even their own. 

575
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,169
 They were worlds apart from you. 

576
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:03,109
 Da Mi and Hannah have more than enough right to be loved. 

577
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,219
 And yet you let her die. 

578
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,799
 Geum Ra Hee, you're a murderer. 

579
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:10,039
 A murderer who killed her own daughter. 

580
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,849
 You have no right to blame K. 

581
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,769
 You're not even a human. You're a monster. 

582
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,029
 You're not even worth it. 

583
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,529
 Die! Die! Just die, Geum Ra Hee. 

584
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:18,869
 Die, Geum Ra Hee! 

585
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:21,109
 You're not even a human. You're a monster. You're a murderer. 

586
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,239
 Die, Geum Ra Hee. A murderer. 

587
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,969
What will you do now?

588
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,619
Will you live on as a beast?

589
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:48,339
Just like K?

590
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:53,739
Being less than human, obeying K's orders?

591
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,939
Fine.

592
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:08,619
I'll just die.

593
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:13,199
If it'll end only if I die,

594
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,559
I'll just die.

595
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,929
 S-Spare my mom's life, please. 

596
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:19,369
 Geum Ra Hee! 

597
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:32,849
Is everything over if you just die?

598
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:38,469
K is still alive and well, but you're going to run away like this?

599
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:41,109
Aren't you even sorry to Da Mi?

600
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:42,379
Park Nan Young.

601
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:45,579
We're Da Mi's mothers.

602
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:49,239
You and I alike.

603
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,809
For our poor Da Mi,

604
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:04,359
please take my place.

605
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,849
   

606
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,679
Go upstairs.

607
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:02,529
We're connected.

608
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:04,949
I'm sure there's a hint for the password.

609
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:08,859
Luca, show me information regarding Lee Hwi So.

610
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,019
   

611
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:13,619
   

612
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,809
   

613
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,729
Lee Da Mi.

614
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:21,869
The password is Lee Da Mi.

615
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:23,229
Lee Da Mi?

616
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,579
It's Lee Da Mi, not Bang Da Mi.

617
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:29,719
Because Da Mi was always Lee Da Mi to Lee Hwi So.

618
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,259
   

619
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,769
Got it. We're in. I see the codes.

620
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:40,639
   

621
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,529
 It's just as you said. 

622
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:47,129
 I'll kill K first and pay for my sins. 

623
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:52,229
 This is Da Mi's last moment. 

624
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:57,419
I can't believe he filmed this. What a trashy bastard.

625
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:06,839
 You two were alive. 

626
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:09,529
 Throw him back in. 

627
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:12,469
 I'll send you the money right away. 

628
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:19,629
 He'll probably float all the way to the ocean. 

629
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:37,169
 Did Kang Ki Tak survive? 

630
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:39,939
 I don't know. His wound was too deep. 

631
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:44,269
 Anyhow, I did first aid and got him to the destination. 

632
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,679
 Whether he'll live or die is his fate. Right? 

633
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,799
 Thanks for your work. 

634
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:52,709
 I'll send the money right away once you send me the picture. 

635
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:04,529
 This is my last gesture of kindness. 

636
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:17,129
Stand guard around here.

637
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:24,319
The alarm didn't even ring, so who are you saying broke in?

638
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,919
The security system was turned off.

639
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:28,619
 I also see suspicious footprints. 

640
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:33,049
 What kind of a rat dared to intrude on my territory? 

641
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:37,349
 I can't let him find them. 

642
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:39,629
 I need to make them escape. 

643
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:47,069
Let's get out of here.

644
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:50,449
Luca, delete access history.

645
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:03,969
- Get him! 
 - Stop right there!

646
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:27,429
Stop right there!

647
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:33,729
- Hurry up and find him! 
 - Yes!

648
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,809
 Find him! 

649
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:47,119
What are you all doing?

650
00:54:31,189 --> 00:54:34,659
He's around here. Find him!

651
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,959
Hyung, it has all the information about Luca.

652
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:14,699
We can get through Matthew's updates with this and check Luca in real-time.

653
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:19,029
Someone was at the vacation home earlier.

654
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:22,319
He broke the vase to let us know K was there.

655
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:28,729
Yes, I felt it, too.

656
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:36,829
Who could be the person who helped us?

657
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,929
Please help.

658
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:47,279
Please save me.

659
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:51,619
I'm dying here...

660
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:57,169
   

661
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:07,669
 If this is the heavens' punishment, 

662
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:10,039
 I'll accept it. 

663
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:14,019
 I'll even walk into the firepits of hell. 

664
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:17,859
 However, could you... 

665
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:24,229
   
 Could you delay it just a little bit? 

666
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:28,729
 Please give me the last chance to kill him. 

667
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:30,619
 Please. 

668
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:36,079
 So that I can be human for once... 

669
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,529
Am I alive?

670
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:06,629
I gave you first aid for now. But you almost died.

671
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:09,669
Thank you so much.

672
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:13,899
Thank you for giving me a chance.

673
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,329
You need to go to a big hospital and get surgery right away.

674
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:21,609
If you delay it longer, you'll need to amputate your leg.

675
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,419
I'll recommend a hospital where my colleague works.

676
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:29,229
No.

677
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:31,139
I can't go anywhere else.

678
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:33,619
No one must know. Please do it here.

679
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:36,469
This place isn't equipped for surgery, and there's no anesthesiologist.

680
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:39,129
I don't need anesthesia.

681
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:42,629
Just...

682
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:47,159
cut it off.

683
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:52,579
I'll accept it as punishment from the heavens.

684
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:58,329
I'm begging you.

685
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:00,729
Please help me out.

686
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:45,309
 Just this once, be my mom. Just this once! 

687
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:23,149
 I must walk like nothing happened, no matter what. 

688
01:00:23,149 --> 01:00:25,909
 I absolutely can't let K find out. 

689
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:05,359
 You don't even deserve to writhe in pain. 

690
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,979
 Walk on ahead, Geum Ra Hee. 

691
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:11,759
 Every step you take will be 

692
01:01:11,759 --> 01:01:14,219
 the punishment sentenced for you. 

693
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,959
Ahjumma!

694
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:21,999
Are you okay?

695
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:27,779
Do you need a hand?

696
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:36,789
It's my first time seeing a person after coming here.

697
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:40,259
I thought no one else lived around here.

698
01:01:40,259 --> 01:01:41,909
Right!

699
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:49,299
I roasted it myself. Do you want a sweet potato?

700
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:53,809
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Da Mi. 

701
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:57,229
 Mommy boiled a sweet potato for you. 

702
01:01:57,229 --> 01:01:59,729
 - Ta-da. What's this? 
 - Sweet potato. 

703
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:02,669
 Gosh, how lovely. 

704
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:04,939
 Say, ah. 

705
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:07,399
 Goodness, there you go. 

706
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:10,289
 Clap if it's delicious! 

707
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:12,429
 Give Mommy a kiss. 

708
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:26,189
It's a really delicious sweet potato. Take it with you.

709
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:29,139
Go!

710
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,059
   

711
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:45,969
Here are the books you asked me to get.

712
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,919
Thank you, Hyung.

713
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:54,149
Hyung, I confirmed there was a total of 11 updates.

714
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:57,189
Whoa, pretty good.

715
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:01,279
Do Hyeok,

716
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:03,659
the art gallery's not in a good condition, either.

717
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:06,139
Let's get on the move as soon as we can.

718
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,649
Why the heck can't I reach her?

719
01:03:16,649 --> 01:03:19,719
Did she go to a remote place in the U.S. or something?

720
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:29,389
I'm sure I saw this from somewhere.

721
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:39,599
   
 Come back right now, or I'll fly to the U.S. myself. 

722
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,809
 I warned you. 

723
01:04:01,819 --> 01:04:07,399
   

724
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:12,189
 If I didn't ignore Da Mi back then, 

725
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:14,949
 would Da Mi still be alive? 

726
01:04:15,629 --> 01:04:17,899
 Hey, you f***ing thief. 

727
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:24,089
 I guess God really exists. 

728
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:27,289
 I'm getting paid back exactly for the things I did. 

729
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:32,199
 I was cowardly and finally receiving my punishment now. 

730
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:37,299
 I miss Unni so much. 

731
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:41,189
 I can't take any more steps back. 

732
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:45,749
 No matter what scary things come my way, I want to... 

733
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:49,029
 live like a human being for once. 

734
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:52,029
 And I want to be forgiven. 

735
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:55,629
   
 By Da Mi. 

736
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:18,289
Why would you die?

737
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,939
The one who should die is alive and well.

738
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:23,409
Because there's no reason for me to live.

739
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:25,329
Forget revenge.

740
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:30,519
How can I stand that my movie is being used to promote K?

741
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,439
Listen to me carefully.

742
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,799
You need to keep filming movies. That's the best choice you can make right now.

743
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:41,699
How many more foolish things are you telling me to do?

744
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:44,469
I'm sure we can't bring down K at once.

745
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:47,689
We'll take our time and proceed in one step at a time.

746
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:52,789
So that, having become Lee Hwi So will give him hell,

747
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:55,699
you need to help me.

748
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:58,159
I need your power.

749
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,429
Did you want to see me?

750
01:06:14,169 --> 01:06:16,429
I came running as soon as you summoned me.

751
01:06:16,429 --> 01:06:19,209
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet. Right?

752
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:26,689
By the way, what mission do you have for me at this late hour?

753
01:06:26,689 --> 01:06:28,879
Is Geum Ra Hee still not back?

754
01:06:28,879 --> 01:06:31,649
More than two weeks have passed since her original schedule.

755
01:06:31,649 --> 01:06:33,949
 You called me over at midnight over this? 

756
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:35,739
 Even if you think of me as your dog... 

757
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:39,029
 Gosh, he's got a talent for making people's blood boil. 

758
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:42,019
Why aren't you answering me? Haven't you heard about Geum Ra Hee?

759
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:45,239
N-No, she came back today.

760
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:48,339
And she's meeting Joo Ran right now.

761
01:06:48,339 --> 01:06:51,569
Why didn't you report that to me right away?

762
01:06:56,659 --> 01:07:00,389
I guess staying in the U.S. wasn't that great, huh?

763
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:03,219
You're not looking too well.

764
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,469
It looks like you lost some weight, too.

765
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:08,419
Maybe because I'm sensitive to water?

766
01:07:19,379 --> 01:07:21,449
Why was your business trip so long?

767
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:23,569
I couldn't even reach you.

768
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,179
I'm sorry. There was a lot to learn.

769
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:32,829
I'm flying out again tomorrow. I want to tour Europe while I'm at it.

770
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:35,849
I'm thinking it'll take about a month.

771
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:37,909
It's okay. Right?

772
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:42,639
Oh, I just got a word from Director Michelle.

773
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:45,739
She said she'll resume filming soon.

774
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:51,079
Things are going smoothly now that CEO Geum is back.

775
01:07:56,279 --> 01:08:00,099
 It looks like he stepped on an animal trap since there was blood. 

776
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:02,829
His leg shouldn't be in a normal state.

777
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:07,969
Why don't you bring me some whiskey?

778
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,439
Could you bring it, please? I'm a little tired from the jet lag.

779
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:17,199
Oh, sure thing.

780
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,769
Should I bring you more coffee, too?

781
01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:21,679
Me, too.

782
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,499
She's treating me like I'm her maid.

783
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:32,919
Is she playing princess or something?

784
01:08:32,919 --> 01:08:34,729
Seriously.

785
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:38,119
She was always dying to serve Matthew.

786
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,889
But she's acting a little weird today.

787
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:43,999
The day before you went to the U.S. on your business trip,

788
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:48,179
were you at my vacation home, by chance?

789
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:51,629
Of course not.

790
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:55,679
We said bye over the phone because we were both busy.

791
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:06,199
I haven't seen those shoes before.

792
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,289
I got them in the States.

793
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:11,579
They're customized to my feet.

794
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:13,049
I see.

795
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:18,679
Can I see your feet for a second, then?

796
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:28,019
Y-You want to see my feet?

797
01:09:28,019 --> 01:09:29,639
Yes.

798
01:09:32,249 --> 01:09:34,979
 He couldn't have caught on. Right? 

799
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,979
 I must not stagger. 

800
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:56,499
 I must not shake, either. 

801
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:07,199
Go on, take a look.

802
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:18,069
What doubt are you trying to confirm?

803
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:29,129
 Please. 

804
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:31,119
 Please. 

805
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:41,129
Here's your whiskey—

806
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:42,799
What?

807
01:10:44,339 --> 01:10:46,149
It's fine.

808
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:39,109
   

809
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:40,229
   

810
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,449
   

811
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:13,279
   

812
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,369
♫  By the window of a small house in the forest  ♫

813
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:36,589
♫  A small child stood up  ♫

814
01:14:36,589 --> 01:14:40,749
♫  A rabbit came running  ♫

815
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:45,559
♫  Knocked on the door and said  ♫

816
01:14:45,559 --> 01:14:50,219
♫  Little rabbit, come inside  ♫

817
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,899
♫  And get some rest  ♫

818
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,409
Ahjumma!

819
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:33,899
Hyung! Ki Tak, come over here.

820
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:35,509
Why?

821
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:39,919
I did it.

822
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:42,989
This is Luca's core source code.

823
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:45,039
   
 Let me introduced Luca the AI. 

824
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,889
 The programmer, Lee Hwi So, will transfer admin rights to the manager, Matthew Lee. 

825
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:53,509
 Matthew Lee is the authorized owner of Luca. 

826
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:56,539
 If the owner doesn't log in for 72 hours, 

827
01:16:56,539 --> 01:17:00,819
 Luca will commence an attack on all networks in the country. 

828
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:04,629
That sly bastard. He prepared for emergency situations.

829
01:17:04,629 --> 01:17:10,929
He set it up so there would be colossal information chaos if he were in danger.

830
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:16,029
Luca became K's armor and shield.

831
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:20,029
Do Hyeok, is there any way to stop Luca from here?

832
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:21,639
That will be difficult.

833
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:24,879
I need to access Luca's main body directly.

834
01:17:27,029 --> 01:17:28,729
There must be a way.

835
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:32,829
We just need to take over both Luca and K.

836
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:38,129
Ahjumma!

837
01:17:50,049 --> 01:17:52,229
Ahjumma.

838
01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:03,529
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

839
01:18:03,529 --> 01:18:05,529
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

840
01:18:05,529 --> 01:18:09,029
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

841
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:11,889
Did you hear the news? I became the leader of the Children's Home.

842
01:18:11,889 --> 01:18:14,069
Yes, it's an app for locating missing children.

843
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,409
I think he'll make it into a policy project for Seoul.

844
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:19,809
He put Yang Jin Mo as the deputy mayor to prepare for this.

845
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:21,639
   

846
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,629
Interesting.

847
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:27,129
She got a haircut.

848
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:31,559
    
 You want to film an observational documentary for Chairman Matthew?

849
01:18:31,559 --> 01:18:34,029
Yes, I already finished filming the movie.

850
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:37,369
I want to film a documentary while finishing up the post-production work.

851
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:42,409
We can work on it before the movie comes out if we start now.

852
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:48,629
I understand your affectionate feelings for your late sister.

853
01:18:48,629 --> 01:18:52,729
But is there a need for us to go this far?

854
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,129
K is still at large and

855
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:58,069
I'm worried people might forget about K like this.

856
01:18:58,069 --> 01:19:01,429
That's not what you want, either, Chairman.

857
01:19:04,059 --> 01:19:09,209
Before I'm Da Mi's father, I'm also a businessman.

858
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:13,229
Right now, I want to focus on my company.

859
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:17,929
Losing myself in personal revenge is a clear neglect of my duties.

860
01:19:17,929 --> 01:19:21,609
Does that mean you're going to decline?

861
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:29,129
No, it's worth a review.

862
01:19:31,329 --> 01:19:34,529
I agree with Director Michelle.

863
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:41,979
As her mother, I wish more people would remember Da Mi.

864
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:48,279
Don't you feel the same, Lee Hwi So?

865
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:58,219
Instead, I want to introduce the Children's Home that TikiTaka is developing.

866
01:19:58,219 --> 01:20:02,019
It's an app that collects people's DNA and makes it easier to find missing children.

867
01:20:02,019 --> 01:20:07,969
I think it'd be good for TikiTaka's public service to be well-known.

868
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,509
All right.

869
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,319
I lost to the two of you.

870
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,429
I'll appear in the documentary for our Da Mi.

871
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:22,019
Thank you, Chairman.

872
01:20:22,019 --> 01:20:25,309
If you count on me, I'll do my best to do the best work.

873
01:20:25,309 --> 01:20:27,719
Yes, I got it.

874
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,809
 I'll suggest a documentary to Chairman Matthew today. 

875
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:33,779
 Don't worry. I'll make sure we get to observe him by any means. 

876
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:37,619
 I'm going to record all of that bastard's true colors with my camera. 

877
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:43,169
 Once Matthew's cover gets blown, you can come out into the world, Min Do Hyeok. 

878
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:53,969
Once "To D" comes out, it's sure to cause quite the shock.

879
01:20:55,229 --> 01:21:00,429
The true colors of people who live just fine even after committing a crime will be exposed.

880
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:07,629
 Han Mo Ne, you'll be the first to go. 

881
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:11,039
 I'll do whatever it takes to survive, 

882
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:16,549
 even if it means I'll be used completely by K and get destroyed. 

883
01:21:16,549 --> 01:21:20,859
 Until the day I meet my mom again. 

884
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:39,629
Director Michelle started working on the documentary.

885
01:22:39,629 --> 01:22:44,819
Please do your best at your stations until the first plan begins.

886
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:04,859
 Do Hyeok, I'll bring you out into the world for sure. 

887
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:07,159
 Let's see this to the end, Hyung. 

888
01:23:07,159 --> 01:23:09,609
 Until we bring down K. 

889

 She must've been kidnapped in front of the kindergarten!

 Did you forget what kind of woman I am?

 I'm a crazy bitch who abandoned the child she gave birth to.
