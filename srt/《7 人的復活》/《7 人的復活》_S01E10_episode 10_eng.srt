1
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,265
   

2
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:51,315
   

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,600


4
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,185
You don't need to get worked up.

5
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,305
What did you do to my mom?

6
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:10,515
Why can't she even recognize me? How?

7
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:15,015
I only used some medicine to complete your lie.

8
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,215
 It was all for your sake, Mo Ne. 

9
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:27,785
From now on,

10
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:31,205
you have to become the perfect mother Mo Ne talked about.

11
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:35,155
If you wish for Mo Ne's happiness,

12
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,405
you'll have to do as I say.

13
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:42,115
 My daughter, congratulations on your wedding. 

14
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:46,215
 I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband. 

15
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,795
That was for my sake?

16
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,845
What the hell do you want from me?

17
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,245
The fact.

18
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,965
What I want is the fact.

19
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,895
I don't trust women.

20
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:11,525
You see, women always lie.

21
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:14,705
They only want my money and power.

22
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,885
They don't care even a bit about the truth.

23
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,555
Of course, I'm sure you're different.

24
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,905
I'd need a safety device of some sort, wouldn't I?

25
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,805
Bring my mom to me right now.

26
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,915
Or else, I'll kill you.

27
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,525
Don't you hear me?

28
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,935
Bring me my mom, you fucking psychopath!

29
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:44,505
   

30
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,705
This is hell.

31
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:20,505
A tight and filthy room where a human being can't live in!

32
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,135
Yes, Do Hyeok.

33
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:29,545
 Hyung, Ahjumma showed up at the wedding. 

34
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:30,805
But she seems off.

35
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,075
Yoon Ji Sook did?

36
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,375
We also found where she was locked up.

37
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,195
As you said, it was in Hwang Chan Seong's house.

38
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,575
Hwang Chan Seong took Ahjumma again.

39
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,635
And I'm chasing her right now.

40
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,405
Okay, be careful.

41
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,165
Hwang Chan Seong is a lunatic.

42
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,835
D-Did he find Mom?

43
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,995
Let's get out of here for now.

44
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,305
Your mouth became so vulgar from hanging out with

45
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,365
a thug like Min Do Hyeok.

46
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,625
Do you want your mom to die?

47
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,755
If you wish, I'll kill her right away.

48
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,285
No. I'm sorry.

49
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:16,905
I must've lost it for a moment.

50
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,645
I'll do everything you want. I'll do everything you say.

51
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:22,605
Please don't harm my mom. Please?

52
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,265
I beg you. Please.

53
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,055
Your mom was in great pain

54
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:35,245
because you met Min Do Hyeok, that son of a bitch.

55
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,085
She took the pain that was supposed to be yours.

56
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:42,255
I'll never meet Min Do Hyeok again.

57
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,575
I swear. Please trust me. Okay?

58
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,205
Please don't do this.

59
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:59,815
None of this is your fault. This is all...

60
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,765
because of Min Do Hyeok, that asshole.

61
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,005
Don't cry.

62
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,185
All right, then.

63
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:18,795
We'll have to get rid of Min Do Hyeok first. Right?

64
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,775
Call up that asshole.

65
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,735
Tell him to stop following right now.

66
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,195
Han Mo Ne, listen up.

67
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:51,365
Hwang Chan Seong had locked up your mom in his house.

68
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,145
Stop chasing after my mom.

69
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,285
 No, I can get her right now. 

70
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,575
Hello.

71
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,585
 I told you to stop. 

72
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,795
Did I ask you to find my mom?

73
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,945
Who do you think you are to get in my business?

74
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,825
Stop. I said to stop!

75
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:11,515
 Why are you making me repeat myself? 

76
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:16,025
 Hey, do you have feelings for me? 

77
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,305
Are you doing this to get on my good side or something?

78
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:22,655
But that's too bad.

79
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,455
I fucking loathe...

80
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:32,045
thugs like you the most in this world.

81
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:39,145
So stop lingering around in my life and get lost!

82
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,415
 Hwang Chan Seong is next to her. 

83
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:47,085
Hey, I-I'm helping you right now.

84
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:51,465
Hey, okay. It's your mom, so you do whatever you want.

85
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,535
I'm taking my hands off.

86
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:02,195
 Han Mo Ne, are you okay? 

87
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,845
That was excellent.

88
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,715
If you'll only listen to me like this, I won't have to get mad.

89
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,845
You'll get to meet your mom soon, too.

90
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:26,385
We can't even go on a honeymoon because of the filming schedule.

91
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,475
What a shame, huh?

92
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:34,435
Instead, let's spend tonight in a luxurious hotel room.

93
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,635
Thank you for coming.

94
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,815
Congratulations on your wedding.

95
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,635
- Congratulations. 
 - Your bride is so beautiful.

96
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,755
Congratulations.

97
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,355
Congratulations.

98
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,165
 I can't get worked up. 

99
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:06,815
 As long as Hwang Chan Seong has Hannah, I'm the weaker one. 

100
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:10,215
 If I recklessly go at him, Hannah can get hurt. 

101
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,505
 Go ahead. 

102
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:16,885
Min Do Hyeok, listen carefully.

103
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,095
Hwang Chan Seong took Hannah.

104
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:20,795
 What do you mean? 

105
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,325
I gave her to him.

106
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:25,235
The mayoral elections are over, and I used her enough.

107
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,435
There's no reason for me to keep her.

108
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,225
I thought I should let you know.

109
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,805
Mayor!

110
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,255
Are you okay?

111
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,065
How dare you!

112
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,105
It's okay. You can go ahead.

113
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:57,535
But still—

114
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,745
I said it's okay.

115
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,695
What are you doing right now?

116
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:14,905
Why did you give him Hannah? You—

117
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,965
You don't feel bad for Madam Noh at all, huh?

118
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,735
If you weren't Seongchan Group's biological son,

119
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,505
both Paeng Hee and Hannah would've been happy.

120
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:26,105
Everyone became miserable because of you, your shameless bastard!

121
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,295
The reason K was trying to make you the mayor.

122
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,735
I know it's because of Gagok District.

123
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,775
I also know what K's trying to do there.

124
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:42,485
So what? You can't stop Matthew anyway.

125
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,825
Because I also bet my life on the Gagok District.

126
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,805
I plan to take everything I can from there.

127
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:51,185
And I'll get rid of everything that gets in my way!

128
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:58,235
Even if Paeng Hee were to come back to life, there's no exception.

129
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,805
It was only for a moment,

130
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:05,695
but I was a moron for having hoped...

131
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,715
we can become allies.

132
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,605
Go ahead and try.

133
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:15,905
- I'll also bet my life. 
 - Sure.

134
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,205
Go.

135
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,795
Min Do Hyeok!

136
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:43,325
Do you know why I became the mayor, even abandoning Myeong Ji and the kids?

137
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:49,405
That's the only way I can stop K's monstrous plan to obtain Gagok District.

138
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,685
This contains the evidence that Hwang Chan Seong met me.

139
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,635
You can use this to shake up Hwang Chan Seong.

140
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,615
I'm trash that can't even be recycled.

141
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:06,805
But at least for Myeong Ji's sake

142
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:09,435
and the kids' sakes...

143
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,705
Do Hyeok,

144
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,565
could even trash like me

145
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,175
become a dad?

146
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,130
I can't believe you're my wife.

147
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,215
I'm so happy.

148
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,830
I sweat a little.

149
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,330
I'll go wash up.

150
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,330
It's okay.

151
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:27,555
It must be urgent. Go and check first.

152
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,630
Stay put.

153
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,830
Who is it?

154
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,830
CEO, this is bad.

155
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,125
What's the matter?

156
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,265
I've committed a grave mistake.

157
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:54,185
The child... The child disappeared.

158
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,530
Just how many people do you need to handle a brat?

159
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,895
I thought she was sleeping.

160
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,205
So I left my station for a moment.

161
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,315
Is that even an excuse?

162
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:14,635
- Why aren't you looking for her? 
 - Yes.

163
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,225
Did Hannah contact you by any chance?

164
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:27,530
Hannah?

165
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,730
I dropped her off at the hotel as you ordered.

166
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,230
Could it be Hannah disappeared?

167
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,975
If Hannah contacts you, call me right away.

168
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,945
Is something wrong?

169
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:54,495
You sounded serious.

170
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,055
I'm so sorry.

171
00:13:57,055 --> 00:14:00,605
Something urgent came up. I'll have to go out for a moment.

172
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,915
Don't worry about me, and take care of your business.

173
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:06,545
- I'll go on home. 
 - Okay.

174
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,930
Why aren't you eating?

175
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,605
You like ice cream.

176
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:30,305
I want to go home.

177
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:32,705
You can't.

178
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,375
You're not my family.

179
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,730
Then, where am I going?

180
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:51,325
Where you're supposed to be.

181
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,115
 If you're there, 

182
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:57,385
 Yang Jin Mo will become miserable. 

183
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:12,335
Please refrain from going out from now on except for your filming.

184
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,830
This is an order from CEO Hwang.

185
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:22,045
   
   

186
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,530
 Fucking lunatic. 

187
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,430
I want to be alone.

188
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:34,925
CEO Hwang ordered me not to stay away from you even for a second.

189
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,415
Will you follow me into the bathroom, too?

190
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:48,930
I won't.

191
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,630
I'll unload and organize your belongings first, Madam.

192
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,030
How could you?

193
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,355
How could you lock up a person in a place like this?

194
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:58,385
How could you lock up a person in a place like this?

195
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,630
 Mo Ne, run away. 

196
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,930
 Mommy's okay. 

197
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,730
 Protect Hannah. 

198
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,875
Mom...

199
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:23,915
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

200
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,730
Please wait a bit longer.

201
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,405
I'll find you, no matter what.

202
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:37,195
 If I just keep the 10 commandments, that bastard won't mess with me. 

203
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,655
 I have to cater to him as much as I can. 

204
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:43,675
 That's how I can keep Mom and Hannah safe. 

205
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:48,015
 Min Do Hyeok, you'll help me. Right? 

206
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:51,175
 You know what I'm trying to do. 

207
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,975
 Please. 

208
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:11,045
 Han Mo Ne, just stay alive by any means. 

209
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:15,905
From this moment on, break off all connections with Mo Ne.

210
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,630
What are you saying, Hyung?

211
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,930
You'll let my sister stay with that bastard?

212
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,405
That doesn't make sense!

213
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:27,405
I'll tear this bastard apart and bring my mom and sister.

214
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,930
Kyeong Soo,

215
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,130
the only way to save your mom and sister is to trust your sister.

216
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,030
- What if everyone dies? 
 - Mo Ne won't die.

217
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,595
She has to protect someone.

218
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,635
Kyeong Soo.

219
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,405
I also believe Han Mo Ne can handle it.

220
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:57,805
What's the next plan?

221
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:02,825
First off, we'll bring Hannah to our side.

222
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,435
We need to find Go Myeong Ji first.

223
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,230
 You're like my mother. 

224
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,130
 How sweet of you to say so. 

225
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,030
 You should thank Chairman Matthew for his generosity. 

226
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,145
 Who are you? 

227
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:27,505
 You won't be sleeping easy from now on. 

228
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,130
It took you longer than I thought.

229
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,630
I brought Hannah as you ordered.

230
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,030
Keep your promise, too, Chairman.

231
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,630
Of course.

232
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,195
As soon as the Gagok District is settled, I'll get rid of Yang Jin Mo for good.

233
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,675
I also need a hideout for a while.

234
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:04,095
Because I need to protect my kids.

235
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,695
I have already prepared a safe place.

236
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:11,030
Neither Yang Jin Mo nor Hwang Chan Seong can find it.

237
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,730
I won't refuse.

238
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,585
Now, then.

239
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,630
Ahjumma, did I do something wrong?

240
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,230
Listen to the Chairman.

241
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,695
There won't be much problem, then.

242
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,545
Ahjumma. Ahjumma—

243
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:35,725
You better stay put!

244
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,395
- Chairman hates this. 
 - Let me go!

245
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,675
Let me go.

246
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,530
Keep her out of my sight.

247
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,805
I understand, Chairman.

248
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,225
Let go. Let me go!

249
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:51,535
Let go of me!

250
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,395
Ahjumma. Ahjumma!

251
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,785
 It's not my fault. 

252
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,995
 I won't regret it, ever. 

253
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,630
Hyungnim, I don't think anyone's here.

254
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,785
Go look inside over there.

255
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,495
Yes, Hyung.

256
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:25,230
Hyungnim, even the closets are empty!

257
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,530
I think she ran away in a hurry.

258
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,130
The kids' room is the same.

259
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,505
Yes.

260
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,030
Go Myeong Ji's family disappeared.

261
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,630
Her phone's off, too.

262
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,130
Min Do Hyeok! Kang Ki Tak!

263
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,555
What's the matter today?

264
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,555
I was excited all the way here.

265
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:51,785
What do we need to do?

266
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,730
Hey, before that, I have a question.

267
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,730
The woman at the wedding is Mo Ne's birth mother. Right?

268
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,205
And the corpse from the reservoir was someone else's?

269
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:03,195
You're right.

270
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,995
See? I'm right.

271
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:09,215
Unexpectedly, Han Mo Ne's mother showed up and

272
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:11,815
we'll use this to our advantage.

273
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,905
We're going with Plan B.

274
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,905
Is it a spy movie again? Or a thriller? A horror?

275
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,175
I'm kind of excited.

276
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,130
What's this?

277
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,330
It's Yang Jin Mo and Hwang Chan Seong—

278
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,130
They're close enough to meet for dinner?

279
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,730
Spread rumors that they're way closer than that.

280
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,930
We'll rush in, so Hwang Chan Seong can't keep his calm.

281
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,030
You two just light the fire.

282
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,585
   
 After that, the rumors will spread on their own. 

283
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:49,730
This is a secret, but I heard Save's Hwang Chan Seong is Mayor Yang Jin Mo's sponsor.

284
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,730
No way. Who told you that?

285
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,530
Hwang Chan Seong is a transparent person.

286
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,730
I saw it with my own eyes!

287
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,730
Here. A CCTV footage of them eating together at a luxurious restaurant in Cheongdam.

288
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,615
I even took a picture as evidence. It's them. Right?

289
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,775
A person who heard the secret couldn't keep it to himself.

290
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:11,525
She said Save sponsored Mayor Yang so he could become Seoul's mayor.

291
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,305
No way.

292
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,615
Save announced being neutral.

293
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:17,375
It's all bullshit!

294
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,830
I heard a Seoul city official say it!

295
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,630
Really?

296
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:26,945
Then, Hwang Chan Seong provided his political funds!

297
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:30,845
    
 - Hwang Chan Seong and Yang Jin Mo are... 
 - Oh, aren't they from the same hometown?

298
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:31,825
Oh, my. It must be so.

299
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:35,335
The rumor becomes more exaggerated and vulgar every time it's repeated.

300
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:38,145
I heard a crazy rumor today. In Seoul...

301
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:43,730
    
 The mom café, which has power, will mistakenly think they can change the world.

302
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,630
Hwang Chan Seong blatantly made him the mayor!

303
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,175
So, he can hit it off big time!

304
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,525
How can we stay put like this?

305
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,865
We need to seek justice.

306
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,845
Please inform other members of the mom café.

307
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,465
Your acquaintances' words cleverly

308
00:23:57,465 --> 00:23:59,155
increase the credibility of the facts.

309
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:03,230
I'm sure Hwang Chan Seong rigged the algorithm to support Yang Jin Mo.

310
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,230
My junior is Save's Hwang Chan Seong's colleague and closest friend.

311
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,935
He's the one who told me!

312
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:13,215
Wow, I knew it.

313
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,630
That rumor will be distributed randomly

314
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,185
to open chats through a macro.

315
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:32,955
TikiTaka's Talk must be the origin of the rumor.

316
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,985
That way, K and Hwang Chan Seong will go at each other like dogs

317
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:38,720
and fight even more fiercely.

318
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,130
Min Do Hyeok, is this your doing?

319
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:54,595
Is the enemy of my enemy a friend?

320
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:59,995
Thanks to you, I could take over Save very easily.

321
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:11,305
You told me to prepare the meals myself, so I worked on it since early morning.

322
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:12,665
How is it?

323
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:16,875
I'm sorry. You don't have to prepare meals from now on.

324
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,275
I'll go eat at the office.

325
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,875
I don't mind doing it.

326
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,365
I'm happy enough to see you try.

327
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,675
Just keep this up.

328
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,735
   

329
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,565
You've got a call.

330
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,165
Hey, Secretary Nam, if it's not urgent—

331
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,635
 We've got a problem, CEO. 

332
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,835
 Rumors about you and Mayor Yang are circulating. 

333
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,085
Rumors? Where's the origin?

334
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,235
It's spreading rapidly through TikiTaka's Talk.

335
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:48,385
The SNS is already full of posts criticizing you and Save.

336
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,425
TikiTaka?

337
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:54,105
I got it. I'll be there.

338
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:57,095
 Min Do Hyeok finally made a move. 

339
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,545
 It's my turn next. 

340
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,985
I have a shoot today.

341
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:05,115
I can go out. Right?

342
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:07,065
I'll leave that up to you.

343
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:26,155
 Hwang Chan Seong, you'll have it tough going forward. 

344
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,005
He's here! He came!

345
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,425
- CEO Hwang, one word, please! 
 - CEO Hwang!

346
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,045
- CEO Hwang! 
 - CEO Hwang!

347
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,715
Is it true you're Mayor Yang Jin Mo's sponsor?

348
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:36,795
There was an intel saying Save rigged the algorithm

349
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,595
to post news articles favorable to Mayor Yang!

350
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:42,675
Save doesn't rig the algorithm.

351
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:46,885
What about the rumor you met Mayor Yang secretly during the elections?

352
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:50,605
Are you daring to shove your mics in front of me

353
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:54,945
solely because of mere stock market gossip, irresponsible intel,

354
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:58,125
and baseless rumors right now?

355
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:01,605
Will you feign ignorance when there's evidence like this picture?

356
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:05,025
Please give us a fact-check, CEO Hwang!

357
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,365
- Please answer. 
 - One word, please.

358
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:08,465
 Please give us a word! 

359
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:11,075
I think you should leave the scene first.

360
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:16,415
Find a hideout for me. Where the reporters can't find me.

361
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:18,245
Yes.

362
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,535
 CEO Hwang! 

363
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,965
 CEO Hwang! 

364
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,125
I got it, Chan Seong.

365
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,175
I'll tell reporters you're taking a break because you're not well.

366
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:35,995
Don't worry about me, and stay hidden.

367
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:43,245
 There's a shoot today, but I don't see Hannah. 

368
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,275
- Director. 
 - Oh, Mo Ne.

369
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:52,125
Thank you so much for coming to my wedding.

370
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,975
Gosh. Of course, I should come since it's your wedding.

371
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,165
By the way, we've got enough time for the shoot.

372
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:58,825
Why did you postpone your honeymoon?

373
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:01,785
I'd have felt uncomfortable since everyone was working hard.

374
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:03,015
There's always next time.

375
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,775
Gosh, we'd be thankful, but—

376
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:09,485
Wait! What happened to your arm?

377
00:28:10,225 --> 00:28:13,445
Oh, I-I fell by mistake.

378
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,795
Is it really from a fall?

379
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:19,735
 Mayor Yang Jin Mo, step down right now! 

380
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:22,705
 Step down! Step down! 

381
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:25,895
What about the thing I asked for?

382
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:33,105
You've become fearless after becoming Seoul mayor.

383
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:36,205
Asking for the people's Secret Talk and all.

384
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,415
Who are those fuckers?

385
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,615
Mind your own business.

386
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:44,965
Why'd you hang out with a scum like Hwang Chan Seong and have this trouble?

387
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,895
Since you're the mayor,

388
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:50,855
you need to get on with the Gagok District business.

389
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,975
Why would I need to do that?

390
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:56,185
They're already yelling at me to resign.

391
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:58,685
You want me to develop the troubled Gagok District, too?

392
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:01,765
I can't risk my job for shit like that.

393
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,215
If you still want to keep pushing for it,

394
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:06,945
bring me 100 billion won.

395
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,825
100 billion won?

396
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,585
This is why I like you, Hyung.

397
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:23,445
You can smell money from miles away.

398
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,455
It's easy to get to the point.

399
00:29:25,455 --> 00:29:27,495
By the way, Hyung,

400
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,785
you need to protect Hannah.

401
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:34,245
I have Hannah right now.

402
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:39,125
You have Hannah? Not Hwang Chan Seong?

403
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,445
Of course!

404
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:45,225
Would I hand over such a perfect weakness to a bastard like Hwang Chan Seong?

405
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,195
Where's Hannah right now?

406
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:54,455
I hid her away at a place no one knows.

407
00:29:56,725 --> 00:30:00,945
All right. Can we talk business now?

408
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:02,835
Is Hannah okay?

409
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,675
If you even lay a finger on her—

410
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,445
Don't worry about that.

411
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:11,335
If you hand over Gagok District to me,

412
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:15,705
I'll also hand over Hannah to you, Hyung.

413
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:18,175
Want me to make a pinky promise?

414
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,485
If you don't want to lose Hannah,

415
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:26,475
you'd better open up the Gagok District case quickly.

416
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,345
Chairman, the conference room is this way.

417
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:30,405
Let's go.

418
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:36,195
Go Myeong Ji.

419
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,715
There's nothing to think about.

420
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:58,995
Why would I feel bad for Hannah?

421
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:03,505
Kids, shall we order some chicken?

422
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:06,125
No, I don't want any.

423
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,595
What about you, Phillip? Should we eat some meat?

424
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,065
Or do you want a buffet?

425
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:13,935
I'm not hungry, either.

426
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,355
You're not hungry?

427
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,105
Are you sick or something?

428
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,735
You eat Buldak even when you get cold sores. 
  (Korean spicy hot chicken ramen.) 

429
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:25,755
Do you have a fever?

430
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:27,595
I'm so bored.

431
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,125
This isn't fun at all.

432
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,045
Swimming and the buffet. I hate them all.

433
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:37,015
I miss Dad and Hannah.

434
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:42,455
Sleeping next to Hannah is better than sleeping at a hotel.

435
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:48,275
So, make up with Dad and bring him right now.

436
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:51,865
I already told you. It'll just be the three of us like before.

437
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:55,105
We can be happy with just the three of us, too.

438
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:57,805
I miss them every day.

439
00:31:57,805 --> 00:32:00,655
How can I be happy?

440
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:05,425
You're also a stupid idiot!

441
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,245
I want to see Dad, too.

442
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:12,615
Can't we live together again?

443
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:17,155
I want to eat the pasta Dad made.

444
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:32,905
 Goodness, eat slowly. 

445
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:37,845
 Hey, why do you let Erica hit you when you eat so much every day? 

446
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:42,085
 Come on. I'm obviously letting her win. 

447
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,395
 Because she's my older sister. 

448
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,945
 When I'm outside, I'm also 

449
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,995
 a king of fists. 

450
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:53,915
 Sure. 

451
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:57,765
 You have to protect your sister and mom 

452
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:00,235
 with those fists if something happens. Okay, Phillip? 

453
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:02,575
 Of course! 

454
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,485
 What about you, Dad? 

455
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,665
 Won't you protect us? 

456
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:17,535
 I also... 

457
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,785
 am learning right now. 

458
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,495
 Hurry up and eat. 

459
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,385
You kicked Dad out. Right?

460
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:28,375
I hate you.

461
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,815
I like Dad!

462
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:35,455
Mom and Dad are going to get a divorce.

463
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:38,675
Dad and Hannah aren't coming back anymore.

464
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:40,945
So stop crying now.

465
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,685
Phillip, won't you listen to me?

466
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:46,485
Do you want to get a beating?

467
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,245
Why are you being so stubborn?

468
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,625
Oh, my goodness!

469
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,765
Is this what you call a shameless behavior?

470
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:12,545
I think you're abusing your power right now, not me.

471
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,535
From now on, Seoul city will put your mom café under special regulations and

472
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:19,225
strictly punish you for verbal abuse and the spread of misinformation.

473
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,415
Do you think we're just going to watch?

474
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:24,735
Shall we start with your daughter's abuse?

475
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:27,895
No, let's start with the kindergarten teacher who killed herself

476
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:30,105
because of the false post you uploaded.

477
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:33,605
That's not it. Before that...

478
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,365
shall we start with who this man is?

479
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,145
Seo Jang Ho, 37 years old. The husband of the kindergarten teacher who killed herself.

480
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,845
Your lover.

481
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,635
If you think you've got what it takes, come at me.

482
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:48,275
Mayor, please spare me.

483
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:51,415
P-Please spare me.

484
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:57,335
If you mess with my family one more time,

485
00:34:57,335 --> 00:35:01,485
be prepared to make your family shed bloody tears.

486
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:16,035
 Prepare an emergency press conference. 

487
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,675
We've decided to resume the development of the Gagok District,

488
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:24,375
which was paused six years ago.

489
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,885
The project period is 48 months.

490
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:31,265
Approximately 30.7 trillion won will be spent on everything

491
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:34,835
from planning to construction.

492
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:42,875
In the future, Gagok District will become a global high-tech city that surpasses Las Vegas,

493
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:47,205
containing tourist attractions, resorts, casinos, leisure, and theme parks.

494
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:48,395
   
   

495
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,325
   
   

496
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:53,505
   

497
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:12,095
   

498
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:25,085
The land prices soared four times in just a few days.

499
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:28,425
K's buying out every single plot of land at the asking price.

500
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:33,185
We absolutely can't let K take over Gagok District.

501
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,305
Gosh, let's go check over there.

502
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:38,825
Gosh, wait— Gosh!

503
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,715
- Which way shall we go? 
 - P-Please come to me—

504
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:44,895
Shall we go to Gagok District?

505
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:49,175
- N-No, please take a look. 
 - Please take one look here.

506
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:52,095
The money is here. It arrived.

507
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:54,535
Goodness, you're here, Chairwoman.

508
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:57,885
There you go!

509
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:07,735
This is the broker fee I'm giving you as advance payment.

510
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:12,215
I don't care about the price, so hand over everything that's on sale to me.

511
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:13,635
- Okay? 
 - Goodness.

512
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:15,265
Of course I will!

513
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,115
Now, then. I'm counting on you.

514
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:20,215
Please don't worry!

515
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:25,775
If Vice President Kang Ki Tak finds out,

516
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,765
he'll be extremely upset.

517
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:32,435
I'm buying my land with my own money. What's the problem?

518
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:36,205
This is all an investment for my future with Vice President Kang.

519
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:42,255
With this, I'll really recover my status as a conglomerate!

520
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,415
Here's 100 billion won.

521
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,250
   

522
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,195
Luca,

523
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:58,265
expand the area for development to the land marked on there.

524
00:37:58,265 --> 00:38:00,225
 After the Gagok District development was announced, 

525
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:02,665
 the land prices soared 20 times in a month. 

526
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:05,445
 But Seoul city hasn't designated it as excessive property speculation, 

527
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:07,065
 raising controversy. 

528
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:10,965
 Experts are expressing concerns that the price increase rate 

529
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:13,345
 will rise and become uncontrollable again 

530
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:17,375
 if Gagok District isn't designated as excessive property speculation. 

531
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:29,155
It's nice and moist.

532
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:30,645
Today's makeup will be great.

533
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,895
Right? It's shiny, isn't it?

534
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,735
Gosh, you won't need any lighting today.

535
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,625
Mo Ne, you keep getting bruises these days.

536
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:44,385
You keep losing weight after getting married, too.

537
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:48,065
Really? I can't really tell.

538
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,225
Is your husband still staying in?

539
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:51,705
Does he have COVID or something?

540
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:56,615
I mean, don't you feel stifled if he stays home all day?

541
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:59,505
He went to work today.

542
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:02,205
- Should I wear the costume now? 
 - Yes.

543
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,335
Whoa, Mo Ne—

544
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:07,375
Oh, my. What's wrong, Mo Ne?

545
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,505
Why are you shaking so much?

546
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:14,625
By chance, do you get beat up at home?

547
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,655
It's not like that.

548
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,795
Please pretend you didn't see the bruises on my body.

549
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:21,315
Otherwise, I'll really die.

550
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:28,805
It's my husband. I think I'll have to cancel today's shoot.

551
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:31,145
 - Han Mo Ne, it's our turn now.  
 - Mo Ne!

552
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:34,125
 I'll reveal what kind of person Hwang Chan Seong is. 

553
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:38,875
S-Talk 4.0, with our newest update, includes secret chatrooms,

554
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:42,225
content services such as webtoons and web novels,

555
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,695
and news services are to be added in the future, too.

556
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:48,145
Are you saying S-Talk will function as a portal site?

557
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,365
That's correct.

558
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:56,595
As a demo, here's the first news article S-Talk will be delivering.

559
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:58,865
   

560
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,665
 What's that? 

561
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,215
 What is that? 

562
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:05,545
 - Isn't it Han Mo Ne? 
 - Look at this! 

563
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,665
 - What's this? 
 - They even got two pictures. 

564
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:11,375
Are you saying Han Mo Ne, the top star, is a victim of domestic violence?

565
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,825
That's correct.

566
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,895
Who is he?

567
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,575
Even before the wedding, Han Mo Ne

568
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:19,035
was a victim of dating violence by Hwang Chan Seong.

569
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:23,345
After their wedding, even Han Mo Ne's mother went missing.

570
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:26,425
These are all facts I researched in person.

571
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,470
 - Please answer! 
 - Min Do Hyeok! 

572
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:36,335
We received a report of domestic violence.

573
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,315
 CEO Hwang Chan Seong? 

574
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,015
Domestic violence?

575
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:43,875
Such a thing never happened!

576
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:51,085
Madam...

577
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:54,355
 Min Do Hyeok, leave the acting to me. 

578
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:07,965
Where's Han Mo Ne?

579
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,005
I'm over here!

580
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,895
Please help me.

581
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,495
My husband locks me up in a hidden room and beats me.

582
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:18,805
I can't even get out because of these people!

583
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:21,745
Please get me out of this hell.

584
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,155
I told you!

585
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:27,715
I clearly heard the sounds of screaming and beating from this house!

586
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:30,175
 We'll wrap up. 

587
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:32,135
 It's nice to see you, Dr. Cha and Mr. Nam. 

588
00:41:32,135 --> 00:41:33,935
Where's the hidden room?

589
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,665
It's behind those glasses.

590
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:38,745
Search! Make sure to secure evidence, too.

591
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:44,555
You'll have to speak the truth to the police.

592
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,195
We'll take Han Mo Ne with us for safety.

593
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,805
My goodness! Look at those bruises!

594
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:56,005
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - Let us talk.

595
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:58,245
My goodness!

596
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:00,165
The police took Mo Ne?

597
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:01,645
But why?

598
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,685
They said there was a report on domestic violence.

599
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:07,855
I told them we didn't know anything.

600
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:10,855
What kind of bullshit is that?

601
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:13,285
I couldn't even go home for a month.

602
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:15,755
CEO Hwang, please look at this.

603
00:42:15,755 --> 00:42:18,285
 If there was no act of violence, 

604
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,355
 come out in person and explain, Hwang Chan Seong. 

605
00:42:22,355 --> 00:42:25,515
 Otherwise, we'll continue to raise suspicion. 

606
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:28,895
Then, why are you taking charge of Han Mo Ne's matter, Min Do Hyeok?

607
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:30,995
What is your relationship to each other?

608
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:34,885
I was also a victim of the media's indiscriminate violence and

609
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,495
since I found out about Han Mo Ne, the presumed victim, and her situation,

610
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:39,155
I couldn't just sit back.

611
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:43,515
Because Han Mo Ne is too famous of a person to take action in person.

612
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:45,525
This message is for Hwang Chan Seong.

613
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:48,505
I'll give you exactly three hours from now.

614
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:52,155
Please show the press that Han Mo Ne's mother is safe.

615
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,785
 I won't take your bullshit she's not in Korea. 

616
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:58,535
 Because Yoon Ji Sook has no record of leaving the country. 

617
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,865
Before I see her mother, I'll never back down.

618
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,005
Please explain about the picture!

619
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:08,205
I can see my brother's face from this kid.

620
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:12,675
Although he was raised by someone else, he grew up damn fine.

621
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,495
My nephew.

622
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,445
 This message is for Hwang Chan Seong. 

623
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:19,465
 I'll give you exactly three hours from now. 

624
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:23,155
 Please show the press that Han Mo Ne's mother is safe. 

625
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:25,395
This was Min Do Hyeok's Plan B, huh?

626
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:28,965
Cornering Hwang Chan Seong as a domestic violence offender.

627
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:32,690
Will Hwang Chan Seong bring my mom?

628
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,640
   

629
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,910
   

630
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:46,345
 The phone is turned off. After the beep... 

631
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:50,105
Han Mo Ne.

632
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:54,125
She was scheming with Min Do Hyeok behind my back.

633
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:58,395
You need to meet your consequences.

634
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:05,315
Send away Yoon Ji Sook to a country no one can find right now.

635
00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:08,065
We can't. If Yoon Ji Sook doesn't show up,

636
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,975
the suspicions will only grow.

637
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:13,655
There's only one way, then.

638
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:17,105
We'll show Yoon Ji Sook to the media for a moment and

639
00:44:17,105 --> 00:44:20,385
we'll deploy my private jet right away.

640
00:44:20,385 --> 00:44:23,475
 With National Hero Min Do Hyeok's sudden reveal, 

641
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:26,975
 the stock prices of TikiTaka and Save, which announced a merger, 

642
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:30,365
 ended the day with a lower limit price. 

643
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,395
 Min Do Hyeok said TikiTaka... 

644
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:34,085
Domestic violence?

645
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,755
Hwang Chan Seong, that fucking idiot.

646
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:39,965
He's ruining my TikiTaka.

647
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,245
Gagok District is all I have left.

648
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:52,685
I must take over the Gagok District without fail.

649
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:11,435
 Where is Mo Ne? 

650
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:15,995
 Where is my daughter? 

651
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:20,605
Mother,

652
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:25,775
if you just do as I say, you can meet Mo Ne.

653
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:29,205
So you just need to

654
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:33,625
do as you practiced in front of the people.

655
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:45,885
Mom.

656
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:05,025
 The phone is turned off. After the beep... 

657
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:07,285
I'll kill those fucking bastards!

658
00:46:07,285 --> 00:46:08,645
 Don't get worked up. 

659
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:10,825
 You absolutely can't act on your own. Okay? 

660
00:46:10,825 --> 00:46:13,165
I don't care about any of that.

661
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:22,565
- Mom. 
 - Shit.

662
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:24,425
Mom!

663
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:43,155
Run! Run away, Mom!

664
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:47,555
Get her!

665
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,265
Where are you going, Mother?

666
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:50,745
Take her.

667
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:02,695
I'll have to kill Han Mo Ne.

668
00:48:21,075 --> 00:48:23,465
It's dangerous, CEO!

669
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:31,055
 I'm only a burden to my children. 

670
00:48:31,055 --> 00:48:35,955
 I need to disappear for my Mo Ne to be free. 

671
00:48:54,675 --> 00:49:01,195
 Mo Ne, you have to live on for sure! Okay? 

672
00:49:02,665 --> 00:49:04,285
Mom...

673
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:05,955
- What? 
 - Huh?

674
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:08,325
Isn't something going on over there?

675
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:11,735
- We'll have to go there first. 
 - Yes.

676
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,755
You need to leave before someone sees you.

677
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:18,785
She'll die in there. Right?

678
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:23,715
H-Hey, what's going on here?

679
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,560
Hey!

680
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:41,665
Mom?

681
00:49:41,665 --> 00:49:43,925
Mom. Mom!

682
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:44,855
Mom!

683
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:47,105
- You can't! Don't. 
 - Mom! Mom!

684
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:48,845
- You can't! 
 - Mom!

685
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:51,085
- Mom! Mom! 
 - Don't go.

686
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:53,585
No, this can't be!

687
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:55,725
- Mom! 
 - Mo Ne!

688
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:57,745
Mom!

689
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:03,225
Mom! Mom!

690
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:05,085
Mo Ne!

691
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,345
Han Mo Ne, you stay here. Don't come inside.

692
00:50:10,345 --> 00:50:12,815
H-Hey! Hey!

693
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:30,525
 I won't let you die like my mom. 

694
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:32,665
 I won't ever make a mistake again. 

695
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:37,115
 Ahjumma, I'll save you for sure. 

696
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,265
Mom.

697
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,895
 My mom and my brother are inside. 

698
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,770
   

699
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:33,405
What's this? Why are you here, Sis?

700
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:35,735
It can't be. Right?

701
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,655
Min Do Hyeok went inside to rescue her.

702
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:41,315
No. No, Mom!

703
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:42,205
Mom—

704
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:45,555
H-Hyung, let me go! I need to go and save my mom!

705
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:47,625
Hyung, let me go!

706
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:51,025
Please. Please.

707
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:00,125
Ahjumma, wake up.

708
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,045
Ahjumma!

709
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:24,135
Mom!

710
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:26,295
- Mom! 
 - Mom.

711
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:28,455
Mom, are you okay?

712
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:44,655
It's all okay.

713
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:50,995
I think she inhaled too much toxic gas.

714
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:52,985
She needs to get treated right away.

715
00:52:52,985 --> 00:52:55,005
The firetruck will arrive in five minutes.

716
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,295
Get her to the hospital quickly. We'll go after Hwang Chan Seong.

717
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:00,755
- Yes, leave it to me. 
 - Hurry.

718
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,095
Mother!

719
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:06,485
- This way. 
 - Careful.

720
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:29,405
You can go.

721
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:31,725
She'll be okay.

722
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:35,175
And you?

723
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:38,275
Are you okay?

724
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:40,435
Yes.

725
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,825
Of course, I'm okay.

726
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:43,895
What is it? Do you still have insults to spare?

727
00:54:43,895 --> 00:54:46,535
Apologize to Erica.

728
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:50,155
I'm sorry for biting you and bothering you.

729
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:52,915
I won't make fun of you again.

730
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,255
You apologize, too, Mom.

731
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:58,475
I apologize for what happened.

732
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:02,035
Any parent would lose it if their child got hurt.

733
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:05,705
I was also worried the apartment would go down in value.

734
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:07,655
You understand how I feel, right?

735
00:55:07,655 --> 00:55:10,275
Do I have to understand all that?

736
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:12,095
I'm tired, so please move aside.

737
00:55:12,095 --> 00:55:14,455
Even so, your husband really went too far.

738
00:55:14,455 --> 00:55:17,085
How could he use public authority to dig into personal info?

739
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:20,485
An ordinary citizen like me has no power!

740
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:25,015
I was scared to death that my family would fall apart.

741
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:26,985
Let's go.

742
00:55:32,535 --> 00:55:36,285
 No way. Did he... 

743
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:39,615
 No, he would never. 

744
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:42,375
 He would never do anything for our sakes. 

745
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:44,645
Let's go, kids.

746
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:47,895
 Gagok District's contractor is to be announced tomorrow. 

747
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:52,155
 The nation is closely watching to see Seoul city's decision on the contractor. 

748
00:55:52,155 --> 00:55:54,965
Sell off every part of the Gagok District we own.

749
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:55,805
Yes!

750
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:58,115
What? S-Sell them off?

751
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:02,715
T-They're announcing the contractor tomorrow!

752
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:07,405
A big fortune is inches away, Chairwoman!

753
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,055
I said sell them off.

754
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:16,595
   

755
00:56:19,305 --> 00:56:22,025
   

756
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:27,465
   

757
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:35,285
Mayor, it's time for you to make the announcement.

758
00:56:36,465 --> 00:56:38,455
Let's go.

759
00:56:38,455 --> 00:56:40,525
 Step down! Step down! 

760
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:42,555
 Step down! 

761
00:56:42,555 --> 00:56:44,525
Yang Jin Mo must resign!

762
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:46,995
Yang Jin Mo must step down!

763
00:56:46,995 --> 00:56:50,385
   

764
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:54,325
   

765
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,705
Currently, Gagok District is showing

766
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:11,065
an excessive property speculation comparable to Gangnam in Seoul.

767
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:21,430
However, Seoul was never going to develop the Gagok District in the first place.

768
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:27,235
 K, don't get your hopes up. 

769
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,555
 This is my decision. 

770
00:57:31,655 --> 00:57:34,595
Announcing the development plan for Gagok District in the beginning

771
00:57:34,595 --> 00:57:40,230
was to expose the unseen hand manipulating Korea's real estate industry.

772
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:45,930
From this moment, Seoul City is planning to launch a full-scale census of the Gagok District

773
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,495
to completely root out and

774
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:52,830
get rid of the private cartel that's corrupting Korea.

775
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,330
Who's the unseen hand manipulating the real estate industry of Korea?

776
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,745
Mayor Yang Jin Mo, please answer!

777
00:57:57,745 --> 00:58:01,805
   

778
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,225
Jin Mo.

779
00:58:07,225 --> 00:58:08,470
   

780
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,330
Hannah.

781
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:17,585
Hannah's in danger.

782
00:58:23,015 --> 00:58:26,845
 This is what you were going to do, to begin with. Right? 

783
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:33,015
 Yang Jin Mo, I'll make you regret this. 

784
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:35,135
 Starting with Noh Hannah, that bitch. 

785
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:38,645
 You've already taken all the money you need, huh? 

786
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,535
   
  We found Hannah.  

787
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:47,955
 She's inside K's house. 

788
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,530
Ki Tak found Hannah's location. It's K's house.

789
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,885
What? It was his house?

790
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:57,495
We need to move faster than Matthew.

791
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:00,465
   

792
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:05,085
 Jin Mo, Hannah's in Matthew's house. 

793
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:07,025
I know. Where are you right now?

794
00:59:07,025 --> 00:59:09,705
I'll go get Hannah. It's a quick trip from my house.

795
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:11,965
No, it's too dangerous alone! We've got people who will help.

796
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:17,345
 No, I want to correct the mistake I made. 

797
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:22,495
 Hannah's location has been identified just now. 

798
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,685
 It's K's house. 

799
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,555
Oh, I'll drive.

800
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:26,825
- Hurry up. 
 - Okay.

801
00:59:26,825 --> 00:59:30,705
 We'll save Hannah, no matter what. 

802
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:12,930
Where's Hannah?

803
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:15,230
She's in her room on the second floor.

804
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,325
What's the matter?

805
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:21,285
Chairman said to bring Hannah quickly.

806
01:00:29,485 --> 01:00:31,405
Hannah!

807
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,230
Hannah!

808
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:42,845
Ahjumma!

809
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:47,465
I knew you'd come.

810
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:50,765
I'll be a good kid from now on.

811
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,230
Please take me out of here.

812
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:00,055
H-Hannah...

813
01:01:01,285 --> 01:01:03,765
I'm so sorry.

814
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:06,930
We have to run away from here right now.

815
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,730
You can do that. Right?

816
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:12,025
You're a smart girl, Hannah.

817
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:14,625
Go Myeong Ji!

818
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,475
Chairman said he never said such a thing—

819
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:24,045
Go Myeong Ji?

820
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:26,695
Go Myeong Ji!

821
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:34,415
Run away!

822
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,330
Hannah, hurry up and go!

823
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,730
Just look ahead and run. Hurry up!

824
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:43,930
I don't want to! I'll go with you, Ahjumma!

825
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,555
Where do you think you're going?

826
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,855
Mr. Jin Mo said he'll come for you.

827
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:53,695
If you get hurt, I can't face him.

828
01:01:53,695 --> 01:01:56,965
So please go right now. I'll see you at home. Okay?

829
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,555
You have to come quickly, too. Okay?

830
01:01:59,555 --> 01:02:01,655
It's a promise.

831
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:45,165
Chairman.

832
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:48,385
Go Myeong Ji!

833
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:51,430
You're really bold.

834
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,030
Who could I blame?

835
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:59,965
I brought it upon myself for siding with a bastard like you.

836
01:02:59,965 --> 01:03:02,205
Hannah ran away.

837
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:04,155
We have to catch Hannah first.

838
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,605
No...

839
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:08,465
D-Don't do this to Hannah.

840
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,125
It doesn't matter, even if it isn't Hannah!

841
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:16,025
I also have what Yang Jin Mo cherishes here right now.

842
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:37,045
Hannah.

843
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:39,595
Ahjussi.

844
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,925
Ahjussi!

845
01:03:47,245 --> 01:03:48,755
Ahjumma...

846
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:52,225
Ahjumma is still in that house.

847
01:03:54,155 --> 01:03:56,275
I got it.

848
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:21,315
 I still saved Hannah. 

849
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:24,185
 That's enough. 

850
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:26,630
 Erica... 

851
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,230
 Phillip... 

852
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:34,115
 I'm so sorry for being a terrible mom. 

853
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:42,895
Bury her in the mountains.

854
01:04:42,895 --> 01:04:44,715
Yes, sir.

855
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,330
Myeong Ji.

856
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,805
What are you doing? Back out!

857
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,230
Hold on tight.

858
01:05:57,395 --> 01:05:59,605
What the fuck is this?

859
01:06:17,565 --> 01:06:20,165
Myeong Ji. Myeong Ji!

860
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,230
Go Myeong Ji! Wake up, Go Myeong Ji!

861
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,845
Hurry! Hurry up!

862
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:34,965
Myeong Ji!

863
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:38,255
Myeong Ji!

864
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:44,105
Myeong Ji. Myeong Ji!

865
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:52,255
Myeong Ji.

866
01:06:56,285 --> 01:06:58,575
What about Hannah?

867
01:06:58,575 --> 01:07:01,130
Did Hannah make it?

868
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:04,130
She made it. Don't worry.

869
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,630
I think...

870
01:07:07,515 --> 01:07:11,485
this is it for me.

871
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,930
I know it's shameless of me,

872
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,930
but could I ask you to...

873
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:21,130
take care of our kids?

874
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,030
Quit the nonsense. I won't let you die like this.

875
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,945
Think of Erica and Phillip.

876
01:07:27,655 --> 01:07:30,865
Jin Mo...

877
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:33,255
Jin Mo...

878
01:07:34,895 --> 01:07:37,665
Jin Mo...

879
01:07:37,665 --> 01:07:41,905
I'm really sorry.

880
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:55,455
I don't want to lose any more people I cherish.

881
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,930
Jin Mo...

882
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,030
Myeong Ji.

883
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,230
Myeong Ji.

884
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,435
Myeong Ji!

885
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:44,640


886
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:56,660
♫  Like shadows in the dark  ♫

887
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:03,605
♫  Stolen nights that hid the truth  ♫

888
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:06,205
♫  Lies  ♫

889
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:09,015
   

890
01:09:09,015 --> 01:09:11,330
 Do you admit to attempting to kill the mayor's wife? 

891
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,930
 Contact Hwang Chan Seong right now. 

892
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,055
 He'll do anything to help me, given the circumstances. 

893
01:09:15,055 --> 01:09:16,935
 I only want two things. 

894
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:18,915
 Luca and Min Do Hyeok. 

895
01:09:18,915 --> 01:09:20,575
 I'm getting punished. 

896
01:09:20,575 --> 01:09:22,230
 For what I did to Da Mi. 

897
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,730
 Can I borrow Seongchan's power to take down K? 

898
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,530
 What's there to hesitate? We've got nothing to lose now! 

899
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,115
 We killed a person! 

900
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:32,395
 I'll reveal it. 

901
01:09:32,395 --> 01:09:36,350
 That I gave birth to K's child and that Matthew is K. 

902
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,930
♫  I can't let you go  ♫
