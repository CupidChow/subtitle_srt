00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,830
   

3
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,830
That fucking lunatic.

5
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,270
Who the hell dares to pretend he's Shim Joon Seok?

6
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,500
K, long time no see.

7
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,850
Thanks for your work

8
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,640
on bringing me out into the world.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,370
You managed to survive, Min Do Hyeok.

10
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,730
How does it make you feel?

11
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,740
You mocked the world with fake news.

12
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,160
How does it feel to have fake news work against you?

13
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,500
Did you come on your own feet because dying once wasn't enough?

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,430
You see, I've got nothing to lose.

15
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,200
So I've got nothing to fear.

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,310
Fucking bastard—

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,770
What? You want to go at it?

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,430
Let's go at it.

19
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,600
Do something.

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,050
I hope playing Lee Hwi So, the hero, was fun for you.

21
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,600
As long as I'm back,

22
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,530
it's all over for you.

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,820
No matter how hard you try,

24
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,200
there's no one who will believe you.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,310
Sure. Let's see what happens.

26
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,140
We'll be meeting again soon.

27
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,880
Enjoy your time while it lasts,

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,910
Shim Joon Seok.

29
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,820
K.

30
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,340
How did he survive? Does this make sense?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,040
Min Do Hyeok.

32
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,220
Min Do Hyeok is alive!

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,930
 He was right in front of my eyes just now! 

34
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,820
He was wearing a mask as me, Shim Joon Seok, and mocking me all along!

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,070
Everything makes sense now.

36
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,570
The reason Michelle disappeared.

37
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,090
There must be a traitor among us.

38
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,260
What?

39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,630
For now, I'll gather everyone.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,500
We'll be able to rule out the traitor based on their reactions.

41
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,420
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,790
Min Do Hyeok is alive?

43
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,790
We need to go and meet Matthew. Get ready.

44
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,830
   

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,970
Hello?

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,140
 Meet me right now. Just the two of us. 

47
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,080
Be honest.

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,190
Did you communicate with Min Do Hyeok all this time?

49
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,710
Did you know that bastard was alive?

50
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,720
Are you doubting me right now?

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,460
I had no idea.

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,940
What about you?

53
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,700
How could I have known?

54
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,480
You know where Hannah is, don't you?

55
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,260
 You'll be in danger if you keep that girl with you. 

56
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,240
 Hurry up and send her to an orphanage. 

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,930
 Otherwise, we'll all die! 

58
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,820
 We'll hide away real good until we die, so don't worry and go! 

59
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,220
 I won't call you even if I die, so go! 

60
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,030
You know where she is, don't you?

61
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,900
Do you keep in touch with Hannah?

62
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,450
How many times have I told you I don't know?

63
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,210
Oh! Are you trying to score a point with Matthew by sacrificing me?

64
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,390
Even so, you and I are in the same boat.

65
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,620
Because we both didn't tell him Hannah was alive.

66
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,510
Matthew can never find out.

67
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
If he finds out, Hannah and we will all die—

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
What are you two doing here?

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,640
Don't tell me you're having an affair with Mo Ne

70
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,070
when you're the deputy mayor of Seoul.

71
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,660
What kind of nonsense is that?

72
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,130
- My goodness. 
 - I got stuck.

73
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,810
I guess you two were having a secret talk, huh?

74
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,130
There's no such thing.

75
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,830
Someone suggested Mo Ne as Seoul's ambassador, so I was making an offer.

76
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,400
The Grim Reaper came to get us, and you asked her about work?

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,330
Whether Min Do Hyeok is alive or not, we need to make a living. Right?

78
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,570
I'll think about it and let you know.

79
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,470
All right.

80
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,910
Who is it? Who betrayed me?

81
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,540
I had to say Min Do Hyeok was innocent with my own lips.

82
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,130
I said Min Do Hyeok wasn't Shim Joon Seok with my own mouth!

83
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,970
Tell me. Who helped Min Do Hyeok out?

84
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,950
Was it you?

85
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,610
Was it you?

86
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,750
Or was it you?

87
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,090
I was first to side with you one year ago.

88
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,540
I'm the last one you should doubt!

89
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,050
The exhibition exploded for sure back then.

90
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,040
 Even the news said they found a corpse. 

91
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,350
Who on earth was the corpse, then?

92
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,370
We naturally thought it was Min Do Hyeok.

93
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,580
Someone switched it.

94
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,250
Min Do Hyeok was switched with someone else.

95
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,440
Who would do such a thing?

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,570
Could it have been Michelle?

97
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,140
Think about who secretly contacted Michelle.

98
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,870
Michelle was working with Min Do Hyeok to spy on us in the first place,

99
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,130
saying she was filming a documentary.

100
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,060
That means it was you, Han Mo Ne!

101
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,840
You told Michelle that I was Shim Joon Seok!

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Michelle just blackmailed me this whole time.

103
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,820
I've never even met Min Do Hyeok!

104
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,630
Yang Jin Mo's suspicious, too.

105
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,480
He was talking to Han Mo Ne secretly in her car just now.

106
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
And it was so secretive.

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,140
You're right.

108
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,350
The two of you totally sided with Min Do Hyeok in the past.

109
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,510
This is why ex-convicts are the first ones to be suspected.

110
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,310
What did you two talk about?

111
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,120
You're going to shut your mouths, huh?

112
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,780
Fine, then.

113
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,840
I'll help you open your mouths myself.

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,780
Hold these two down.

115
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,790
You dared to betray me again, huh?

116
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,200
Who should I kill first?

117
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,640
Yang Jin Mo, should we start with you?

118
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,800
This is why I met up with Mo Ne first!

119
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,920
I didn't want to be framed as Min Do Hyeok's follower!

120
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,100
As a consequence of betraying once, my every move is being spied on.

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,860
By my wife at that!

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,520
I can vouch for that!

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,570
His schedule was always so full. He had no time to mess around.

124
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,820
Now that I think about it, aren't you two the least monitored?

125
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,100
Oh, my. Are you defending Yang Jin Mo because he's your husband?

126
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
You must be so lovey-dovey with your fake husband.

127
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,770
What do we have to gain from siding with Min Do Hyeok?

128
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,640
Because you two are the most lacking

129
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,550
out of everyone here.

130
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,300
So it'd be easier to take you down.

131
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,790
Are you picking a fight or what—

132
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,580
Sure, let's fight.

133
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,720
- What are you going to do? 
 - How dare you accuse me?

134
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,250
- Wait, Go Myeong Ji! 
 - You arrogant bastard! Hey, you!

135
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,680
 Keep fighting amongst yourselves like that. 

136
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,840
 Until none of you remain. 

137
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,190
What's the matter?

138
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,880
What?

139
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,080
Luca, turn on the TV.

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,690
   
 "I'm Also a Natural Person's" first-ever... 

141
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,140
Everyone shut up!

142
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,320
 I keep hearing music from there. 

143
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,750
 I'll go meet today's natural person. 

144
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,380
 Catch fish and frogs! 

145
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,680
 Harvest medicinal herbs and catch frogs! 

146
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,620
Catch fish and frogs and harvest medicinal—

147
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,800
Whoa, hold on. I-It's a celebrity.

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,510
 R-Right? Whoa, this is crazy. 

149
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,540
 Gosh, I-I was really surprised. W-What do I do? 

150
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,580
He's become the dirtiest bum!

151
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,630
I was really too scared.

152
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,220
Whenever I turn on the TV, my face comes out right away.

153
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,580
Everyone kept calling me Shim Joon Seok and K. How could I live in such fear?

154
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,480
I-If I spoke up and denied it, I thought I'd get the cuffs.

155
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,410
But it's not like I could've admitted to it.

156
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,160
I really thought I'd go mad back then.

157
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,130
That crazy bastard!

158
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,830
The chat is filled with friendly comments for Min Do Hyeok.

159
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,240
The reactions are something else.

160
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,290
After meeting you like this, I can tell you're truly a natural person.

161
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,940
But Chairman Shim Yong had once said you're his son.

162
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,580
That's totally absurd, I tell you.

163
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,070
He had once framed me as a Shim Joon Seok impersonator.

164
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,500
He's totally not. I'm saying he's not my father.

165
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,190
 I'll tell you clearly right now— I-I can say it to that camera, right? 

166
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,280
   
 Y-Yes, that one. 

167
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,110
 I'm the son of Jeong Mi So, who used to run a hair salon in Deokseon County. 

168
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,540
 Look over here. T-This is my mom, my younger brother, and me. Right? 

169
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,470
 In my opinion, Chairman Matthew probably... 

170
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,310
- He denied being Chairman Shim Yong's biological son. 
  - Such a nonsense like that... 

171
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,010
What is he scheming?

172
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,190
Actually, Chairman Matthew and I...

173
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,550
share the fact that we lost our family members to Shim Joon Seok.

174
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,240
 Chairman Matthew's old name is Lee Hwi So. Right? 

175
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,120
 Lee Hwi So's family and my family lived on different floors in the same house. 

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,540
I see.

177
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,620
And both families were slaughtered then because of Shim Joon Seok's arson.

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,310
 Lee Hwi So's wife and my mom— 

179
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,060
My mom— I-I'm sorry. One moment, please.

180
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,610
Min Do Hyeok is messing with people's sentiments.

181
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,120
It's getting tons of supportive comments here, too.

182
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,710
"Whoa, that poor family was Min Do Hyeok's?"

183
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,260
"I remember his brother graduated No. 1 from Seoul National University Law School."

184
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,300
"Poor Min Do Hyeok. He lost his family and got framed, too."

185
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,340
Shut up! You're thrilled, huh?

186
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,590
 I don't know how Chairman Matthew knew about this. 

187
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,290
 H-He came to my house and even knelt down to apologize in front of me. 

188
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,590
I see.

189
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,040
He said he'll take responsibility for my life.

190
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,320
He said I should work at TikiTaka with him.

191
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,470
Quit the fucking show. When did I ever?

192
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,540
 The national hero sure stands out from the rest. 

193
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,470
Chairman Matthew Lee— Gosh, I'm an idiot. That's not right.

194
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,190
 Mr. Lee Hwi So, you'll protect me from that Shim Joon Seok going forward. Right? 

195
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,170
That asshole! He's toying with me right now!

196
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,430
Should I take care of him? We should get rid of sources of trouble in advance.

197
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,000
- I'll be too anxious like this. 
 - No.

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

199
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,930
Are you really going to bring Min Do Hyeok to TikiTaka?

200
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,130
Why can't we?

201
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,320
Keeping him close and looking for Min Do Hyeok's secret helper is also a method.

202
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,570
Matthew, Matthew, Matthew, Matthew.

203
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,700
Matthew, my love.

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,690
 No, there's no time. Let me... 

205
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,020
 Let me make you dinner. 

206
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,660
 The attention on Min Do Hyeok, doing interviews, is causing a syndrome. 

207
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,420
 The clothes Min Do Hyeok wore on his appearance were sold out, and 

208
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,870
 Min Do Hyeok's fashion and kimchi fried rice were top real-time searches. 

209
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,970
 Copying Min Do Hyeok seems to be becoming a trend among people in their 20s. 

210
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,710
 Especially the challenges where you copy Min Do Hyeok's dance and movement 

211
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,080
 are trending, mainly on short-form platforms. 

212
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,810
 Memes about the natural person Min Do Hyeok's return increased explosively. 

213
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,440
 Save, a portal site, is taking a popularity vote on him and Lee Hwi So, the national hero. 
   

214
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,430
What about fact-checks on Director Michelle?

215
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,740
It's true Director Michelle is Song Ji Ah's older sister.

216
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,580
It's also true Song Ji Ah was sentenced as a juvenile criminal.

217
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,410
It was also confirmed that Director Michelle had left for the U.S. after that.

218
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,530
How about the fact that Song Ji Ah gave birth to Shim Joon Seok's child?

219
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,120
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay. Continue checking the facts.

221
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,850
Okay.

222
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,440
Min Do Hyeok.

223
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,540
Seongchan Group heir's entrance is already different.

224
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,620
Did Michelle arrive safely?

225
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,140
Yes. I heard she recovered a lot.

226
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,550
Do Hyeok,

227
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,230
let me ask you one last time.

228
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,490
Are you really going to enter TikiTaka?

229
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,570
I need to find them.

230
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,130
Starting with Chairman Bang's two trillion won...

231
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,500
Also, Hyung, we need to break through Luca's firewall.

232
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,920
So we can take away a powerful weapon from Matthew.

233
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,430
You didn't forget what I requested. Right?

234
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,690
Finding Hannah.

235
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,080
We need to find Hannah before Matthew finds out she's alive.

236
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,450
I got it.

237
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,090
I'll find her for sure.

238
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,760
   

239
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,690
H-Hey, look over there. I-It's dancing.

240
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,120
Hello. I-I'm cool, right?

241
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,810
We welcome you, Min Do Hyeok.

242
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,150
G-Goodness, you even got me flowers. Thank you.

243
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,800
This is a clean area, so rest assured.

244
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,330
TikiTaka will take care of you 24 hours a day.

245
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,940
2-24—

246
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,600
Whoa, b-but this is a bit burdensome, though.

247
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,870
By the way, where is Chairman Matthew?

248
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm very sorry. It must've been so tough for you all this time.

249
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,030
No, you can't. Don't apologize.

251
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,560
N-No, this isn't right!

252
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,300
This isn't your fault, Brother.

253
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,280
You were also wronged by the damned fake news.

254
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,600
Shall we stand up together? One, two, three!

255
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,480
Oh, we agreed to be brothers from now on.

256
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,970
Right, Brother Matthew Lee?

257
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,150
 What the fuck? 

258
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,720
O-Oh, yes, Do Hyeok.

259
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,190
Well, do you like your escort?

260
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,670
Of course, I love it so much!

261
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,160
I guess it feels like I've become a conglomerate?

262
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,590
It feels really burdensome and familiar at the same time.

263
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,190
Was I born to be a conglomerate, you think?

264
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,930
Anyhow, thank you for this great treatment, everyone.

265
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll be at ease for a while even if an army of Shim Joon Seok comes.

266
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,610
Thank you!

267
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,820
Brother, I love you!

268
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
Don't panic, you bastard.

269
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,950
Who are you saying is panicking?

270
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,060
If it's a show you want,

271
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,180
I'll treat you to the greatest show.

272
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,360
Should we do that? Since the reporters are here, a service for the fans.

273
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,190
- A heart? 
 - A heart.

274
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,050
- A heart like this? 
 - Yes.

275
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,480
I love you.

276
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,510
Thank you. I love you.

277
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,220
Min Do Hyeok, Mo Ne will take you to...

278
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,340
where you'll be working.

279
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,370
What—

280
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,810
Wait, Mo Ne? It'd be a great honor for me.

281
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,530
Follow me.

282
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,730
How does it feel to live as K's servant?

283
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,880
I guess it's not as good as I expected.

284
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,310
You're trembling right now.

285
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,980
Is it me you fear, not K?

286
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,960
Because I came back alive when you thought I'd be in hell.

287
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,190
Shut up.

288
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
Did it feel good?

289
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,160
To side with K and even offer him Chairman Bang's money?

290
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,470
How pathetic.

291
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,200
Pretending to be a happy top star while maintaining your lousy life.

292
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,270
No one has the right to criticize me.

293
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,980
In front of death, you can give loyalty to the dogs.

294
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,800
You feared dying so much that you abandoned your own daughter?

295
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,770
I'm talking about Noh Hannah.

296
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,810
Why would you bring that up?

297
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,570
She's got nothing to do with me.

298
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,140
I think K would think differently if he found out you deceived him.

299
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,300
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

300
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,640
My choice is still the same even if we go back a year.

301
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,630
I'm always my top priority.

302
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,230
Nothing changes just because you come back alive.

303
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,370
What kind of situation is this now?

304
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
Please come this way.

305
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,210
My guide ends here. Get out.

306
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,412
 You'd better stop! 

307
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:23,412
   

308
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:39,172
I protected my face today.

309
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,522
I told you, right?

310
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:42,762
You're a genius!

311
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:47,102
Your ideas are becoming more innovative by the day.

312
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:50,192
I came in late on purpose to avoid those morons.

313
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:55,332
But I do have to admit, those people who are determined to egg me every morning

314
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:57,862
have some passion.

315
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,442
Please get changed first.

316
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:04,402
The very important guest will arrive soon!

317
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,242
No, no, no!

318
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,112
I'd look more pitiful this way, won't I?

319
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,672
But still, the eggs—

320
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:18,392
Please excuse me.

321
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,482
Oh, Chairman Matthew.

322
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:26,252
It's all because of that bastard.

323
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:30,812
Because that bastard Joon Seok came back alive, I go through this every day.

324
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:32,452
You know, Chairman Matthew. Right?

325
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:36,362
That bastard and I have nothing to do with each other.

326
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:38,752
Of course, I know very well.

327
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,672
It must be so tough on you.

328
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:43,152
Gosh, I'm sorry.

329
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:49,572
By the way, I guess you're also allergic to eggs, huh?

330
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,502
That annoying bastard had it, too.

331
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,112
 Also, you can hand over all other subsidiaries, 

332
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:58,942
 but make sure to keep S-Talk by any means. 

333
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:01,972
Anyhow, I've made up my mind.

334
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:07,432
I'm going to sell the rest of the subsidiaries to you as well, Chairman Matthew.

335
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:11,432
Then the public opinion about me would improve a bit. Right?

336
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:15,132
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of eggs now.

337
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,112
 How idiotic, Aunt. 

338
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,452
 I'd be thankful if you'd do that. 

339
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:23,102
I don't plan to live in Korea anymore, anyway.

340
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:27,172
What I want is cash.

341
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,732
You're going to raise the selling price?

342
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:35,432
Whoa, so, so bright! You're so smart!

343
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,862
TikiTaka isn't the only one after S-Talk.

344
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:44,902
One hundred billion won, exactly twice the price you offered.

345
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:49,102
With that, I'll seal the deal even tomorrow.

346
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:54,782
Okay?

347
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:56,622
Of course.

348
00:23:57,432 --> 00:24:02,412
Gosh, what a macho man. You're so cool.

349
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:07,222
With your luxurious style, you're totally my type.

350
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:13,132
 Joon Seok, hurry up and bite the bait. 

351
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,582
How was the reunion with your old comrade?

352
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:25,572
I intentionally gave you two some time.

353
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:28,962
If you think I'm Min Do Hyeok's helper, you're totally wrong.

354
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:33,602
The company lost big time because you convinced Matthew to cancel the movie's launch.

355
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,972
How will you make up for that loss?

356
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,912
With Hwang Chan Seong.

357
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:40,562
What?

358
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,382
Oh, didn't Matthew tell you?

359
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,972
Matthew got a meeting scheduled with Hwang Chan Seong, thanks to me.

360
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:50,672
That's how you changed Matthew's mind, huh?

361
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:55,712
If you want to defeat someone, you have to show something the other can't do.

362
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:59,042
You couldn't do it no matter what, but it was quite easy for me.

363
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,082
Because I'm Han Mo Ne.

364
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,652
Exactly.

365
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:05,402
Matthew won't trust you because you're Han Mo Ne.

366
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,372
You're a card he'll use and discard anyway.

367
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,182
Your role is just to get him connected to Hwang Chan Seong.

368
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:17,872
That's why I'm going to become Scheherazade from the "Arabian Nights."

369
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:20,182
The main character of the story is Hwang Chan Seong.

370
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:23,612
Matthew will continue to need Hwang Chan Seong.

371
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,832
I'm going to stay here for a bit.

372
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:30,162
I've got some time until the commercial shoot.

373
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:34,182
Oh, I could ask you for a cup of coffee. Right?

374
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:36,892
Of course.

375
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,172
Take your time and enjoy.

376
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:56,882
I'm sorry for the lukewarm coffee.

377
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,652
That crazy bitch!

378
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,632
Ta-da!

379
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:11,232
This is what TikiTaka's Children Home prepared for Min Do Hyeok.

380
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:15,052
Here. If you press the button on this protective bracelet,

381
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:19,612
you'll be directly connected to a nearby police station and Chairman Matthew.

382
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:25,062
 You're telling me I get connected to Chairman Matthew if I just press this button. Right? 

383
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:26,792
 Well, that's right. 

384
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,172
Can I check how well it functions, then?

385
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,982
Right now?

386
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:35,322
Chairman!

387
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:39,042
 P-Please spare me. P-Please— 

388
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:42,742
 Stop it, Shim Joon Seok. Shim Joon Seok! 

389
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,512
W-Wait, why—

390
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:47,202
That crazy bastard!

391
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:59,192
   

392
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:10,202
Wow, isn't this taking him too long?

393
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:14,812
Could he really protect me from Shim Joon Seok like this?

394
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:18,582
He's taking too long. Right? But let's hang in there and wait for him.

395
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,202
   

396
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,182
This is nuts. Ten minutes passed.

397
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,482
What's going on?

398
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:36,242
Chairman!

399
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:38,792
Dad, you're late.

400
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,302
Do Hyeok. Are you okay?

401
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,762
   

402
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:48,762
I'm not okay. If you take your sweet time to arrive after 10 minutes, I'd already be...

403
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:50,942
long dead!

404
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:53,242
Brother, l-look at that CCTV over there!

405
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:59,112
I'm so anxious about those. What if Shim Joon Seok hacked into them to watch me?

406
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,802
I'm so scared of Shim Joon Seok, you hear?

407
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:04,912
G-Get rid of these CCTVs right away.

408
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:08,132
- Why are there so many CCTVs? 
 - Okay.

409
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:09,932
What are you doing? He said to get rid of the CCTVs.

410
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:12,222
This bothers me, too. I'm not going to wear it.

411
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:15,332
He might have hacked into it.

412
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:18,312
Hurry up and get rid of them! I said I am really scared!

413
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:21,842
Y-Yes, please hurry up and get rid of them.

414
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:30,132
J-Jeong—

415
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:34,102
J-J is right here. It's "J" and...

416
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:38,272
I-It's "Eo," so press this and...

417
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,142
O... O...

418
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,712
You've never used a computer before?

419
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:45,282
Oh, yes. I've only played games on a computer.

420
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:48,752
Leave it. We'll finish it after lunch.

421
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:52,662
Yes, I'll try focusing on playing games, then.

422
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:56,052
- Let's go and get lunch. 
 - Yes.

423
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:08,722
Wait! This is a knife-only room, but he shot me with a sniper—

424
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:11,082
Oh, this one doesn't have a mic, huh?

425
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,622
Gosh, I can't do anything because I can't type fast—

426
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,722
Please enjoy your lunch.

427
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:24,832
   
   

428
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,092
   

429
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:29,952
   

430
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:33,902
   

431
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:36,102
   
   

432
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,762
   

433
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:05,902
   

434
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:10,202
   

435
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:13,492
Isn't he a total idiot?

436
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:16,412
Is he really Shim Yong's biological son?

437
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:35,602
   

438
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,292
   

439
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:52,642
   

440
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,972
Here you go, Madam.

441
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,442
I love this time of the day.

442
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:14,672
I take care of my skin and have a productive talk about the future with you.

443
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,742
Oh, doesn't the Mayor say you look different?

444
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:22,762
I was going to tell you. The Mayor, who never says things like that,

445
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:26,032
touched my face for no reason, saying my skin got better.

446
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:28,322
Oh, my. And then?

447
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:30,642
He asked if there was one for him, too.

448
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,532
I'll get you one for the Mayor, too.

449
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:38,702
My goodness. You sure know how to be supportive.

450
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:41,752
Yes, Honey. It's me.

451
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:44,542
I'm with Myeong Ji right now.

452
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,022
Yes, yes.

453
00:31:47,022 --> 00:31:48,832
 Get out of there now. 

454
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:51,362
 - There's a rumor about Chairman Matthew.  
 - What?

455
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,932
 We need to distance ourselves from Deputy Mayor Yang, too. 

456
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:55,842
I got it.

457
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:00,462
Something came up suddenly, so I need to go.

458
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,632
Madam!

459
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,542
Take this with you.

460
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,712
No, it's okay.

461
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:15,312
I got it.

462
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:20,442
   

463
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:22,242
   

464
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:26,372
   

465
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:31,652
Did you want to see me, Mayor?

466
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:33,082
Take a look at this.

467
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,722
Yes.

468
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,882
   

469
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:40,652
   

470
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:44,492
Do you still believe this fake news?

471
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:48,202
It was proven to the world that Chairman Matthew is Lee Hwi So.

472
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:51,162
I suddenly had this thought.

473
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:55,712
Why did Chairman Matthew bother to make you State Affairs Deputy Mayor

474
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:59,432
when you were a meager entertainment company owner?

475
00:32:59,432 --> 00:33:03,272
He even donated a large amount of money to me.

476
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,402
Chairman Matthew is supporting you as the next president.

477
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,302
   

478
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,422
That's why I'm telling you this.

479
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:18,392
I feel Chairman Matthew will be an obstacle in my path to the presidency.

480
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:23,182
I'll have you resign from the State Affairs Deputy Mayor position due to personal circumstances.

481
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:25,582
You can vacate your seat starting tomorrow.

482
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:30,552
You're going to cut ties with Chairman Matthew?

483
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:34,922
You'll have to give back the donations you received so far.

484
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,932
I'm sure Chairman Matthew doesn't want that, either.

485
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:42,172
If people find out he gave me political funds,

486
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:46,092
It'll do great damage to his image as a national hero.

487
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,112
   

488
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,632
The mayor's wife was acting weird.

489
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:52,912
She got a call from the mayor and suddenly got up and left!

490
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:55,882
The mayor is the same.

491
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:59,652
   
   

492
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:02,422
All the articles are getting a crazy number of comments.

493
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:06,312
"Is Chairman Matthew really Lee Hwi So? Is he telling the truth?"

494
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,692
The IDs are different, but they all say the same thing.

495
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:10,232
This isn't an amateur's work.

496
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:13,602
He's using a macro to comment.

497
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,972
What about Min Do Hyeok?

498
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:17,002
He played games all day.

499
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:22,812
I told him to write a document, and he couldn't even type a single letter. He's a total moron.

500
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,712
 This one's too skilled. 

501
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,662
 If it's not Min Do Hyeok... 

502
00:34:30,662 --> 00:34:33,412
 No, Lee Hwi So is dead. 

503
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,222
We need to strike the mayor.

504
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:37,322
If Yang Jin Mo resigns from the State Affairs Deputy Mayor position,

505
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:39,522
our future plan will be obstructed.

506
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,112
Do you have a solution?

507
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,302
Of course.

508
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:50,142
We've finally got a reason to put Children Home's database to good use.

509
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:56,942
 Use the Mayor of Seoul's fingerprint registered on Children Home 

510
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,942
 to expose a bribery corruption. 

511
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:02,622
   
 Right! That's one thing we can do. 

512
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,522
   
   

513
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,312
   

514
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,882
   

515
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,242
   

516
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,032
   

517
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,762
   

518
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:23,482
   

519
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:28,222
This is it!

520
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:36,002
Yes!

521
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:39,202
 How was your meeting with K? 

522
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:40,412
I killed it.

523
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:44,432
I wish you could've seen his face when he got so annoyed, Hyung.

524
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:45,682
 What about Hannah? 

525
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:48,212
Hyung, don't get disappointed yet. You'll meet her soon.

526
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,742
 Do Hyeok. D-Do Hyeok. 

527
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:54,332
Hyung-Hyung, can you hear me? Hello?

528
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:57,192
- Hyung! 
  - Do Hyeok- 

529
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,042
 Min Do Hyeok. 

530
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:02,342
 Congrats on making it out alive. 

531
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:03,702
Who are you?

532
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:06,302
 - Medusa.  
 - Medusa?

533
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:10,322
 I could become your enemy or an ally in the future. 

534
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,302
What do you want from me?

535
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:14,092
 Matthew's death. 

536
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:16,332
 And Geum Ra Hee's death as well. 

537
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:17,672
What?

538
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:20,892
 You must do as I say from now on. 

539
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:22,982
 You're not allowed to refuse. 

540
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,102
 If you don't obey me, you'll be eliminated at any given point. 

541
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,852
And why should I do that?

542
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,222
 Because your life is in my hands. 

543
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:42,432
 Just like now. 

544
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,982
 Was that enough of an answer? 

545
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:48,992
 Let me give you one reason to trust me. 

546
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:53,782
A scandal that will shock the political world will break out tomorrow.

547
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:56,202
 What scandal? 

548
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:58,112
A scandal on the Mayor of Seoul.

549
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:01,212
 TikiTaka's Secret Talk isn't secret. 

550
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:03,452
 And you have to expose that. 

551
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:07,002
 Today's conversation is a secret between us. 

552
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:08,832
 Kang Ki Tak can't know about it, either. 

553
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:11,802
 They know Ki Tak is alive. 

554
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:13,362
 Don't forget my warning. 

555
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:17,542
 I'll contact you again tomorrow at this time. 

556
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:19,892
 Do Hyeok, what happened? 

557
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,952
 Could it be that K found out? 

558
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:23,482
 What happened? 

559
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:27,182
No, H-Hyung. I think there was a connection error.

560
00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:29,842
I-I'll contact you again later, Hyung.

561
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,922
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

562
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:44,272
   

563
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,622
Min Do Hyeok,

564
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:56,172
our secret cooperation begins now.

565
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:01,812
In order to take down K.

566
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:09,632
It's really an honor to meet you.

567
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:12,322
I really wanted to meet you.

568
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,322
The honor's mine, to be honest.

569
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:19,952
I get to drink coffee with a national hero like this.

570
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:21,532
The reason I wanted to meet you is—

571
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,492
Oh, I don't really care.

572
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,282
Let me get straight to the point.

573
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:33,512
Han Mo Ne, do you want to model for Save?

574
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:37,132
We conducted a survey on the most compatible model for Save's commercial.

575
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,072
And Mo Ne received the most votes.

576
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:47,062
If you give me a chance, I should think about it.

577
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,982
Of course, Mo Ne will also positively—

578
00:38:54,472 --> 00:38:56,402
Yes, hello?

579
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:01,032
All right. I'll be on my way.

580
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:07,142
There's an emergency briefing at Seoul City Hall.

581
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:08,792
It looks like I'll have to leave.

582
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:12,502
Oh, sure. Of course, you should.

583
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:14,802
Now, then.

584
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:19,722
Right.

585
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:26,162
I think there's an event you'd also be quite interested in.

586
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:33,252
I've granted your request with this, Mo Ne.

587
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:42,422
Check the facts as quickly as you can.

588
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:47,672
What a fucking asshole!

589
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,932
It looks like Yang Jin Mo ignited the case against the Mayor of Seoul.

590
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:59,232
Those who oppose me will only receive punishments.

591
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,652
Don't worry.

592
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:04,632
I'll make sure to dig out Hwang Chan Seong's weakness.

593
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:09,452
    
 - Deputy Mayor! 
 - One word, please!

594
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:11,842
Please give us a response on Mayor Jang Jin Goo of Seoul!

595
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,402
Is it true Mayor Jang Jin Goo, mentioned to be the next presidential candidate,

596
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,862
lobbied powerful figures with paintings?

597
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:19,582
Is it true Si Han Gallery, under the Mayor's wife's management,

598
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:22,662
was used to launder slush funds?

599
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:24,192
It's still only a rumor. It could be his wife's sole doing.

600
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,452
It's still only a rumor. It could be his wife's sole doing.

601
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:30,182
We'll respond strongly to fake news until the truth is uncovered.

602
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:34,312
Both Mayor Jang and his wife's fingerprints were found on the evidence the police seized.

603
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:36,452
Doesn't this mean the mayor was directly involved?

604
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:39,672
The investigation is ongoing. We'll await the police's announcements.

605
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:42,482
I have nothing more to say. Now, then.

606
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,372
 Are you trying to hide the truth? 

607
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:49,752
 Matthew, I'm doing all of this for myself, not for you. 

608
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:53,042
 I'll use you and become the Mayor of Seoul, no matter what. 

609
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,692
 That's how I'll get a chance to crush you. 

610
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:59,722
Chairman Matthew, it went as we wanted.

611
00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:05,592
Mayor Jang Jin Goo will be cast out today.

612
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:16,522
   

613
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:18,832
 The Mayor of Seoul's scandal. 

614
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:21,372
 It's just as Medusa said. 

615
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:23,952
 How did they know this in advance? 

616
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,972
   

617
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:41,032
What is it?

618
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:44,462
Before you go to Save, Chairman Matthew wants to see you first.

619
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:47,152
Tell him to forget it. I'm busy.

620
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:52,192
But your son will be in serious trouble, then.

621
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:55,092
   

622
00:41:55,092 --> 00:42:00,902
 Did you know your son, who attends an international school, is a bully? 

623
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:07,662
If this Secret Talk is exposed, I don't know if your son will have a future.

624
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:11,112
Forget taking the college exam. He obviously couldn't even apply to colleges.

625
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,822
And he'll fail to get a job every time.

626
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:19,432
He'll live the rest of his life as a school violence offender.

627
00:42:19,432 --> 00:42:23,792
Thanks to having such a famous father.

628
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,612
Did you dig into my son's messages?

629
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:32,452
Wasn't Secret Talk supposed to be confidential?

630
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:36,782
Also, you plotted the painting lobby. Right?

631
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:39,142
What do you want?

632
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:43,612
Admit to everything and resign.

633
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:46,922
And the money you accepted from me all this time...

634
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:49,372
Just give it back.

635
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:01,732
It's a butterfly.

636
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:06,162
It's a flower.

637
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:22,372
 She said she was going to catch a butterfly. But what's taking her so long? 

638
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,382
Please help!

639
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:49,022
Grandma! Grandma, I'm here!

640
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:51,282
Grandma!

641
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:01,812
Grandma, over here! I'm here!

642
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:06,242
Grandm!, Grandma! Grandma—

643
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:12,162
- Grandma! 
 - I'll come to you.

644
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:14,802
I'm here.

645
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:17,762
Grandma.

646
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:20,452
Grandma!

647
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:24,622
Grandma...

648
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:38,892
 My baby. 

649
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:40,942
 Just hang in there. I'm sorry. 

650
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:43,202
 It's my fault. 

651
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:47,932
   

652
00:44:49,882 --> 00:44:52,082
How did she end up like this?

653
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:56,322
 A venomous snake bit her. 

654
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,192
 I said a venomous snake bit her. 

655
00:44:58,192 --> 00:45:01,902
A snake? Oh, okay. I understand.

656
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,032
Are you the child's family?

657
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:07,312
Please write down her name and her identification number here.

658
00:45:09,492 --> 00:45:14,282
 No matter what happens, you can't let other people see her. 

659
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:19,252
 You can't even speak our names. 

660
00:45:19,252 --> 00:45:23,172
 Not my name, nor Hannah's name. 

661
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,842
You don't know the child's name?

662
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:39,902
   

663
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,432
Ma'am.

664
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,852
How are you related to that child?

665
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:06,222
M-Me?

666
00:46:08,942 --> 00:46:15,002
   

667
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,012
Her grandmother?

668
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:22,242
But you don't even know her name?

669
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,302
You're lying. Right?

670
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:26,462
You took her from someone else to make her work. Right?

671
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:30,932
You'll have to come with us.

672
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:32,792
You can talk at the station.

673
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,602
   

674
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:39,552
   

675
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:41,402
   

676
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,612
Hello?

677
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:46,012
 This is Sampyeong Police Station. There's a grandmother who wanted to video call you. 

678
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,002
 One moment, please. 

679
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:55,522
What's the matter? Why are you at the police station?

680
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,182
Why are you there, Mom?

681
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:00,632
 Hannah got hurt. 

682
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:01,872
What?

683
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:07,712
 I took her to the hospital, but the police came and wanted Hannah's name. 

684
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:11,072
I'll be right there, so don't say a word.

685
00:47:11,072 --> 00:47:14,842
- You got it? 
  - Yes. 

686
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:24,752
Where are you rushing off to?

687
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:30,592
I forgot I had a massage appointment.

688
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:55,362
Wait! Are you Han Mo Ne?

689
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:59,652
Hello, I'm her legal guarantor.

690
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,542
She's definitely not a kidnapper.

691
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:06,332
Even if you guarantee her, she can't even tell me the name of the child she lives with.

692
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:09,532
- The social worker will be here soon. 
 - Sorry?

693
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:13,612
You can't tell him.

694
00:48:14,762 --> 00:48:18,002
The child's name is Hannah. Noh Hannah.

695
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:23,312
She became an orphan after losing her mother recently, so I'm sponsoring her.

696
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,472
Hannah...

697
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:31,072
 Did something happen? 

698
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:33,562
 It's a matter of time before Hannah's existence is revealed. 

699
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:36,062
 I'll have to strike first. 

700
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:42,032
Yes.

701
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:47,692
What? Hannah, that brat is alive?

702
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,512
We need to catch Hannah right now.

703
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:55,192
If Min Do Hyeok finds out, he'll use Hannah to expose your identity.

704
00:48:56,972 --> 00:49:00,782
Who was hiding that brat all this fucking time?

705
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:02,602
It was Mo Ne.

706
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:06,152
Mo Ne's biological mother was living with Hannah.

707
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,702
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

708
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:09,932
Where are you right now?

709
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:15,032
- Where is she? 
 - Over there.

710
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:20,182
They removed the poison, but she won't wake up.

711
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:40,362
Is this where you get your massage?

712
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:47,262
If you're looking for Hannah, she's not here.

713
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:57,692
You already told Matthew everything?

714
00:49:57,692 --> 00:50:01,752
Would I miss the perfect chance to get rid of you?

715
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,462
Where's our Hannah?

716
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,372
See you later, kid.

717
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:23,152
Where's our Hannah?

718
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:31,532
As soon as you get out of here, hide away somewhere. Okay?

719
00:50:32,202 --> 00:50:35,182
And don't ever come back. Okay?

720
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:37,832
Go hide away anywhere!

721
00:50:46,602 --> 00:50:52,082
I won't. Hannah's going to look for her grandmother!

722
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,052
Calm down!

723
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,682
Calm down and listen to me!

724
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,932
I'm going to find Hannah.

725
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,432
You need to stay alive to meet the kid!

726
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:32,892
 Is Nam Cheol Woo on duty today? 

727
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:12,742
 Min Do Hyeok, find Noh Hannah right now. 

728
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:14,402
How do you know Noh Hannah?

729
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:16,242
Matthew is going after Noh Hannah.

730
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:18,192
The location is Sampyeong Public Health Clinic.

731
00:52:18,192 --> 00:52:19,282
Sampyeong Public Health Clinic?

732
00:52:19,282 --> 00:52:22,652
 Go rescue Hannah right now. 

733
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:36,292
 Han Mo Ne, this is the beginning of the fire pit. 

734
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:38,112
 Meet the consequences you deserve. 

735
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:41,512
 Instead, I'll protect Hannah. 

736
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:47,932
What's the matter?

737
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,652
I found Hannah. I think Matthew found out about Hannah.

738
00:52:50,652 --> 00:52:52,142
What?

739
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:57,262
   

740
00:52:57,262 --> 00:52:59,382
That's Hannah right there.

741
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:08,562
Baek Ik Ho took Hannah.

742
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:10,802
Confirm one more time.

743
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:14,542
   

744
00:53:17,222 --> 00:53:18,832
This is near Gimpo.

745
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,792
This is the way to K's secret vacation home.

746
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:24,962
We have to get there before Matthew, no matter what.

747
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:26,952
There's no time.

748
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:31,982
You're sure we got Noh Hannah. Right?

749
00:53:31,982 --> 00:53:33,572
Yes.

750
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:21,402
What's that?

751
00:54:22,252 --> 00:54:24,532
Who the fuck are you?

752
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,412
What happened?

753
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:57,702
How fucking childish.

754
00:54:57,702 --> 00:54:59,822
Where's the girl?

755
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:02,372
Where the fuck is the girl?

756
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:05,632
We were played.

757
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:08,162
You fucking morons!

758
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:14,762
Who was it? Who took her away?

759
00:55:14,762 --> 00:55:19,192
It was Min Do Hyeok. And I couldn't get a good look at the other one.

760
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:22,842
He was very strong. We couldn't really do—

761
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,182
I'm sorry.

762
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:27,452
That's your excuse?

763
00:55:28,732 --> 00:55:30,552
Our information was leaked.

764
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:33,502
It means someone is colluding with Min Do Hyeok.

765
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:39,232
Han Mo Ne.

766
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:43,612
Bring me Han Mo Ne.

767
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:45,332
Sorry?

768
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,102
Didn't you hear me?

769
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,822
Bring me your fucking sister!

770
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:52,292
Yes, I-I understand.

771
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,612
Do Hyeok.

772
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:13,412
Hannah, are you awake?

773
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,302
Don't be scared.

774
00:56:15,302 --> 00:56:18,302
We're your mom's friends.

775
00:56:18,302 --> 00:56:21,752
You saw her with me in front of your house. Right?

776
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:23,942
 Mom! 

777
00:56:25,372 --> 00:56:27,552
 Why did you come out in the cold? 

778
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:32,462
 Mister, who are you? 

779
00:56:33,382 --> 00:56:36,222
 I'm a very close friend of your mom. 

780
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:42,482
But where's my grandma?

781
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,742
Hannah, we're also looking for her.

782
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:49,512
Do you know where your grandmother might be?

783
00:56:49,512 --> 00:56:51,172
Huh?

784
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:54,612
The country home in Sampyeong.

785
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:57,582
I had made a promise to Grandma.

786
00:56:57,582 --> 00:57:01,312
We said we'd meet at our home, regardless of where we separated.

787
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:04,502
Grandma said she'd wait there.

788
00:57:23,842 --> 00:57:26,182
Grandma!

789
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:41,102
Grandma, I made you worry a lot. Right?

790
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,412
I'm so sorry.

791
00:57:46,322 --> 00:57:49,912
It's all okay.

792
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:52,512
Grandma!

793
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,962
 Do Hyeok! 

794
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:03,682
 My son! 

795
00:58:06,802 --> 00:58:10,672
 You didn't come home for days. What have you been doing? 

796
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:12,702
 I missed my son so much. I thought my eyes would pop out. 

797
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:16,062
 You were sitting on the steps and waiting for me again, huh? 

798
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:16,992
 I told you not to do that. 

799
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:19,392
 Your knees will wear out and suffer when you grow old! 

800
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:20,992
 What does it matter? 

801
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:23,652
 It's fine as long as you're back in one piece. 

802
00:58:23,652 --> 00:58:25,942
 That's all I need. 

803
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:32,322
 I will always be waiting until you come back. 

804
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,182
 M-My mom and my brother are inside. 

805
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,272
 Let go! 

806
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,852
 Mom! 

807
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,972
 Mom. 

808
00:58:56,982 --> 00:59:01,212
These men saved me.

809
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:13,352
Y-You're—

810
00:59:13,352 --> 00:59:19,432
Ma'am, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

811
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:24,992
In the future, Hannah will become the most famous child in Korea.

812
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:28,542
Because I made it look like Shim Joon Seok kidnapped Hannah.

813
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,952
This is the only way to save Hannah.

814
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:34,792
Making her into a child Chairman Matthew can't dare mess with.

815
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:40,092
Making her famous enough for everyone in this world to recognize.

816
00:59:42,282 --> 00:59:46,702
Hannah, things might become tougher in the future. However,

817
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:51,972
for you to live safely with your grandmother, you have to go through it once.

818
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:56,512
But if you don't want me to, I'll stop it right now.

819
00:59:58,772 --> 01:00:01,302
I can do it.

820
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:03,512
I'll do anything.

821
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:13,652
I need to do whatever you tell me to do if I want to live happily with Grandma.ight?

822
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:17,712
I can do it. I really can.

823
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:21,302
All right, Hannah.

824
01:00:21,302 --> 01:00:23,312
In that case,

825
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:26,322
we'll give it a shot.

826
01:00:28,932 --> 01:00:33,282
   
 This is bad. Shim Joon Seok gave a murder notice. 

827
01:00:33,282 --> 01:00:36,232
   
 What the heck is this? I'm Shim Joon Seok! 

828
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,872
 They're deep fake videos! 

829
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:44,602
 Lee Hwi So. 
   

830
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:51,402
 I've got Noh Hannah, whom you're sponsoring. 

831
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:56,392
 I heard you cherish that child especially a lot. 

832
01:00:56,392 --> 01:01:01,072
 I registered Noh Hannah's information on TikiTaka today. 
   

833
01:01:01,072 --> 01:01:04,612
 So find her if you can. 
   

834
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:08,212
   

835
01:01:18,662 --> 01:01:23,592
   
   

836
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:36,142
Is she that important to you?

837
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:37,952
Why is that?

838
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:43,642
Because she's the daughter of the woman you loved?

839
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:45,182
I need to go out.

840
01:01:45,182 --> 01:01:48,222
Don't go. Stop right there!

841
01:01:48,222 --> 01:01:50,512
If you go out now, I'll tell Matthew everything.

842
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:52,972
That you've been looking for that child continuously.

843
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:57,092
Everything! How you knew she was alive from the beginning!

844
01:01:58,652 --> 01:02:00,842
So don't do anything.

845
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,822
Unless you want to be tied to Mo Ne and be suspected.

846
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,352
Just stay home.

847
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:14,922
 Please don't do anything. 

848
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:17,522
 I don't want to see you get hurt. 

849
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:24,642
   
   

850
01:02:26,802 --> 01:02:29,192
   

851
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:37,272
   

852
01:02:39,662 --> 01:02:42,482
   

853
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,242
   
   

854
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,612
   
   

855
01:03:09,712 --> 01:03:10,572
   

856
01:03:10,572 --> 01:03:11,402
   

857
01:03:11,402 --> 01:03:12,332
   

858
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,862
   

859
01:03:16,512 --> 01:03:19,032
Why don't you make an official statement first?

860
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:20,722
We need to calm the public opinion first.

861
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:23,372
Those fucking assholes at Save!

862
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:27,152
Luca, find Min Do Hyeok.

863
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:30,372
   
 Hacking couldn't be completed. Hacking couldn't be completed. 

864
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:32,782
What? What's wrong with this?

865
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:34,122
   

866
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:38,182
Luca, find out the hacking path used to hack the display board at Gwanghwamun.

867
01:03:40,502 --> 01:03:42,792
   
 Unable to enter the hacking path. 

868
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:44,762
 The path can't be determined. 

869
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:47,882
No way. What's wrong with Luca?

870
01:03:47,882 --> 01:03:50,522
Hold on. Stop using Luca.

871
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:53,282
I think she had spyware installed.

872
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:03,832
 Temporarily... Temporarily... Attempting recovery- 

873
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:06,382
Fuck this shit!

874
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:09,242
Luca has become trash!

875
01:04:16,912 --> 01:04:18,682
It's not Min Do Hyeok's doing.

876
01:04:18,682 --> 01:04:20,982
There's someone...

877
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:24,872
behind Min Do Hyeok.

878
01:04:24,872 --> 01:04:26,912
I know it, too.

879
01:04:26,912 --> 01:04:32,772
There's only one person who can pull off something like this.

880
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:35,072
Lee Hwi So.

881
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,232
 You'll have many people to fight against from now on. 

882
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:44,542
 Lee Hwi So, who's already dead, and Shim Joon Seok, yourself. 

883
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:50,412
 You'll probably have a bloody fight with those non-existent delusions. 

884
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:22,172
Tell me where Min Do Hyeok is.

885
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:24,542
Who's behind Min Do Hyeok?

886
01:05:25,272 --> 01:05:27,462
Is it Lee Hwi So?

887
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:32,502
I don't know. I really don't know anything.

888
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:35,262
Lies.

889
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:38,532
She won't spill it so easily anyway.

890
01:05:39,262 --> 01:05:40,902
Just kill her.

891
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,002
She'll only be an obstacle to our plans.

892
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:49,542
You asked for your death.

893
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:53,712
I'll send your mom to where you'll be soon, so you won't be lonely.

894
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:56,312
Please don't! You can't do that!

895
01:05:56,312 --> 01:05:58,392
D-Don't do anything to my mom.

896
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:01,902
She can't even speak, and she's just a powerless old lady.

897
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:06,452
She's a poor woman who lived in hiding because of me!

898
01:06:06,452 --> 01:06:09,902
Han Cheong Soo, hurry up and say something!

899
01:06:14,162 --> 01:06:18,362
There's no need to hesitate. Kill her. Right now.

900
01:06:33,742 --> 01:06:36,192
