1
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,785
   

2
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:50,545
   

3
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,495
   

4
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:55,865
Min Do Hyeok, I'll fucking kill you.

5
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,610


6
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:38,255
- Do Hyeok! 
 - Hyung, get going right away.

7
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:40,265
Do Hyeok!

8
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:51,665
Yang Jin Mo, that son of a bitch, ruined my plan until the end!

9
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,590
My goodness.

10
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:58,405
Min Do Hyeok, you're dead today.

11
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,985
 A car accident report has been submitted. 

12
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,555
 A police car is approaching nearby. 

13
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,345
What?

14
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:08,755
Luca, delete all CCTV footage on National Route 7.

15
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,035
I was never here.

16
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:12,885
Make it so I went home right away from Seoul City Hall!

17
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,195
 It's too late. 

18
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:17,405
 The police already secured some of the CCTV footage. 

19
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,005
Just delete all nearby CCTV footage, then!

20
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,655
All footages that show the car crash!

21
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,195
 Yes, Chairman. It was processed right away. 

22
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,395
I just need Yang Jin Mo dead now.

23
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:29,715
Find out which hospital Yang Jin Mo will be sent to.

24
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,495
- Honey. 
 - Yes, yes.

25
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,325
Please take care of the kids.

26
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,635
You can't open the curtains, and

27
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:20,925
you can't respond even if someone comes.

28
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,775
No one would think you came back home.

29
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,755
I'll be back later.

30
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,505
That was Yang Jin Mo earlier, right?

31
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:30,535
It was clearly Yang Jin Mo.

32
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:34,875
That man couldn't have died in our place, right?

33
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,035
We can't come to any conclusion right now.

34
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,835
Make sure to call me if something comes up.

35
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,515
Yes.

36
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,975
That poor Yang Jin Mo. My heart aches.

37
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:52,315
Gosh, he finally got himself a family, too.

38
00:03:55,815 --> 00:04:00,075
I didn't know I'd owe my life to Yang Jin Mo, of all people.

39
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,445
Wait.

40
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,045
H-Honey, why are you having so much cold sweat?

41
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,825
Are you nauseous again?

42
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,425
Let's go to the hospital first.

43
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,195
No, I'm okay.

44
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,575
No, no. W-Whoa—

45
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,395
J-Joo Ran. Joo Ran!

46
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:18,435
Wake up. Cha Joo Ran! Honey!

47
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,085
Please make way! We have an emergency patient!

48
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,195
Open the doors, please!

49
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:27,645
   

50
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:32,325
   

51
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,345
How are you feeling? Feeling better?

52
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,145
You scared me.

53
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:55,165
Let's take some cheongsimhwan for now. 
  (Herbal pill that helps ease anxiety.) 

54
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,955
It's fine. I don't need it.

55
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,245
Honey, should I ask Mi Young to

56
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,445
send us a doctor here?

57
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,695
I'm a doctor.

58
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,695
Once named the best doctor of this age,

59
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,475
a gynecologist with 25 years of experience.

60
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:14,155
You think I wouldn't know my illness?

61
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,745
Illness?

62
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,345
I'll cure you.

63
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,535
We just need to cure it. I'll earn the money...

64
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,145
and make sure you get better.

65
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,795
Until the day I die

66
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,425
I'll take care of you.

67
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,235
I'm...

68
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,815
pregnant.

69
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,325
What?

70
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,535
What are you saying?

71
00:05:56,535 --> 00:06:00,425
I delivered babies all my life but never gave birth to one.

72
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,655
So, I didn't catch on, either.

73
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,885
You're going to be a dad.

74
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,725
We'll...

75
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,995
become parents now.

76
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,785
Dad?

77
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,655
D-Dad!

78
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:50,045
The patient was just pronounced brain-dead.

79
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,265
His heart can still be transplanted.

80
00:06:57,035 --> 00:07:00,015
Yang Jin Mo is brain dead.

81
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,915
Great going!

82
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,645
I got rid of one rat that gave me a headache.

83
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:11,515
Keep giving me updates on Min Do Hyeok and

84
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,795
confirm Yang Jin Mo's corpse yourself to make sure.

85
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,605
Luca, call Prime Minister Jang's phone.

86
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:25,285
Gosh, Prime Minister.

87
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:28,915
You're going to ignore my call, huh?

88
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:35,395
Thank you, Yang Jin Mo, the brain-dead patient, for donating his organ.

89
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:40,335
We'll now begin Patient Go Myeong Ji's heart transplant surgery.

90
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,035
Scalpel.

91
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:47,285
Chest incision.

92
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:53,715
Matthew, that bastard, caused another problem.

93
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,465
He even tried to kill Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

94
00:07:56,465 --> 00:08:00,575
We'll also end up in the gutters if we continue to work with him.

95
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:03,465
It's better to just cut ties at this point—

96
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:07,625
I'll be the one to cut ties, not you, Prime Minister.

97
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,435
Come on. Hang up.

98
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,765
How did you find out about the network installation in Gagok District?

99
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,905
Shim Mi Young was here.

100
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:24,255
She even brought evidence.

101
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:26,595
Why didn't you tell me?

102
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,135
What were you going to do with it?

103
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,595
Stop acting stupid.

104
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:34,535
Are you asking because you don't know what I'd do with a hacking network?

105
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:40,045
You really shouldn't have canceled today's press conference.

106
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:44,125
You completely ruined an entrée that was almost done.

107
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,195
You'll have to cover it up yourself.

108
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:48,175
How would I do that?

109
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,235
It's not like running a country is child's play.

110
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,885
Saying this and that.

111
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,465
The people will find it suspicious!

112
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:57,935
You're the one who needs to find the method.

113
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:00,975
Unless you want to die here.

114
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,795
I'm already about to be exposed as Shim Joon Seok.

115
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,665
Nothing would change for me, even if a murder is to be added to the list.

116
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,715
Unless you want to become my last victim,

117
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:15,625
you'll have to squeeze your brains out.

118
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,105
I got it. Okay?

119
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,985
Hold on.

120
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,935
You're the one who should die.

121
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,525
I won't work with you anymore!

122
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,835
Shoot me if you've got the guts.

123
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,415
If I die,

124
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:44,085
Luca will expose all your information right away.

125
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:48,895
Starting with begging me to take down Seoul Mayor Jang Jin Goo, the next presidential candidate,

126
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:53,015
to everything, including gathering members to plan Gagok District.

127
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:59,085
If you want to end your life or your political life,

128
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,345
do as you please.

129
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:15,665
You can aim this gun at Min Do Hyeok now.

130
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,025
That'd mean you'll go with me to the presidential election.

131
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,855
Once you get on my boat, there's no exit.

132
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,695
Oh, there's some good news.

133
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,275
Yang Jin Mo dropped dead.

134
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:33,105
I heard his heart will be transplanted to his wife.

135
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,885
What this means is

136
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:39,165
we just need to fabricate the accident as we've been doing.

137
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:42,235
This much isn't even a workout for us anymore.

138
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,705
All right, then.

139
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:49,475
Could you please give our members a phone call?

140
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:02,155
Schedule an emergency virtual conference in one hour.

141
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,355
The host is Chairman Matthew.

142
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:08,505
Tell all the members to attend.

143
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,085
Also, until you get the order from me,

144
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:15,765
put an embargo on Mayor Yang Jin Mo's death.

145
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,295
Mayor Yang Jin Mo died?

146
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:22,795
 I just confirmed the Seoul Mayor's wife's heart transplant surgery started. 

147
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:26,295
Okay. I'll be there.

148
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,125
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,475
Yang Jin Mo died?

150
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,465
Who's the culprit?

151
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,085
It's Matthew, that bastard. Right?

152
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,725
I'll have to go there to confirm the details.

153
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:44,015
I'm coming with you.

154
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:46,665
I must see if Hannah is safe with my own eyes.

155
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,175
I don't even have the location right now!

156
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,905
I'll go and confirm first.

157
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:59,795
Hey, you killed Yang Jin Mo, huh?

158
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,305
Have you gone mad?

159
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,665
Do you even know what you did?

160
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,555
That's why we need to cover it up together.

161
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,295
If I fall, you're falling, too.

162
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,395
Didn't you know?

163
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:15,175
Are you telling me to assist you with your crime?

164
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:19,485
 If you don't cooperate, I'll have to keep doubting you. 

165
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,895
Come over to my house right now. Let's talk in person.

166
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,205
I have to go see K.

167
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,785
He seems to be suspicious of me after the Lee Hwi So verification.

168
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,235
I'll also find out where Hannah is.

169
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,935
I got it.

170
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,445
Please be careful.

171
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,115
All right.

172
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:07,225
   

173
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:10,115
Please inject blood cardioplegia.

174
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,035
Yes. Injecting blood cardioplegia. Start.

175
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:14,335
Injecting 1,500 ml.

176
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,225
   

177
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:39,875
   

178
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:43,345
What took you so long? I'm so anxious I might die first.

179
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,225
What's Go Myeong Ji's status?

180
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,505
They're in surgery right now.

181
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:50,365
They said she almost died before trying the heart transplant if it took any longer.

182
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:52,415
Did you call the police?

183
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,665
They're negligent.

184
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,915
Not a single coverage when Seoul's mayor is dead.

185
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:01,385
The Prime Minister is now serious about protecting Matthew.

186
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:03,105
That son of a bitch Prime Minister.

187
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,795
He told me he'd cut ties with Matthew right away.

188
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,865
What a scoundrel.

189
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,765
   
 Hwang Chan Seong just got a call and went to Matthew's house. 

190
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,695
 I removed the bug just to be safe. 

191
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:19,295
Hwang Chan Seong went to K's house.

192
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:21,645
He'll follow the Prime Minister's orders, too.

193
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,445
Hyung, there will be a storm of troubles from now on.

194
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:28,335
Those bastards will become even more meticulous and sly.

195
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,755
We must come up with a new plan.

196
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,655
A plan to take them down all at once.

197
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,695
Hey.

198
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,745
Don't you know me?

199
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,265
What a stupid show.

200
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,125
What's the meaning of this?

201
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,305
I need you to cooperate.

202
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:15,775
We don't know if our information is getting leaked.

203
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,205
Are you doubting me?

204
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:21,265
I just can't get over Luca's error from a few days ago.

205
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,345
It doesn't hurt to be safe. Right?

206
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,855
There's nothing unusual.

207
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,835
Wait outside.

208
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:31,145
Let's go in. We've got guests waiting.

209
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:50,485
 The Prime Minister and Attorney General. 

210
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:53,075
 Commissioner General and Director of National Intelligence Service. 

211
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:55,715
 Representatives of the ruling party and the opposition party, too. 

212
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,465
Gentlemen!

213
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,575
This is CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save.

214
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,865
Welcome to the Trillion Family.

215
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:13,865
The people who move Korea are all gathered here, huh?

216
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:18,715
If you're the Trillion Family, does it mean Gagok District's cartel's size is...

217
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,675
one trillion won?

218
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,825
It'll be more than that, probably.

219
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,975
If we take care of this crisis without a hitch.

220
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,435
No need to be scared.

221
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:34,505
Because we're bound by money, which is thicker than blood.

222
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,575
Don't say unnecessary things.

223
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:39,225
Yes.

224
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:41,225
CEO Hwang,

225
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:46,295
I asked to see you because you need to do a job for me.

226
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,825
Please go ahead, Prime Minister.

227
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:55,155
 They're going to try to fabricate Yang Jin Mo's death somehow. 

228
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:59,085
Could it be making you the culprit?

229
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,345
You're right. They'll make me a murderer.

230
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,755
They'll use Aunt's investment in the Gagok District

231
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:08,185
as evidence and claim that Seongchan Group was the core of the cartel.

232
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:11,915
These crazy fucking bastards!

233
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,065
What's the plan?

234
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,875
I'm thinking about helping K have his dream come true.

235
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:22,905
I'm sure you already know Mayor Yang Jin Mo died.

236
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:27,545
You had placed an embargo directly, Prime Minister.

237
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:32,685
Yang Jin Mo's cause of death will be fabricated.

238
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:38,495
Save will have to manipulate public opinion for me.

239
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,825
Will that be possible?

240
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,755
The accident happened during the day.

241
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,205
How are you going to silence

242
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:50,135
Min Do Hyeok, Kang Ki Tak, and the witnesses at the scene?

243
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,555
Why do you think it's impossible?

244
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,125
We have power, authority, and money.

245
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,805
On top of that, we even have Luca.

246
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:01,655
Go Myeong Ji's getting the transplant surgery right now.

247
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:05,385
Once the surgery ends in success, she'll wake up soon.

248
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,855
How are you going to convince Go Myeong Ji?

249
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:10,825
Go Myeong Ji is also a victim you almost killed.

250
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,245
You think I can't keep a woman like her in check?

251
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:18,435
 The culprit who attacked Go Myeong Ji was concluded as Baek Ik Ho. 

252
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,275
 We even got his confession. 

253
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,935
 There will never be a reinvestigation. 

254
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,075
 Baek Ik Ho's trial will also be done without a problem. 

255
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:30,345
 Since the murder of Seoul mayor is a serious case, 

256
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:35,035
 it must be concluded with the least amount of suspicion. 

257
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,445
I have already decided on the culprit.

258
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,615
Min Do Hyeok.

259
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:50,835
For that to happen, Save has to become our reliable reinforcement.

260
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,965
So, Yang Jin Mo's case can be smoothly fabricated.

261
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:57,695
So that Seongchan Group could become history forever.

262
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:01,045
We must join forces.

263
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:04,565
What do you say? Are you going to join?

264
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,485
If it means Min Do Hyeok will become the culprit,

265
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:21,045
there's no reason for me to hesitate.

266
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,495
Are you crazy? Are you going to get locked up or something?

267
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:29,695
What if your life really ends like that?

268
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:31,375
While I'm in the police custody, they'll relax and fabricate the case.

269
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,205
While I'm in the police custody, they'll relax and fabricate the case.

270
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:38,265
After that, those connected by the chains of evil will show up.

271
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:42,595
We'll have to wait and see who is hiding behind K and scheming.

272
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,295
Until they show their main body,

273
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:48,715
I'll prepare the stage for them properly.

274
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:51,905
Are you saying you'll use yourself as bait?

275
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:54,705
Consider it the time of low tide.

276
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,145
Once the filthy, muddy water recedes,

277
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,625
we can see who was swimming naked in there.

278
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:10,805
From now on, this is a fight between

279
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:12,945
Shim Joon Seok and me.

280
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,245
Luca!

281
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,645
 Yes, CEO Hwang. 

282
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,855
Show me the Trillion Family meeting.

283
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:49,285
 Yes, Chairman. 

284
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,515
Luca.

285
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:55,765
Erase my face from every part of the meeting.

286
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,085
 Erasing your face. 

287
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:04,805
What a fucking moron.

288
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,875
You're so obsessed over Min Do Hyeok,

289
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:15,105
you didn't even know I installed a backdoor program. 
  (A covert method of bypassing normal authentication.) 

290
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,775
This makes...

291
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,315
the job way too easy.

292
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,055
 As you ordered, CEO Hwang Chan Seong's face was erased from 

293
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:31,815
 every part of the Trillion Family meeting's recording. 

294
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:51,065
Prime Minister, please lift the embargo.

295
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:55,335
We'll now begin turning Min Do Hyeok into a murderer.

296
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,235
 Breaking news. 

297
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,445
 Mayor Yang Jin Mo, who disappeared before yesterday's emergency press conference 

298
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,895
 on Gagok District was found dead. 

299
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:08,355
 The police said it was an intentional murder disguised as a car accident 

300
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:13,375
 and set up by CEO Min Do Hyeok of Seongchan Group, according to witness testimonies. 

301
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,865
   
First, control the public opinion. 

302
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:17,725
Chairman Matthew, were you really the witness?

303
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,065
   
 Create a trustworthy witness. 

304
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,455
Did you witness it in person?

305
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:27,615
Mayor Yang and I were investigating the cartel behind Gagok District together.

306
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:32,405
We found out Min Do Hyeok and Seongchan Group were at its core.

307
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,885
Min Do Hyeok, once he was cornered,

308
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:38,165
kidnapped Mayor Yang's children to blackmail him.

309
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:42,085
I persistently chased after Min Do Hyeok's car

310
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:45,555
and succeeded in saving Mayor Yang's children.

311
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:47,965
But I failed to save...

312
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:51,105
Mayor Yang.

313
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,625
The children were safely handed over to the police

314
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,055
and they're under protection at a safe house.

315
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:03,555
 This is Min Do Hyeok's wallet, found in Mayor Yang's car. 

316
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:09,425
 Besides this, the police already secured evidence such as fingerprints and hair. 

317
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:12,175
   
 We can just fabricate the evidence. 

318
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,645
Go find the brats as quickly as possible.

319
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,715
They'll be easily found if you track down Cha Joo Ran and Nam Cheol Woo.

320
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,955
Yes, I got it.

321
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:26,395
Min Do Hyeok, you're a rat in the trap now.

322
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:31,435
 It'll be perfected if we just add a bit of a lie. 

323
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:34,695
Save has officially pointed out S-Curi's problems.

324
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:37,055
Could you please provide us with the exact details?

325
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,765
From a security expert's perspective,

326
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,625
S-Curi is nothing more than malware.

327
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,385
People who downloaded S-Curi may see

328
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:46,765
their phones slow down suddenly or be reset.

329
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:50,515
There's also a chance of a personal information breach.

330
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,005
   
   

331
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,595
   

332
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:59,635
Currently, Min Do Hyeok has been arrested for murder allegations.

333
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:04,635
There's no way such a person developed an app with good intentions.

334
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,225
Goodness, how are you doing?

335
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:29,065
Min Do Hyeok, you're under arrest for allegations of murdering Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

336
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:32,585
You have the right to remain silent, and you have the right to an attorney.

337
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:36,415
Detective, what evidence do you even have?

338
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:40,835
We secured the CCTV footage and witness testimonies.

339
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:42,545
Let's go.

340
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,455
Gosh, there's no need for something so inconvenient.

341
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,225
I won't run away.

342
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,655
You know who's lying better than I do.

343
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,875
You'll also be ashamed.

344
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,135
I'll be back, Hyung.

345
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,605
Kang Ki Tak, you'll also be summoned for a material witness statement.

346
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,555
You'll be banned from traveling,

347
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,985
so don't try to run away overseas.

348
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,945
Did you eat yet? You must be hungry.

349
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:04,955
There's a great bean sprout soup place right across the street.

350
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:08,305
Is it true you killed Mayor Yang Jin Mo?

351
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:12,385
Did you murder him out of spite for dismissing the Gagok District development project?

352
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,435
Is Seongchan Group the cartel Mayor Yang mentioned?

353
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:20,195
No, Seongchan Group has never been involved in cartels of any interest.

354
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:24,555
Evidence of former Chairwoman Shim's large investments in Gagok District is surfacing.

355
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,945
Is this a fact?

356
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:27,935
That's right.

357
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:31,245
The former Chairwoman, Shim Mi Young, made the investment.

358
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:33,605
Are you admitting to real estate speculation right now?

359
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:36,125
Why did you kidnap Mayor Yang's children?

360
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,035
If Chairman Matthew didn't save them, what were you going to do to the children?

361
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,205
When did you first plan your crime?

362
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,485
Please answer!

363
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:45,075
Please give us one more word!

364
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:48,295
- Why did you kidnap them? 
 - Hurry up and speak, please!

365
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:58,535
Post the prepared article on Save's main page.

366
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:00,565
Yes, CEO.

367
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:06,375
   

368
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:12,175
K and Hwang Chan Seong, those SOBs.

369
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,945
This is what you were scheming?

370
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:25,715
 Have faith in Do Hyeok and wait. 

371
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,275
Min Do Hyeok.

372
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,285
 Let's meet right now. 

373
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:39,645
 I have something to tell you. 

374
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,345
Why did you want to see me?

375
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:55,285
I saw Hwang Chan Seong access Luca at home.

376
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:56,935
How can Hwang Chan Seong do that?

377
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,315
I don't know.

378
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:01,075
I tried to access it as well, but it didn't work.

379
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:03,345
I think he found out an important thing from Luca.

380
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,975
It must be K's weakness.

381
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:09,515
Luca stores every crime K committed.

382
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:13,015
Everything from Da Mi's death to Yang Jin Mo's death.

383
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:16,775
In that case, if we just expose Luca,

384
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:20,535
we can reveal that K killed Yang Jin Mo.

385
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,605
And Min Do Hyeok will be proven innocent.

386
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,225
However, to access Luca,

387
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,175
you need to know what the encrypted passcode is.

388
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:31,385
And Do Hyeok is the only one who can find out.

389
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,645
We can bring Min Do Hyeok to my house.

390
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:36,075
Would it be difficult, even for a moment?

391
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:38,185
I'll look for a cop we can bribe.

392
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:41,535
K already took over the police.

393
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,545
Don't do anything.

394
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,985
Don't contact me, either.

395
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:49,945
The moment Hwang Chan Seong doubts you, all of us will be in danger.

396
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:53,175
Do Hyeok wouldn't want that, either.

397
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:57,085
No, I'm going to do whatever it takes.

398
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:00,585
If that's the only way to help Min Do Hyeok,

399
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:05,415
I'll get Min Do Hyeok out somehow and sit him in front of Hwang Chan Seong's computer.

400
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:12,115
I guess you're not afraid.

401
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:16,105
Once Luca is exposed,

402
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:19,035
the entire world will also find out...

403
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,065
what you did to Da Mi.

404
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,595
Will you still be okay with that?

405
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:34,075
Let's just think about how to get Min Do Hyeok out.

406
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:16,641
Myeong Ji.

407
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,061
Can you tell who I am?

408
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,001
Do you remember?

409
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:35,271
Myeong Ji, your heart was severely injured

410
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:38,401
because Matthew had shot you.

411
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,501
I remember it.

412
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:48,381
What about the kids?

413
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,611
What about him?

414
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,811
Yang Jin Mo is...

415
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,611
together with you.

416
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:11,661
Together with me?

417
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:33,831
Nothing serious...

418
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:37,451
happened to him. Right?

419
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:40,471
Right?

420
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,811
Please tell me nothing happened.

421
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,601
Calm down.

422
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,801
I...

423
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,701
can't stay for too long.

424
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:52,501
Matthew is going berserk like a lunatic.

425
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,801
Min Do Hyeok became the murderer.

426
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,501
The murderer who killed Yang Jin Mo.

427
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:07,411
Matthew even held Yang Jin Mo's funeral right away.

428
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:18,941
Calm down. You can't get worked up!

429
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:20,671
What about the kids?

430
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,861
Please let me see my kids.

431
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,061
Not right now.

432
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:27,201
What's certain is the kids are safe.

433
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:29,891
I came to tell you that.

434
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:32,311
N-No! No!

435
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:34,791
Take me to my kids!

436
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,881
No!

437
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,781
No!

438
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:44,511
If you're angry and frustrated, do whatever it takes to survive.

439
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:48,081
In this fight, surviving is winning.

440
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:49,731
You have to pull yourself together.

441
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:52,491
That's how you can save your kids.

442
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:55,231
You know what I mean. Right?

443
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:06,641
Hey, the patient woke up.

444
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,831
- What? 
 - Why didn't you call me?

445
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:12,041
Ms. Go, please calm down.

446
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,671
Ms. Go, please calm down.

447
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:15,681
Ms. Go, please calm down.

448
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:17,501
Go Myeong Ji, please calm down.

449
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,091
Go Myeong Ji, can you hear me?

450
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:22,031
Do you have difficulty breathing?

451
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,070
Check her blood pressure first.

452
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:40,021
Hyungnim!

453
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:42,681
- No one's following you. Right? 
 - Yes.

454
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:47,661
These are the borrowed-name accounts Secretary Chae is managing.

455
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,321
Secretary Chae has the key to this case.

456
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:50,461
Where's Secretary Chae?

457
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:53,581
I'm going through the list of officers and dissecting each one in order of hierarchy.

458
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:55,321
It's the same method they used on Lee Hwi So.

459
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,541
They shake up the public opinion with fake news,

460
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:01,641
frame Do Hyeok as a murderer, and cover up their crimes.

461
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:05,441
In one moment, Yang Jin Mo died,

462
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,121
Do Hyeok was arrested,

463
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:09,901
and my company's in ruins.

464
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,581
What's going on over here?

465
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:16,721
What's up?

466
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,581
What did you say?

467
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,871
O-Oh, okay.

468
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,161
It's my hacker.

469
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:25,621
He said the police just placed a public warrant on you on their radio.

470
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:29,111
It's an allegation for installing a network in Gagok District.

471
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:33,191
They're the ones who installed the network. Those rotten bastards!

472
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,421
They'll find this place, too. You have to escape, Hyungnim.

473
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,121
Hurry back to Seongchan Group and protect the chairman's office.

474
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:41,361
Hang in there with all your might from now on.

475
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,301
Do Hyeok told us this.

476
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:47,371
The true form of the evil will surface within 10 days.

477
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,661
It's not too far away now.

478
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:53,471
Let's go.

479
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:04,071
Where did you hide Kang Ki Tak?

480
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,091
Aren't you going home?

481
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,311
I think you haven't gone home for days now.

482
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:11,591
Shit! Stop acting nonchalant.

483
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,171
What makes you think you can behave like this?

484
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:14,961
You're worked up because you're ashamed, huh?

485
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,131
For submitting to a bastard like Matthew.

486
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,371
Why you little!

487
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,111
What do you even know?

488
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:30,701
Whoa! Detective, you're really strong!

489
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,331
But you know I'm right.

490
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,771
T-That's why you can't go home.

491
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,741
Because you're too ashamed to see your kids.

492
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,651
Stroking your kids's hair with your hands that took filthy money and

493
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:42,391
kissing your kids' cheeks with your mouth that spewed lies

494
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:45,571
are quite agonizing to do, actually.

495
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:48,111
Shut your mouth!

496
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,901
If you've got time to be sarcastic, worry about your future.

497
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:53,031
You've become a murderer right now.

498
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:56,071
No one would bat an eye even if I killed you here.

499
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:59,221
The entire nation might actually be happy.

500
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:05,661
Nope. You can never be happy.

501
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:08,981
Because you're Korea's policeman.

502
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,131
Detective Nam Cheol Woo said so.

503
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:14,221
You don't accept any form of bribery.

504
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:18,811
He said you can be trusted.

505
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,291
It was true when I first saw you, too.

506
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,801
 You're not the culprit, though! 

507
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:28,891
 Why would you hurt Go Myeong Ji? What do you gain by this? 

508
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,571
 You're only Matthew's henchman. 

509
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:33,681
 Matthew ordered you to do all this, didn't he? 

510
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:36,231
You can waver,

511
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:39,271
but please don't break.

512
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:44,751
Because I still think you're a decent policeman.

513
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:48,401
Hey, what's with the loud noise?

514
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:52,141
Detective Oh, are you okay?

515
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,391
Lock up Min Do Hyeok in the cell again.

516
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:01,011
What are you doing? Let's go.

517
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:05,821
 The Prime Minister suspended all stock trades on Seongchan Group's S Talk this afternoon. 

518
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,301
 The suspension is indefinite, so normal- 

519
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:12,961
No! A trade suspension so soon?

520
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,521
Stop overreacting.

521
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:16,681
We expected all of this.

522
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:19,971
B-But this can't be.

523
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,311
I came to enforce a search and seize warrant. 
    

524
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:27,811
All right. Go ahead!

525
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,781
All right! Pack every single thing you see here!

526
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,031
- Gosh. 
 - That side, too!

527
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,571
- Pack this thing, too. 
 - You can't!

528
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:37,201
We're not the ones you should search!

529
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:11,101
   

530
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:21,821
   
 No! 

531
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:24,311
I don't want this.

532
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:31,471
How can you leave me behind?

533
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:36,041
What am I going to do by myself without you?

534
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:40,441
What can I do alone?

535
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:43,731
What about the kids?

536
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:54,811
I don't need your heart.

537
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,541
You come back to me.

538
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:03,611
 What's the use of having this heart when I don't have you? 

539
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:05,261
Jin Mo...

540
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:09,981
Jin Mo, come back!

541
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:12,411
Come back!

542
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:25,401
Jin Mo...

543
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:40,671
How can I help you?

544
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,311
I'm Go Myeong Ji.

545
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,261
I'd like to testify as a victim.

546
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:49,811
The one who tried to kill me was Chairman Matthew.

547
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:54,441
I definitely got shot by Matthew in his living room back then.

548
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,541
I was the detective in charge of your case.

549
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,771
You can talk to me.

550
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,831
I...

551
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:09,721
I brought Hannah to Matthew.

552
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:13,121
Because I felt betrayed by my husband.

553
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:15,901
However, it was all a misunderstanding.

554
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:19,551
My husband was trying to protect us from Matthew.

555
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,721
We caught the culprit already.

556
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:26,221
Baek Ik Ho turned himself in.

557
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,061
Baek Ik Ho?

558
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:35,761
He said he tried to kill you because Mayor Yang dismissed the Gagok District project.

559
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:37,831
That's a lie.

560
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,731
Chairman Matthew shot me.

561
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:43,221
Baek Ik Ho carried me out to get rid of me.

562
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:46,281
I clearly remember what happened that day.

563
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:50,571
I-I'm the victim, so why would I lie?

564
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:55,121
It looks like your memory is flawed from staying unconscious for a long time.

565
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,161
That's not the case!

566
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,701
I said I remember everything!

567
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:04,581
Why...

568
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:07,751
Why won't you believe me?

569
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,321
You're a policeman.

570
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,811
If a policeman doesn't help someone like me,

571
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,571
who's going to help me?

572
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:22,431
The case was already turned over to the prosecution.

573
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,171
I'm done talking to you, too.

574
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:29,791
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

575
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,441
I'm going to talk to the prosecutor.

576
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:36,401
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

577
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,541
Didn't Go Myeong Ji come see you?

578
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,781
 She was here. 

579
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:44,311
I was just about to let you know.

580
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,301
She said she was going to go see the prosecutor in charge.

581
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,041
What should I do?

582
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,371
The prosecutor in charge is unnecessarily stubborn, you see.

583
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:53,731
You were also quite famous for being stubborn, Detective Oh.

584
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,211
But look at you now.

585
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,541
 You've become such a sly person. 

586
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,471
I'll take care of the prosecution.

587
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:03,241
You just keep a close watch on Min Do Hyeok.

588
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:06,941
I'll personally check at every hour, sharp.

589
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:08,411
Yes.

590
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:20,231
A stubborn prosecutor, huh?

591
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:24,601
He's still cut from the same cloth in the end.

592
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:30,721
Yes, Prime Minister.

593
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,521
There's a job I need you to do.

594
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:37,461
Please replace the prosecutor in charge with someone on our side.

595
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,541
Hand over the case? This suddenly?

596
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,081
I'm a bit dumbfounded. Who gave the order?

597
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:44,331
It'll only take a minute.

598
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,061
- I have something to tell the prosecutor. 
 - You can't.

599
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:49,551
Please let me in for just a minute—

600
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,061
Prosecutor Kang Ki Joo!

601
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,451
You're Prosecutor Kang Ki Joo. Right?

602
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,581
My name is Go Myeong Ji.

603
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:04,211
Since the victim woke up, shouldn't you hear the victim's testimony first?

604
00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:06,261
According to the procedure—

605
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:08,351
- Go Myeong Ji? 
 - Yes.

606
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,801
I'm Go Myeong Ji.

607
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:11,581
I did hear about the transplant surgery.

608
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:14,541
I was waiting for you to recover.

609
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,301
I'm sorry for what happened to Mayor Yang.

610
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,771
I am sorry for your loss.

611
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,011
The one who killed my husband is also Chairman Matthew.

612
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:24,941
It's not Min Do Hyeok!

613
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:26,751
Chairman Matthew tried to kill me and

614
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,401
ended up killing my husband, too.

615
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:32,261
I'm the victim and the witness.

616
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,941
But why won't you believe me?

617
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:38,961
I'm sorry, but the prosecutor in charge was changed just now.

618
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:41,641
It's not my case anymore.

619
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:43,471
Sorry?

620
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:46,971
What do you mean by that?

621
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:49,011
I don't know the reason, either.

622
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:51,731
I was only notified just now.

623
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:12,781
 This case has a terrible stench. 

624
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:17,311
 I feel you're in for a difficult fight. 

625
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,281
 I'll help you with what I can with my conscience as a prosecutor on the line. 

626
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:24,441
 I don't trust Korea's prosecutors. 

627
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:28,701
 But you'll have to trust me right now. 

628
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:32,071
 Because your opponent has the attorney general on their backs. 

629
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:34,241
 I'll promise you one thing. 

630
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:37,981
 I'm going to take charge of this case until the end, 

631
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,221
 no matter what I have to do. 

632
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:48,511
Chairman Matthew is waiting for you.

633
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,260
   

634
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,671
Welcome!

635
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:01,871
I'm so glad to see you in good health that I'm tearing up.

636
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,821
Son of a bitch.

637
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:06,401
I'll kill you!

638
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:13,401
You aren't going to let Yang Jin Mo's death go to waste, are you?

639
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,921
Shut up, you fucking trash!

640
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,981
Isn't Yang Jin Mo the real trash?

641
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:24,911
Who made a bastard like him into a hero who died while fighting for justice?

642
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:26,151
Where's Noh Hannah?

643
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:28,421
Where did you hide your brats?

644
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,541
I don't know. I know nothing!

645
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,381
I miss them like crazy!

646
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,731
Does it make sense that you don't know where your kids are?

647
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,011
Cha Joo Ran and Nam Cheol Woo disappeared, too.

648
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,861
You know where they are.

649
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:43,601
Shut up and bring my husband back first.

650
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:45,701
Why did you kill him?

651
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:48,481
And you frame Min Do Hyeok?

652
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:52,551
Don't you fear the heavens, you crazy psychopath?

653
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,381
You!

654
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:56,371
Stop pushing your luck.

655
00:44:56,371 --> 00:45:01,481
Your brats' fates will change depending on how you behave from now on.

656
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,961
You think I've got anything to fear?

657
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:10,321
As long as I'm alive, you can't lay a finger on my kids!

658
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:13,461
Let me warn you. Get over Yang Jin Mo's death here.

659
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,421
Stop digging into it anymore.

660
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,311
Min Do Hyeok is the murderer.

661
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:20,641
If you admit that, I'll respect you and your kids

662
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:25,381
as the bereaved family of the righteous Seoul mayor.

663
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:29,991
What if I refuse?

664
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:34,041
In that case, I'll have to edit the scenario a bit.

665
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:38,021
He'll be the corrupt Mayor Yang Jin Mo, who died while fighting over

666
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:40,311
Gagok District with Min Do Hyeok.

667
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:45,121
That'd mean your kids will live the rest of their lives

668
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:47,391
as a corrupt politician's children.

669
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,431
In addition,

670
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:54,431
I also plan to reveal they were born out of an affair with a married man.

671
00:45:54,431 --> 00:45:57,511
Your young ones will be trampled on even before they bloom

672
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,751
and they'll be trashed into the gutter.

673
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:01,871
Will you be okay with that?

674
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:06,981
No one would resent you for keeping quiet about the truth.

675
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:10,981
Because you're only trying to protect your children.

676
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:17,341
You just need to remain as a sad widow who lost her husband.

677
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:56,520
♫  Like shadows in the dark  ♫

678
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:03,720
♫  Stolen nights that hid the truth  ♫

679
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:10,441
 Hurry up and get better so we can share this happiness together. 

680
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:18,360
♫  My life and my mind have been devoured  ♫

681
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,881
♫  It's forever, no, it's passing by  ♫

682
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:27,071
♫  Don't lock up my paradise  ♫

683
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:32,490
♫  Let my pain run wild  ♫

684
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:37,761
♫  All the fire now ignite  ♫

685
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:41,411
♫  I go find you  ♫

686
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:45,101
♫  Don't tell me I have gone too far  ♫

687
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,041
 All right. Here's your tteokbokki. 

688
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,861
 Whoa, it looks delicious! 

689
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:51,371
 Careful, now. 

690
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,751
 Oh, it's hot. 

691
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:56,020
 Is it delicious? 

692
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,090
♫  The day I let you go  ♫

693
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:04,470
♫  I'm just waiting for last goodbye  ♫

694
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:10,751
♫  Never let you go  ♫

695
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:14,651
   
   

696
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:17,161
    
 One, two, three, four.

697
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:22,500
♫  I feel it in the air  ♫

698
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:26,541
♫  Inside a corner  ♫

699
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,131
   

700
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:32,481
♫  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh  ♫

701
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:36,731
♫  O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way  ♫

702
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:41,381
♫  Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright  ♫ 
    

703
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,730
♫  Until the moment comes  ♫

704
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:04,821
I'm interrogating Min Do Hyeok right now.

705
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,951
Did you check?

706
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:11,211
Yes, looks good. You're doing great.

707
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:14,051
I'll call you back in an hour.

708
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,801
Han Mo Ne was here earlier today.

709
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:37,031
She asked me to give this to you, saying it's urgent.

710
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:40,271
 Luca can be accessed in Hwang Chan Seong's house. 

711
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,391
Kang Ki Tak is waiting outside.

712
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:08,501
I'm excited to eat out with you in a long time, Mo Ne.

713
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:11,131
What gave you the idea of eating out?

714
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:14,661
I needed some air because I'm home all the time.

715
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:16,051
What do you want to eat?

716
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:19,071
Just say it, and I'll buy you anything.

717
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:20,691
Right.

718
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:24,521
Let's do some shopping, too.

719
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,911
I like it when you get all dolled up.

720
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:30,121
Shall we do that, then?

721
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,411
I'll go change, then.

722
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:39,741
Sit down and wait for me.

723
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:05,509
Now's the time. Follow me.

724
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:19,589
You have exactly one hour. You must come back before eight o'clock.

725
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:20,779
Thank you.

726
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:23,199
Save your thanks for later when you come back.

727
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:40,859
   

728
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,709
It's to your left at the end.

729
00:51:58,339 --> 00:52:02,199
As you expected, people under the Prime Minister are working as a group.

730
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:04,519
Hwang Chan Seong installed a backdoor program in Luca.

731
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:06,079
If I can figure out the secret code,

732
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,999
we can also access Luca from anywhere.

733
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:10,739
Hyung, we must find the OTP.

734
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:13,359
There's no time. Let's look quickly.

735
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,639
   

736
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,569
Is something wrong?

737
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:26,469
Why? Nothing's wrong.

738
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:29,339
You're a bit different from usual.

739
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,389
How should I put it?

740
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,449
You seem a bit anxious.

741
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,789
No way.

742
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:40,099
Why would I be anxious when I have you?

743
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:43,199
You said Hannah's okay, too.

744
00:52:46,979 --> 00:52:49,689
We need to go back home.

745
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:52,909
There's something I forgot.

746
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:55,709
You don't seem to be in a good condition, either.

747
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,529
I'm really fine.

748
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:01,249
Can't you work later?

749
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:03,019
I even made a reservation at a restaurant, too.

750
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:06,589
No, I must do it right now.

751
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,470
Hyung, I found it!

752
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,759
   
   

753
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:34,779
It'll be over in 10 minutes.

754
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:39,199
We can make it to the police station by eight, then.

755
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:42,539
   

756
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:46,059
It's Han Mo Ne.

757
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:53,070
Hi, I made a reservation for Hwang Chan Seong at 7:30 p.m.

758
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,270
I'd like to cancel.

759
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,089
I'm sorry.

760
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:01,369
Okay, I'll cancel the reservation for you.

761
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:05,759
I think Hwang Chan Seong is coming here.

762
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:08,099
Hurry up. There's no time.

763
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:37,499
I'll make it up to you for canceling today's date.

764
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:40,359
I'll go prepare dinner, then.

765
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:42,459
How's some simple salad?

766
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:45,319
I'm happy with anything you make me.

767
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:27,289
You're not answering?

768
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,970
Chairman Matthew called earlier than expected.

769
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,699
Hurry up.

770
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:42,370
Detective Oh couldn't have betrayed me.

771
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:49,369
Luca, hack into the police station's CCTV.

772
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:52,379
 Yes, I got it. 

773
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:56,509
 - It's me. I went to the bathroom, so I—  
 - Seriously?

774
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:01,269
 Oh, okay. I got it. 

775
00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:37,269
It's done.

776
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:42,189
You must be hungry.

777
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:44,259
Hurry up and come.

778
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,519
Mo Ne.

779
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:56,119
You know I love you a lot. Right?

780
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:04,819
Of course.

781
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:07,799
I'm always thankful for you.

782
00:57:10,479 --> 00:57:14,009
Chairman Matthew doubted you,

783
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:16,719
but I always trusted you.

784
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:23,399
However...

785
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:29,119
the consequence of my love...

786
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,870
is betrayal in the end.

787
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,370
Betrayal, Chan Seong?

788
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,970
What do you mean?

789
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:46,519
You must have a misunderstanding.

790
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:48,769
There was an intruder in our sacred space.

791
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:51,409
My room's CCTV caught all of it!

792
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:56,109
You know who it was better than I do.

793
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,739
How could you?

794
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:10,559
How could you do that to me?

795
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:19,179
I treated you so well.

796
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:22,659
I loved you so much!

797
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:33,069
Min Do Hyeok, that bastard.

798
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,929
I'm really going to kill him.

799
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:39,849
Also, your mother and your brother.

800
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,469
All of them.

801
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:56,879
You have to be punished.

802
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:59,489
You can never leave this house again.

803
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:04,929
You'll rot in this house by my side for the rest of your life!

804
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:11,189
In this room where your mom was confined.

805
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:39,499
You're fucking crazy.

806
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:43,709
You're a complete nutcase.

807
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,389
Did you say that to me just now?

808
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:52,169
Want me to show you what a real nutcase is?

809
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:09,639
With one call from me,

810
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:15,999
your mom will die without a sound at a place where no one can help.

811
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:21,889
Watch clearly with your own eyes how terribly she dies because of

812
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,809
her daughter who broke her promise.

813
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:30,579
No, you can't!

814
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:33,689
No, don't do it!

815
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,570
Where's Yoon Ji Sook right now?

816
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,359
Hold her down right now.

817
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,219
I'm going to kill that bitch myself.

818
01:01:04,149 --> 01:01:07,409
I came in here to kill you.

819
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,609
I don't give a damn what happens to my life!

820
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:15,509
But I won't let you harass my mother and Min Do Hyeok anymore.

821
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:21,609
I've never once loved a monster like you.

822
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:23,449
Please...

823
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:27,339
Please just die!

824
01:01:27,339 --> 01:01:29,469
Y-You—

825
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,559
A monster?

826
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,570
Me?

827
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,839
I won't die alone like this.

828
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:55,129
I'm going to die with you even if I were to die.

829
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,579
Because we'll be together forever.

830
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,470
You're bound to die...

831
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:07,139
by Kang Ki Tak's hands if I'm not around.

832
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:09,269
You didn't know, did you?

833
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:13,959
That fucker is the biological dad of Bang Da Mi.

834
01:02:16,749 --> 01:02:18,249
What?

835
01:02:18,249 --> 01:02:21,439
Rather than get killed by that fucker...

836
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:25,289
just...

837
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:28,529
just...

838
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,939
just die with me.

839
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,329
Kang Ki Tak, you son of a—

840
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:26,469
I love you.

841
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:49,840


842
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:59,200
♫  Let's burn down  ♫

843
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,620
♫  Let's burn down  ♫

844
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:12,729
♫  You can't shoot me down  ♫

845
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:15,839
   

846
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,299
 The investigation has to be sped up to full throttle. 

847
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,089
 So I can devour Gagok District in one bite. 

848
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,629
 You bothered to come to my house, huh? 

849
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,839
 - Where's CEO Hwang?  
  - He fell asleep after taking medicine. 

850
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,219
 I won't let a single helper of K escape. 

851
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:29,079
 The truth doesn't matter every time. 

852
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,319
 You need to at least be a monkey at the zoo 

853
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,859
 for them to believe you died of shame. Right? 

854
01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:35,679
 This is weird. Kang Ki Tak can't be reached. 

855
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,489
 I think something's going wrong. 

856
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:39,389
 You'll come back for sure. Right? 

857
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:40,969
 We're going to Somang Hospital. 

858
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:42,009
 Who's there? 

859
01:04:42,009 --> 01:04:44,079
 You're bound to die. 

860
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,669
 The way I want. 

861
01:04:48,859 --> 01:04:51,660
♫  Oh, let's burn down  ♫
