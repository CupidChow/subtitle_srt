4
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,680
 You met Da Mi. Right? 

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,650
 Beg for her forgiveness so you won't regret it.

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,670
It's now time for you guys to decide.

8
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,040
Will you stomp on your sins and let a flower bloom like Geum Ra Hee

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,180
or will you stomp on the flower and...

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,440
let your sin bloom?

11
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,260
 Yang Jin Mo! Yang Jin Mo! 

12
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,760
    
 Dear citizens of Seoul, how are you doing?

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,870
Please make me the servant of Seoul's citizens!

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,790
Handsome Seoul made by Mi Nam! 
  (Means a handsome man in Korean) 

15
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,630
Please look forward to it!

16
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,160
♫  Real, real, real, real, it's for real  ♫

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,780
Please give Yang Jin Mo, who always thinks of the people first

18
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,840
with a humble heart, your trust!

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
 Yang Jin Mo! 

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,180
Handsome Seoul, please look forward to it!

21
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,600
 Jin Mo, Jin Mo, Yang Jin Mo! 

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,730
 Candidate No. 1! 

23
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,030
- I'll be a mayor who works for the people! 
 - Handsome Seoul made by Mi Nam!

24
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,910
Come and join us!

25
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,640
   

26
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,330
   

27
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,070

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,220
Fighting, Yang Jin Mo!

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,890
Please enjoy.

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,700
- Please enjoy. 
  - Please enjoy. 

34
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,570
    
 Luca, open the secret talk about public opinion.

35
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,710
 Korea Galler. Choi Mi Nam, 51.6%. 

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,990
 Yang Jin Mo, 38.1%. 

37
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,990
 Real Meta. Choi Mi Nam, 50.8%. 

38
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,980
 Yang Jin Mo, 37.7%. 

39
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,320
 Candidate Choi Mi Nam is winning at all research centers. 

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,320
 Rock, paper, scissors! 

41
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,600
Phillip.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
- Are you okay? 
 - It hurts.

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,310
Who pushed my brother?

44
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,970
Was it you? It was you. Right?

45
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,130
Yes, it was me. Why?

46
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,930
How dare you!

47
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,560
Do you want to get in trouble with my dad?

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,590
Your dad is a fake.

49
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,780
My mom said so.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,840
Do you even know your dad is a middle school graduate?

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,770
Hey, don't badmouth my dad!

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,860
Take it back! My dad is really smart!

53
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,520
My brother told you to apologize.

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,370
I don't think I can do that.

55
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,070
Did I say something wrong?

56
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,280
All of you will get kicked out soon.

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
My mom is the mom café owner. 
  (Korea's internet community of mothers.) 

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,670
Mom café's boss is the strongest in the world!

59
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,470
Why you little!

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,430
My arm!

61
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,450
What's wrong? What's the matter?

62
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,680
Goodness, my baby! Why are you crying? What's wrong—

63
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,970
My goodness. Are you trying to show your lack of upbringing?

64
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,620
Should I bite you, too?

65
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,500
Erica, did you really do it?

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,530
But he was the first one to push Phillip and

67
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,610
saying he'd kick us out of the apartment!

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,810
I'm really sorry.

69
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,250
I'll make sure to teach her properly so this won't happen again.

70
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,560
   

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,630
   

72
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,600
   

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,260
   

74
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,350
 - Candidate No. 1, Choi Mi Nam!  
  - Candidate No. 7, Yang Jin Mo! 

75
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,830
 Candidate No. 1, Choi Mi Nam! 

76
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,320
An orphan, a middle school graduate, a former waiter at a bar,

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,840
and fake marriage. What a chaotic mess!

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,610
Sure. Job discrimination, disparaging academic background, and distributing fake news!

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,600
Who did all that?

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,700
My approval rating is overwhelmingly higher.

81
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,640
Gosh, Candidate Yang only has three days left.

82
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,850
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have three days!

83
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,240
Unless you want the nation to go down,

84
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,660
who'd ever vote a lord of scandal like him as a mayor?

85
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,860
Don't you agree?

86
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,470
Gosh, a so-called teacher gets into a fake contractual marriage?

87
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,800
Gosh, how humiliating!

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Yes, that's right. Our marriage is fake.

89
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,350
However, we're much happier than people who got caught cheating on each other

90
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,780
and resorted to trying to commit suicide at the Han River.

91
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,800
Has she gone mad? How dare you spread a baseless rumor?

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
Why get into an arranged marriage after checking terms and families?

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,980
Their household is a total mess. It's a pity for their kids.

94
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,460
I wasn't going to mention your kids.

95
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,820
But your daughter is a bully at the kindergarten, huh?

96
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,160
I saw the story in Mom café. Mind your own kids' educations!

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,160
He's right! What did the kid learn at home to be using violence already?

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,260
- Isn't that right? 
  - You're right! 

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,200
You weren't followed?

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,710
Don't worry. Hwang Chan Seong went to meet K.

101
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm supposed to be at a massage shop right now.

102
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,260
This is Hwang Chan Seong's location history for the past week.

103
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,980
He only goes to work and home, which is simpler than I expected.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,050
What if he already hid my mom out of the country?

105
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,580
Hwang Chan Seong and his aide haven't left the country for the past few months.

106
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,430
He could've smuggled her out on a ship.

107
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,830
No...

108
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,700
What if he already killed her?

109
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,440
Don't think of the worst.

110
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,020
She might actually be a lot closer to us than we thought.

111
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,890
We just need to search his office and home. Right?

112
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,470
This won't do. I'll move into his house.

113
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,030
Staying with him right now is way too dangerous.

114
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,460
Nothing is more important than finding my mom.

115
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,710
Is it because you didn't get any sunlight?

116
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,870
You're even paler.

117
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,280
Cut the bullshit and get to the point as to why you're here.

118
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,940
Why the heck aren't you sharing Luca with me?

119
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,700
You won't gain anything by ruining my mood, Joon Seok.

120
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,220
It's the access code for Luca.

121
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,480
Hacking Secret Talk, huh?

122
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,900
What a crazy thing you've done.

123
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,960
I mean, Lee Hwi So is the one who did it, not you.

124
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,920
The real genius is Lee Hwi So, isn't he?

125
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,550
Which is why I'll clarify the copyright once and for all.

126
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,330
- Luca. 
  - Yes, Chairman. 

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,040
Hwang Chan Seong will be allowed access from now on.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,620
However, never let him enter without my permission.

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,300
Hey!

130
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,070
That isn't handing it over.

131
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,910
Do you want to die?

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,860
If I die, you won't be able to get access authorization for Luca.

133
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,660
Shouldn't we find a way to coexist now?

134
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,950
As long as our enemy is alive,

135
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,340
we can't just idle away our time.

136
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,140
Min Do Hyeok?

137
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,400
Should I make you an offer, then?

138
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,040
If I kill Min Do Hyeok without fail,

139
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,010
can TikiTaka and Save...

140
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,440
become one family?

141
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,550
Are you talking about a merger right now?

142
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,210
 - Hyung!  
 - Yes, Kyeong Soo. Go ahead.

143
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,830
Ki Tak disappeared.

144
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,930
He disappeared again?

145
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,560
All right. I got it.

146
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,460
Locate Kang Ki Tak. 
    

147
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,900
 I'm sorry for resenting you all my life, Kang Ki Tak. 

148
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
 And also... 

149
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,520
 for resenting your daughter. 

150
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,130
   

151
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,420
Hey! Ra Hee died because of that bastard!

152
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,440
- Let go. 
 - Hyung! Hyung!

153
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,460
- Ra Hee died! 
 - Hyung, Hyung!

154
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,180
Hey! Hey!

155
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,710
What do you even know?

156
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,100
Hyung, please don't do this.

157
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,420
Our enemy is K.

158
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,300
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
And thank you.

160
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,170
For stopping me from making a mistake.

161
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,060
Geum Ra Hee wouldn't want you to do this, either.

162
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,070
You're right.

163
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,910
Because I still have a job to do.

164
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,260
That was hanging on Da Mi's tree, wasn't it?

165
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,310
Did I ever tell you?

166
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,140
I like the ocean.

167
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,830
When I saw you going into the ocean in winter a long time ago...

168
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,310
I thought you were a crazy man. I remember that.

169
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,160
That's the fish you like. Right?

170
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,200
I thought Geum Ra Hee hung it for Da Mi. But it wasn't.

171
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,980
She left it for you, Hyung.

172
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,040
After we're done with this, I'm going to travel the oceans.

173
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,820
I also want to show you.

174
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,260
I'll go wherever you want, Hyung.

175
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,060
As long as you're paying.

176
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,530
I mean it. You need to get me business tickets.

177
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,050
I've always liked you from the beginning, Hyung.

178
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,910
I love you, Hyung.

179
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,560
Delivery!

180
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,860
- Hey, did you tell him? 
 - Hyung!

181
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,060
I was so worried!

182
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,660
Why are you so strong?

183
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,000
   
 Geum Ra Hee's last moment as a mother was respectable. 

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,870
 I'm going to join her cause. 

185
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,540
 We decided to trust you, Min Do Hyeok. 

186
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,860
   
 You know I'm included in "we". Right? 

187
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,560
 Instead, keep this a secret from others. 

188
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,860
Attention!

189
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,970
We've got our first supporters.

190
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,690
Cha Joo Ran and Nam Cheol Woo.

191
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,300
To oppose Save and TikiTaka, we also need power.

192
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,840
I plan to use Seongchan.

193
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,760
It's the super moon.

194
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,260
Kyeong Soo, let's find your mother for sure. Okay?

195
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,660
Also, clear the name of your brother, who died as Shim Joon Seok.

196
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,550
 Thank you, Ra Hee. 

197
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,370
 For telling me the truth. 

198
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,080
 I'll swear to that moon. 

199
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,250
 I'll kill K, who killed our daughter. 

200
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,840
You have a meeting early in the day tomorrow,

201
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,170
so wash up and go to bed.

202
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,570
   

203
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,460
I'll help. It'll be quick if we do it together.

204
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,590
You'll hurt your stomach. I'll bring some food.

205
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,060
Should we drink together? We worked hard.

206
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,290
Together?

207
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,720
I'd love to.

208
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,360
That's refreshing.

209
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
Have just one can. No more than that.

210
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,660
Your face will swell, and your voice will crack, too.

211
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,810
Are you worried about me right now?

212
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,100
People would think you're really my wife.

213
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,430
I mean it.

214
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,360
Because it's also beneficial for our kids

215
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,630
to have you become the mayor.

216
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,660
I should go to sleep now.

217
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,380
You should stop drinking, too. My goodness!

218
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

219
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,400
Sis, this is bad!

220
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,930
Mom and Dad must be fighting again.

221
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,360
People can't find out about this.

222
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,180
Should I play the recorder or something?

223
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,950
You're so dense.

224
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,530
Are you going to interrupt Mom and Dad's quality time?

225
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,710
Get him!

226
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,410
Yes.

227
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,150
Gosh, why? Why are you doing this?

228
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,660
Erica, Phillip, and Hannah! It's time to eat.

229
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:22,760
Hey, Go Phillip, if you say funny stuff about last night...

230
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,060
- You know, right? 
 - Yes.

231
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,840
My lips are sealed.

232
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,540
Mommy, good morning!

233
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,580
Did you sleep well?

234
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,450
Did you have a good night?

235
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,460
By the way, Mom, your face is glowing so much.

236
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,960
Are you happy Dad showed you love last night?

237
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,140
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

238
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,710
Of course, it's because I take care of myself.

239
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,870
Hannah!

240
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,840
You're going to the filming set today. Right?

241
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,940
I will come with you later.

242
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,180
Can I come with you, too?

243
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,500
I don't think you can, Erica.

244
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,910
I think the mom of the kid you hit last time posted something negative on the mom café.

245
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,750
Is Dad not going to become the mayor, then?

246
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,660
Phillip.

247
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,160
- Erica, as I was saying... 
 - Oh, I forgot.

248
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,610
I have the English debate tournament.

249
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,620
I need to practice, so I need to get going early.

250
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,940
W-Wait, Erica!

251
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,420
What about breakfast? You need—

252
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,290
Erica.

253
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,230
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

254
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,860
My mother, who passed away, isn't my real mother.

255
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,670
What about it?

256
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,180
I don't feel sorry for you at all.

257
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,110
My dad only likes you.

258
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,860
My mom and dad, who gave birth to me, abandoned me,

259
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,650
so that mom raised me instead.

260
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,810
Abandoned you? Why?

261
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,920
A mom abandoned her child?

262
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,760
That's why I envy...

263
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,260
you and Phillip the most in my life.

264
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Because Ahjumma loves you two sincerely.

265
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,100
Are your biological mom and dad alive?

266
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,930
Yes.

267
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,360
But...

268
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,240
I guess they want me to die.

269
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,640
No way.

270
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,750
Everyone suffers...

271
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,460
if they stay by my side.

272
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,160
Hey, there's no such thing.

273
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,260
How old are you to believe in superstitions?

274
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,140
Stop crying.

275
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,560
You have a shoot today.

276
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,960
What's with your face? You're already ugly.

277
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,890
That's a little bit better.

278
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,580
You're ages away to catch up to my looks.

279
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,130
Thank you.

280
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,240
 I thought it was made for you the moment I saw it. 

281
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,610
 Wear it for your first day at work. 

282
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,260
 Let's do our best on the new start at Seongchan. 

283
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,860
 Mom would've been happy to see this. 

284
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,860
 Her wish was to have her son go to work in a suit. 

285
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,210
Thank you, Hyung.

286
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,640
   

287
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,020
   

288
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,900
You have to remember your dignity.

289
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,760
Rather than coming on so strong like this, men like—

290
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,460
Don't worry about a thing.

291
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,260
I'm Shim Mi Young. I'm absolutely not an easy woman.

292
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,960
Ki Tak!

293
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,160
I missed you so, so very much!

294
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,060
Do you know how much I waited for today?

295
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,200
I just got you approved as vice president at the board meeting.

296
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
Vice President Kang Ki Tak.

297
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,150
Wait, w-when did you come?

298
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,780
I've been with him since we left home.

299
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,970
Really? I'm the type to only focus on one man.

300
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Let's go.

301
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,020
- I'm Chief Secretary Jo Jong Rak. 
 - Oh, yes.

302
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,480
Chairman Shim Yong should've seen this scene.

303
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,560
 Our Do Hyeok. Goodbye. 

304
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,180
 Hurry up and run away, Min Do Hyeok. 

305
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,160
 I'm finally entering Seongchan. 

306
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,090
 I won't avoid or run away anymore. 

307
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,040
 No matter how much it hurts. 

308
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,980
I'll prepare the breakfast, Ms. Han.

309
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,000
Take a break.

310
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,740
Chan Seong will like it, too.

311
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,110
Hurry up and get some rest.

312
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,960
 If Mom is alive, there must be some kind of a clue in this house. 

313
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,810
 I must find it. There must be something. 

314
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,660
You're up.

315
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,160
What brings you here, Mo Ne?

316
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,060
You said you wanted tteokbokki, Chan Seong.

317
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll make it tasty. Have some before you go to work.

318
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,520
   

319
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,710
   

320
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,230
Try it.

321
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,750
Whoa, it's deliciously spicy.

322
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,640
It's the best tteokbokki I've ever had.

323
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,460
You should eat with me, Mo Ne.

324
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,340
I'm fine. I don't have much appetite.

325
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,820
Why? Is something wrong?

326
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,790
My mom used to make me tteokbokki often, too.

327
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,760
I can't remember my mom's face these days.

328
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,150
She probably isn't even visiting me in my dreams because I'm a horrible daughter.

329
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,630
Mo Ne.

330
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,790
Gosh, I'm sorry.

331
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,260
I shouldn't say this to someone going to work.

332
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,560
 He does anything I want. 

333
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,060
 I need to let him make his move. So I can find my mom. 

334
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,190
But you know it, too.

335
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,230
You're the only one I can talk to about these things.

336
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,410
I know very well.

337
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,210
I'll do better, so you won't have to cry.

338
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,900
I need to get going now.

339
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,680
I hope you'll enjoy it all before going to work.

340
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,480
Good luck with the shoot!

341
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,310
   

342
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,590
Don't look at me like that.

343
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,310
You know I'm not a bad person.

344
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,170
I'm still your son-in-law-to-be, Mother.

345
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,870
 Mother! Please eat. 

346
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,320
 If you're Mo Ne's mother, you're also my mother. 

347
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,220
 Consider this your own home and relax comfortably. 

348
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,520
 Can I borrow your phone? 

349
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,750
 Oh, my phone? 

350
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,200
 Who are you going to call? 

351
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
 You can't call Mo Ne yet. 

352
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,970
 I'll let you meet her when the time is right. 

353
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,850
 Min Do Hyeok. 

354
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,970
 Can you write it down here? 

355
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:43,270
 Min Do Hyeok. Please give him a call for me. 

356
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,120
 Why Min Do Hyeok? 

357
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,500
 He'll be really worried because I disappeared. 

358
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,240
 Please tell him not to worry about me 

359
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,340
 and that I'm leaving my Mo Ne and Hannah in his care. 

360
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,940
 I don't think I can grant you that request. 

361
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,200
 I'm not exactly fond of Min Do Hyeok. 

362
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,560
 You should stop now and... 

363
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,620
 just get to your meal. 

364
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,580
 He is a good person. 

365
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,260
 I'm thankful to him because he saved Hannah 

366
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,920
 and helped me meet Mo Ne. 

367
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,800
 Enough. 

368
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,550
 I told you to stop talking about that asshole. 

369
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,810
 Min Do Hyeok is an extremely dangerous person. 

370
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,000
 Why did you meet him? 

371
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,540
 You were following me? 

372
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,040
 No, no, no! 

373
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,850
 Mo Ne! 

374
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,830
   

375
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,690
 Why did you hit my daughter? 

376
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,370
 What did she ever do to you? 

377
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,690
 I'm already about to lose it because of Min Do Hyeok, that fucker. 

378
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,490
 So don't add on to it, Mother. 

379
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,170
 Don't touch my daughter. 

380
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,960
 I don't care what you do to me. 

381
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,610
 Hit me instead! 

382
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,110
 Oh, you're telling me to hit you instead? 

383
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,230
 That's also a very good idea. 

384
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,270
 I mean, you're on Min Do Hyeok's side, too. Right? 

385
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,110
 You say that asshole is a good person, huh? 

386
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,040
 You're thankful to him, huh? 

387
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:21,670
 I beg you. Please don't do anything to my daughter. 

388
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:27,770
 Please, I beg you... 

389
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,540
As long as Mo Ne doesn't break our promise.

390
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,560
However,

391
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,590
there's a job you need to do for me.

392
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,080
Oh, my! Reporters, you're here?

393
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,520
Hello. Can we proceed right away?

394
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,570
Oh, yes.

395
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,850
Did you come to take care of Hannah yourself?

396
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,940
Of course, the election is important, too.

397
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,490
But Hannah is very precious to me as well.

398
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,700
Hannah is a child with a lot of scars.

399
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,900
I sincerely want to become a reliable fence for her.

400
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,400
Does that mean Hannah can become a true family to you?

401
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,310
For example, are you thinking of adopting her?

402
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,600
Adopt her?

403
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,470
Oh, I-I haven't thought about that yet.

404
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,310
B-But please don't write about it in an article yet.

405
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,400
She might get hurt by it.

406
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,960
Yes.

407
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,710
Han Mo Ne?

408
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,300
This is from CEO Hwang.

409
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,220
What is it?

410
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,720
It's a lunchbox CEO went through trouble to get.

411
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,930
 This is my thanks for this morning's surprise. 

412
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,110
 I hope you like it, Mo Ne. 

413
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,520
M-Mom.

414
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,410
It's you, right, Mom?

415
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,790
It's you, right, Mom?

416
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,240
Mom.

417
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,980
Mom.

418
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,720
Mom.

419
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,360
Hannah.

420
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,840
Do you like living at our house?

421
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,230
This is purely a hypothetical question,

422
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,400
but if I asked you to be my daughter,

423
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,360
would you hate it?

424
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
I-I'm sorry.

425
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
I shouldn't have said that.

426
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,800
You couldn't even forget your mom yet.

427
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,260
Please forget what I just said. Okay?

428
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,430
H-Hannah.

429
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,290
Can I really do that?

430
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,180
Didn't you hate me, Ahjumma?

431
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,060
It'd be perfect for your dad to play a fake dad role!

432
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,010
I have to hold back.

433
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,780
I have to endure it for Dad.

434
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,830
Why won't you do it? Are you acting nice because of the kids?

435
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,860
Get lost while I ask nicely.

436
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,830
Before I take a chunk out of you again.

437
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,300
You think I'm scared?

438
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,950
If you bite me one more time, my mom said she'll bring in

439
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,350
the mom café members and make your dad drop out.

440
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,580
Bite me if you dare!

441
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,500
Go on. Bite me!

442
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,770
You little... you're ignoring me?

443
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,840
"S Talk 4.0"?

444
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,730
   

445
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,090
If we don't surpass in public opinion and information gathering,

446
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,000
we can't beat Matthew.

447
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,210
S-Talk 4.0, our latest development,

448
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,920
will become a powerful weapon for us.

449
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,560
Just in time, the number of people leaving TikiTaka is rising rapidly, too.

450
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,500
It's the perfect time to get more people to use S-Talk.

451
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,150
What a genius.

452
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,760
You're Seongchan's savior.

453
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,060
You name it. I can give you any position except chairman.

454
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,000
Gosh, I'm happy as an engineer on the development team.

455
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,520
Okay, all right.

456
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,320
Escort him in.

457
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,220
Is someone coming?

458
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,610
The person Ki Tak wanted to meet but could not meet.

459
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,230
You see, I am a queen of connections once you get to know me.

460
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,190
Welcome, former Seoul Mayor Jang Jin Goo.

461
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,310
I am pleased to meet you.

462
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,180
Min Do Hyeok?

463
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,920
Chairman Matthew isn't Lee Hwi So, huh?

464
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,560
In that case, there's nothing more I can tell you.

465
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,360
Even my family's lives will be in danger if things go wrong.

466
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,480
Let's say today's meeting never happened.

467
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,350
I won't ask you to go out of your way to testify.

468
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,360
I just need one thing.

469
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,160
The reason Matthew is trying to make Yang Jin Mo the mayor.

470
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,380
I don't know such a thing.

471
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,080
Nor do I want to know.

472
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,290
Do you wish for more victims like you?

473
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,860
Did you really become the mayor for your own good, as Matthew said?

474
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,430
Do you actually believe that asshole?

475
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,000
I was wronged!

476
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,030
One who stays cowardly to the end...

477
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,610
has no right to feel wronged.

478
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,060
Gagok District.

479
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,940
That bastard wanted Gagok District development, which was put on pause.

480
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,000
Why is Gagok District so important?

481
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,650
He wants to make a separate nation even the president can't mess with.

482
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:31,000
A city that can control all information, including those of national security.

483
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,690
If he can promote it as a national project,

484
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,240
he'll be obtaining enormous power for free.

485
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,240
As expected, Save announced its merger with TikiTaka.

486
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,300
People want to know which candidate you endorse

487
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,080
for the position of Seoul mayor, CEO Hwang.

488
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,020
Could you give us a hint, please?

489
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,820
What you just said sounds like a very dangerous statement.

490
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,600
Save always stays neutral.

491
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,620
We don't endorse anyone.

492
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,930
The reason I invited the two of you

493
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,720
is to help with your campaign, Candidate Yang.

494
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,650
At this rate, you can't become the Seoul mayor, Candidate Yang.

495
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,640
Because the numbers don't lie.

496
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,560
Chairman Matthew's power alone will not be enough.

497
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,260
Is there a way to turn the tables or something?

498
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,910
Have you heard of the phrase, subliminal effect?

499
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,530
I have. The effect on the unconscious.

500
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,150
You're right.

501
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,080
It's a message to the subconsciousness of those who access Save

502
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,140
that Candidate Yang Jin Mo is the best fit for the mayor.

503
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,960
You see, algorithms are frightening.

504
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,440
Would that work when the elections are right around the corner?

505
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:15,320
How much time do you think people normally spend looking at their phones?

506
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,550
It'll be a combative release of aggressive digital attacks.

507
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,750
To be frank, I don't know why you'd go this far.

508
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,340
What is it you want?

509
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,100
We'll talk about that after you win the election.

510
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,680
What do you say?

511
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,320
Do you want to work with me?

512
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,750
 What do we need to do? 

513
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,130
Connect this to the computer in

514
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,410
the basement of K's house.

515
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:02,720
It contains programs that can neutralize Save's security system.

516
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,960
K's house?

517
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,760
No, I can't do that.

518
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,720
I said I'll join your side, not bet my life on it.

519
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,480
Even Geum Ra Hee did it. Why can't I?

520
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,960
Honey, don't compete with your life on the line.

521
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,180
What a coward. Stay out of it if you're scared.

522
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,270
I'll do it alone if I have to.

523
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,900
I can't guarantee that the program I created will work.

524
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,400
If things go wrong...

525
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,730
Why do you have so much to say?

526
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,270
I said I'll do it. Okay?

527
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,040
No!

528
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,720
I'll do it.

529
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,710
I can't make you do such a dangerous thing.

530
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,810
Yang Jin Mo!

531
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,810
Matthew!

532
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,940
G-Gosh, don't do that!

533
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,210
Joo Ran!

534
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,700
Joo Ran, I-I get you.

535
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,860
Let go! Don't hold me back today.

536
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,450
Matthew. Chairman Matthew!

537
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,900
Hey, Joon Seok!

538
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,420
Cha Joo Ran!

539
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,210
What do you think you're doing?

540
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,990
Chairman—

541
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,570
T-The thing is, Chairman...

542
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,000
I guess J-Joo Ran was shocked to hear about the merger and drank too much.

543
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,260
Please, just don't kill her.

544
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,780
Why don't you give me an explanation?

545
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,730
A merger with Save?

546
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:28,220
Even if I'm a puppet of a president,

547
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,180
how can you look down on me like this?

548
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,010
Do you know how embarrassed I was at work?

549
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,730
I found out through the article, too.

550
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,450
Liar. Do you think I'm a moron?

551
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,120
You're working with Hwang Chan Seong

552
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,970
and trying to abandon us all!

553
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,920
Chairman Matthew, please don't abandon me.

554
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,430
Is Cha Joo Ran, the SNU College of Medicine Graduate, not enough?

555
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,830
Chairman.

556
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,860
I-I need to poop suddenly.

557
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,120
You two are really a handful.

558
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,180
That way.

559
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,680
I just need five minutes. Is it this way?

560
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,650
What are you looking at? Look at me. Focus, focus!

561
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,900
You don't know what a scarred woman will do.

562
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,920
I own this house now!

563
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,630
Yeah!

564
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:34,060
Whoa, this is all mine, too!

565
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,060
- Hey, you, too. 
 - Don't!

566
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,630
- Put it down. 
 - Chairman.

567
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,630
Put it down.

568
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,380
Do you like this one or me?

569
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,360
- Put it down. 
 - Chairman.

570
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,410
Put it down.

571
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,200
Chairman.

572
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,130
- Chairman, come catch me. 
 - I said to put it down—

573
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,400
Put it down!

574
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,020
Am I not enough?

575
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,970
Chairman, catch me if you can!

576
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,830
I'm ready.

577
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,130
 Can you see my face? 

578
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,320
Hold the leg of the silver horse in front of you and push it forward.

579
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,130
Oh, okay. Where is it?

580
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,200
 This one? 

581
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,760
Yes. Push it?

582
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,430
Hey, it's moving.

583
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,770
It's opening.

584
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,450
Crazy bastard. What did he build in his house?

585
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,340
Whoa, this is fun!

586
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,590
Come down. Come down from there!

587
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,740
Chairman, catch me—

588
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,320
Where is it?

589
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,370
I found the port.

590
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,120
You have exactly three minutes to stop Luca.

591
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,510
Any longer than that, Matthew will be alerted.

592
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,010
 - Are you ready?  
 - Yes.

593
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,540
One.

594
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,170
Two.

595
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,830
Three.

596
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,240
Yes!

597
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,360
   

598
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,860
   
   

599
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,240
Gosh, what do we do? It failed!

600
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,850
Open the second program.

601
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,180
Okay.

602
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,320
   

603
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,190
   

604
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,140
   

605
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,740
It failed again.

606
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,730
I shouldn't have trusted you in the first place.

607
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,680
We've got one minute and 27 seconds left.

608
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,470
Don't do it. Stop that!

609
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,370
What's that? What's—

610
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,130
- My shoes. 
 - These are pretty, too.

611
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,010
- Open the door right now! 
 - Am I pretty, Chairman?

612
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,550
Open it. Come on!

613
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,860
Has she gone mad?

614
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,160
What's taking you so long? Hurry up, Nam Cheol Woo.

615
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,460
   

616
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,290
   

617
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,070
Please, please.

618
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,070
   

619
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,480
   

620
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,560
It worked!

621
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,640
Whoa, it worked!

622
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,080
That's my brother's son for you!

623
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,150
We're retreating now.

624
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,430
 - Hold on.  
 - What is it now?

625
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,340
Bring the information about Gagok District.

626
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,300
There's no time. I'm going to get caught.

627
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,390
We've got 30 seconds left.

628
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,580
You have to do it.

629
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,060
Bring it with you.

630
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,040
- Put it down. 
 - Chairman!

631
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,750
Has she gone mad for real?

632
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,930
No. Chairman!

633
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,260
Gosh, seriously!

634
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,030
Nam Cheol Woo.

635
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,850
No!

636
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:57,010
I got you, Chairman Matthew!

637
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,160
 Nam Cheol Woo, hurry up and come out. 

638
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,770
Let go of me!

639
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,890
Honey.

640
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,140
Gosh, I... Gosh, I think I...

641
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,720
Hold on.

642
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,580
Oh, thank you.

643
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,470
I almost died pooping.

644
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,010
I think I got hemorrhoids.

645
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,750
So what if you have hemorrhoids? I even love your hemorrhoids, Honey.

646
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,950
What a load of bullshit.

647
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,840
Erica, are you in pain?

648
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,420
Should I bring Ahjumma?

649
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,370
No, don't bring her.

650
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,190
No one is hurting.

651
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,510
But why are you sweating so much?

652
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:25,540
Erica, you're bleeding!

653
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,280
It hurts.

654
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,220
Erica, what's wrong with your arm?

655
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,130
Who did this to you?

656
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,190
It's nothing.

657
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:42,270
What do you mean it's nothing? Look how deep the wound is!

658
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,260
Who is it? Hurry up and tell me.

659
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,760
That stupid son of the mom café!

660
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,110
I got so mad that I was going to beat him up,

661
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,350
but the mom café ladies were watching. So, I just held back.

662
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,390
But keep this a secret from Dad.

663
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,790
He'll be upset unnecessarily.

664
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:08,660
You held back because of Dad?

665
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,450
Because it might cause trouble for Dad?

666
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,400
Yes. Because I like Dad.

667
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,200
Erica.

668
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,890
I didn't even know my daughter was in such pain.

669
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,480
I'm sorry.

670
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,480
I'm really sorry, Erica.

671
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,940
 I can't breathe, Mom. Let me go. 

672
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,360
You should sleep inside.

673
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,510
It's comfortable here.

674
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,930
Did I make a mistake or something?

675
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,060
No, I'm the one who made a mistake.

676
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,160
Let's say nothing happened last night.

677
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,970
We're...

678
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,660
a business couple, you know.

679
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,200
It won't happen again.

680
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,500
All right. Goodnight.

681
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,560
 Wake up, Yang Jin Mo. 

682
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,160
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve a family. 

683
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,460
 Who are you trying to sacrifice after you killed Paeng Hee? 

684
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,470
 You don't deserve to have a family. 

685
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,260
The lunchbox was warm.

686
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,260
Min Do Hyeok was right. Mom is nearby.

687
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,240
   

688
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,420
Yes, Chan Seong.

689
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,660
I was going to call you, too.

690
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,450
The lunchbox you sent me earlier was so delicious.

691
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,160
Where did you buy it?

692
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,760
I know a woman who is very good at cooking.

693
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,360
I'll send you food you like more often from now on.

694
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,460
You shouldn't get sick until the wedding.

695
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,880
Thank you.

696
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,030
   

697
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:04,200
 The special elections for Seoul mayor just began. 

698
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,600
 Citizens who left their homes earlier to cast their votes 

699
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,140
 are heading to the polling place. 

700
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,050
   

701
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,770
   

702
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:26,120
 I wonder who the people will choose. 

703
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,000
 In that case, just vote for Yang Jin Mo. 

704
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,960
   

705
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,760
Post articles about fake marriage and foster care children on the main page.

706
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,460
Move the hearts of the female voters.

707
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,320
   

708
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,180
Upload articles about the murder of the bar waiter.

709
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,090
Upload featured articles about successful middle school graduates.

710
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,930
Yang Jin Mo will become their hope.

711
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,380
 Candidate Yang Jin Mo got 43.2%, and 

712
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,570
 Candidate Choi Mi Nam got 43.6% of the votes. 

713
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,180
 And Candidate Choi Mi Nam is in the lead. 

714
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,870
 Candidate Yang Jin Mo, 43.1%. 

715
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,560
 Candidate Choi Mi Nam, 43.7%. 

716
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,660
 The difference grew to 0.6%. 

717
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,560
 The last ballot box was opened. 

718
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,160
 Candidate Yang Jin Mo received 45.6% of the votes. 

719
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,600
 Candidate Yang Jin Mo from independent party 

720
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,960
 - has been confirmed as the winner.  
 - It's Dad!

721
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,260
 Independent candidate Yang Jin Mo was elected as Seoul mayor. 

722
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,900
 That's a total of 45.8% of the votes. 

723
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,660
   

724
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,260
 Yang Jin Mo! 

725
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,630
 Yang Jin Mo! Yang Jin Mo! 

726
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,880
 Yang Jin Mo! Yang Jin Mo! 

727
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,330
 Yang Jin Mo! 

728
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,510
There you go!

729
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,980
 He is causing a scene at the National Election Committee, 

730
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,590
 refusing to accept the result. 

731
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,820
Everything is going as I want now, Luca.

732
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,460
 Congratulations, Chairman. 

733
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,960
Luca, contact Go Myeong Ji.

734
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,020
   

735
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,280
It's Dad! Guys, it's Dad!

736
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,090
   

737
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,220
What the heck?

738
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,690
Congratulations!

739
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,090
 Congratulations, Mayor Yang. 

740
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,810
It's all thanks to you, CEO Hwang.

741
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,200
The featured articles that came up hourly were amazing.

742
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,810
It's now my turn to state what I want, then.

743
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,000
As you wish.

744
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,910
I'll do anything to help within my power.

745
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,060
Hannah.

746
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,260
I'll take her.

747
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,970
What did you say?

748
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,880
I'm going to marry Mo Ne soon.

749
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,790
Hannah should live with us, then.

750
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,820
It's natural for a child to live with her mother. Right?

751
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,910
You knew about that?

752
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,410
You can't. Hannah is not an object.

753
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,480
Let me just tell you one thing.

754
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,380
Just like how I was able to make you Seoul mayor,

755
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,410
I can just as easily take you down from being the mayor.

756
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,040
I'll be taking my present when I want it.

757
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,680
You must be busy with the celebrations, so I'll hang up now.

758
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,300
No.

759
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,170
Hannah...

760
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,040
You can't.

761
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,900
You knew everything all along?

762
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,670
That Hannah is my daughter?

763
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,750
Were you surprised?

764
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,300
Why didn't you tell me when you knew it?

765
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,210
Were you deceiving me?

766
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,370
I mean, I just didn't tell you.

767
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,000
It's not like I lied to you.

768
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,260
I'll officially announce our marriage soon.

769
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,460
Marriage?

770
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,560
I plan to announce Hannah's adoption together as well.

771
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,180
Well, I guess we can say you grew attached while filming together.

772
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,600
The wedding is scheduled to be held in two weeks.

773
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,150
You're just as...

774
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,460
excited as I am. Right?

775
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,370
Mom, look at this.

776
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,030
Whoa, you're the best.

777
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:03,610
   

778
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:12,680
When is Ahjussi coming?

779
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,240
Let's wait a bit longer.

780
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,720
 The kids and I are waiting for you. 

781
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,910
 Will you be coming late? 

782
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,270
 Please give me a reply. 

783
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,810
You're home.

784
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,560
You should've come a bit earlier.

785
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,590
The kids just went to kindergarten.

786
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,400
We didn't even sleep and waited for you all night.

787
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,380
The celebration must've lasted longer than planned.

788
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,020
I should've been there, huh?

789
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,990
I have to get changed and head out again.

790
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:31,400
Jin Mo! I have something to tell you.

791
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,340
What do you think about officially adopting Hannah?

792
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,830
Hannah needs to start school soon, too.

793
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:47,140
So let's raise her as our child.

794
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:52,390
I think I can really become a good mother.

795
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:56,160
Of course, I need to try harder.

796
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,660
There's no need to try.

797
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,150
Sorry?

798
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,030
Do you think you have the right to become Hannah's mother?

799
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,260
What do you know how to do?

800
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,670
Besides lying, scamming, and murdering, what else are you good at?

801
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:15,260
H-How can you say such a thing?

802
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,060
We're a fake couple Matthew formed.

803
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,800
Since the election is over, we're finished, too.

804
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,630
Let me make this clear.

805
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,160
I've never thought of you as Hannah's mother.

806
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,610
So, don't try to dirty that position and

807
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,360
get through with the divorce quietly.

808
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,500
Honey!

809
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,960
C-Can you reconsider, at least for the kids?

810
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,830
Erica needs a dad.

811
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,800
She was worried you'd be in trouble,

812
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,030
so she kept quiet all night, even with a bruise on her arm.

813
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:47,070
Because she likes you...

814
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,120
Because she likes her dad so much!

815
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,780
L-Look at this.

816
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,660
The kids made this cake for you.

817
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:05,700
It has nothing to do with me.

818
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,270
Did you forget I almost lost the election because of Erica?

819
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,530
Take the kid to the hospital if she's sick!

820
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:28,840
Son of a bitch.

821
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,590
 You, Erica, and Phillip will be in danger if you stay by my side. 

822
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,760
 Even if things go wrong, I should be the only one to die. 

823
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,690
Secretary Oh, whether it's in Europe or Australia,

824
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,290
look for a boarding school a six-year-old can go to.

825
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,390
As quickly as possible.

826
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:16,200
I-I'll make you regret...

827
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,420
what you said today horribly.

828
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,460
You ignored my calls so much.

829
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:58,260
So what brings you here at this late hour looking like that?

830
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,110
Wouldn't it be the

831
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:06,620
same reason you desperately wanted to see me, Chairman?

832
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,120
What could you mean by that?

833
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:15,190
Yang Jin Mo has teamed up with Hwang Chan Seong.

834
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:18,130
He has betrayed you already.

835
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,530
That man will no longer

836
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,320
do as you want him to.

837
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,460
And why are you telling me that?

838
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,720
I want to see...

839
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,460
Yang Jin Mo go down miserably.

840
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,760
So, he can never get back up again!

841
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,560
Trample him...

842
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,570
and crush him down, please!

843
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,520
Han Mo Ne sent an email.

844
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,160
It's Hwang Chan Seong's schedule.

845
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,070
I'm sure there's an odd location if he's hiding Yoon Ji Sook.

846
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,490
Not at all. He stays longer at home.

847
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:24,260
His call history and emails don't show anything special.

848
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,040
Is Sis really going to marry that psychopath?

849
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,210
There are only two weeks left to the wedding.

850
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:37,770
   

851
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,940
 Min Do Hyeok, I'm getting married. 

852
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:25,070
 I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance. 

853
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,750
 I didn't have the courage to tell you. 

854
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:34,520
 I was worried I'd lose my resolve if you said I can't. 

855
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,160
 Because I might not want to get married. 

856
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,430
 I'll only think about Mom for now. 

857
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:42,880
 Nothing is more dangerous than looking for my mom. 

858
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,860
 CEO Geum Ra Hee saved her, 

859
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,200
 so at least for her sake... 

860
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,730
 But why does my heart ache so much? 

861
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,090
 I know it's shameless of me, 

862
01:09:55,090 --> 01:10:00,400
 but it looks like I like... 

863
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,700
I also prepared the best gift for you, Mo Ne.

864
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,420
I'm sure you'll be very surprised.

865
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,710
 Fine. Let's bring it on. 

866
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:44,440
 I'll willingly walk into the hell you created. 

867
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,900
Hannah! Hannah!

868
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,010
Where's Hannah?

869
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,180
Oh, Erica. Hannah...

870
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:59,400
Where's Hannah?

871
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,220
Where's Hannah?

872
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,860
Get changed first. We need to go to Mo Ne's wedding.

873
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,470
CEO Hwang Chan Seong invited us.

874
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,460
I asked where Hannah was!

875
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:19,260
She's leaving the country today. Did you pack Hannah's things?

876
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,160
Hannah isn't here, though.

877
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,250
- She already left. 
 - She left?

878
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,760
Where did she go?

879
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,480
What are you saying right now?

880
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,880
CEO Hwang told me

881
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,380
that you promised to give Hannah to CEO Hwang.

882
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,770
That's why

883
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,230
I gave her to him just now.

884
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,760
Go Myeong Ji, have you gone mad?

885
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,030
What right do you have to hit me?

886
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,800
You were selfish from the beginning to the end.

887
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,410
 I told you, didn't I? I'll kill anyone who hurts my kids. 

888
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,470
 I'm fine with a divorce. 

889
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,860
Rather, let's divorce right now!

890
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,730
Get out of my house right now!

891
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:06,680
If something happens to Hannah, you won't get away with it.

892
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,630
   

893
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,260
It's connected.

894
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,000
It has maximum security.

895
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,370
I think it'll take a long time.

896
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,740
Leave things here to us, and you go to the wedding.

897
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:58,600
I'll contact you when we find Yoon Ji Sook, so bring out Han Mo Ne then.

898
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,090
I got it, Hyung.

899
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,740
Kyeong Soo, I'm counting on you.

900
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,520
Yes, Hyung.

901
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,590
Hyung, my mom should be here. Right?

902
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:21,240
Let's do everything we can.

903
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:27,690
 It's now time to meet the stars of this wedding where 

904
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,940
 a beautiful harmony of East and West meet. 

905
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,070
Here comes the first star of the day.

906
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:35,360
The groom enters now!

907
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,030
Kyeong Soo, you look inside.

908
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,590
Yes!

909
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,660
Han Kyeong Soo!

910
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,810
Kyeong Soo, stand aside for a moment.

911
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,570
Hwang Chan Seong, that trashy bastard.

912
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:10,050
Next, we'll have the bride enter.

913
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:14,910
She must be more nervous and excited than anyone at this moment.

914
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:20,410
I believe a warmhearted applause and welcoming will greatly support our bride.

915
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:22,950
On this day, their most special day in life,

916
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:26,790
the bride and groom prepared another event.

917
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:33,280
The bride will march down the aisle with her mother.

918
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,740
The bride's mother?

919
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:42,210
Mo Ne's mom died at the reservoir back then, though...

920
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,730
Now, then. Please look toward the back.

921
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,910
The bride enters.

922
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:58,270
M-Mom!

923
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,160
Mom!

924
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,010
Mom.

925
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:22,000
Mom.

926
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,450
No way.

927
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,900
Mom, are you okay?

928
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,920
Mom.

929
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,090
Next, the bride's mother has prepared

930
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,210
a congratulatory speech in place of an officiant's speech.

931
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,390
Having perfected English, French, and German,

932
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,910
the bride's mother will give her speech now.

933
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:04,120
   

934
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,030
My daughter, congratulations on your wedding.

935
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:12,180
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

936
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,990
Sweetheart, congratulations on your wedding.

937
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:23,470
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

938
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:29,370
Sweetheart, congratulations on your wedding.

939
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:34,110
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

940
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:36,560
Sweetheart, congratulations on your wedding.

941
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,660
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

942
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,370
 Brag about my mom? 

943
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,680
 Yes! 

944
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,080
 She's perfect in every way. 

945
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,890
 She's fluent in English, French, and Spanish 

946
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,730
 and takes care of herself diligently that 

947
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:00,410
 she exercises at 5:00 a.m. every day. 

948
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:04,600
 Even I haven't seen her without makeup on. 

949
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,940
 My mom and family mean everything to me. 

950
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:14,190
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

951
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:21,660
With this, your life has become perfect without any lies.

952
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:27,070
On top of your own daughter, you've got an elegant and intelligent mother.

953
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:58,630

 Please refrain from going outside from now on. 
   

960
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:27,700
 This is an order from CEO Hwang. 

961
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,000
 I'd also need a safety device. 

962
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,910
 Do you get physically abused at home? 

963
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,610
 I brought Hannah as you ordered. 

964
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:35,380
 So, keep your promise, too, Chairman. 

965
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,990
 Everyone became miserable because of you, your shameless bastard! 

966

 Is the enemy of my enemy a friend? 

967
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,450
 From this moment on, break off all connections with Mo Ne. 

968
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:46,660
 Fine. I'll willingly walk into the hell you created. 

969
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,890
 Han Mo Ne. You need to meet your consequences.
