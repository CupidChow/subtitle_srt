4
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,000
 Geum Ra Hee! 

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,750
 Geum Ra Hee, you crazy— What are you doing right now? 

6
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,920
 Geum Ra Hee! 

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,890
 - Geum Ra Hee! 
 - Hey, Geum Ra Hee! 

8
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,630
 You! Shit, how can you— 

9
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,020
Honey! Honey!

10
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,180
C-Cheol Woo— I-I'm over here.

11
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,780
It's okay!

12
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,650
Jin Mo, are you okay?

13
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,820
 Can we get out? 

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,020
 Jin Mo! 

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,260
Welcome to hell.

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll start the survival game now.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,730
You must follow my orders to survive, no matter what.

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,410
Sounds like fun. Right?

19
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,380
All right. Shall we start talking about Bang Da Mi first?

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,330
 The first game is Confession. 

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,330
Those who confess all of their sins will be given a chance to survive.

22
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,130
 What kind of bullshit are you spewing? 

23
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,940
 What the heck would I confess? 

24
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,850
 If you don't want to die, uncuff me first! 

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,280
What deal did you make with Hwang Chan Seong, calling yourself Medusa?

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,540
On top of taking money from Joo Ran and me, you want our lives, too?

27
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,840
What are you going to do with our confessions, then?

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,700
 Talk about Bang Da Mi at this point? 

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,520
 You'll still be a murderer who killed her own daughter. 

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
You're the one who cornered her to die.

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,220
It was you, Geum Ra Hee!

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,410
 A wicked mother and an immoral bitch. 

33
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,810
What right do you have to talk about Bang Da Mi?

34
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,380
You don't even deserve to be called a mom!

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,630
 Who do you think did all the dirty work? 

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,790
 Cosplaying as a mom by selling your daughter's name? 

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,580
You're a demon who made her daughter's killer the national hero!

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,970
Merely for money!

39
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,600
 Since when were you a mother to be doing this shit? 

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,660
 You should've been good to her when she was alive. What the fuck! 

41
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,330
What a fucking lunatic!

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,490
Free me right now!

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,690
 What if she's regretting? 

44
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,460
 What if that's why she contacted you? 

45
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,310
 Geum Ra Hee, why are you just listening to them? 

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,130
 Are you really regretting it? 

47
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,320
- What's this? 
  - This doesn't look good. 

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,140
Fuck! She's trying to crush us to death.

49
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,120
I-It stopped moving.

50
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,980
How can you do this?

51
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,380
Let me go!

52
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,530
You took everything from me! The least you could do is let me live.

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,510
All right. Are you all ready to talk now?

54
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,020
 I'll give you another chance. 

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,300
If confessing is too difficult,

56
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,380
expose each other's sins.

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,460
Those who remain silent...

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,140
will soon die in that room.

59
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,090
If I do as you say, will you let me go?

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,810
 You won't do anything to my kids. Right? 

61
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,820
Of course.

62
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,560
You have three minutes left.

63
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
 This was why... 

64
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,930
 Geum Ra Hee planned a survival game. 

65
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,160
 She's trying to expose their sins on a live broadcast. 

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,330
 I'll go first, then. 

67
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,890
 Cha Joo Ran, that woman 

68
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,200
wrote a fake pregnancy diagnosis and lied about Da Mi being pregnant.

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,070
Something a doctor should never do.

70
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,880
 Corrupt Doctor Cha Joo Ran! 

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
 Bang Da Mi? 

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,930
 Yes, Bang Da Mi. 

73
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,840
 To be honest, there's something I haven't told you, Chairman. 

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,970
 Da Mi had come to visit my hospital recently. 

75
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,130
 Here. I even have the chart. 

76
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,890
   

77
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,730
   

78
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,330
 You disgraceful wretch! 

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,820
Shut up! You're the one who lied about Da Mi giving birth.

80
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,500
 I saw Bang Da Mi giving birth. 

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,370
To hide your affair. Right?

82
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,260
Want me to tell you her latest sin?

83
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,230
 That woman even kidnapped my Erica and faked an abduction 

84
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,250
 to increase the number of registries with Children Home! 

85
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,450
What about you?

86
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,400
You fabricated the proof during the Mayor of Seoul's lobby incident!

87
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,890
 Power tripping and selling worthless paintings to parents for college admissions. 

88
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,090
A corrupt teacher like you as the mayor's wife?

89
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,080
Your kids have so much to learn from you, huh?

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,710
My lies are nothing compared to what you did!

91
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,810
Right back at you!

92
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,320
My only sin is lying to Da Mi's grandfather.

93
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,520
 It was that old fart who went senile for believing everything I said. 

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,180
 Who tried to kill that old man? 

95
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,280
Who tried to kill Kang Ki Tak?

96
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,120
But he didn't die!

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,040
No one died because of me!

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,150
 Hey, Nam Cheol Woo, 

99
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,800
you falsely framed an innocent citizen as a junkie

100
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,440
and got him the death sentence!

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,710
 You son of a bitch. 

102
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,290
 Junkies only see junkies, huh? 

103
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,510
Who started the fake news?

104
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,980
It was you, Yang Jin Mo.

105
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,960
 Only if you hadn't created Joo Hong Letters, 

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,250
Da Mi wouldn't have become a national star!

107
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,210
You public opinion manipulator.

108
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,340
 Make fake news on an online MyTV broadcast. 

109
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,480
You're the worst of the worst!

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,590
It's proof this world is losing it for a fucker like you to be a candidate for mayor of Seoul!

111
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,980
Oh, that's right! I heard you did drugs again.

112
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,970
What a fitting ending for you.

113
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,650
 A dog can't stop pooping! 

114
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,330
 A dog? Did you just call me a dog? You're worse than a dog! 

115
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,260
 I graduated from the police academy at the top of the class! 

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,810
You're a middle school graduate who used to pour drinks at a bar! How dare you!

117
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,190
Pouring drinks is better than sniffing drugs!

118
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,220
Sure, hit me. Hit me, you asshole!

119
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,440
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you today.

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,220
Hey, Geum Ra Hee, uncuff me now!

121
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,230
 Hurry up! I'll teach this fucker— 

122
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,860
Shut your traps, you fucking morons!

123
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,740
What makes you think you can run your mouths?

124
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,460
Why?

125
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Are you afraid?

126
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,610
That people would find out you're the fake Lee Hwi So?

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,280
Should I name the people who died because of you?

128
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,750
Shut up, asshole.

129
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,470
There's this thing called the killer's stench.

130
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,270
No matter how you change your face and steal names,

131
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,080
that filthy stench will never disappear.

132
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,310
Bang Da Mi's killer.

133
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,540
The bastard who killed his own parents.

134
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,230
What about you?

135
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,350
You're nothing but a damn thug.

136
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,380
Joon Seok.

137
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,900
Once I'm freed,

138
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,130
you're dead.

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,920
Kill me.

140
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,250
Kill me right now, you fucker.

141
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,180
I said, kill me right now!

142
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,860
That fucking brute.

143
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,490
What? You said you're a good fighter.

144
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,500
Does it hurt here?

145
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,840
- This arm's fine. 
 - I can see that.

146
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,550
Just die, you fucking—

147
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Are you even human when you turn on your friend?

148
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,690
Is it better to die here than get exposed during the elections?

149
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,260
Why would I die here?

150
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,280
Worry about yourself, you sorry excuse of a human being!

151
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,300
Have you gone mad?

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,560
That hurts!

153
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,570
Hey, hold on! Wait a minute!

154
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,430
By the way, why is Mo Ne the only one missing?

155
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,320
Right, Han Mo Ne.

156
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,980
Did Hwang Chan Seong get her out?

157
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,130
 Whoa, she uses her connections even in death. Damn her. 

158
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,090
You!

159
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,440
Mo Ne will die, too.

160
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,780
In a different way from you lot.

161
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,880
   

162
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,440
You're sure Geum Ra Hee's here. Right?

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,620
What's she trying to do on the livestream?

164
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,590
That's not what matters.

165
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,540
What matters is that the chance to kill Geum Ra Hee with your hands finally came.

166
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,980
Wait.

167
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,710
It's a time bomb. Hurry up and get out!

168
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,450
It's Geum Ra Hee's doing.

169
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,210
On top of killing my mom,

170
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,980
she tried to kill me, too!

171
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,380
You said you wanted to kill Geum Ra Hee. Right?

172
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,370
Today is the day.

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,640
I forgot to tell you this in advance.

174
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,070
You're on Save's livestream.

175
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,180
Including everything you said.

176
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,050
 That crazy little... 

177
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,760
For crying out loud!

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,310
The camera.

179
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,350
The camera. Shit.

180
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,170
Hey!

181
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,250
None of them are true.

182
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,640
I-I mean, only what I said about Yang Jin Mo is true!

183
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,470
Everyone, please don't misunderstand—

184
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,480
Erica and Phillip, you aren't watching, are you?

185
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,650
Gosh, I'm not that bad of a person!

186
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,780
T-That crazy lady was lying all along!

187
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,790
I wasn't lying!

188
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,350
I'll change the rules.

189
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,420
Each room will have only one survivor.

190
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,650
You need to shoot the other person first to escape that room.

191
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,430
 Are you telling us to shoot the other one? 

192
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,250
 That's up to you. 

193
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,410
Whether to kill and survive or to be killed.

194
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,760
What's this?

195
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,790
 The key's in the room, so look closely. 

196
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,120
 There's only one bullet, and you have five minutes. 

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,010
If you don't shoot within five minutes, you'll all die.

198
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,530
 - Geum Ra Hee! 
 - What a load of bullshit! 

199
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,730
 We're all going to die in the end! 

200
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,990
 We're all going to die, and you're just putting on a show! 

201
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,670
You're right. In five minutes, this underground prison

202
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,410
will be gone without a trace from a time bomb explosion.

203
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,910
- A time bomb? 
 - I-I have to—

204
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,640
 A time bomb— 

205
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,590
 Hey, have you gone mad? 

206
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,340
 If you want to live, is there any other way? 

207
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,300
As of now, you can only win the fight and escape this room first.

208
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,080
It's time for punishment now.

209
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,070
   

210
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,570
N-No, I have—

211
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,340
Hey!

212
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,850
You!

213
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,830
No!

214
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,750
No!

215
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,270
 Honey, I don't want to die. 

216
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,450
 We can really get out alive. Right? 

217
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,960
 Of course, we have to meet again. 

218
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,230
 It took so much for our love to rekindle. 

219
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,210
 Make sure you win and survive. 

220
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,980
 If you don't, I'll kill you in hell, Nam Cheol Woo. 

221
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,150
 Erica and Phillip, wait for me. 

222
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,790
 Mom will come to you. 

223
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,390
 Mom will come and explain everything. 

224
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,770
 I will never abandon you two. 

225
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,040
 I won't suddenly disappear irresponsibly like my parents. 

226
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
 Asshole! 

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,040
 Paeng Hee, don't worry. I won't leave Hannah alone again. 

228
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
 I promised you I'll protect Hannah to the end. 

229
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,940
 K, remember this moment. 

230
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,660
 The day our wicked fate ended. 

231
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,500
 None of you can ever understand 

232
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,810
 the sadness of being a fake son 

233
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,810
 and how petty it is to be robbed of what was given. 

234
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,640
 You became a fake son on your own accord. 

235
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,280
 Kang Ki Tak. 

236
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,190
 This letter is my last letter of apology to you, and 

237
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,850
 it'll also be my dying will. 

238
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,480
 I believe you'll take care of the aftermath nicely. 

239
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,530
 Today, I plan to expose all of our sins through a live stream on Save and kill all of us. 

240
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,480
 I'm sure... 

241
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,950
 I don't deserve a peaceful death, either. 

242
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,710
   

243
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,300
Ra Hee, you were fooled by Hwang Chan Seong.

244
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,820
The livestream isn't happening.

245
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,210
Do Hyeok!

246
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,260
Do Hyeok!

247
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,730
Ra Hee.

248
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,310
Ra Hee!

249
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,290
Ra Hee!

250
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,150
Do Hyeok!

251
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:11,090
 I'm going to repay them for Da Mi's pain as she died from a gunshot. 

252
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,420
 They also need to know 

253
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,870
 what a terrible fear it was. 

254
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,310
Hey, stay put for a second.

255
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,220
Min Do Hyeok,

256
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,600
playing phoenix is over for you today.

257
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,120
Geum Ra Hee, go rot in hell!

258
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,270
There's also a bomb in here.

259
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,320
We have to get out of here.

260
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,550
Geum Ra Hee.

261
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,840
Why are you...

262
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,620
- Jin Mo! 
 - Joo Ran!

263
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,820
You fucking lunatic!

264
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,070
- Honey, hang in there! Honey! 
 - That hurts.

265
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,190
- It hurts! 
 - There's no time.

266
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,090
Hurry!

267
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,880
Geum Ra Hee. You!

268
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,180
Just die!

269
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,790
Honey! Honey!

270
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,720
You can't! You're our kids' father!

271
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,870
 It was decided from the beginning. 

272
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
 That my death will be in vain. 

273
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,720
 Just like Da Mi, who died from a bullet through her heart. 

274
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,620
 Just like Park Nan Young, who burned to death. 

275
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,860
 Just like Lee Hwi So, who was ripped apart by the bomb. 

276
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,510
 Will God allow me to take my revenge? 

277
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,960
Min Do Hyeok, wake up.

278
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,940
You can't die—

279
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,620
Joo Ran, just a bit more.

280
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,510
It's okay.

281
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,286
It's okay. It's okay.

282
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:24,106
It's okay...

283
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:33,006
What a crazy fucking bitch.

284
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:45,456
 A large-scale bomb terror occurred in Gagok District this evening at 7:30 p.m. 

285
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:49,376
 Currently, the police are focused on identifying the exact cause— 

286
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:57,876
Shit. Hey, what's so funny?

287
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,996
Min Do Hyeok is dead.

288
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,736
I killed that bastard.

289
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,406
The fact that fucker isn't here means

290
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:19,006
he kicked the bucket with Geum Ra Hee there.

291
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:22,436
We only need to get our stories straight now.

292
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,716
A mere live stream won't even be a problem.

293
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,596
How will we get rid of Hwang Chan Seong?

294
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,226
That bastard is on Geum Ra Hee's side!

295
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:31,806
I'm going to seal that fucker's mouth myself.

296
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:36,946
First off, we couldn't help but lie because we were blackmailed by Geum Ra Hee.

297
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,106
Because that bitch tried to kill us,

298
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:43,946
we couldn't help but speak as she wanted us to.

299
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:47,976
A cruel mother who even abandoned her daughter because of her menace for money.

300
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:49,876
I'll testify as well.

301
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,266
I'm going to say she stole all of my money.

302
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,826
I can also say my drug case was Geum Ra Hee's trap.

303
00:27:55,826 --> 00:28:00,196
However, will the public believe this?

304
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:04,506
You were partners with Geum Ra Hee.

305
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:07,306
We came this far by using Bang Da Mi.

306
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:09,566
We can say the Chairman was deceived, too.

307
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:14,506
Geum Ra Hee became a murderer who killed the national hero, Min Do Hyeok.

308
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:17,756
Fake news is your specialty.

309
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:22,866
If things go well, we can also cover up our fake marriage case with this.

310
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:29,486
If we get our teamwork right, it's not impossible to do.

311
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,006
Who is it?

312
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:33,826
This area is off-limits!

313
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,896
Congrats on returning from hell alive, everyone.

314
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:49,746
Do you have a death wish?

315
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:53,486
You dare try to kill me with Geum Ra Hee!

316
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,336
Joon Seok.

317
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:02,776
Can you move your face?

318
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:08,146
I still can't get used to your face, you know.

319
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:16,326
Who do you have to thank for having survived all that?

320
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:21,126
If I didn't open the exit, all of you would've died there. You know that?

321
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,956
Right. Want to hear a funny story?

322
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:30,766
Min Do Hyeok didn't die.

323
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:38,546
He's alive.

324
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:50,926
We'll have to rush.

325
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:52,676
Scalpel.

326
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,516
Ki Tak.

327
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:03,006
Gosh, my goodness.

328
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:07,126
You must've been so scared. Look how much you waned.

329
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,326
However, don't worry.

330
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:12,126
The best medical staff are in charge right now.

331
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:15,806
This is my friend's hospital, so it's 100% confidential.

332
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:19,356
I also completely blocked off all reporters.

333
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:22,286
Thank you.

334
00:30:22,926 --> 00:30:26,606
You were the only person I could contact, Chairman Shim.

335
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:32,016
Gosh, you can skip the thanks between us.

336
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:38,626
From now on, you can just call me Mi Young comfortably.

337
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:41,926
Are you not feeling well?

338
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,966
Do Hyeok is in a terrible condition.

339
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:49,976
I'll promise you this. I'll save Min Do Hyeok without fail.

340
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:52,816
I'm Do Hyeok's aunt, his only blood relative.

341
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:57,536
As long as Shim Joon Seok's alive, I'll never let Do Hyeok die.

342
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,166
I might not look it, but I keep all my promises.

343
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,466
The icon of promises.

344
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:06,936
I'll trust you, Mi Young.

345
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:11,376
Where's that bastard right now?

346
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:14,326
I'm looking right now.

347
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:17,206
I think Shim Mi Young made a move.

348
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,036
I guess blood is thicker than water.

349
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:21,616
She ran over when she heard her nephew got hurt.

350
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:23,916
You're telling me he didn't die, huh?

351
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,846
What a persistent bastard. How many times is this?

352
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,806
Min Do Hyeok isn't the problem right now.

353
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,316
What about the live stream?

354
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:31,976
Our sins were exposed to the entire world!

355
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:35,166
We basically got the death sentence in society!

356
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,336
I also took care of that already.

357
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,106
The live stream was called off.

358
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,836
I didn't plan on doing it in the first place.

359
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:48,906
It was just a decoy to fool Geum Ra Hee.

360
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:52,196
Thank you.

361
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:54,426
You saved us.

362
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,966
You're like a god to us.

363
00:31:56,966 --> 00:32:00,576
You're right. A god.

364
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:04,156
Because I have the video of your confessions.

365
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,186
- What? 
 - Please erase it!

366
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,356
What the fuck is this?

367
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:19,496
It's no use. I already backed it up.

368
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:23,116
Do you realize it now?

369
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:27,156
I have total control over your lives now.

370
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,146
Especially you, Shim Joon Seok.

371
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:34,526
I could be your Grim Reaper or your savior.

372
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:37,536
What is it you want?

373
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,396
What I want?

374
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,736
Luca.

375
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,666
- Share it with me. 
 - Are you crazy?

376
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,906
What kind of bullshit is that?

377
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:56,906
Why can't you share it? Are you trying to make a deal in this situation?

378
00:32:56,906 --> 00:33:00,526
Just give it to him! What can be more important than our lives?

379
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:03,936
He's right! We've done everything you told us to so far.

380
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:05,556
But look what happened!

381
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:08,556
That stupid Geum Ra Hee almost killed us in vain!

382
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:11,566
If it's what CEO Hwang wants, we'll help.

383
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:16,436
Whatever it may be, we'll take it away from him if we have to.

384
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,356
Trust us.

385
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:29,636
From this moment, I'm in charge of the terrorist attack in Gagok District.

386
00:33:30,806 --> 00:33:32,306
Yes.

387
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:39,828
 - Where is she? 
 - Cha Joo Ran, come out! 

388
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:42,428
 Where's my money... 

389
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,038
What's this?

390
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:45,458
Come out!

391
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,418
Give me my money back!

392
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,898
Turn around. Turn back.

393
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:51,638
- Why? 
 - Turn around and just go.

394
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:02,518
Mom!

395
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,388
Erica! Phillip!

396
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,878
What about Dad?

397
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:18,578
Is Dad okay?

398
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,878
He just needs to get treated at the hospital.

399
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,318
Don't worry too much.

400
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:32,128
 Ms. Geum Ra Hee announced last night 

401
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:36,868
 that she would air a live stream program called "Confession" at 7 p.m. via Save's portal. 

402
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:40,828
 However, Ms. Geum canceled the livestream abruptly right before it was to begin. 

403
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:45,028
 And committed a bomb terror in Gagok District at 7:30 p.m. 

404
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:47,708
 Through the live stream before the bomb terror, Ms. Geum... 

405
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,358
You're up.

406
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:52,198
How about some morning coffee?

407
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,698
How did you come into my house?

408
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:59,078
I already knew your passcode for a while now.

409
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:08,958
Anyway, Mo Ne, you were beautiful even while sleeping.

410
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:13,568
- You even came into my room? 
 - Yes.

411
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:16,938
I didn't wake you up because you were sleeping so soundly.

412
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:23,698
CEO Geum is gone now. Won't you be lonely in this big house alone?

413
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,958
I should stay over for a while now.

414
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,388
At least until the wedding.

415
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,828
No, it's okay.

416
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,858
There's no need.

417
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:40,578
It's because I just can't relax.

418
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,468
Drink it.

419
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,528
I have a question.

420
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:05,888
Did you also know Geum Ra Hee tried to kill those people

421
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:08,528
at Gagok District, Chan Seong?

422
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,528
Of course.

423
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:13,708
You were originally included in Geum Ra Hee's plan, too.

424
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:17,758
I had to sacrifice someone else to save you, though.

425
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,828
Someone else?

426
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,048
Who is this person?

427
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,328
Of course, it's Min Do Hyeok.

428
00:36:26,328 --> 00:36:29,398
You even told me the method.

429
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:35,088
The key that can summon Min Do Hyeok at any time.

430
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,028
So...

431
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:45,178
did he die?

432
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:56,448
Let's talk about fun stuff.

433
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:01,428
Something exciting will be posted on Save soon.

434
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,158
It just posted.

435
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:26,438
   

436
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,508
 Mom... 

437
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:32,358
 What? You want to tell your parents? 

438
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,778
 Do you want to go back? Then go back! 

439
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,558
 Mom! 

440
00:37:46,428 --> 00:37:48,768
Where did you get this?

441
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,648
I did some fact-checks.

442
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,048
I had to hack Geum Ra Hee's car's black box from six years ago,

443
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:01,238
nearby CCTVs and even Joo Yong Joo's call recording.

444
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,588
It was quite the trouble.

445
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:11,568
Now, then. It's my turn to act now.

446
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:17,658
Watch closely and see how awesome your man is.

447
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:22,158
   

448
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:23,268
   

449
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,238
   

450
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:26,428
   

451
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:37,858
I believe the nation was in shock

452
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,898
after watching the video that was released this morning.

453
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,008
However, they're all facts.

454
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:47,358
Save has been negative toward TikiTaka all this time.

455
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,088
Does it have to do with this matter?

456
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:53,158
Save is not interested in anything else but facts.

457
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:55,408
Here's a question for Chairman Matthew!

458
00:38:55,408 --> 00:39:00,838
Were you in the dark about Geum Ra Hee's domestic abuse toward Bang Da Mi?

459
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:07,118
I'm ashamed, but I didn't know about Geum Ra Hee's dual life at all.

460
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,368
It's all my fault.

461
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:11,078
I found out much too late

462
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:14,838
that she took Da Mi from me to steal her grandfather's money.

463
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:18,138
In addition, she embezzled TikiTaka's corporate funds and

464
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:21,498
didn't hesitate to blackmail politicians for her personal gain.

465
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:26,758
Still, we can't say Chairman Matthew is blameless.

466
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:35,408
I'll accept that.

467
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:39,108
From this moment, I'll resign from TikiTaka's CEO position and

468
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:43,238
comply with police investigations honestly.

469
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,198
 Let's sit over here. 

470
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,648
Wait just a moment here.

471
00:40:02,648 --> 00:40:05,378
I'll get Dad discharged.

472
00:40:09,588 --> 00:40:11,598
Erica, did you come to see your dad?

473
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:13,998
Did you know your parents were a fake couple?

474
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,158
Do your parents use separate bedrooms?

475
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:19,358
Do you eat together? Did you see them fighting?

476
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,028
Hannah, were you ever discriminated against or treated unfairly in foster care?

477
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:27,028
They said mean things and harassed you when no one was looking. Right?

478
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,698
W-We're all reporters. Okay?

479
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:31,488
You can just talk to us comfortably.

480
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,108
Don't get the kids involved!

481
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:38,768
The kids did nothing wrong.

482
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,338
Ask me if you want to know.

483
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,488
Let me ask Candidate Yang in that case.

484
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,548
Will you resign as a candidate for mayor of Seoul?

485
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:48,568
Candidate Yang, how did you become a victim of the Geum Ra Hee incident?

486
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:50,228
Are you sure you weren't an accomplice?

487
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:54,218
Your recording said Hannah will be used for your election. Do you admit that?

488
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,048
Once it's proven that your marriage is fake,

489
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:59,298
there's also a chance Hannah's foster care will be rebuked.

490
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:02,298
We're not a fake family!

491
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:05,998
I know that for sure.

492
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:11,438
Erica and Phillip both love Mr. Jin Mo.

493
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,038
Ahjumma also likes Ahjussi.

494
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:26,818
And I'm grateful to Ahjussi for taking care of my mom and me for a long time.

495
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:29,638
Please move.

496
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:31,808
Let me make this clear here.

497
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:35,378
He'll never resign from a mayor candidate position.

498
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:41,468
All allegations and rumors about our family are to be judged by the voters.

499
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:45,468
   

500
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:49,238
Gosh, it's so delicious!

501
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:52,398
Honey, try the soup, too.

502
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:55,258
It's a killer.

503
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:01,318
- By the way, Honey. 
 - Yes?

504
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,708
Do you really have money?

505
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,928
Why do you keep asking? You can't trust me?

506
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:10,048
Trusting you and being completely broke are two different things.

507
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:11,588
   

508
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:15,198
Here's a lesson for you. Okay?

509
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,528
Right now, who is our captain?

510
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:20,808
Matthew.

511
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:23,708
He got totally got crushed.

512
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,588
Who is it, then?

513
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:28,098
Oh, there she comes.

514
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,258
Mo Ne is our captain?

515
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:37,388
Gosh, no. It's Hwang Chan Seong!

516
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,368
It was Cleopatra for Rome's Antonius.

517
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,258
Yang Guifei controlled Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty.

518
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,868
Who do you think controls Hwang Chan Seong?

519
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:45,958
Oh, we're here.

520
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:49,138
Madam.

521
00:43:07,058 --> 00:43:08,998
Mo Ne!

522
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:14,468
Goodness, you're here, CEO!

523
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:20,228
Welcome, CEO Hwang.

524
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:25,628
What brings you two here?

525
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:29,358
They have nowhere to go because Geum Ra Hee took everything.

526
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,528
Technically speaking, we've got shares on this house, too.

527
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,538
Because we lost all our money because of Geum Ra Hee's schemes.

528
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:40,498
We won't set foot outside of this house until we get that money back.

529
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:51,078
You didn't drag these people in intentionally, right, Mo Ne?

530
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:53,248
How could I?

531
00:43:53,248 --> 00:43:57,058
I allowed them because I thought you'd feel more at ease to have them here

532
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:59,318
than for me to be alone in this house.

533
00:44:01,688 --> 00:44:05,798
Gosh! You even brought flowers.

534
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:12,548
I'll be in your care, CEO Hwang.

535
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:17,718
Oh, you should marry Mo Ne and get a new home quickly.

536
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:22,878
We'll take great care of this house, so don't worry.

537
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:26,848
Why don't you just have Save take over TikiTaka completely?

538
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:29,498
Just destroy Shim Joon Seok, that little brat.

539
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:32,528
We'll give you all the support!

540
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:34,858
- Bam! 
 - Bam!

541
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:36,778
I love you, Honey.

542
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:38,758
Thank you.

543
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:43,138
 Hwang Chan Seong, let's bring it on. 

544
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,618
 I'll show you I'm definitely not an easy prey. 

545
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,478
Geum Ra Hee.

546
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:05,968
Geum Ra Hee.

547
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:10,038
Do Hyeok, are you awake?

548
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:17,838
Can you recognize me?

549
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:21,328
You've been unconscious for a week.

550
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:26,068
It's okay. You can rest assured now.

551
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:28,178
Hyung.

552
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:30,948
Geum Ra Hee was...

553
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:33,118
Geum Ra Hee was...

554
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:46,848
Throw all of it out, please.

555
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:49,608
You can keep anything you like.

556
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,908
This is heaven.

557
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:07,298
Who could you be?

558
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,638
   
   

559
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:11,818
   
   

560
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,478
Huh?

561
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:25,028
Hello? This is Cha Joo Ran.

562
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:28,498
Geez, Dr. Cha, it's been a while.

563
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,458
Fancy to have you call me first.

564
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:33,818
What do you mean all my debts were paid off? I just got the text.

565
00:46:33,818 --> 00:46:35,648
 Oh, that. 

566
00:46:35,648 --> 00:46:38,678
Geum Ra Hee's representative came by and paid it all off.

567
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:41,848
Geum Ra Hee did? Aren't you mistaken?

568
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:44,568
 He said he won't pay off anything besides your debt. 

569
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:49,888
He said there mustn't be any victims who lose money because they lent you money.

570
00:46:51,148 --> 00:46:54,328
He was quite cut and dry.

571
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:57,038
Okay, I-I understand.

572
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:02,848
Right. Let's never meet again while I'm alive!

573
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:08,828
Wait! H-Hold on.

574
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:10,858
You can leave that box.

575
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:23,918
Geum Ra Hee, what's this now?

576
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:26,678
Why would you pay off my debt?

577
00:47:27,508 --> 00:47:29,888
That's not like you.

578
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:41,798
Could it be you were planning to die in the first place?

579
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:43,428
Why?

580
00:47:47,118 --> 00:47:49,278
Why on earth would you?

581
00:48:00,048 --> 00:48:01,648
You were alive?

582
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:04,758
Why are you contacting me only now?

583
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:07,488
How do you feel? Are you okay?

584
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:10,318
Can you be outside like this?

585
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:20,478
There's something I couldn't tell you yet.

586
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:26,318
At the reservoir back then, the one who died in Shim Joon Seok's place...

587
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:31,258
was your brother, Cheong Soo.

588
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:34,548
What?

589
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,258
Everyone's gone mad.

590
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:46,878
Why are you telling me that now?

591
00:48:46,878 --> 00:48:49,838
Who did it? It was K, right?

592
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,798
And I'm sure Geum Ra Hee helped him.

593
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:54,798
Geum Ra Hee.

594
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,308
Geum Ra Hee.

595
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:59,478
Geum Ra Hee, that woman deserved to die.

596
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,758
You're right. But she shouldn't have died like that.

597
00:49:03,758 --> 00:49:09,178
She shouldn't have suffered at the hands of Hwang Chan Seong.

598
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:13,338
The one who saved me...

599
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:16,288
was Geum Ra Hee.

600
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,068
You're doing this because she saved you?

601
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:19,698
Were you moved or something?

602
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,628
She must've had a reason.

603
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,558
K and Geum Ra Hee are both psychopaths!

604
00:49:24,558 --> 00:49:27,768
They're lunatics who killed my mom and brother!

605
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:29,968
Han Mo Ne.

606
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:33,158
There's something you must know about your mother.

607
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,028
My mom? What is it?

608
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:40,858
This is the letter Geum Ra Hee left with Ki Tak.

609
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,388
 I have a confession to make. 

610
00:49:51,048 --> 00:49:55,468
 Mo Ne's mom is alive. 

611
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,078
 I hated Mo Ne to death. 

612
00:50:00,378 --> 00:50:02,678
 But I couldn't harm that woman. 

613
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,268
 Thank you. 

614
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:08,698
 She said she's thankful for me. 

615
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:14,198
 Unaware her son was dead right in front of her, 

616
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:16,138
 she kept thanking me. 

617
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,388
 Bring me a corpse of a woman without family or friends. 

618
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:21,538
 As soon as possible. 

619
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:28,178
Long time no see, So Yeon.

620
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:30,368
Have you been well?

621
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:34,668
What brings you to my house?

622
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:38,808
You'll have to help me out.

623
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:43,248
First off, shall we pack your things?

624
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:52,068
Huh? This woman is...

625
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,258
She's Mo Ne's mom.

626
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:55,378
What?

627
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:57,818
Take care of her for now.

628
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:01,828
You mustn't let anyone see her.

629
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:05,938
No phones, either. Just bring her food to eat.

630
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,638
Make sure she's comfortable.

631
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:20,008
 But unfortunately, Hwang Chan Seong caught me. 

632
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:22,688
 Hwang Chan Seong has her right now. 

633
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,948
 Please find Mo Ne's mom for me. 

634
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:29,378
 Because that woman is innocent. 

635
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,088
My mom is...

636
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,818
My mom is alive?

637
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:38,738
Is this true? Is this letter really true?

638
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:40,598
I can't guarantee, either.

639
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,228
But it's worth confirming.

640
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:47,828
Hwang Chan Seong, that fucker put on that show while he had my mom?

641
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:49,468
That fucking lunatic!

642
00:51:49,468 --> 00:51:50,798
Don't get worked up.

643
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:53,078
Let go. Let go!

644
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,428
No, I'm sure it's not.

645
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:57,938
I'm sure it's all lies.

646
00:51:57,938 --> 00:51:59,478
Why would she save my mom?

647
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,718
Geum Ra Hee was different from K.

648
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,918
In the end, at least.

649
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:06,328
That woman was going to kill us all and survive alone in the first place!

650
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:08,328
That's why she stole Cha Joo Ran's money.

651
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,458
That's why she was punished by dying alone.

652
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:16,188
Geum Ra Hee was going to die in that place from the beginning.

653
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:23,088
I couldn't understand it, either. Also, the fact that Geum Ra Hee was Medusa.

654
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:27,728
But everyone...

655
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:30,968
changes without an exception.

656
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:39,548
Just like a thug like me wishes to live like a human being for once,

657
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:41,988
Geum Ra Hee must've also felt...

658
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:44,858
the same way, at least once.

659
00:52:44,858 --> 00:52:46,538
I don't want to hear it!

660
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,978
What do you know about that woman to be running your mouth?

661
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:37,108
 If... 

662
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,948
 If you happen to... 

663
00:53:41,268 --> 00:53:44,888
 find even a handful of my ashes, 

664
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:49,338
 please throw it away far from Da Mi. 

665
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:52,648
 So, she won't run into me even in death. 

666
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:55,888
 Is it an unnecessary worry? 

667
00:53:56,938 --> 00:53:59,478
 Because Da Mi will be in heaven and 

668
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:02,268
 I'll be in hell. 

669
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:04,978
 Da Mi. 

670
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:09,678
 You met... 

671
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,268
 your mom and dad in heaven. Right? 

672
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,068
 Please be happy there. 

673
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:35,708
I did everything you asked for.

674
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:39,548
I took care of all of Cha Joo Ran's debt.

675
00:54:39,548 --> 00:54:42,778
So that no one would be at a loss.

676
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,158
 Geum Ra Hee. 

677
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:13,528
 Since when did she wear a prosthetic leg? 

678
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:14,878
 Why did she hide it? 

679
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,698
 What were you trying to gain by doing that? 

680
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:19,858
 You hated me so much. 

681
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,428
 Why did you save my mom? 

682
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:50,338
   

683
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:54,578
   

684
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:57,798
 I found out who gave me the sketchbook and crayons. 

685
00:55:57,798 --> 00:55:58,948
 Who was it? 

686
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:00,988
 It's Dimple CEO. 

687
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:04,448
 I think she's been watching me for a long time. 

688
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:07,538
Why would Geum Ra Hee do that?

689
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,608
Why did she give this sketchbook to Hannah?

690
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:17,958
Only Geum Ra Hee would know why she did that.

691
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:22,068
This doesn't add up.

692
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:24,928
Geum Ra Hee knew where Hannah was.

693
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:28,838
If she were to use Hannah, she should've notified Matthew first. However,

694
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,268
she was actually hiding Hannah.

695
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:38,358
   

696
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:41,368
Do you think she was regretting?

697
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:43,778
Regretting?

698
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:45,788
The case of Da Mi.

699
00:56:46,688 --> 00:56:49,818
At least, when she was visiting Hannah,

700
00:56:49,818 --> 00:56:53,708
Hannah might've been in Da Mi's place.

701
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:09,048
   

702
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,438
Do you think that could've been the case?

703
00:57:15,818 --> 00:57:18,098
Could Geum Ra Hee have been...

704
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:21,378
a mom, after all?

705
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:42,338
   

706
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,758
   

707
00:58:08,758 --> 00:58:13,648
   

708
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:36,998
 Ra Hee, I don't think I can carry out one of your requests. 

709
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:39,688
   

710
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:42,508
 You can be next to Da Mi. 

711
00:58:43,508 --> 00:58:47,078
 Meet Da Mi and seek her forgiveness in person. 

712
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,588
 Da Mi... 

713
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:06,918
Geum Ra Hee!

714
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:11,178
To you and to your daughter,

715
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:12,778
I'm not sorry for a damn thing!

716
00:59:12,778 --> 00:59:14,268
   

717
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:19,978
I'm not going to ask for forgiveness, either!

718
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:22,838
I'm not thankful at all

719
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:25,508
about you saving my mom, either.

720
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:30,488
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

721
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:34,708
Why did you go that far to torment me? Why?

722
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:44,048
The cemetery in the middle of the night?

723
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:46,388
It feels so eerie.

724
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:48,338
Honey, did you follow me—

725
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:49,788
Do you have Othello syndrome?

726
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:53,148
What are you saying? I also got the text.

727
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:55,078
Othello syndrome?

728
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:05,348
Don't ask me.

729
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:09,568
I don't know why I came here, either.

730
01:00:26,058 --> 01:00:30,958
 Geum Ra Hee, your death wasn't in vain. 

731
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:35,958
 Because you moved us at least a step forward. 

732
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:32,318
♫  By the window of a small house in the forest  ♫

733
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:37,688
♫  A small child stood up  ♫

734
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:41,208
 Eat up and grow well, my babies. 

735
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:44,188
 Should Mommy give you some more water? 

736
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:01,808
 What's this? 

737
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:11,048
   

738
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:36,878
 Children who were abandoned by their biological parents. 

739
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,438
 Children who weren't protected like Da Mi. 

740
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:43,328
 Please use my money for them. 

741
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:47,778
 I'm sorry for resenting you all my life. 

742
01:02:47,778 --> 01:02:49,838
 Kang Ki Tak. 

743
01:02:54,028 --> 01:02:55,908
 And also... 

744
01:02:57,348 --> 01:03:00,078
 for resenting your daughter. 

745
01:03:05,258 --> 01:03:12,278
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

746
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:19,248
   

747
01:03:19,248 --> 01:03:21,118
 It's time for all of you to decide. 

748
01:03:21,118 --> 01:03:23,158
 What do we need to do? 

749
01:03:23,158 --> 01:03:24,648
 Are you worried about me right now? 

750
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:26,578
 People would think you're really my wife. 

751
01:03:26,578 --> 01:03:28,038
 I mean it. 

752
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,538
 We need power. I'm planning to use Seongchan. 

753
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:33,308
 Shouldn't we find a way to coexist? 

754
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:35,108
 What do you say? Do you want to join forces with me? 

755
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:37,588
 This won't do. I'll move into Hwang Chan Seong's house. 

756
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:40,718
 Don't look at me like that. You know I'm not a bad person. 

757
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:42,008
 Ki Tak disappeared! 

758
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:46,138
 Please don't do this. Our enemy is K.
