2
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,460
   

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,210
   

4
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,690
   

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,280
We're not late. Hurry up and go inside.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,900
Hyung, please check in on Han Mo Ne.

7
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,520
It bothers me how he suddenly canceled their dinner and came back.

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,670
Okay, you get going.

9
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:18,620
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

10
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,640
You have to be punished.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,210
You can never leave this house again.

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,890
You'll rot in this house

13
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,750
by my side for the rest of your life!

14
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,600
In this room where your mom...

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,550
was confined.

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,340
Watch with your own eyes how terribly she dies because of

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,450
her daughter who broke her promise.

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,940
No, you can't!

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,140
No, don't do it!

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,660
Where's Yoon Ji Sook right now?

21
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,550
Hold her down right now.

22
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,530
I'm going to kill that bitch myself.

23
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,990
I came in here to kill you.

24
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,190
I don't give a damn what happens to my life!

25
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,990
But I won't let you harass my mother and Min Do Hyeok anymore.

26
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,190
I've never loved a monster like you.

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,130
Please...

28
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,410
Please just die!

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,450
Y-You—

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,540
A monster?

31
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,010
Me?

32
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,050
I won't die alone like this.

33
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm going to die with you if I have to die.

34
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,360
Because we'll be together forever.

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,090
You're bound to die...

36
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,860
by Kang Ki Tak's hands if I'm not around.

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,420
You didn't know, did you?

38
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,490
That bastard is Bang Da Mi's biological father.

39
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,670
What?

40
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,540
Rather than get killed by that asshole...

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,660
just...

42
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,680
just...

43
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,350
let's just die together.

44
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,480
Kang Ki Tak, you son of a—

45
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,130
I love you.

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,310
Do Hyeok told me to check in on you.

47
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm glad I didn't come too late.

48
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,840
 That fucker is Bang Da Mi's biological father. 

49
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,840
Han Mo Ne.

50
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,840
Can you hear me?

51
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,740
Is it true...

52
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,670
that you're Da Mi's biological father?

53
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,970
But why'd you help me?

54
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm sure you'd wish for my death more than anyone else.

55
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,950
It was a chance to avenge your daughter without dirtying your own hands.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,650
But why'd you save me?

57
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,570
Whether it be revenge or forgiveness...

58
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,980
it's not up to me.

59
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,890
You can ask Da Mi and

60
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,710
her parents...

61
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,690
who raised her for their forgiveness.

62
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,970
I don't have the right.

63
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,020
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm so sorry.

65
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,420
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,830
I'll take care of the body first.

67
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,500
Was he expecting someone?

68
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,250
I think it's the housekeepers.

69
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,910
I told them to take the day off, but I guess Chan Seong called them over.

70
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,370
I think they're trying to come in.

71
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,230
Buy me some time.

72
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,720
I'll take care of this somehow.

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,180
What brings you in?

74
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,160
CEO Hwang told us to come.

75
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,860
He said the dinner plan was canceled, so he needed to eat at home.

76
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,670
I prepared a simple meal.

77
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,000
You can go back.

78
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,200
Where's CEO Hwang...

79
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,140
right now?

80
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,950
I must see CEO Hwang before I leave.

81
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,400
He just went in...

82
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,950
to take a shower.

83
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,100
You'll be in trouble if you interrupt our private time.

84
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,710
I still need to see him in person—

85
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,800
   

86
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,880
Yes. I just received a text from CEO Hwang.

87
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,600
All right. Please have a nice time.

88
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,510
Did they leave?

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,830
We need to take the body outside.

90
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,440
Pack whatever you need. You need to come with me, too.

91
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,100
No, I'll stay in this house.

92
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,180
What are you saying?

93
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,800
The housekeepers and bodyguards live right next door.

94
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,410
Getting rid of the body without them catching on is impossible.

95
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,180
If Hwang Chan Seong's death gets out,

96
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,260
K will realize Min Do Hyeok has accessed Luca.

97
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,020
And all of Min Do Hyeok's plans will fail.

98
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,540
I need to keep communicating with K

99
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,210
as if I were Hwang Chan Seong so he won't get suspicious.

100
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,040
With Hwang Chan Seong's phone.

101
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,070
Don't give me that nonsense.

102
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,780
Are you saying you'll live with a corpse?

103
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,980
I can do it. This is nothing to me.

104
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,780
Everything will be over once Luca's information is exposed.

105
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
There's nothing we can guarantee right now.

106
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,230
No one can stop me.

107
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,580
If there's anything hindering this plan,

108
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,190
I'll get rid of them all.

109
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,220
Where are you going to keep the corpse?

110
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,610
I know just the right space.

111
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,210
Did Ki Tak contact me?

112
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,870
 Hwang Chan Seong is dead. 

113
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,010
 He knew we were at his house. 

114
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,400
 So we had to get rid of him. 

115
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,250
 Mo Ne is okay, so don't worry. 

116
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,240
It's great to see you often.

117
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,100
The investigation has to be sped up to full throttle.

118
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,470
So I can devour Gagok District in one bite.

119
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,750
You're bound to choke on food eaten in a rush.

120
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,220
Why worry when we've got the digestive medicine?

121
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,630
We already turned Min Do Hyeok into a murderer by driving public opinion.

122
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,740
If we give them too much time, we don't know what crazy plot they'll come up with.

123
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,240
So, what is it you want?

124
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Issue the arrest warrant on Min Do Hyeok and place Kang Ki Tak on the wanted list.

125
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,080
Min Do Hyeok is sternly denying the allegations.

126
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,480
What's more, Kang Ki Tak has a clue about the hacking network.

127
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
That's why...

128
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,780
we must strike first!

129
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,790
Before that bastard, Kang Ki Tak strikes us.

130
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,070
It's a shame to lose the network that cost a fortune,

131
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,440
but we'll have to lose it for the bigger cause.

132
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,100
It was them.

133
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,600
The ones helping K.

134
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,910
The root of evil.

135
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,940
 Putting on a show in key positions of the government, saying they care about the people. 

136
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,540
 Yet they create fake news for personal gain behind their backs. 

137
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,490
 Those pig bastards with a terrible stench. 

138
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,540
I won't let a single one of them escape.

139
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,460
 Start driving Kang Ki Tak into a corner publicly. 

140
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,760
 Make sure Save foments the public opinion accordingly! 

141
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,150
   

142
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,240
I heard from Matthew.

143
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,100
He says drive Kang Ki Tak into a corner.

144
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,840
Looks like he'll switch gears by putting out a bounty on you.

145
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,040
I was ready for it.

146
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,610
In case something were to happen to me,

147
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,300
Do Hyeok's plan must succeed.

148
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,180
Why are you saying something like that?

149
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,740
 You just never know. 

150
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,190
 I'm worried about Do Hyeok. 

151
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect him at some point.

152
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,840
 Let me ask you. 

153
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,810
 Please don't abandon Do Hyeok to the end. 

154
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,840
   

155
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,540
   

156
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll speak on the progress made so far in the investigations of

157
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,400
Gagok District and Mayor Yang Jin Mo's murder.

158
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,900
The late Mayor Yang Jin Mo was continually blackmailed by

159
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,770
CEO Min Do Hyeok of Seongchan Group regarding the

160
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,480
development of Gagok District.

161
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,260
The suspect, CEO Min Do Hyeok, kidnapped Mayor Yang's children

162
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,690
when he refused to follow his orders.

163
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,640
Mayor Yang, while attempting to rescue his children...

164
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,740
W-What's this?

165
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,320
lost his life.

166
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,570
It's the Director of the National Intelligence Service!

167
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm the Director of NIS, Park Moo Hyeok.

168
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,060
An anonymous report on Gagok District came into the NIS last night.

169
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,970
 The report stated that there's a hacking network installed under Gagok District. 

170
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,230
 Accordingly, the NIS started investigating right away. 

171
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,170
And as the report stated, we found the hacking network.

172
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,530
   

173
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,400
We believe Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak secretly installed Gagok District's hacking network

174
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,450
to steal classified intel from the government and corporations.

175
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,660
 This is a clear act of terrorism putting national security at risk. 

176
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,670
 Thus, Kang Ki Tak, the mastermind, is hereby wanted. 

177
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,540
But something feels off.

178
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,960
Min Do Hyeok is obediently staying locked up and

179
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,770
Kang Ki Tak isn't doing anything right now.

180
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,840
And why is that asshole Hwang Chan Seong so quiet?

181
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,710
He'd always call me being anxious.

182
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,040
   

183
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,540
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

184
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,840
Luca, check Hwang Chan Seong's last access log.

185
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,740
 CEO Hwang Chan Seong is currently logged in. 

186
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
Secretary Chae!

187
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,920
   

188
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,160
   

189
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,440
- Where's CEO Hwang? 
 - He's home.

190
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,040
He's taking a few days off due to the flu.

191
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,530
A flu out of nowhere?

192
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,380
 I guess you're really sick. You can't even answer your phone. 

193
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,770
 Taking off work at such an important time like now? 

194
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,640
 I don't think I can go anywhere for a while. 

195
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,500
 Don't worry. Save will be posting the articles as planned. 

196
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,650
 Something's off. 

197
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,450
 He doesn't sound like his usual self. 

198
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,490
 He'd never answer me so obediently. 

199
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,570
Yes! Yes, don't worry, Attorney General.

200
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,220
Go Myeong Ji won't say otherwise.

201
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,450
Her kids' lives are on the line here.

202
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,090
 What about the kids' whereabouts? 

203
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,620
I'm doing all I can to look.

204
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,400
But there hasn't been much progress so far.

205
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,190
Go Myeong Ji really doesn't seem to know, either.

206
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,420
 Prosecutor Kang, this is your ticket to super fast promotion. 

207
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,940
Yes, thank you, Attorney General!

208
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,810
I'll wrap up the investigation, sir.

209
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,980
Yes, sir!

210
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,220
Go Myeong Ji, you'll have to be on alert.

211
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,660
The situation isn't in your favor.

212
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,270
They started to attack Kang Ki Tak seriously now.

213
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,460
Prosecutor Kang, why are you helping me?

214
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,560
If the Attorney General finds out, you'll be in deep trouble.

215
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,580
Not all prosecutors are as pathetic as people think.

216
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,210
If you give up on stuff like getting promoted to chief prosecutor,

217
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,120
you've got nothing to fear as a prosecutor.

218
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,130
I've got nothing to gain from them, so the higher-ups don't scare me at all.

219
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,890
You're something else.

220
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,730
There's nothing fancy about being a prosecutor.

221
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,180
Our pride is all we live by.

222
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,820
Shall we go for a quick drive?

223
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,540
- Sorry? 
 - Hurry now.

224
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,840
I already told the guards the investigation will take longer than expected.

225
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,540
Where are we headed?

226
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,740
The kids are at Geum Ra Hee's residence.

227
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,690
I can let you stay there only up to six in the evening.

228
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,710
They'll get suspicious if it goes beyond that time.

229
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,190
Prosecutor...

230
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,980
I'll escort you there. Hurry up.

231
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,640
Thank you...

232
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,340
Thank you so much!

233
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,410
To late Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo, who lost his life in an unfortunate accident,

234
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,990
and his bereaved family,

235
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,910
I express deep and sincere condolences.

236
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:35,710
The government plans to actively support the high-tech city project, which was

237
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:42,550
the late former Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo's last project of interest.

238
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,080
I hereby state...

239
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,580
all development rights are to be assigned to TikiTaka.

240
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,350
Furthermore, I also thank Chairman Matthew for

241
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:06,650
his outstanding work in helping to reveal all truths.

242
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,110
Good job.

243
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm proud of you. I really am.

244
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,580
Do you know how worried the little ones were?

245
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,410
Worried that they'd lose their mom, too.

246
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,720
The kids also know everything?

247
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,240
I didn't tell them, but I think they caught on.

248
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,680
At least Erica and Phillip cried.

249
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,520
But Hannah won't even cry.

250
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,040
Erica. Phillip!

251
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,910
Mommy!

252
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,330
It's Mommy.

253
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,350
Mommy is so sorry for coming late.

254
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,480
Mom, I missed you.

255
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
I missed you so much that I thought I'd go crazy.

256
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,430
Mommy, are you all better now?

257
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,120
You're not sick anymore?

258
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,490
You don't have to go to the hospital again?

259
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,550
Mommy's all better now.

260
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,520
My babies, I'm sorry for making you worry.

261
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,010
But about Dad...

262
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,560
So, we'll never get to see Dad again?

263
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,730
We can't meet him again?

264
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,980
What do we do about Dad?

265
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,460
I feel so sorry for Dad!

266
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,680
Dad is the one who saved us. Right?

267
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,010
Where's Hannah?

268
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,850
- Hannah? 
 - Yes.

269
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,850
She was with them. Where did she go?

270
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,680
Hannah!

271
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,780
Hannah.

272
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,050
You didn't miss me?

273
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,280
I missed Hannah.

274
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,590
Can you let me see your face, please?

275
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,240
Hannah.

276
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,610
It's all my fault.

277
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,170
If only I wasn't here,

278
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:38,080
you and Ahjussi both would've been happy.

279
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,470
I'm so sorry, Ahjumma.

281
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,010
Ahjussi died because of me.

282
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,050
Hannah.

283
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,000
It's all my fault.

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm sorry.

285
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,820
I'm so sorry, Ahjumma.

286
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,260
I'm sorry.

287
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,190
Who said such a thing?

288
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,610
I'm so glad to have you.

289
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:11,020
Erica and Phillip relied on you so much, too. So don't say such a thing.

290
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,620
I'm sorry, Hannah.

291
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,070
For taking you to Chairman Matthew back then.

292
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,620
I must've gone mad.

293
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,120
I must've...

294
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,740
I missed you.

295
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,920
Ahjumma, I missed you so much.

296
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,580
I'm sorry, Hannah!

297
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,360
I'm sorry!

298
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

299
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,290
Are we done investigating Go Myeong Ji?

300
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,300
I was told she went home at 6:00.

301
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,800
Anything suspicious about Prosecutor Kang?

302
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,720
No, he's very friendly with the Attorney General these days.

303
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,230
The loonies sure get along well.

304
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,900
 Hey, Detective Oh, anything going on? 

305
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,810
Are you keeping a good watch on that Min Do Hyeok?

306
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,240
 Yes, Chairman. Nothing's wrong here. 

307
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,110
Stop calling, seriously. You perverted stalker.

308
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,960
What a nutcase.

309
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,880
He's still full of energy.

310
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,610
Chan Seong.

311
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,410
 CEO Hwang, I know you're home. 

312
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,950
 If you don't open the door, I'll break it open. 

313
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,010
- Break it down. 
 - Yes, Chairman.

314
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,260
Wait for me there!

315
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,160
I heard he told you he was sick.

316
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,880
And you insist on coming all the way here.

317
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,220
I stopped by to pay him a visit.

318
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,730
Where's CEO Hwang?

319
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,890
Let me see him for a minute.

320
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,400
He took medicine and fell asleep.

321
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,380
Wake him up, then.

322
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,380
If he can text, he must not be deathly sick.

323
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,820
He's sick.

324
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,840
He lost his voice, too.

325
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,130
I'm surprised...

326
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,730
at how much you worry about Hwang Chan Seong.

327
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,960
In that case, I'll just wait for him while having a drink.

328
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,770
CEO Hwang recently said he's got a good port wine.

329
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,380
You need to go to the basement for that.

330
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,090
The housekeepers aren't here today.

331
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,350
Your husband is sick, but the housekeepers took the day off?

332
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,900
I guess the flu broke out only in this house, huh?

333
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,040
What are you doing? Aren't you going to get the wine?

334
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,990
I can't go, can I? This isn't even my house.

335
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,970
Don't even think about waking up Chan Seong.

336
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,910
Bring me a good one.

337
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,680
CEO Hwang?

338
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,450
CEO Hwang!

339
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,030
Chan Seong, where are you?

340
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,030
Hwang Chan Seong?

341
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,490
Chan Seong.

342
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,650
Hwang Chan Seong would at least show his face if he knew I was here.

343
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,970
Chan Seong.

344
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,010
Chan Seong.

345
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,400
Where are you?

346
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,710
Whoa!  What kind of a place is this?

347
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
K found out everything.

348
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,040
That Hwang Chan Seong is dead, and Min Do Hyeok was here.

349
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,350
Get out of the house before the police arrive!

350
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,970
What about Hwang Chan Seong's body?

351
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,440
Do as I say!

352
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,920
I'll take care of the rest.

353
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,060
Follow her.

354
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,290
Yes, Mo Ne. Hurry up and go.

355
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,450
Whether it's Kang Ki Tak or Cha Joo Ran and Nam Cheol Woo.

356
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,550
I already found out about your plans anyway.

357
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,190
Where's the burner phone?

358
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,200
It's right here.

359
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,210
 Yes, this is the police. 

360
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,380
A-A person is dead. Please help.

361
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,900
 Where are you calling from? 

362
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,550
It's Hwang Chan Seong's house.

363
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,130
CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save.

364
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,420
I also know the culprit. It's Min Do Hyeok.

365
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,990
Min Do Hyeok escaped the police station and is on a serial killing spree.

366
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,920
N-No, no—

367
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,700
Did Min Do Hyeok really kill CEO Hwang?

368
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
As if.

369
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,800
I think Han Mo Ne killed him.

370
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,070
Hwang Chan Seong must've found out Min Do Hyeok accessed Luca.

371
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,740
So, she couldn't help but kill him.

372
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,440
Gosh, how bold.

373
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,480
She killed her husband and even put up an act pretending to be him.

374
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,610
If Min Do Hyeok had accessed Luca, wouldn't it be a serious problem?

375
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,060
It must contain all the secrets of the Trillion Family.

376
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,250
They're asking for their deaths, so I can't help it.

377
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,290
I'll have to silence them by killing them.

378
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,590
I think I'm being followed.

379
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,500
We can't let him find out the location, so I'll take a detour for now.

380
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,050
No, just go.

381
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,720
I'll help you lose them.

382
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,500
What are you saying? Where are you right now?

383
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,290
Just trust me and go!

384
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,040
Don't ever stop your car!

385
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,480
What's this?

386
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,570
Kang Ki Tak.

387
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,140
Yes, I got it, Commissioner General.

388
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,080
   

389
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,070
Follow me!

390
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,280
 The call is not going through... 

391
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,910
It's weird. I can't reach Kang Ki Tak.

392
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,570
It's not connecting at all.

393
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,910
W-What's going on? I lost access to Luca, too.

394
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,510
   

395
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,310
Detective Jeong, I told you not to come in without my permission!

396
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,530
Oh Sang Sik! You're under arrest for abetting homicide and obstruction of investigation.

397
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,810
Arrest him!

398
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,020
What are you doing?

399
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,980
Abetting homicide? On what grounds?

400
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,110
CEO Hwang Chan Seong is dead.

401
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,950
And the culprit is Min Do Hyeok.

402
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,650
Take him away!

403
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,130
Min Do Hyeok didn't do it! Detective Jeong, hear me out!

404
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,850
I'll explain what happened—

405
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,260
Min Do Hyeok, your arrest warrant has been issued just now.

406
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,670
You'll be transferred to the Seoul Detention Center.

407
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,610
Hold him down.

408
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,900
- Let go. 
 - Stay still!

409
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,180
Let go of me!

410
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:42,044
Where's Ki Tak?

411
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:45,534
Why isn't he here? It's way past the time he said he'd come.

412
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:48,984
I lost contact with him suddenly.

413
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:52,224
You lost contact? Since when and why?

414
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,134
I'll be right back.

415
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:58,714
I think something's going wrong.

416
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:00,944
- Where are you going? 
 - To Min Do Hyeok.

417
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:03,124
If they got Kang Ki Tak, it means they got Min Do Hyeok, too.

418
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,874
- I need to go. 
 - Be careful.

419
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,464
Run if you think you'll get caught.

420
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,924
Why would I get caught? No one's as nimble as me.

421
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:25,154
 Breaking news. CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save was found dead. 

422
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:28,424
 CEO Hwang was found to be murdered in his residence. 

423
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:33,244
 The police confirmed Min Do Hyeok, the alleged killer of Mayor Yang, as the culprit 

424
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:35,024
 and made an emergency arrest. 

425
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:38,504
 It is believed that Min Do Hyeok escaped the police station with the help 

426
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:42,194
 from the detective in charge and murdered CEO Hwang. 

427
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:49,114
   

428
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:50,354
You saw the news. Right?

429
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:54,064
Min Do Hyeok was moved to the detention center, and Detective Oh is being interrogated, too.

430
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:56,774
- Any word from Kang Ki Tak? 
 - Not yet.

431
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,524
Hurry up and come back, Honey. Don't do anything alone.

432
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:01,554
Okay?

433
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,874
I'll turn myself in.

434
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,564
I killed Hwang Chan Seong.

435
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,164
Min Do Hyeok knows nothing.

436
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:17,014
Who would believe that?

437
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:20,014
They'll fabricate anything to make Do Hyeok a murderer.

438
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:23,644
You and Do Hyeok even had a scandal!

439
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:26,574
The truth never matters.

440
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:30,394
 People imagine as they please and talk of more stimulating things. 

441
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:32,254
 Because it's more fun that way. 

442
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:35,294
 Because they make more money, the more they talk. 

443
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,164
So, wait for the right time.

444
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,564
There's no time to waste!

445
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:43,834
You think K will sit back if he finds out Min Do Hyeok accessed Luca?

446
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,194
He'll try to kill him!

447
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:48,054
Did I say I'll just let him die?

448
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,664
Joon Seok, that son of a bitch.

449
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:56,174
He better not lay a finger on my nephew. I'll yank all his hair!

450
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,224
Do Hyeok is the only

451
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:03,544
family I have left now.

452
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,584
Kang Ki Tak! Let me ask you just one question.

453
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:18,204
Why do you keep messing with me like this?

454
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:21,414
You can find out for yourself.

455
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:24,344
It didn't make sense from the beginning.

456
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,864
Even if Geum Ra Hee was your first love,

457
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:31,324
you helped that old man Bang Chil Seong for a woman like her,

458
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:33,174
assisted Min Do Hyeok,

459
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:37,064
and you're now defending Han Mo Ne?

460
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:41,164
For the revenge of Bang Da Mi, whom you have nothing to do with,

461
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:46,234
there's no reason for you to be working this hard.

462
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:49,314
I told you not to utter that name with your mouth!

463
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:52,204
So, I gave it some thought.

464
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,074
Is Bang Da Mi your daughter?

465
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,484
I'm right!

466
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:07,444
You're that wench, Bang Da Mi's dad!

467
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:10,964
Man, everything's starting to make sense now.

468
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:14,064
And that's why you helped Min Do Hyeok.

469
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:16,194
Am I wrong?

470
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,954
Hey, you asshole. I'm going to kill you.

471
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:25,344
I'm going to kill you off!

472
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:27,674
Why you little!

473
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:32,414
What were you trying to do by accessing Luca?

474
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,334
What's Min Do Hyeok's plan?

475
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:38,154
If you tell me, I'll spare your life.

476
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,744
Hey...

477
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:47,194
you think I'd negotiate with an animal?

478
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:48,774
I see.

479
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:53,774
In that case, I'll send you to your daughter myself.

480
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,604
Chairman, it's a call from the Attorney General.

481
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:28,114
Yes, Attorney General. It's me.

482
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:29,414
Where's Min Do Hyeok?

483
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:33,644
 In solitary confinement. We beat some sense into him so he won't cause trouble. 

484
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,654
You did a fabulous job.

485
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:41,774
We'll never see another helper for Min Do Hyeok.

486
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,764
Neither Kang Ki Tak nor Detective Oh.

487
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:45,954
The rest are just small fries anyway.

488
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:48,064
 Hwang Chan Seong also kicked the bucket at the perfect time. 

489
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:51,164
 We got Save without breaking a sweat, too. 

490
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,294
 Congrats. 

491
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:56,074
 As you wanted, things will be wrapped up nicely before the presentation. 

492
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:58,984
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

493
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:06,154
It's no fun for the infamous Kang Ki Tak to die comfortably like this.

494
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:11,084
Unfortunately, you didn't get to see your daughter's death.

495
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:16,174
But it'll be fun to see you die after witnessing your beloved Min Do Hyeok's death.

496
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,844
No, not Do Hyeok!

497
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,574
Don't you do anything, you asshole!

498
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:26,184
Shall I go meet Min Do Hyeok now?

499
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,934
Oh, keep a good watch on this asshole.

500
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:32,244
Do whatever it takes to make him spill Min Do Hyeok's plan. Got it?

501
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:35,174
- Yes, I understand. 
 - Hey, stop right there!

502
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,134
No—

503
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:42,664
No.

504
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:44,674
No!

505
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:13,274
Mr. Do Hyeok is brave.

506
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:16,854
So, he'll be all right.

507
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,724
That's what Grandma told me.

508
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:27,544
She said the kind person always wins.

509
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:06,074
As expected, a jumpsuit really suits you.

510
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:08,134
You're fundamentally a thug bastard, you know?

511
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:09,664
What do you want?

512
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:11,954
I came to bid you farewell.

513
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:16,654
We've got a special relationship where we shared the name, Shim Joon Seok.

514
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:19,324
Of course, we both abandoned that name now.

515
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:23,874
You're Min Do Hyeok, and I'm Lee Hwi So now.

516
00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:28,604
You're Lee Hwi So?

517
00:43:28,604 --> 00:43:32,324
Joon Seok, you're just

518
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:34,984
a mental patient.

519
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:39,024
Oh, did you know this?

520
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:43,914
Kang Ki Tak is detained in my basement right now.

521
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:49,474
And that means

522
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:53,554
no one can come to your rescue now.

523
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:55,804
You're bound to die.

524
00:43:55,804 --> 00:43:59,294
According to my plan, the way I want.

525
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:05,824
I heard people regret lots of things before they die.

526
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:09,214
What kind of regrets do you think your father had?

527
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:13,584
 I came here to put an end 

528
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:18,624
 to the debate about what is true and false. 

529
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:24,464
 I will pay the full price for revealing the truth only now. 

530
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:26,514
 My son... 

531
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:31,134
 is Min Do Hyeok. 

532
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,744
 Did he regret admitting you're his biological son? 

533
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:38,814
 It is true that Min Do Hyeok is my birth son, 

534
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:42,284
 but the serial murderer Shim Joon Seok 

535
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:46,304
 is Chairman Matthew of TikiTaka. 

536
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:47,884
 It wasn't... 

537
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:52,004
 It wasn't enough that he killed his mother who raised him. 

538
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:55,304
 He brutally murdered 

539
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:58,904
 Bang Da Mi's family and Min Do Hyeok's family, 

540
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:05,404
 and even killed a girl named Song Ji Ah and made it look like suicide. 

541
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:09,804
Or did he regret abandoning me?

542
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:15,504
 Min Do Hyeok is innocent. 

543
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,544
 Min Do Hyeok is a victim 

544
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:23,674
 who lost his family he grew up with because of Joon Seok— 

545
00:45:23,674 --> 00:45:25,804
 His... 

546
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:28,184
 innocence... 

547
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:46,274
I'm sure he felt bad for what he did to me, at least a bit. Right?

548
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:50,874
You're still haunted by the ghost of Chairman Shim Yong?

549
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:54,474
Want me to give you the answer instead?

550
00:45:55,934 --> 00:46:00,514
I'm sure he regretted not having killed you.

551
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:04,414
I'm sure he regretted turning you into a monster.

552
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:07,204
I'm sure he was...

553
00:46:07,204 --> 00:46:13,174
mournful for failing to raise his child into an adult.

554
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:18,564
You can ask him in person whether that's the case.

555
00:46:18,564 --> 00:46:22,504
You'll get to meet your father soon.

556
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:26,834
Tell him I said hi while you're at it.

557
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,844
All right, then.

558
00:46:36,474 --> 00:46:38,674
How did you...

559
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,974
come in here?

560
00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:45,484
Prosecutor Kang, what brings you here?

561
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:47,584
We've got an on-site verification tomorrow.

562
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:50,594
I need the culprit's confession before then.

563
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:53,174
Due to a lot of attention on this case,

564
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:57,574
the Attorney General ordered to speed up the investigation.

565
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,064
I see.

566
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:05,254
I hope you can get his confession, then.

567
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,844
Here's the whiskey you wanted.

568
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:21,244
Leave it here.

569
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:24,544
Clean up the area around that bastard, too.

570
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,254
Okay.

571
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:02,454
Did Kang Ki Tak open his mouth?

572
00:48:02,454 --> 00:48:05,814
No, he's way more persistent than expected.

573
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:08,254
Gosh, we can't help it.

574
00:48:08,254 --> 00:48:09,744
Get rid of him quietly at the proper time.

575
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:11,314
Yes, I got it.

576
00:48:11,314 --> 00:48:15,314
Also, Min Do Hyeok's death will be a suicide after the on-site verification.

577
00:48:15,314 --> 00:48:18,194
A suicide, huh?

578
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:23,164
We'll have to prepare a fun show for him, then.

579
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:28,004
Gather all the reporters and MyTV streamers wherever Min Do Hyeok goes today.

580
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,874
Yes, I got it.

581
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:33,074
 The on-site verification of Min Do Hyeok, arrested for murdering 

582
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:34,724
 Mayor Yang and CEO Hwang of Save— 

583
00:48:34,724 --> 00:48:37,494
 He needs to at least be a monkey at the zoo 

584
00:48:37,494 --> 00:48:40,984
 for them to believe he died of shame. Right? 

585
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,984
Talking about all kinds of news,

586
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:45,704
I'm Talkman of Talker!

587
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:47,634
Korea is full of anger.

588
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,684
Mayor Yang Jin Mo is crying out from his grave.

589
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:54,774
Talkman, please punch Min Do Hyeok, the murderer, in the face!

590
00:48:54,774 --> 00:48:58,224
I'm Na Beauty of Criminal's Beauty Salon.

591
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:03,414
What's Min Do Hyeok, the murderer's fashion score for his on-site verification today?

592
00:49:03,414 --> 00:49:07,194
The Punishman is on duty today. Punish!

593
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,474
One punch in Min Do Hyeok's face!

594
00:49:11,474 --> 00:49:12,524
   

595
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:14,144
   

596
00:49:14,144 --> 00:49:16,534
 - You should die now, too.  
 - How gross. What a psychopath. 

597
00:49:16,534 --> 00:49:18,924
 - People like him need to be quarantined.
 - National hero, my foot. He's a national killer. 

598
00:49:18,924 --> 00:49:21,364
 - I'm ashamed to breathe the same air as him.
- How can a human being do that? 

599
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:24,114
 - You can't trust anyone. 
 - I'm about to get Min Do Hyeok PTSD. 

600
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,784
   

601
00:49:31,874 --> 00:49:33,274
   

602
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:36,174
   

603
00:49:46,144 --> 00:49:49,704
 The nation's anger against Min Do Hyeok, the serial killer, is growing. 

604
00:49:49,704 --> 00:49:52,294
This is just like what happened to Da Mi.

605
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:55,914
No one is trying to find the truth.

606
00:49:55,914 --> 00:49:58,974
Only fake news is growing.

607
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:02,594
Just like...

608
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,694
what I did to Da Mi.

609
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:09,574
 I saw it clearly. 

610
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:10,934
 Mo Ne gave birth! 

611
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:14,944
 I brought the baby outside because Mo Ne asked me to! 

612
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:18,074
 Wait a second. What did you do with the baby? 

613
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:19,324
 You didn't... 

614
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:21,564
 Don't be like that to Da Mi! 

615
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:24,404
 Please, I beg you. Stop the witch hunt. 

616
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:29,924
 Da Mi, I know your desperation better than anyone. 

617
00:50:29,924 --> 00:50:32,144
 Your desire to protect your dad. 

618
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:37,674
 So please tell everyone with your own mouth. 

619
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:40,404
 It's so hard for me. 

620
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:45,944
 The only thing Da Mi did wrong was love her dad as a man. 

621
00:50:45,944 --> 00:50:47,204
 She's lying. 

622
00:50:47,204 --> 00:50:51,164
 What are you saying? Why are you doing this? I didn't do anything wrong! 

623
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:54,554
 We found the conclusive evidence. 

624
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:57,374
 The baby's ultrasound picture. 

625
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:58,954
 That's not mine. 

626
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:03,534
 I said that's not mine! Please just believe me! 

627
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:05,934
 It's not mine! 

628
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:13,674
You're right.

629
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:16,724
I did the same thing to Lee Hwi So.

630
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:23,244
We can't leave Min Do Hyeok like that.

631
00:51:23,244 --> 00:51:25,584
- Let us go. 
 - Of course.

632
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:28,454
You can't. You're with a baby.

633
00:51:28,454 --> 00:51:30,974
It's your first pregnancy. What if something happens to the baby?

634
00:51:30,974 --> 00:51:33,664
Not to mention yourself. You can't!

635
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:35,904
Is that true?

636
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:40,304
I, Cha Joo Ran, have never given up on the mother or the baby

637
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,324
ever since I became a gynecologist.

638
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:45,314
I always saved both. And it's the same now.

639
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,644
I'll save Min Do Hyeok, give birth to our baby, and raise him right.

640
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:53,474
The day will come when I'll get to boast about my great performance today.

641
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:56,374
So Daddy shouldn't stop me. Okay?

642
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:59,154
All right. Let's go.

643
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:01,254
Let's go.

644
00:52:16,154 --> 00:52:19,954
You'll come back for sure. Right?

645
00:52:19,954 --> 00:52:24,094
You can't get hurt. Okay?

646
00:52:50,224 --> 00:52:52,144
How pretty.

647
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:14,464
 Next news. 

648
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:17,464
 This afternoon, the presentation for the national project blueprint 

649
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:20,954
 in Gagok District will be held at TikiTaka's main building. 

650
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:24,684
 The presentation will be attended by the prime minister and other officials, 

651
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:28,894
 including Chairman Matthew, who was entrusted with development rights. 

652
00:53:59,024 --> 00:54:04,474
   
   

653
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,374
 Father, you can see. Right? 

654
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:12,074
 Look what a great person the fake son you looked down on became. 

655
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:17,164
 And watch the last moment of your biological son. 

656
00:54:17,164 --> 00:54:20,574
Gosh, how wonderful.

657
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:22,274
Welcome, Prime Minister.

658
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:24,574
Welcome to TikiTaka.

659
00:54:31,274 --> 00:54:36,474
Will Min Do Hyeok be taken care of for good today?

660
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:39,464
Yes, I plan to end him

661
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:42,634
in the ride on his way back to the detention center from the on-site verification.

662
00:54:42,634 --> 00:54:45,374
Of course, it'll be disguised as suicide.

663
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:48,754
There mustn't be any trouble afterward.

664
00:54:49,974 --> 00:54:55,654
You can't forget I'm the next presidential candidate.

665
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:58,834
Just leave it to me.

666
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:04,294
 There he is! 

667
00:55:04,294 --> 00:55:06,954
 Hey, you fake! 

668
00:55:07,744 --> 00:55:09,884
   

669
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:19,134
Come here, you punk! I'll teach you a lesson!

670
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:20,004
Hey, Min Do Hyeok!

671
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:23,154
How did you kill him, you punk?

672
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,704
 Hit me, insult me, and trample me all you want. 

673
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:31,784
 I'll willingly become Bang Da Mi and Lee Hwi So, just as you want. 

674
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:47,624
Min Do Hyeok will be dead soon.

675
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:50,924
I'll help you die with him, then.

676
00:55:58,174 --> 00:56:00,574
Kang Ki Tak!

677
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:13,594
K will regret keeping me alive.

678
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:25,134
 Come out through the rear door. 

679
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:34,174
Ki Tak!

680
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:45,314
Do you know how worried I was?

681
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:48,334
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

682
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:55,264
Why would you risk your life for someone like Mo Ne?

683
00:56:55,264 --> 00:56:58,634
H-How am I to live without you?

684
00:56:58,634 --> 00:57:01,114
She's Hannah's mom.

685
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:03,554
I can't let her get hurt.

686
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,494
Don't cry.

687
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:11,854
What about Do Hyeok? I heard he was sent to the detention center.

688
00:57:11,854 --> 00:57:13,624
Today is the on-site verification.

689
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:16,464
Cheol Woo and Joo Ran went to save Do Hyeok.

690
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:18,524
Let's go to Somang Hospital.

691
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:21,144
Somang Hospital? Who's there?

692
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:24,674
You'll see when we get there. Let's hurry.

693
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:30,144
 Please. I hope for a miracle. 

694
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:34,624
Let's go if you're done.

695
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:43,124
W-What's that?

696
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:05,634
Who are you people?

697
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:08,634
Do you want to get arrested for obstruction of justice?

698
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,614
Han Mo Ne?

699
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:14,064
Why are you helping the murderer of your husband?

700
00:58:14,064 --> 00:58:16,124
Who said this man is a murderer?

701
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:19,414
You're making a mistake. Making an innocent man do an on-site verification!

702
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,924
No need for a chat.

703
00:58:20,924 --> 00:58:23,234
Han Mo Ne, leave with Min Do Hyeok!

704
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:25,534
We'll take care of things here.

705
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:27,554
Hurry!

706
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:30,354
Hey, g-get them!

707
00:58:31,194 --> 00:58:32,804
Don't you move!

708
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,764
I'll fire if you move.

709
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:36,504
I'm a pregnant woman!

710
00:58:36,504 --> 00:58:38,054
First pregnancy in my 50s.

711
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:42,704
If something happens to the baby, all of you'll become murderers!

712
00:58:43,574 --> 00:58:46,314
Mo Ne, hurry up and go!

713
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,854
Freeze!

714
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,894
The blueprint presentation for Gagok District will begin soon.

715
00:58:57,894 --> 00:58:59,944
Let's go there.

716
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:04,964
I heard from Kang Ki Tak that you need the laptop.

717
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:21,084
I can get my hands on everything I want soon.

718
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,964
Min Do Hyeok escaped.

719
00:59:35,964 --> 00:59:37,034
Escaped?

720
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:38,654
You have to cancel today's presentation.

721
00:59:38,654 --> 00:59:40,604
Min Do Hyeok might come here.

722
00:59:40,604 --> 00:59:43,944
He'll wreak havoc. We need to avoid him for now.

723
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,364
No, there won't be any cancellations.

724
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:52,714
I won't let that bastard ruin our grand plan from the first step.

725
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,274
Isn't it actually for the better?

726
00:59:55,274 --> 00:59:59,124
We've got a clear cause to end Min Do Hyeok now.

727
01:00:01,404 --> 01:00:05,384
 As we're about to start the grand project, we'll have 

728
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,984
 a ribbon-cutting ceremony prior to the main event. 

729
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:12,154
 Three, two, one! 

730
01:00:14,104 --> 01:00:16,404
   
   

731
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:26,024
   

732
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:28,484
He's a serial killer!

733
01:00:28,484 --> 01:00:30,604
You may kill him if he resists!

734
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:32,424
 Yes! 

735
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:45,584
Go inside first. I'll park and follow you in.

736
01:00:45,584 --> 01:00:47,504
Han Mo Ne.

737
01:00:49,864 --> 01:00:52,004
Thank you for today.

738
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,534
I'm Han Mo Ne, the actor.

739
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:32,234
I killed a person.

740
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:35,034
It's CEO Hwang Chan Seong of Save.

741
01:01:35,034 --> 01:01:37,554
I'll go and turn myself in right now.

742
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:47,184
Min Do Hyeok!

743
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:51,914
It won't be easy to go inside alone.

744
01:01:51,914 --> 01:01:53,774
Follow me.

745
01:02:19,724 --> 01:02:23,474
 A grand project Korea and TikiTaka are working on together. 

746
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:26,474
We'll now begin its long-awaited first moment right now.

747
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:29,714
He's the person who worked the hardest for this moment.

748
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:32,524
The word 'pioneer' fits him better than anyone else.

749
01:02:32,524 --> 01:02:35,604
Please welcome Chairman Matthew Lee!

750
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:57,104
Thank you for spending your valuable time to be here today.

751
01:02:57,104 --> 01:03:02,174
I'm moved to see those who helped with the Gagok District's national project

752
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:04,354
onstage like this.

753
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:07,524
This is justice and a miracle.

754
01:03:07,524 --> 01:03:09,464
I'll keep it short.

755
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:12,044
I'll repay you with the results.

756
01:03:12,044 --> 01:03:15,214
There's TikiTaka's pride I've been hiding all this time,

757
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:18,414
so I can introduce it here at this gathering.

758
01:03:18,414 --> 01:03:20,174
I'd like to introduce it to you for the first time.

759
01:03:20,174 --> 01:03:23,954
This is TikiTaka's AI, Luca.

760
01:03:23,954 --> 01:03:27,164
   

761
01:03:32,214 --> 01:03:34,514
The AI that never makes mistakes.

762
01:03:34,514 --> 01:03:36,954
The one and only AI in this world.

763
01:03:36,954 --> 01:03:41,114
Luca, the AI developed by TikiTaka and watched by the entire world,

764
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:45,524
will show you the blueprint of Gagok District's high-tech city.

765
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:02,714
   

766
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:06,344
   
 The people who move Korea are all gathered here, huh? 

767
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:10,824
  
 If you're the Trillion Family, does it mean Gagok District's cartel's size is one trillion won?

768
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:12,434
What's this?

769
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:14,544
What's going on?

770
01:04:14,544 --> 01:04:16,774
    
 Prime Minister.

771
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:19,384
Please explain that video.

772
01:04:19,384 --> 01:04:21,434
I'd like an answer from

773
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:24,334
Chairman Matthew Lee and the entire Trillion Family!

774
01:04:24,334 --> 01:04:25,644
Please explain!

775
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,814
Commissioner General!

776
01:04:27,814 --> 01:04:30,134
Prime Minister!

777
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,314
 - Please explain the video! 
 - Please explain! 

778
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:38,554
 - Please explain! 
 - What's the meaning of this? 

779
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:46,054
   

780
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,554
   

781
01:04:54,804 --> 01:04:56,954
Well...

782
01:04:56,954 --> 01:04:59,694
to make it official,

783
01:05:00,424 --> 01:05:03,474
we have nothing to do with this video.

784
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,914
 What are you saying? 

785
01:05:09,294 --> 01:05:11,464
You son of a bitch.

786
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:14,384
I shouldn't have partnered with you.

787
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:16,604
Do you want an internal war among us?

788
01:05:16,604 --> 01:05:18,844
This isn't my doing.

789
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:46,534
Where do you think you're going?

790
01:05:49,254 --> 01:05:51,594
No one can leave without my permission.

791
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,534
How dare a murderer come in here!

792
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,114
Did you escape again?

793
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:56,644
Take him down right now!

794
01:05:56,644 --> 01:05:58,754
Let me ask all of you here.

795
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,544
Am I the murderer who killed Yang Jin Mo?

796
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:06,534
Please answer, Prime Minister.

797
01:06:06,534 --> 01:06:09,114
Commissioner General.

798
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:10,924
Hurry up.

799
01:06:22,384 --> 01:06:24,984
- Get him! 
 - What's this?

800
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:28,544
H-Hey!

 What are you all doing? Arrest him right now!

 We'll protect Min Do Hyeok! 

809

 As long as we're here, you can't take him away! 

810
01:07:22,484 --> 01:07:24,764
 Min Do Hyeok didn't try to kill me. 

811
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:25,944
 It was Shim Joon Seok. 

812
01:07:25,944 --> 01:07:28,644
 What's going on here? 

813
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:30,664
 Matthew needs to log into Luca. 

814
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:32,564
 Otherwise, there could be great chaos soon. 

815
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:33,724
 Hurry up and log in. 

816
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:34,894
 Stop Luca! 

817
01:07:34,894 --> 01:07:36,224
 Why would I? 

818
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:38,014
 Tell your beloved Min Do Hyeok to stop her. 

819
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:39,384
 You're the one who had Min Do Hyeok— 

820
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:43,564
 If I don't log in, Korea will be in utter chaos. 

821
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:46,444
 There's less than a minute left. 

822
01:07:46,444 --> 01:07:51,284
♫  Don't tell me I have gone too far  ♫

823
01:07:51,774 --> 01:07:53,574
♫  Every night, I missed you  ♫
