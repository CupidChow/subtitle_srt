1
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,860
   

2
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,040
   

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,000
   
   

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
- It's still not showing up? 
 - Yes.

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Gosh, this is weird. What's going on?

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,550
- Oh, my! 
 - What's that little brat's current location?

7
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,850
Well...

8
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,340
    
 It's not showing up.

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,310
He lied about registering with our system on purpose.

10
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,610
To leave a flaw in TikiTaka's system.

11
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,960
W-Wait! It's showing up there!

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,400
   

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,810
Wait, there's more than one location! W-Why is it doing that?

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,510
   

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:35,710

 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

16
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,110
 It's been more than 12 hours since Noh Hannah was kidnapped by Shim Joon Seok. 

17
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,740
 But neither the police nor TikiTaka have produced meaningful results. 

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,550
 It's a hopeless situation. 

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,930
 The public is showing earnest hearts as they watch. 

20
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,520
   

21
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,000
   

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,190
    
 It worked!

23
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,930
This is...

24
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,020
   

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,210
Shit, it's my vacation home. That son of a bitch!

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,440
   
   

27
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,300
Lee Hwi So?

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,830
It really was your doing!

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,900
A person with such skills...

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,950
Yes, you're the only one.

31
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,330
I'm thankful for the acknowledgment.

32
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,080
We've finally got two Lee Hwi So.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,830
Two? Not at all.

34
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm the only Lee Hwi So who exists on this planet.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,690
Your family, who can vouch for you, all died.

36
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,970
I had perfectly changed everything about Lee Hwi So

37
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,100
that exists in Korea into mine.

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,810
All you've got is that grossly deformed face now.

39
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,700
So, how will you prove yourself?

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,660
Proving is what you will have to do as the fake one.

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,310
Oh?

42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,610
If you're thinking about using Luca to get me, wake up!

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,640
Luca isn't the AI you created in the past anymore.

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,930
It's evolved so much that you can't even mess with it!

45
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,030
Do you really think so?

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,830
You were a punk kid who was nothing without me.

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,490
What's this?

48
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,960
What the hell!

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,710
   
   

50
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,150
   

51
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,050
   

52
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,400
   

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,130
Damn it!

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,420
Lee Hwi So, you son of a—

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,750
I'll pay you back for every single thing you did to me.

56
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,010
This is only the beginning, K.

57
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,870
Hurry.

58
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,860
What's the matter?

59
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,480
You're— But you died back then!

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,370
I did die from the joint force of Geum Ra Hee and Cha Joo Ran.

61
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,010
What's he saying?

62
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,700
Did you do hurt Kang Ki Tak, too?

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,310
That means you killed Chairman Bang and Kang Ki Tak. A double kill?

64
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,060
Are you the one behind Min Do Hyeok?

65
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,810
I came to get back what's mine, TikiTaka.

66
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,280
The world has changed.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,100
No one will believe your words.

68
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,090
I don't think you have time to relax like this.

69
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,670
We called the police and told them this was K's hideout.

70
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,150
Wouldn't your fake hero who's trapped in there be in trouble?

71
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,560
Hurry up.

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,600
Hurry!

73
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,390
Chairman!

74
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,530
- It's so dark! 
 - Matthew!

75
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,120
- It's dark. 
 - Matthew! Matthew!

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,220
Matthew, wake up.

77
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,710
Are you okay?

78
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,300
Hey, over there. Lee Hwi So is over there.

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,520
He came back alive with Min Do Hyeok, that bastard.

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,030
Where? No one's here, though.

81
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,720
He ran away. That bastard of a rat!

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,390
Kang Ki Tak was alive, too.

83
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,790
What? Kang Ki Tak?

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,120
These bastards! They were all alive.

85
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,350
They were alive!

86
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,780
Matthew! That's not the problem.

87
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,020
The police are coming.

88
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,510
They'll suspect you if your fingerprints are all over this vacation home.

89
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,270
Those bastards were planning to expose my hideout to the world in the first place!

90
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,210
   

91
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,800
 Move out! Move out to 28-1 Seonjam-ro! 

92
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,210
 Enter in groups of three. Go! 

93
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,350
 Entering. 

94
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,190
W-What do we do? Hurry up.

95
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,810
What's this?

96
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,650
How are we going to explain losing Shim Joon Seok?

97
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,550
We have to all say we were attacked while trying to catch Shim Joon Seok.

98
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,360
This damned acting life...

99
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,380
- Huh? 
 - Why?

100
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,370
Me, too?

101
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,570
 Move in threes. Do you copy? 

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,120
Everyone freeze!

103
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,310
Please help.

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,380
We came to catch Shim Joon Seok and got attacked!

105
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,410
Are you okay?

106
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,960
Blood?

107
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,630
Shim Joon Seok has escaped.

108
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,790
What about the child? Was she alive?

109
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,090
I think so.

110
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,550
W-We didn't even have time to save the child before Shim Joon Seok attacked us.

111
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,540
I'm Captain Nam Cheol Woo of the Special Crimes Unit.

112
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,550
Shim Joon Seok escaped through the second floor.

113
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,540
- Go after him right now! 
 - Yes, sir!

114
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,520
 We found Noh Hannah! 

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,360
Where?

116
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,650
- My head. 
 - Why did you hit so hard?

117
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,150
- Be quiet! 
  - Someone's coming! 

118
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,500
 They're coming out! 

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,890
 Someone's coming out! It's Min Do Hyeok! 

120
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,950
Hannah, were you held hostage by Shim Joon Seok all this time?

121
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,880
How did you know where Hannah was?

122
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,190
I tracked Shim Joon Seok's hideout and chased after him as he ran away.

123
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,870
After much fighting, I was barely able to rescue Hannah.

124
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,860
You see, I'm damn good at throwing punches.

125
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,390
All of this is thanks to my mom, who taught me Taekwondo in my early years.

126
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I think Hannah was able to be safe, thanks to everyone who supported her with one heart.

127
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,970
Everyone, I beg of you.

128
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,550
Please remember Hannah's face.

129
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,970
And please protect Hannah from Shim Joon Seok, the madman.

130
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,830
 This is what you planned to do from the beginning. 

131
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,490
 You want to play the hero? 

132
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,820
 I'll play a fake hero against a fake hero. 

133
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,400
He's trying to make Hannah into an untouchable child.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,270
W-Why is he going that far for that brat?

135
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,920
No way.

136
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,010
Hey, find out which hospital Noh Hannah went to as quickly as you can.

137
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,290
Yang Jin Mo, answer this one question.

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,750
Noh Hannah...

139
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,940
is she Matthew's child?

140
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,150
No, Hannah is Noh Paeng Hee's daughter.

141
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,930
And she'll continue to be.

142
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,510
Please make way.

143
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,910
Don't mess with Hannah anymore.

144
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,880
Is Hannah okay right now?

145
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,700
Chairman Matthew! Chairman Matthew!

146
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,530
Shim Joon Seok's victim, Min Do Hyeok, saved Noh Hannah.

147
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,510
What have you been doing during that time?

148
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,210
Oh, Min Do Hyeok was able to save Noh Hannah, thanks to TikiTaka's app, Children Home.

149
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,420
I was attacked by Shim Joon Seok and lost him, but—

150
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,610
Are you admitting to losing Shim Joon Seok in front of your eyes?

151
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,390
Noh Hannah couldn't have been found if it hadn't been for Min Do Hyeok.

152
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,230
Some people are even saying Children Home is incompetent as an app.

153
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,580
How would you explain yourself?

154
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,920
This case is a horrible crime committed on a defenseless child.

155
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,770
I'll even use my personal funds if I have to—

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,870
Chairman Matthew, let me ask you a few more questions.

157
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,660
Please tell us how you feel right now.

158
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,050
- Chairman Matthew? One more word... 
 - Chairman Matthew, a few more...

159
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,040
What a great idea, Min Do Hyeok.

160
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,460
   

161
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,630
We should also support Min Do Hyeok.

162
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,040
Fallen Hero Matthew Lee.

163
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,770
The new hero, Min Do Hyeok.

164
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,130
Post it on Save's main page.

165
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,730
Also, attach Noh Hannah's face to every article.

166
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,060
So, every citizen of Korea will remember Noh Hannah's face.

167
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,300
Yes, I understand.

168
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,650
Where's Hannah? I came to see Hannah.

169
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,210
Move! I need to see her!

170
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,090
I have to see Hannah's face to be assured.

171
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,800
What right do you have to show up here?

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,740
You didn't care a thing about Hannah.

173
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,400
   

174
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,020
If you're planning to fight Matthew, quit it.

175
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,130
No matter what you try, you can't handle him.

176
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,580
The situation is completely different from a year ago.

177
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,780
Matthew is powerful enough to turn an angel into a demon if he wants to do so.

178
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:12,410
Oh, is that why you begged a bastard like him for your life and are living like a parasite?

179
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,550
Yes. What's the matter?

180
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,870
We're supposed to gather at Matthew's house right now.

181
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,550
Okay. I'll be right there.

182
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,000
You should console him nicely.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm sure your master must be quite furious.

184
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,550
And deliver a word from me.

185
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,940
"Even if I go to hell, I'll be sure to bring your head with me, K."

186
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,550
Mister!

187
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,580
Hannah!

188
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
Mister Jin Mo!

189
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,550
Are you okay? Did it hurt a lot?

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,220
Lee Hwi So is different from Min Do Hyeok and Kang Ki Tak.

191
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,060
Your very existence might become risky.

192
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,460
Shut up! Don't you think I know that?

193
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,950
- Luca. 
  - Yes, Chairman. 

194
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,150
Log out of every program right now.

195
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,730
If Lee Hwi So keeps attacking, you might suffer critical damage.

196
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,220
 Yes, Chairman. 

197
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,230
 Luca is logging out. 

198
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,480
How are we going to fight without Luca?

199
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,710
To catch Lee Hwi So, we need Luca.

200
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,570
What if he gets her?

201
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,930
We need to prevent Lee Hwi So from approaching Luca, don't we?

202
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,830
Save's security program is required to restart Luca.

203
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,320
Save's security program?

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,680
I can't hack into Save

205
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,350
because of the cutting-edge security program that Hwang Chan Seong has developed.

206
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,860
It hasn't been commercialized, so Lee Hwi So can't break through the system, either.

207
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,690
Isn't this why you kept Mo Ne alive?

208
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,780
Because you've got something to steal from Save.

209
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,030
CEO Geum, I'm really not Min Do Hyeok's helper.

210
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,050
I never contacted Min Do Hyeok.

211
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,110
It wasn't my idea for that girl to live with my mom, either,

212
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,610
I've never once thought of her as my daughter.

213
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,960
So, please...

214
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,750
Please don't bring my mom into this.

215
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,460
I guess you cherish your mom, huh?

216
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,340
Thanks for letting me know what you cherish the most.

217
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,580
CEO Geum.

218
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,660
CEO Geum! Please don't, CEO Geum!

219
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,050
Wait, CEO Geum!

220
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,860
CEO Geum!

221
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,870
CEO Geum!

222
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,180
CEO Geum! No! No, you can't!

223
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,450
Is it true Kang Ki Tak and Lee Hwi So came back alive?

224
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,760
We saw Kang Ki Tak, and Matthew saw Lee Hwi So.

225
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,480
What's going on here?

226
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,010
We've got three to take on now, including Min Do Hyeok.

227
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,830
It's like every day is Easter.

228
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,820
Good god, my head!

229
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,690
My head!

230
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,660
The memes of Pathetic Matthew and Sexy Do Hyeok are going around on SNS right now.

231
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,110
Save's polls also confirmed Min Do Hyeok as the national hero.

232
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,450
Everyone is complimenting him, saying he's the strongest fighter in the country.

233
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,590
Save's Hwang Chan Seong is intentionally attacking Matthew.

234
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,860
That bastard didn't like TikiTaka from the beginning.

235
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,310
Bring her out!

236
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,450
What happened to her?

237
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,520
Why is Mo Ne in that state?

238
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,700
Everyone, watch closely and witness the price for betraying me.

239
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,360
How did Mo Ne betray you—

240
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,920
We'll never betray you.

241
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,440
We're in the same boat here.

242
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,650
We'll be together, in life or death.

243
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,310
We need to divert the attention to a new issue.

244
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,000
We'll use the Mayor of Seoul's resignation—

245
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,390
What's a bigger issue than the appearance of Shim Joon Seok?

246
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,560
Forget everything else. Go and bring Lee Hwi So first.

247
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,820
Get him and bring him to me.

248
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,950
I'll give TikiTaka's hotel to the first one to catch Lee Hwi So.

249
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,150
Hotel— The hotel with one trillion won in yearly revenue?

250
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,220
By the way, how and where will we find Lee Hwi So?

251
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,150
Do I need to tell you how, too?

252
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,250
Why would I use you guys, then?

253
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,530
You good-for-nothing idiots.

254
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,610
Hurry up and get moving!

255
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,880
What are you doing?

256
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,530
- Drag her back inside. 
 - Yes.

257
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,540
Matthew. Matthew.

258
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,850
I... I'm really not Min Do Hyeok's helper.

259
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,570
Please... Please leave my mom out of this.

260
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,790
I beg of you, Matthew.

261
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,520
Take her back inside.

262
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,250
Matthew, please. Not my mom.

263
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,550
Matthew... Matthew...

264
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,320
Please, Matthew. Matthew—

265
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,800
We should stop Min Do Hyeok from going around and pretending to be Shim Joon Seok first.

266
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,140
They'll keep attacking TikiTaka for failing to catch Shim Joon Seok.

267
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,570
How do we catch Shim Joon Seok when I'm Shim Joon Seok?

268
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,680
Min Do Hyeok, that son of a bitch.

269
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,120
I've got a decent idea just now.

270
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,220
If there isn't one, we just need to make one and catch him.

271
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,840
We have just the right person, too.

272
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,530
D-Don't tell me.

273
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,740
I'll put a tremendous bounty on Shim Joon Seok.

274
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,110
The more players, the better it'll be.

275
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,260
So much so that people will flip out.

276
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,800
That's a good idea.

277
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll take Mo Ne with me.

278
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,140
She's still useful, so we'll have to make the most out of her.

279
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,650
Keep this in mind.

280
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,710
The allegations of you being Min Do Hyeok's helper and hiding Hannah are still there.

281
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,560
I'll keep an eye on everything you do from now on.

282
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,650
People you meet and what you talk about...

283
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,810
You can't even go to the bathroom without my permission.

284
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,830
Okay, I'll do that.

285
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,500
Hwang Chan Seong contacted you a lot while you were gone.

286
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,990
Contact him and ask him to meet you.

287
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,550
Your first mission is getting Save's security program from Hwang Chan Seong.

288
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,040
You need to become a swan from now on.

289
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,260
A swan who looks elegant on the outside

290
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,310
but needs to keep kicking underwater relentlessly to stay alive.

291
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,130
Prove to me the reason you need to stay alive.

292
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,420
 Geum Ra Hee won. 

293
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you saying? Geum Ra Hee won what?

294
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,800
Han Mo Ne will soon die.

295
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,430
Matthew will never let a traitor live.

296
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,140
Why does everyone keep saying Mo Ne betrayed us?

297
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,150
Do you guys know about this?

298
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,650
What's this? Am I the only one who doesn't know again?

299
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,960
The reason Matthew wants that child dead.

300
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,390
The reason Min Do Hyeok wants to protect that child from Matthew.

301
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,350
There's only one.

302
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,300
It's because that child is Matthew's.

303
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,860
Matthew's child was alive?

304
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,360
Does that mean Mo Ne has been raising his child in secret?

305
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,470
No.

306
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,640
It wasn't Han Mo Ne.

307
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,910
   

308
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,520
Yang Jin Mo, it was you. Right?

309
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,750
You had entrusted Noh Hannah to Shim Joon Seok's victim.

310
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,790
Thanks to you, her mother died.

311
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,050
That's why you met up with Han Mo Ne secretly.

312
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,060
Because you wanted to keep Noh Hannah's existence a secret all the way.

313
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,160
Isn't that right?

314
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,930
Quit the pathetic detective act and

315
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,820
worry about our mission in front of us right now.

316
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,750
Go find Lee Hwi So.

317
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,690
This confirms one thing.

318
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,110
That you're the next target, Yang Jin Mo,

319
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,740
after Han Mo Ne dies.

320
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,950
What kind of fiction are you writing right now?

321
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,290
Why would he keep Matthew's child alive?

322
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,830
Are you keeping him in check right now?

323
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,130
Well, I guess he'll soon become the mayor.

324
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,510
And he'll be the next in line after CEO Geum.

325
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,970
After Geum Ra Hee?

326
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,880
Go Myeong Ji, itturns out you're so ambitious!

327
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,280
How did you hide that sly nature all this time?

328
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,400
Please get out of my store right now.

329
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,830
Get out?

330
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,320
This used to be my store.

331
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,500
Whose VIP clients did you get to keep to live in a lap of luxury?

332
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,090
Did I get them for free?

333
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,240
I paid my dues fair and square.

334
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,670
Fine. Try being a good wife all you want.

335
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,300
It won't last much longer, though.

336
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,130
Aren't you leaving?

337
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,640
Huh? I-I'm coming. I should.

338
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,770
 While no one knows Shim Joon Seok's whereabouts, 

339
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,710
 Chairman Matthew placed a bounty of 10 billion won on him. 

340
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,850
 Some people are saying... 

341
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,930
So, you're going to convert your mistake into a bounty frame?

342
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,610
 Everyone's attention is on Chairman Matthew to see if he'll pull through 

343
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,510
- That's really just like you, Matthew. 
  - as promised in his pledge in a week. 

344
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,680
 Medusa, why aren't you contacting me today? 

345
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,270
 Everything happened as you said. 

346
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,990
 How did you know? 

347
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,990
 Who are you exactly? 

348
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,990
Ki Tak.

349
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,540
Ki Tak!

350
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,660
- Hyung, where have you been? 
 - I went out to get dinner.

351
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,210
Where did Ahjumma go?

352
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,710
She's not here? She was just here.

353
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,750
Ahjumma.

354
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,310
Hyung, hold on.

355
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,350
What's this?

356
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,270
 Thank you again for protecting my Hannah. 

357
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:14,470
 I realized leaving Mo Ne and Hannah is for the best for my daughter and granddaughter. 

358
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,530
 One day, I'll get to meet Hannah and Mo Ne again. 

359
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,450
 I'll wait for that day. 

360
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,850
Hyung, we need to find Ahjumma quickly.

361
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,410
If K catches her,

362
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,190
he won't keep her alive.

363
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,840
You look into Han Mo Ne and her brothers.

364
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,550
I'll go check the train station and the terminal.

365
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,400
 Your first mission is getting Save's security program from Hwang Chan Seong. 

366
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,230
 Prove to me the reason you need to stay alive. 

367
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
How did you know I was here?

368
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,330
Gosh, seriously.

369
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,900
Please stop barging into my life.

370
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,040
What happened this time was your fault!

371
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,330
I wouldn't have ended up this way if you didn't call!

372
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,650
This is driving me nuts, seriously.

373
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,500
   

374
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,110
 Matthew might kill you, Mom. 

375
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,740
 Please hurry up and run away. 

376
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,610
 Do whatever it takes to stay alive. 

377
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,810
I'm sorry for contacting you late.

378
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,810
As you know, there were some internal issues at my company.

379
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,460
I understand.

380
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,810
Shall we have a glass of wine?

381
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,590
I wanted to meet you to get to know you better, Mo Ne.

382
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,830
I've heard, and I'm aware.

383
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,480
That Save's commercial models must always meet CEO Hwang beforehand.

384
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,130
They say you void contracts even after signing them,

385
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,460
if you find out the other party lied, huh?

386
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,320
I value facts.

387
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm ready.

388
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,520
Please ask me anything.

389
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,250
Han Mo Ne, what kind of a person is your mother?

390
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,740
My...

391
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,640
mother?

392
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,170
Was that a difficult question?

393
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,080
No, I'll answer.

394
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,100
 What the heck are you doing? 

395
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,870
 My mom's go-to-phrase is, "I'm sorry." 

396
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,200
 She always thinks of herself as pathetic. 

397
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,590
However, her love for me

398
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,000
is sincere.

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,270
 You're the woman from the tabloids, right? Mo Ne's birth mom, right? 

400
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,510
 - Why are you here? 
 - Did you come to meet Mo Ne? 

401
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,130
 "I am not Mo Ne's mom. 

402
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,590
 I am merely receiving support from Mo Ne. 

403
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,620
 I shamelessly received help from Mo Ne despite my old age." 

404
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,610
 But I was always too busy denying my mom. 

405
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,780
My mom's name is Yoon Ji Sook.

406
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,450
She's unlearned and impoverished.

407
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,460
She's a poor, deaf person.

408
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,520
The Han Mo Ne you know is fake.

409
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,480
- Han Cheong Soo! 
 - Yes!

410
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,840
Do you know where your mother is right now?

411
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,530
N-No, I don't.

412
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,370
Take a seat.

413
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,150
It looks like your mother has sided with Min Do Hyeok.

414
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,460
But that'd make things very troublesome.

415
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,390
It'll be safer to bring your mother to our side.

416
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,060
Of course, I'm going to protect her well.

417
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,020
Do you mean it?

418
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,920
Of course!

419
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,960
Why would I lie when I cherish you so much?

420
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,020
Your sister's the one at fault, but your mother's innocent.

421
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,880
If your mother contacts you, call me right away.

422
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,820
I'll escort her safely, then.

423
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,310
Even if your mother refuses, you have to bring her. Okay?

424
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,860
Yes, I understand.

425
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,640
Cheers.

426
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,160
You can get back to work.

427
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,610
Man, what a moron. How can you buy those words?

428
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,010
You'll have to die as Shim Joon Seok in my place, along with your mom.

429
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,860
My dad was a scum.

430
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,030
Alcohol, gambling, and women.

431
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,960
He beat my mother every day, who couldn't even scream in pain.

432
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,930
He robbed money from her.

433
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,400
I was held back two years in school because I was on the run

434
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,790
due to my dad's gambling debt.

435
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,590
Only after my dad died,

436
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,230
was I able to escape physical abuse.

437
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,180
I started working part-time starting from middle school.

438
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,740
I took on any job I was offered.

439
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,500
But I only became more and more poor.

440
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,910
That's why I decided.

441
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,500
 Mom, let's move to Seoul. 

442
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,170
 Let's start anew where no one knows us. 

443
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,870
 I want to become a singer. 

444
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,090
 And I want to do acting, too. 

445
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,350
 I'll become the greatest top star of this country, so no one can look down on us. 

446
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,060
 Ten billion, 100 billion, one trillion! 

447
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,130
 I'll rake in all the money in this world. 

448
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,490
 Until then, I might pretend not to know you, Mom. 

449
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,300
 You can do everything you want. 

450
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,650
 Mom's okay with anything! 

451
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,350
 I'll make a lot of money and make you happy for sure. 

452
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,390
 I'll let you live with your chin held high. 

453
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,400
 From now on, my name's Han Mo Ne, not Han Hee Soo. 

454
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,380
 Han Mo Ne. 

455
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,190
 You got it? 

456
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,420
Even your family is totally fake?

457
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,120
You're right.

458
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,430
From head to toe, I'm entirely fake.

459
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,910
But do you think you'd be any different?

460
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,520
Can you be certain you wouldn't have lived the way I did?

461
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,550
It's a little confusing.

462
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,210
I need some time to think.

463
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,470
 What's going on? Why is he leaving already? 

464
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,630
 Did your mission fail? 

465
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,760
Did you have someone follow me?

466
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,960
I thought I told you.

467
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,260
I'll watch every single thing you do and say.

468
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,060
He left first today because something came up.

469
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,780
We'll meet again soon. Don't worry.

470
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:53,099
   

471
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,299
Mom!

472
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,999
 Cheong Soo, it's Mom. 

473
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:58,799
I actually wanted to meet you. What a great timing!

474
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,331
 I'm going to go down to the countryside. 

475
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,891
 I want to see all of you before I go. 

476
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,741
 Come to Brother's house, then. 

477
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,861
 It's Hanbit Apartment, Unit 1007, Gaepo-dong. 

478
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:09,899
 Okay. I got it. 

479
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:12,199
 Okay, I'll see you there. 

480
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,199
She's not at the train station or the terminal. What about you?

481
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,899
She didn't come to Han Mo Ne's house, either. The lights are off inside.

482
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:26,299
This is weird. She can't be found on any CCTV.

483
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,599
Hyung, you keep looking.

484
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,731
I'll go check out Han Mo Ne's brother's house.

485
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:41,041
Let's make lots of money together. Okay?

486
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,381
Man, what's with today's weather?

487
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:46,341
It's so great.

488
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:49,781
What's this? What's wrong with that lady?

489
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,631
Is she homeless?

490
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,921
- Beats me. 
 - What's the security doing?

491
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,271
She's lowering our apartment's quality!

492
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,741
- L-Let's go. 
 - I totally hate this.

493
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:02,241
Kyeong Soo, what's your mom like?

494
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,899
Is she the type to boss me around?

495
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,899
I'm telling you now. I won't get involved with my in-laws!

496
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,499
Gosh, just thinking about a mother-in-law makes me want to puke.

497
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,899
Don't worry. My mom's totally hands-free.

498
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,911
- She doesn't say a word to her kids. 
 - Really?

499
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,281
Gosh, how terrible. Just look at her shoes!

500
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,599
Come on, let's go.

501
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,599
We'll make lots of money so we don't end up like her. Okay?

502
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:31,521
Hurry up and come.

503
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,841
Where did I see that lady?

504
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,999
I'm sure I saw her from somewhere.

505
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,299
Should we have some beer?

506
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,791
I'll go buy them.

507
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,499
- Should I come with you? 
 - No, I can go alone.

508
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,199
I'll be quick.

509
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,199
Mom.

510
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,099
Mom—

511
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,799
Mister! Mister.

512
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,911
Did you see a lady who was standing here just now?

513
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,901
She was wearing a pink top and—

514
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,191
O-Oh, the one who can't speak?

515
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:15,221
Yes.

516
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,681
Is she your mom, young man?

517
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,711
Yes, she is. Which way did she go?

518
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:21,401
Well, she went that way.

519
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,399
She stood here and left.

520
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:27,899
Be kind to your mom while she's still alive.

521
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,151
You can't treat her well later, even if you want to after she passes away.

522
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,561
Who are you saying will die?

523
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:36,791
How dare you say such a horrible thing?

524
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,721
Mom, where are you? Mom, where are you?

525
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:47,591
Mom, where are you?

526
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:49,781
Mom!

527
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,671
Gosh.

528
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:53,661
Mom!

529
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:58,081
   

530
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:07,621
Gosh, I looked everywhere for you!

531
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:10,141
I told you to wait in front of Brother's house. Why are you here?

532
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,311
I already saw Kyeong Soo and came here.

533
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,971
Instead of that, come with me. We need to go somewhere.

534
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:17,981
- Where and why? 
 - Just come with me!

535
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:21,441
It's okay! Just come with me.

536
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:30,841
Yes, Chairman. Where should I head to?

537
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:33,221
I'll send you the address. Escort her there.

538
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,021
Yes.

539
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:12,581
   

540
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:19,011
 Could you look for my mom, please? 

541
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,771
 I'm worried something might've happened to her. 

542
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,399
As you ordered, I put my mom to sleep with a sleeping pill.

543
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:19,441
You brought your mom...

544
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:22,211
with your own hands, huh?

545
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:35,299
What a shame. You had a great future ahead of you.

546
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:38,899
Sorry? W-What do you—

547
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:48,599
This is so fun! It's amazing!

548
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,191
It's fucking exhilarating!

549
00:43:54,461 --> 00:44:00,081
I haven't felt this refreshed in a long time.

550
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:07,199
All right. There you go.

551
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,399
All right.

552
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:18,421
I'll give you a pretty polish.

553
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:22,911
There.

554
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,999
Yoohoo!

555
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:33,699
I feel completely freed from that fucking Lee Hwi So!

556
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:41,099
 You're evil to the bone, huh? 

557
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,771
 You'll surely die by Min Do Hyeok's hands. 

558
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:48,599
 Because I'll help him. 

559
00:45:14,391 --> 00:45:18,091
Did Matthew start his murders again?

560
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,821
Who is it?

561
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:22,491
He's Matthew's driver! It's Mr. Han.

562
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:26,899
No, he has died as Shim Joon Seok now.

563
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:29,099
Nam Cheol Woo,

564
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,921
you can take care of the aftermath.

565
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:36,171
Well, this is just a piece of cake.

566
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:40,151
This is why Matthew got me back into the police, you know.

567
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:43,931
By the way, who's the one in the backseat?

568
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:46,601
- The backseat? 
 - Huh?

569
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:51,241
The last victim Shim Joon Seok murdered.

570
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,651
You don't need to know who that is.

571
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:58,599
The dawn will break soon.

572
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,281
We need to wrap this up before then.

573
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:04,299
Hurry up!

574
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,551
Push!

575
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,399
 Breaking news. 

576
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:20,199
 Yongin Police Station just received a letter from Shim Joon Seok. 

577
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,791
 In his letter, 

578
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:25,699
 Shim Joon Seok showed his hatred towards Chairman Matthew and how overwhelmed he felt. 

579
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:31,999
 He also said he'll decorate an honorable finale with the last offering. 

580
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:35,031
Do Hyeok, be patient for now!

581
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:38,099
Nothing's been confirmed yet! What can you do by going there now?

582
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,799
Something's gone awfully wrong.

583
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:44,101
I'm going to see whose corpse it is with my own eyes.

584
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:52,739
   

585
00:47:55,291 --> 00:48:00,299
   
 Serial Killer Shim Joon Seok was found dead at Yongin Reservoir. 

586
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:05,199
 A large force of police began the search at the reservoir near Shim's vacation home 

587
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,941
 that he specified in his letter. 

588
00:48:08,941 --> 00:48:12,041
 - Four heavy equipment such as cranes and...  
- I hear Shim Joon Seok died.

589
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,541
 After an underwater search... 

590
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:17,231
- Who died in Shim Joon Seok's place? 
  - a vehicle was lifted in about an hour and a half. 

591
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:21,501
- Beats me. Who could it be? 
  - The vehicle owner was identified as Shim Joon Seok, 

592
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:25,141
 - and he was in the driver's seat...  
 - I'm also curious.

593
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:26,891
 This news just came in. 

594
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:30,011
 Inside Shim Joon Seok's vehicle that was brought out of Yongin Reservoir, 

595
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:34,741
 a corpse of serial killer Shim Joon Seok and another corpse were found. 

596
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:37,199
 Some people thought it was Director Michelle. 

597
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,199
 But the identification card was found inside the corpse's clothes, 

598
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,841
 confirming her identity. 

599
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:46,531
 The deceased is Yoon Ji Sook. Born in 1967. 

600
00:48:46,531 --> 00:48:51,751
 I repeat. The deceased is Yoon Ji Sook. Born in 1967. 

601
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:58,161
 The deceased is Yoon Ji Sook. Born in 1967. 

602
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:12,261
No...

603
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:14,131
No...

604
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,499
Mom!

605
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:58,799
No, no, no.

606
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:02,991
No, no, no, no...

607
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:05,041
M-Mom...

608
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:10,111
Mom! Mom!

609
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:13,941
Mom!

610
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,821
Mom...

611
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,781
 I found Yoon Ji Sook. 

612
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:23,711
Where is she? I can head over now.

613
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:26,051
 Yongin Reservoir. 

614
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:29,941
What?

615
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:32,211
What did you just say?

616
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,599
Say that again.

617
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,399
 Yongin Reservoir's corpse belongs to Yoon Ji Sook. 

618
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:41,451
 The one who died with her is Han Mo Ne's younger brother. 

619
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:45,371
You knew about this, didn't you?

620
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,241
That it'd end up this way.

621
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,201
Why didn't you stop it?

622
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:57,591
You killed them.

623
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:03,731
You killed them. Why?

624
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:07,321
Why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you stop it?

625
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:11,671
Why didn't you stop it—

626
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,591
Han Mo Ne.

627
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:36,501
You should also feel...

628
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:40,399
all the pain Da Mi experienced!

629
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:44,011
I'll let you experience it all vividly...

630
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:47,321
until your flesh tears apart...

631
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:52,171
and your bones crumble.

632
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:04,851
 - Careful now! 
 - Watch out! 

633
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,841
 Block-Block them. 

634
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:12,061
No, Mom! Mom!

635
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:14,211
 Confirm her identity! 

636
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,051
Mom!

637
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,631
Mom!

638
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:20,811
Mom! Mom!

639
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:23,481
Mom! No!

640
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:26,641
Let go.

641
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:30,531
Mom!

642
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,441
Mom! Mom!

643
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,311
Mom, wait for me!

644
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:36,841
Mom, wait for me! Wait!

645
00:52:46,351 --> 00:52:48,661
Let go of me!

646
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:50,741
Please go.

647
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:56,121
Don't step over the line there.

648
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,751
Do Hyeok! Do Hyeok!

649
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:03,901
- Do Hyeok! 
 - I'm going to kill him right now.

650
00:53:03,901 --> 00:53:06,231
- Let me go! 
 - Hold back!

651
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:08,661
Doing this right now will mess up our plans more.

652
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:10,301
People are watching right now!

653
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:13,541
It was my fault. I'll kill him.

654
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:18,141
It wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault, Do Hyeok!

655
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:21,611
Just focus on Lee Hwi So. Let's only...

656
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:24,521
think about Lee Hwi So right now.

657
00:53:54,741 --> 00:53:58,801
   

658
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:04,261
   

659
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:14,999
- Hello? 
 - Eat.

660
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:17,361
I'm calling from the special room in Youngseong Funeral Home.

661
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:20,399
I'd like to order 300 more servings of food here.

662
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:22,799
Please make sure we get them on time.

663
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:25,999
Hello.

664
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:28,699
Mo Ne really didn't come, huh?

665
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:33,699
She didn't even come to her mom's funeral. Whoa, the most vicious and scariest bitch.

666
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:41,921
It's horrible just to think the corpse in the backseat was Mo Ne's mom back then.

667
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:45,401
As a warning for Mo Ne, he punished her with blood.

668
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:47,451
No.

669
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,681
It was a warning to all of us.

670
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:51,601
Betrayal is...

671
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:59,131
Oh, Myeong Ji!

672
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:04,561
I heard that the child, Noh Hannah, will receive foster care.

673
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,099
Did you hear anything?

674
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:07,799
Mind your own business.

675
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:10,401
You don't meet the requirements, Ms. Cha.

676
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:12,611
You don't have a family, you know.

677
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:16,901
Why don't I meet the requirements? Marriage— I'll just get married now.

678
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:22,911
We'll take care of Hannah.

679
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:25,399
I already talked it over with Matthew, too.

680
00:55:25,399 --> 00:55:28,641
What? Who said you can?

681
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:34,071
 I'll protect Hannah this time, no matter what, Paeng Hee. 

682
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:38,311
 - Chairman Matthew, one word, please! 
 - A word, please! 

683
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:41,571
 A word, please! Please! 

684
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,741
 - Just a word— 
 - Please give us a word! 

685
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:47,951
 - Why didn't you come to the scene? 
 - How are you feeling? 

686
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:01,981
I'm sorry.

687
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:05,021
I failed to prevent the last accident.

688
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:10,199
We couldn't even imagine Shim Joon Seok would go this far.

689
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:12,599
Where's Han Mo Ne?

690
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:17,941
- Mo Ne is... 
 - Where's that bitch, Han Mo Ne?

691
00:56:22,371 --> 00:56:24,011
Move!

692
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:27,311
What are you looking at? Move!

693
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:29,899
Move!

694
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:33,199
Never seen a bastard who lost his mom, huh?

695
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:41,761
I'm going to kill Han Mo Ne.

696
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:45,049
   

697
00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:46,351
Who the hell—!

698
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:48,361
- Are you any different? 
 - What the fuck—

699
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,531
Do you have the right to flip out?

700
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:54,561
You should be furious at someone else, not Han Mo Ne.

701
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:57,721
The one who killed your mom and younger brother.

702
00:57:00,481 --> 00:57:02,731
My younger brother...

703
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:05,481
Cheong Soo died?

704
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:09,321
Who is it?

705
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:11,941
Who the fuck is it? Tell me!

706
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:14,871
Matthew.

707
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:20,271
   

708
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,711
   

709
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,791
   

710
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,191
   

711
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:38,411
Lee Hwi So! 
    

712
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:48,311
 Great going, Min Do Hyeok. 

713
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:53,941
 But keep in mind that I'm also an offender who killed Da Mi. 

714
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:57,141
   

715
00:58:00,899 --> 00:58:05,199
 Was it Matthew who did that to my mom? 

716
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:07,371
 Or was it you? 

717
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,871
 Can I tell you honestly? 

718
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:11,731
 It was me. 

719
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:14,441
 I killed her. 

720
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:18,431
 Why? 

721
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:20,791
 Why did you do that? 

722
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,481
 Why kill my innocent mom? 

723
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:25,661
 Does one have to be guilty to die? 

724
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:28,811
 If you're mad, go ahead and tear me apart. 

725
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:31,471
 I'll take you on anytime. 

726
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,199
Han Mo Ne!

727
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:29,299
Don't blame yourself too harshly.

728
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,796
I can't fully understand

729
00:59:32,796 --> 00:59:35,286
why you lived such a life, Mo Ne.

730
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:38,999
But even if I were in your shoes,

731
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:42,499
I might've made the same decision.

732
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:55,486
Mo Ne. Han Mo Ne!

733
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:07,066
To the hospital. Hurry up!

734
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:38,476
Come, Hannah. Welcome home.

735
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:45,006
Let's get along.

736
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:47,766
We used to go to the same kindergarten before.

737
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:49,256
Do you remember?

738
01:00:49,256 --> 01:00:52,476
You're more famous than my sister.

739
01:00:52,476 --> 01:00:55,216
Your face is way prettier, too.

740
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:58,076
What? You want to get hit?

741
01:01:01,706 --> 01:01:03,446
Thank you for coming.

742
01:01:03,446 --> 01:01:05,286
What do you like, Hannah?

743
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,786
Do you want to eat anything?

744
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,406
Are you all right?

745
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:36,996
I need to go see my mom.

746
01:01:36,996 --> 01:01:39,506
I need to go to my mom.

747
01:01:39,506 --> 01:01:42,206
Calm down. You need to rest more.

748
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:45,006
My mom must be waiting for me.

749
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:47,636
I've got to apologize to my mom.

750
01:01:47,636 --> 01:01:50,206
Tell her that I'm sorry, and

751
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,236
that I had gone mad!

752
01:01:52,236 --> 01:01:54,796
That I was one crazy bitch!

753
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:57,476
Pull yourself together, Han Mo Ne!

754
01:02:02,906 --> 01:02:05,566
Use me if you need to.

755
01:02:06,346 --> 01:02:09,506
Use me as much as you want

756
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,016
and achieve everything you want.

757
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:15,136
I'll gladly...

758
01:02:17,736 --> 01:02:20,896
be used by you.

759
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,126
 Please enjoy. 

760
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:40,726
 That'd be 3,000 won. 

761
01:02:40,726 --> 01:02:42,806
 Thank you. 

762
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,699
 Oh, right. The delivery. 

763
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:52,006
 I'll be back. 

764
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:03,516
 Hold on. 

765
01:03:03,516 --> 01:03:06,636
 I'm sorry, but you're really my type. 

766
01:03:07,856 --> 01:03:10,326
 - Where do you think you're going? 
 - W-Wait! 

767
01:03:10,326 --> 01:03:12,576
 Come on, what's wrong? 

768
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:14,796
 - Let me see that. 
 - W-Whoa, not this. 

769
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:16,516
 - Where's the money? 
 - Hurry up and take it from her. 

770
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:18,616
 - Hey. 
 - Gosh— 

771
01:03:18,616 --> 01:03:22,216
 - Is that your boyfriend? 
 - Hey, wait up. 

772
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:24,566
 Miste, walk on over that way. Okay? 

773
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:26,876
 I told you to just go— 

774
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,999
 Thank you for helping me. 

775
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:03,016
 Wait, you got blood here. 

776
01:04:06,486 --> 01:04:08,066
 It's okay. 

777
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:10,736
 Let me at least give you money for the medicine. 

778
01:04:11,776 --> 01:04:14,336
 Pay me back when you become successful later. 

779
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:20,286
 I'll come to get the payment, Han Mo Ne. 

780
01:04:20,286 --> 01:04:23,236
 Wait. How did you know my name— 

781
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:40,096
 Shim Joon Seok. 

782
01:04:51,316 --> 01:04:53,076
 What's this? 

783
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:49,636
Getting engaged to a chaebol?

784
01:05:49,636 --> 01:05:53,396
Does this mean Mo Ne will rise to the top again?

785
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:56,766
Han Mo Ne has done it again. She always has a trick up her sleeve.

786
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:59,266
She plummeted and got right back up.

787
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:02,666
Though someone else's ambition ended as only a dream.

788
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:01,406
C-Careful.

789
01:07:11,886 --> 01:07:14,666
Congrats.

790
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:17,566
Your mom must be happy to see this from the heavens.

791
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,906
You did well. Come here.

792
01:07:28,816 --> 01:07:31,346
I'm proud of you.

793
01:07:31,346 --> 01:07:35,106
Doing all you can to stay alive...

794
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:37,406
My daughter, Mo Ne.

795
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:41,196
You're really

796
01:07:41,196 --> 01:07:44,766
the only mom I have in this world, CEO Geum.

797
01:07:46,706 --> 01:07:48,546
Mom.

798
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:05,216
 From now on, 

799
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:10,116
 I'll spend my life trying to kill you, Geum Ra Hee. 

800
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:36,949
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Run, Run, as Fast as You Can🏃@ Viki.com 

801
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:12,526
 Thank you so much for loving Mo Ne. 

802
01:09:12,526 --> 01:09:15,216
 Thank you so much. 

803
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:18,176
 Thank you so much. 

804
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:51,756
 Bring me a corpse of a woman without family or friends within an hour. 

805
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:53,866
 As soon as possible. 

806
01:10:09,266 --> 01:10:12,186
   

807
01:10:12,186 --> 01:10:15,306
 I won't hold back anymore, either. 

808
01:10:15,306 --> 01:10:16,756
 W-Wait, we still- 

809
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:19,296
 No matter what happens, bring me Mo Ne. 

810
01:10:19,296 --> 01:10:20,456
 This is Luca? 

811
01:10:20,456 --> 01:10:23,546
 I've been getting intel from someone called Medusa. 

812
01:10:23,546 --> 01:10:27,276
 I just need to do this to get at him. Right? 

813
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:29,066
 What's going on here? 

814
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:31,706
 You promised to give me Geum Ra Hee's life. Right? 

815
01:10:31,706 --> 01:10:33,776
 This will kill you in one minute after drinking it. 

816
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:36,796
 Let me see you begging for your life. 

817
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:40,986
♫  Arise and stand with me  ♫

818
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,780
♫  Until I stop breathing  ♫
