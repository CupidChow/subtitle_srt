1
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,380
   

2
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,270
   

3
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,980
   

4
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,320
   

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,830
Safe! Whoa, you came right on time!

6
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,090
The press conference is exactly 10 minutes away.

7
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,750
- Move aside. 
 - Gosh!

8
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,410
Don't you dare lay a finger on Chairwoman!

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,750
It's fine!

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,180
Why fear some trash like him?

11
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,070
Joon Seok, I'm so sorry to tell you this.

12
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,980
Unfortunately, you got the wrong address.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,130
The press conference isn't happening here.

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,600
How does it feel to be played by fake information?

15
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,880
Take down that thief right now.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,400
Don't move. Don't move!

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,140
You can bring it on if you want to die!

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,690
What a fucking wimp!

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,350
How dare you trick me?

20
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,760
Luca, track down the reporters who were invited to Hwang Chan Seong's house today.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,690
 Yes, starting location tracking. 

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,980
Please look at the truth now.

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,030
Please look at our faces.

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,520
We're the real offenders...

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,950
who looked away from the truth of the Pom Girl incident,

26
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,730
consistently lied,

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,900
and made K, the serial killer,

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,620
into a national hero.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,670
From this day on, I'm retiring permanently from the industry and

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll humbly accept any punishment

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,920
for the crimes I committed.

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,760
Shouldn't you turn yourself into the police first?

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,540
If you testify altogether, Chairman Matthew couldn't get out of it, either.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,060
To break down the lies first, we need reporters who will deliver the truth.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,150
We have a chance only if we convince people that Matthew isn't Lee Hwi So.

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,030
The entire nation must know.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,750
That the serial killer, K, stole Lee Hwi So's technology.

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,720
What about K, who committed suicide?

39
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,530
Who was that person?

40
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,220
He was my younger brother

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,610
who was Matthew's aide, Han Cheong Soo.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,940
I will also divorce Hwang Chan Seong, a domestic violence offender.

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,600
Are you saying you were also a victim of domestic violence?

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,840
Yes, it's true.

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,140
   

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,110
How can we trust that you're telling the truth?

47
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,700
What if you're all lying right now?

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,250
What if you're planning to lock us up here and force us to write articles?

49
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,540
Can you prove how you're different from Matthew?

50
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,230
We won't force anyone.

51
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,910
I'll let you decide whether or not you'll write your articles.

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,520
I only trust your journalistic conviction,

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
dignity, and mission.

54
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,440
What's this? It's not uploading!

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,340
My phone's not working, either.

56
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,890
All network connections have been blocked!

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,440
- What's this? 
 - What's going on?

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,070
Nothing's working at all!

59
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,370


60
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,970
It's a DDoS attack.

61
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,440
Besides this building, the nearby areas are all affected by radio jamming.

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,930
It's K's doing.

63
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,530
K realized our plan and our location, too.

64
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,900
 DDoS attack has been completed. 

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,760
 Great job, Luca! 

66
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,010
 You can try all you want! 

67
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,720
You guys could never beat me!

68
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,500
This is possible?

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,750
   

70
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,870
This is how powerful Luca is?

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,760
There's a network failure around here currently caused by Matthew's attack.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,890
We'll have to relocate, unfortunately.

73
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,350
Those who want to come with us, please raise your hands.

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,680
Please take courage so the truth won't get buried.

75
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,480
As expected, did we fail?

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,570
I'll come with you.

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,070
If he's that shady, enough to wage a DDoS attack,

78
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,260
I must dig into him out of spite now.

79
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll believe you guys and put my name, Byeon Young Cheol, on the line.

80
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,350
I'll come, too!

81
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,310
Me, too!

82
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,000
How dare he try to stop reporters?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,340
I'm coming, too.

84
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,880
- Me, too. 
 - I'll come as well.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,700
- I'm coming. 
 - I'll come with you, too.

86
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,980
It's all okay now.

87
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,400
We can at least get it started now.

88
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Thank you for believing us.

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,970
Please continue your articles at a different location.

90
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,250
We'll escort you to a safe hotel.

91
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,210
Also, K might track your locations, so please turn off your phones.

92
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,130
Everyone gather your things and follow me. There's no time.

93
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,030
This way, please.

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,280
Please go to where the kids are.

95
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,250
K might send someone there.

96
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,570
- Let's hurry. 
 - Yes.

97
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,970
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry!

98
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,410
I'm coming with you.

99
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,520
I promised the kids that I'd get the man who did that to their mom.

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,220
We'll run two tracks at once.

101
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,120
The reporters will post their articles, and we'll post our confession video on S Talk.

102
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,420
Let's end this today.

103
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,710
They moved together in a van.

104
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,310
They're planning to upload the articles elsewhere.

105
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,300
Luca, track their vehicle.

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,590
You mustn't lose them.

107
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,030
 Yes, Chairman. 

108
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,370
Hwang Chan Seong, I've got a job for you.

109
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,280
If you act according to my plan, we can stop them.

110
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,090
Just give the word.

111
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,990
Gosh, why aren't the articles coming up?

112
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,910
It's supposed to be blowing up by now.

113
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,500
Try calling your sister.

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,330
Okay.

115
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,310
Grandmother, the men who protect us are all on the ground.

116
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,950
What?

117
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,210
M-Mom,

118
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,270
we need to take the kids and run right now!

119
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,020
Hannah, take the kids and escape through the exit on the second floor.

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,890
Hurry up and go now!

121
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,470
Mom, you go with them, too!

122
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,610
You can't do it alone. I'll help!

123
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,520
No, Mom! Just hurry up and go!

124
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,850
Hannah, don't look back and run away with the twins. You can do it, right?

125
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,690
Yes. You have to be careful, too. Okay?

126
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,620
Come this way!

127
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,990
Mom!

128
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,050
 Get them! 

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Who are you people?

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,420
Why are you barging into our house without permission?

131
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,950
The kids aren't here.

132
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,030
- Check the second floor. 
  - Yes! 

133
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,870
It's the police, right? Someone broke into my house right now.

134
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,970
Please hurry up and—

135
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,090
M-Mom!

136
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,590
Hyungnim, the kids aren't here. I think they ran away already.

137
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,570
Go out and find them right now. There are three of them.

138
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,250
Catch at least one of them.

139
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,990
Hurry!

140
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,740
You can't go!

141
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,070
You bastards! Have you no shame?

142
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,050
How dare you try to hurt kids?

143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,250
Let's go that way!

144
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,780
 Hurry up and find them! It's one boy and two girls! 

145
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,630
 - Scatter around! 
 - Yes! 

146
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,670
 You go this way! 

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,510
Now is the time. Let's run.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,820
My feet won't move.

149
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,850
What are you doing, Sis? Hurry!

150
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,340
I can't move.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,250
Erica, don't be afraid.

152
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,420
Just think this is an act.

153
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,980
- An act? 
 - Yes, an act.

154
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,550
The camera's there, and the director's there, too.

155
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,940
We're running away from the villains right now.

156
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,840
 Erica. 

157
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,780
 Cheer up! 

158
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,620
Mom!

159
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,200
Mom's watching me.

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,730
I'm not afraid.

161
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,470
We'll take down the villains.

162
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,590
Even in cartoons, the ones who save the world are little kids like us.

163
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,400
I'll never lose to the villain.

164
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,220
Let's go.

165
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,530
Gosh, this old fart. Do you have a death wish?

166
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,070
N-No, no.

167
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,070
Don't hit my mom!

168
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,510
You can die with her, then.

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,340
You little.

170
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,640
Why you little!

171
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,180
Mom!

172
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,180
Mom! Mom, are you okay?

173
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,280
What about the kids?

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,140
They ran away, but those bastards went after them.

175
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,360
Mo Ne, stay here with your mom. We'll find the kids.

176
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,950
- Cheol Woo, hurry! 
 - Yes.

177
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,030
This little.

178
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,250
Dr. Cha and Mr. Nam!

179
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,970
I beg of you. Please find the kids.

180
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,070
- I'm begging you. 
 - I got it.

181
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,440
You're in shock, huh? Try to get up.

182
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,630
Are you hurt anywhere?

183
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,060
 I'm okay. 

184
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,740
 I hope Hannah and the twins are all right. 

185
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,140
Gosh! I-I'm sorry.

186
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,420
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,520
Ahjumma!

188
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,500
 - Ahjumma!  
 - Y-Yes.

189
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,600
- Yes. 
 - Ahjumma.

190
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,550
We found the kids. You can rest easy now.

191
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,190
Mom, they found them.

192
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,540
Thank you. Thank you so much.

193
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,650
Who is it?

194
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,760
You didn't turn off your phone?

195
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,610
Min Do Hyeok said to leave your phone off

196
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,680
since your location can be tracked through TikiTaka Talk.

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,450
I'm sorry. I thought I turned it off.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,540
What's the matter? Huh?

199
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,120
- Wait 
 - Stay seated.

200
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,820
Who are you people?

201
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,700
Did Chairman Matthew order you to do this?

202
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Hey, you with the phone there.

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,900
Stop it unless you want to die.

204
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,250
All right. Hold your phones above your heads and turn them on.

205
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,230
Get to it!

206
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Get going!

207
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,850
Hurry up and get off!

208
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,410
Get off, all of you!

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,380
Move it!

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,150
Hurry it up now!

211
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,410
- Hurry up! 
 - All right. Hurry up and get out.

212
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,430
Kneel!

213
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,430
All right.

214
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,240
All right.

215
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,330
Move it!

216
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,430
Kneel.

217
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,590
- Kneel! 
 - Kneel!

218
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,440
Kneel!

219
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,580
Sorry for the poor treatment.

220
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,400
What's the meaning of this, Chairman Matthew?

221
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,060
What do you mean?

222
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm trying to protect you from people who seek to distort and cover up the truth.

223
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,190
Protect us? You mean you're trying to block our eyes and ears?

224
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,280
Reporter Byeon,

225
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,370
you're the one blocking off your eyes and ears.

226
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,420
Did you even know your wife bought a piece of Gagok District?

227
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,310
Quit the nonsense!

228
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,520
My wife doesn't know how to do such things.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,600
Of course, that'd be the case.

230
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,010
I'm sure you only heard lies from your wife all this time.

231
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,270
Humans have always been weak to fake news.

232
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:25,270
Because fake news is more stimulating and thrilling than actual news!

233
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,240
And sometimes, the fake one even becomes the real one.

234
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,680
Just like you, huh?

235
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,180
Serial killer Shim Joon Seok!

236
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,440
Shamelessly pretending to be a national hero when you're a murderer!

237
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,920
Don't think we're easy.

238
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,780
People might call us trashy reporters,

239
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,320
but we're not shameless enough to turn a murderer into a national hero.

240
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,230
You messed with the wrong people.

241
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,290
No, no.

242
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,620
You can't stop us.

243
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,330
I'll show you what true journalism is!

244
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,330
Do you really think you can do that?

245
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,680
- Luca. 
  - Yes, Chairman. 

246
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,440
 Send our righteous reporters here the messages from their families. 

247
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,210
 Sending messages. 

248
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,730
Huh?

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,890
All right! Please take a look over here, too!

250
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,590
   

251
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,540
What?

252
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,580
That crazy wife of mine...

253
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,830
Wasn't it supposed to be a secret chat?

254
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,810
You said they're deleted automatically,

255
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,020
but you were actually collecting all conversations?

256
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,040
Of course, that's my real weapon!

257
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,320
Do you understand the situation now?

258
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,030
The moment this is exposed,

259
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:53,410
the entire world will know how delusional and hypocritical your journalism is.

260
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,200
Manipulating public opinion is a walk in the park.

261
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,450
If I just leak bits of your family's personal info,

262
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,890
they'll attack them like hungry hyenas and shred them to pieces.

263
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:12,980
Some of your families might even take their own lives, then.

264
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,670
The cause of those deaths will be

265
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,270
you guys. You murderers.

266
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,730
If you think that blackmail will work, you're mistaken.

267
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,280
You're so knowledgeable, yet why can't I get through to you?

268
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
All right.

269
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,120
What do you think about an ignorant

270
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,230
method like this?

271
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,830
All right. Who else wants to die?

272
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,920
This son of a bitch!

273
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,530
Whoa, please hold back!

274
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,720
Please hold it.

275
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,020
Okay?

276
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,430
You accept the deal, right?

277
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,240
I'll tell you what I want now.

278
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Forget everything you heard and saw today, and

279
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,000
write articles exactly as I tell you from now on.

280
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,590
Did they forget how to type?

281
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,430
When are the articles posting?

282
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,070
Hyung, why? It's still not done?

283
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,060
It looks like something happened to them.

284
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,730
The reporters aren't here.

285
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,170
The driver isn't answering his phone, either.

286
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,830
K must've taken the reporters.

287
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,250
That fucking asshole!

288
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,920
Okay. I'll upload the confession video right now.

289
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,260
Hyung, find the reporters fast and secure them.

290
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,140
   

291
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,700
   
   

292
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,180
   

293
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,090
What's this? Why did the power suddenly go out?

294
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,730
Do you have backup power?

295
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,010
I'll give them a call.

296
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,080
Hello?

297
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,360
Hello!

298
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,750
It's not working.

299
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,840
   

300
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,370
The backup power went out, too.

301
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,070
Someone must've attacked the data center to stop us.

302
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,400
It's Joon Seok's doing again.

303
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,850
Aunt, stay here and make sure the video gets uploaded.

304
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,820
Let's go to the power room.

305
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,250
Fuck this bullshit!

306
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,610
How should I get this son of a bitch killed to make sure I've done it right?

307
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,960
Shit! Fry him to death? Tear him apart?

308
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,660
Shit! Let him hang dry?

309
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,210
Just let me catch you, you fake—

310
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,630
Who are you?

311
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,450
   

312
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,580
   

313
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,720
   

314
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,580
What happened? There was a fire?

315
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,740
K set the data center on fire.

316
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,660
We also lost the press conference footage because all CCTVs were hacked.

317
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,230
How did it go?

318
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,470
The fire didn't spread too much, thanks to the quick report.

319
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,370
Where did the fire start?

320
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,240
It was near the uninterruptable power supply area.

321
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:46,993
Vice President Kang.

322
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:49,803
Vice President Kang.

323
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,413
Vice President Kang!

324
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,263
Are you okay?

325
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:02,883
Ki Tak, I'm alive. Right?

326
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,573
I'm not dead, am I?

327
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:08,443
Please pinch my cheek.

328
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:10,483
Hurry up.

329
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,943
Yes, I'm alive for sure.

330
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:26,443
Gosh, that hurts.

331
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,933
K destroyed the data center.

332
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,293
He also stole our confession video.

333
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:37,013
It wasn't K. It was Hwang Chan Seong!

334
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:42,163
I focused so hard to look at his face even as I was passing out.

335
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,623
I did well, right?

336
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,953
It's Hwang Chan Seong?

337
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:47,743
The power of evil grew bigger.

338
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:50,173
They're still leftovers.

339
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:53,043
We're Seongchan! We also have S Talk.

340
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:56,573
But it'll take some time to restore the center.

341
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:58,653
We don't have a disaster recovery system, either.

342
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:03,083
Sorry. You know I sold it off before we joined forces. Right?

343
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,543
It looks like K found the reporters' weaknesses in Secret Talk.

344
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:10,053
The driver got shot, but he's missing at the moment.

345
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,873
We're looking for him everywhere.

346
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:14,453
We have more victims now.

347
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,693
K became more powerful, and we're still facing a crisis.

348
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:26,713
All right, now! Don't lose your fighting spirit.

349
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:30,853
Do you know how my brother built Seongchan to be the number one corporation in Korea?

350
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,283
Seongchan had countless crises as well!

351
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,723
Every time, he turned a crisis into an opportunity and every trouble into a fortune,

352
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,903
using the wisdom of a blessing in disguise!

353
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:44,153
So, my nephew, don't give up.

354
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:46,703
It's your turn to act now.

355
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,783
You're Seongchan's face and future, Do Hyeok.

356
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,063
I trust you.

357
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,063
Cheers.

358
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,063
Welcome to K-Land.

359
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:06,253
Evil deeds are better done together than alone.

360
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,643
It was quite fun.

361
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:16,303
They won't be able to make a move so easily for a while now.

362
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:19,893
I'm sure they realized this time that

363
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,873
people die if they try to do something.

364
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:26,213
I'm so glad we're on the same side.

365
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:29,163
Especially, Luca.

366
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,033
It's a really crazy system.

367
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:37,463
I need to make proper use of that grand masterpiece in the future.

368
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:42,773
And I must obtain Gagok District to do that.

369
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,943
Why are you obsessing over Gagok District?

370
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:49,493
What scheme are you working so hard at?

371
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:52,143
- Are you curious? 
 - Yes.

372
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,353
Luca, show him!

373
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:11,043
Are you planning to build a high-tech digital center complex?

374
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:14,413
Higher, deeper, and wider than that.

375
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:19,013
I'll obtain the authority to control society by monopolizing all information.

376
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:22,633
I already installed networks for hacking below Gagok District.

377
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,693
That's why it has to be Gagok District.

378
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:28,993
If this succeeds, TikiTaka will collect

379
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:32,063
all confidential information of the government and major corporations.

380
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:35,593
In this world where information is power,

381
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,103
you'll steer it by the reins?

382
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,613
That's right.

383
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:41,453
Luca is a compilation of information in Korea.

384
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,333
That means I'm the power,

385
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:48,543
the absolute ruler, the king,

386
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:50,983
and the god.

387
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:55,703
Wouldn't you like a chance to swear your loyalty to me?

388
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:59,403
Gosh, I'll serve you with my all.

389
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,953
Yes.

390
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,413
We'll have to revive Gagok District first, then.

391
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:09,213
I'm going to give you a gift to commemorate our alliance.

392
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,853
It's what you want most desperately.

393
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:16,063
What I want?

394
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:21,693
Getting rid of Min Do Hyeok?

395
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:27,023
Bingo. There will be an article about the scandal of the century tomorrow morning.

396
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:31,143
Written by the 10 most influential reporters in Korea.

397
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:33,093
   

398
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:34,703
   

399
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:36,303
   

400
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,773
   

401
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,863
   

402
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:44,243
Firstly, congratulations on getting reinstated as the chairman.

403
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:47,023
There was a fire at S Talk's data center, and

404
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:50,273
the affair scandal between Min Do Hyeok and Han Mo Ne.

405
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:52,993
Seongchan Group continues to have crises.

406
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:55,773
What do you think about this matter?

407
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:58,003
It's karma.

408
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:01,023
I can comfortably tell you now

409
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:03,743
the reason I parted ways with Min Do Hyeok.

410
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:07,233
Were you aware of the affair between Min Do Hyeok and Han Mo Ne?

411
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:11,903
Well, at the least, I knew that Min Do Hyeok liked Han Mo Ne.

412
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:16,293
I had advised him as his brother, but Min Do Hyeok didn't listen.

413
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:19,463
I couldn't help but fire Min Do Hyeok because of this, and

414
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:23,573
I think he held a grudge and framed me as a murderer.

415
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:27,143
Does that mean Hwang Chan Seong had

416
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:30,353
never physically abused Han Mo Ne?

417
00:28:30,353 --> 00:28:33,113
CEO Hwang isn't someone who would do such a thing.

418
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,383
CEO Hwang went into hiding

419
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:39,293
because he was shocked to find out about the affair.

420
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:46,913
TikiTaka will cancel its contract with Han Mo Ne from this moment and

421
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:51,633
seek legal responsibility to the fullest according to the indemnification clause.

422
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,103
Honey! Honey! This is bad! This—

423
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,803
You'll wake the kids.

424
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:01,543
Okay.

425
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:05,773
What is it? What's the matter now?

426
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:10,583
It's up. The article on Min Do Hyeok and Han Mo Ne's affair.

427
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:16,743
   

428
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:36,873
 I still love you. 

429
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:39,223
 If you'll come back to me, Mo Ne, 

430
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:44,023
 I can forgive you for everything and take care of this matter. 

431
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:47,333
What a fucking asshole.

432
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:13,143
 In her current condition, a heart transplant is the only way to save the patient. 

433
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:16,773
 We put her name on the organ transplant waiting list. 

434
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,293
 But we don't know when a donor will show up. 

435
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:29,093
I'll do whatever it takes to save you.

436
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:33,083
I'll carve out my heart and give it to you if I have to.

437
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:36,213
Let's not give up.

438
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,283
 You can't come in. 

439
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,373
 Gosh, it'll only take a moment. 

440
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,833
 Why are you stopping me? 

441
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,373
Could we talk?

442
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:07,933
You always show up at the worst fucking time.

443
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:13,503
I want to tear you to pieces whenever I see Myeong Ji.

444
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:17,383
But how dare you stand right in front of me?

445
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,323
Gosh, you're scaring me.

446
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:25,993
I'm trying my darndest not to become a murderer for the kids' sake.

447
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,013
Get lost.

448
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:33,273
Don't you need a heart?

449
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:35,873
I can give her a heart, you see.

450
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:42,493
Are you interested in talking to me now, Mayor?

451
00:31:43,873 --> 00:31:46,373
I know someone who is brain-dead.

452
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:49,473
I'll give that person's heart to Go Myeong Ji.

453
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:52,993
Could it be the driver you shot?

454
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:56,473
I shot him for you so I can give his heart to Go Myeong Ji.

455
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:59,213
You're not even human.

456
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:01,503
You're right.

457
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,613
So save Gagok District first if you want to save Go Myeong Ji.

458
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,303
Say there were no private cartels after investigating

459
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:09,393
and you'll build a high-tech city as planned!

460
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,803
Shut your trap before I shut it for you.

461
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:16,813
I'd rather offer the demon my soul than make a deal with you.

462
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:19,853
Everything will be a happy ending if you just hand over Gagok District.

463
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,973
Why don't you know that? So foolish!

464
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,173
You will never know.

465
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:26,583
What it feels like to have a family you want to protect.

466
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:30,663
A family? What are you saying, you orphan?

467
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:33,733
You can never become family unless you're related by blood.

468
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,623
Let me tell you as someone who's been through it.

469
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,703
It'll hurt a lot once you wake up from your delusion.

470
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:40,243
No, you're the one who's deluded.

471
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,863
The delusion that you're alone and abandoned!

472
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:46,453
To you, family is something you resent and loathe.

473
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:48,873
But Min Do Hyeok is different.

474
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:50,603
And that's why you're below him.

475
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:52,143
Why you little!

476
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,853
We'll only become closer and stronger,

477
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:57,143
the more you struggle frantically.

478
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,043
Right.

479
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:08,773
Min Do Hyeok is really pissed off because of the fake news you made.

480
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:13,173
He'll screw you big time soon, so be prepared.

481
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,303
What did you say?

482
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:20,883
You're the one who raised the stakes for us, you fake fucker.

483
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:26,063
Seongchan Group's press conference room is probably full of reporters by now.

484
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:32,493
   

485
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:40,173
I apologize sincerely for the inconvenience

486
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:44,313
caused by the fire at our data center last night.

487
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:48,413
We'll compensate for all damages caused by the error.

488
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,843
Taking responsibility for this matter,

489
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:59,043
I, Shim Mi Young, will be stepping down.

490
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:03,903
In that case, will Seongchan Group be without a chairman for a while?

491
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:06,093
There is no way.

492
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:12,873
There's a new chairman who will lead Seongchan's future.

493
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:15,873
I'll introduce him right now.

494
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:19,073
Please come in, Chairman.

495
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,953
 Why is he here? 

496
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:42,323
   

497
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,663
Please speak.

498
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:47,373
Min Do Hyeok will become Seongchan Group's chairman?

499
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:51,773
Do you think he qualifies when his act of adultery is causing an uproar?

500
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:54,563
Why wouldn't he qualify?

501
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:59,573
Let me introduce him officially.

502
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:03,073
Chairman Shim Yong's biological son and...

503
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:08,973
the only real nephew to exist in this world.

504
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,473
He is Min Do Hyeok.

505
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:23,273
She's right.

506
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:28,413
Just as Chairman Shim Yong said in his final claim, I'm the real son.

507
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,543
Shim Joon Seok's father is Goo Gang Jae

508
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:34,333
who was Chairman Shim Yong's secretary in the past.

509
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:39,313
In other words, he is fake.

510
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:43,643
The fake one has been pretending to be real and

511
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:48,273
that Shim Joon Seok is CEO Matthew Lee of TikiTaka.

512
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:51,873
 Matthew Lee? 

513
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:53,293
Hold on!

514
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:56,323
Isn't Lee Hwi So the CEO of TikiTaka?

515
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,273
He isn't.

516
00:35:58,273 --> 00:36:03,373
Shim Joon Seok has been using TikiTaka and pretending to be Lee Hwi So.

517
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:06,273
The real Lee Hwi So passed away

518
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:09,433
a year ago at the gallery explosion incident.

519
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:21,173
   

520
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:33,273
It's starting again! These fucking nails!

521
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:43,473
 TikiTaka's Secret Talk was created by the real Lee Hwi So, not Matthew Lee. 

522
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:47,183
 Shim Joon Seok isn't smart enough to create it. 

523
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:54,153
 All he can do is barely pretend to be Lee Hwi So. 

524
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:56,473
 The reason is because 

525
00:36:56,473 --> 00:37:01,673
 Shim Joon Seok is a fake and he is 

526
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:04,533
 a complete idiot. 

527
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:09,773
 You're so stupid. You can't even place in the top 10 of your school. 

528
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:12,813
 I-I-I'll work harder from now on. 

529
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,913
 You have no more chances. Prepare to study abroad in the US. 

530
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:17,823
 Father... 

531
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:21,633
 Father, I really don't want to go. 

532
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,373
 I want to stay with you and Mother. 

533
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:26,373
 Just go if I tell you to go! 

534
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:30,313
 How dare you whine when you're a fake. 

535
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:36,573
 A fake... 

536
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:40,673
A fake?

537
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:43,073
A complete idiot?

538
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:52,563
 Abnormal blood flow has been detected. 

539
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:55,333
 Heart rate increased. Blood pressure increased. 

540
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,173
 You require immediate relaxation. 

541
00:37:57,173 --> 00:38:02,833
 In fact, it isn't important that I'm Chairman Shim Yong's son. 

542
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:06,973
Seongchan Group was denounced as a national evil company

543
00:38:06,973 --> 00:38:08,913
by Shim Joon Seok disguised as Lee Hwi So.

544
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:11,693
And we lost everything.

545
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:14,473
The recent fire at the data center was also

546
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:17,973
an arson committed by Matthew.

547
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:22,313
Does a man like him have the right to criticize

548
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,923
Chairman Shim Yong and Seongchan?

549
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:29,993
I ask this of my fellow citizens.

550
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:35,393
Please help revalidate that Matthew isn't Lee Hwi So.

551
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:46,203
He's just like my brother.

552
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:49,413
Since Seongchan's true face has returned,

553
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:54,173
my brother will be able to rest in peace now.

554
00:38:56,773 --> 00:38:59,773
A fight between the fake and the real.

555
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:07,873
Seongchan Group will fight TikiTaka head-on!

556
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,123
   

557
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,383
Why is it you and not me?

558
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:28,733
I'm the one who served and pleased Father since I was a kid.

559
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:34,313
But why are you the real one, not me?

560
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:39,533
Only if you weren't there, I could've been happy.

561
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:41,903
If it wasn't for you,

562
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:45,253
I wouldn't have had so many issues!

563
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:50,593
You ruined me and you made me a murderer!

564
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:56,513
It's your fault I became a monster, Min Do Hyeok!

565
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:59,823
You look nothing like Father.

566
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:02,753
I'm the one who took after Father.

567
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:08,343
Father's appetite, preference, personality, and gait!

568
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:11,743
I even copied his way of breathing!

569
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:17,093
How dare you mock me, saying I'm a fake!

570
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:19,873
I'll make you regret for life

571
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:23,023
the confession you made today.

572
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:26,403
I'm going to make it so Father will have to acknowledge me!

573
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:31,163
I, Shim Joon Seok, have to be Father's son in life and in death!

574
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:35,123
Because I'm going to make it that way!

575
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:38,443
Open your eyes and see that

576
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:42,003
a fake can become a real one.

577
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:10,153
We'll soon show you substantial proof.

578
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:11,933
All right! That will be it for today.

579
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:13,723
Make way!

580
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:24,063
 Chairman Min Do Hyeok, who took office at Seongchan Group today, 

581
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:26,973
 openly criticized Chairman Matthew Lee of TikiTaka. 

582
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:31,273
 He strongly stated Chairman Matthew is Shim Joon Seok, not Lee Hwi So. 

583
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:34,073
 Former Chairman Shim Mi Young agreed with him, adding to the credibility- 

584
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:39,073
You saw, right? Do Hyeok is definitely my nephew.

585
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:42,473
Regardless of whether Min Do Hyeok is Chairman Shim Yong's biological son or not,

586
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:46,863
the claim that I'm Shim Joon Seok is totally baseless slander.

587
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:50,853
This is a clear attempt at changing the frame to blur the facts.

588
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:54,333
It's a cowardly way of covering up his immoral behavior

589
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,023
with a more provocative matter.

590
00:41:56,023 --> 00:42:01,383
The core of this matter is that Min Do Hyeok and my wife committed adultery.

591
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:05,763
I can't put into words how devastated I feel.

592
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:13,026
I want to sell all the real estate properties I own.

593
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:14,936
Please sell off the rest as quick sales, too.

594
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:18,476
You'll pay a lot in taxes because you bought them less than a year ago.

595
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:21,616
If you keep them, they'll increase in value soon. Why—

596
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:24,646
It doesn't matter. I'm in a hurry.

597
00:42:24,646 --> 00:42:28,646
If anyone wants to buy, let me know.

598
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:33,056
Use Save's main page article to attack Seongchan Group and Min Do Hyeok.

599
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:35,216
Yes, I understand.

600
00:42:37,436 --> 00:42:42,686
 Mo Ne, do you know the issue our nation has the least tolerance for? 

601
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,756
 It's adultery. 

602
00:42:44,756 --> 00:42:47,456
 The longer you endure, 

603
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:49,996
 the harder it'll be on Min Do Hyeok. 

604
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:53,756
 So surrender now 

605
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:56,806
 before you lose everything. 

606
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:28,146
 Min Do Hyeok, don't look back. 

607
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:31,086
 Don't pity someone like me, either. 

608
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:34,056
 You go your way. 

609
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:36,746
 And I'll go my way. 

610
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:39,296
 Hey, it's Han Mo Ne! 

611
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:42,346
 It's Han Mo Ne! 

612
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:45,546
 Hey, how could you! 

613
00:43:45,546 --> 00:43:48,476
 Why did you seduce Min Do Hyeok? 

614
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:52,726
 Say something! How could you! 

615
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,826
   

616
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:58,276
   

617
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:01,286
   

618
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:23,246
 Are you okay? 

619
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:25,526
I'm totally fine.

620
00:44:25,526 --> 00:44:28,076
I'll take this chance to retire and rest.

621
00:44:28,076 --> 00:44:30,716
Did you finish packing?

622
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:42,346
 I'm not sure if leaving is the right thing to do 

623
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,996
 when you're struggling like this. 

624
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:45,656
It's too dangerous here.

625
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,996
Leaving is the right thing to do.

626
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:55,086
 Then, can I see Cheong Soo before I go? 

627
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:57,506
 I haven't seen him in a while. 

628
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:05,296
Cheong Soo went to Thailand to work.

629
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:08,116
He enjoys it and won't be back for a couple of years.

630
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:10,316
Don't worry and just leave with Kyong Soo.

631
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:14,856
 Okay, I'll do as you say. 

632
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:23,836
 I'm ready to give up my life if it means I can protect you, 

633
00:45:23,836 --> 00:45:27,026
 the boys, and Hannah. 

634
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,266
I bought a house in a safe location,

635
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:35,376
and I deposited money in your bank account.

636
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:40,086
Take Kyeong Soo and eat what you want, buy what you want,

637
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:42,606
and do what you want.

638
00:45:43,746 --> 00:45:46,846
 What money did you have in your situation? 

639
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,266
 Stop making sacrifices for us! 

640
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:51,646
 We'll take care of ourselves now. 

641
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:54,716
 No, I'll take care of you now. 

642
00:45:56,756 --> 00:46:00,326
Come on. I'm your daughter, Han Mo Ne.

643
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:02,716
I have more than enough money to pay the fines.

644
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:05,396
Don't worry, and just go!

645
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:25,576
 You can be honest with me. 

646
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:34,086
Mom.

647
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:38,186
I'm really fine.

648
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:41,266
I don't care about the money or the fame.

649
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:44,756
But I'm worried about Min Do Hyeok.

650
00:46:46,276 --> 00:46:50,946
The sacrifice he made with his life came to nothing because of me.

651
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:53,926
No one will even listen to him.

652
00:46:53,926 --> 00:46:58,156
 Do you like him? 

653
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:05,666
I know it's shameless of me.

654
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,296
I know I shouldn't,

655
00:47:08,296 --> 00:47:11,426
but I'm going crazy because I'm worried about him.

656
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:16,276
What can I do to help Min Do Hyeok?

657
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,126
How can I help him?

658
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,456
How?

659
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:41,006
Now, now. It's Ahjussi's turn this time.

660
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:42,496
Number 12.

661
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:43,916
No, no. Number 21.

662
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:47,146
Oh, 21. Yeah, number 21.

663
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:49,986
Dun, dun, dun, dun—

664
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:53,146
Yes, yes! Success!

665
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:56,596
Who's next? Erica? No? Who is it?

666
00:47:56,596 --> 00:48:00,086
Okay, it's Erica's turn—

667
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:06,346
Guys, should we stop and watch TV now?

668
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:11,506
 Min Do Hyeok and Actress Han Mo Ne's affair is a hot topic these days. 

669
00:48:11,506 --> 00:48:13,726
- What's wrong with this? 
  - "Today's Celebrity Topic" 

670
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:17,286
 has outlined a timeline from the start of their relationship to the present. 

671
00:48:17,286 --> 00:48:20,326
 - The two of them met on TikiTaka—  
 - What are you doing?

672
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:23,146
 Min Do Hyeok who used to be— 

673
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,616
Guys! How does my face look?

674
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:29,496
It's absolutely glowing, isn't it?

675
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:32,376
Goodness, you're dazzling!

676
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:37,296
Should we play hide-and-seek? Or... let's see...

677
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:39,396
Cops and Robbers?

678
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:42,186
Who even plays those games these days?

679
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:45,246
Can I go outside to play for a bit?

680
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:49,246
Hey! Don't even think about going outside.

681
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:52,356
- Be quiet. 
 - I can't even talk?

682
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:54,796
I couldn't go to school these past few days

683
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,966
or even meet my friends!

684
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:59,686
Now I can't even talk?

685
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,926
That's too much!

686
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:03,736
Hey!

687
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,416
That stupid booger.

688
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:08,826
Come back here!

689
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:18,496
Hello, Chairman Shim. I have a favor to ask.

690
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,226
I'd like to play with the kids somewhere safe just for a day.

691
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,526
Is that possible?

692
00:49:35,426 --> 00:49:37,596
You guys are here!

693
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:39,396
- Whoa! 
 - Yay!

694
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,376
Guys!

695
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:43,116
Yay!

696
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,856
Guys! It was boring all cooped up at home. Right?

697
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:50,556
Is it really okay to come outside like this?

698
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:53,186
The scary men are all gone now?

699
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:56,756
Of course. You can play all you want today without worry.

700
00:49:56,756 --> 00:49:59,516
- Really? 
 - Really?

701
00:49:59,516 --> 00:50:00,886
The toys are over there.

702
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:02,916
Ahjussi brought so many toys for you!

703
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,866
Ki Tak!

704
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:08,116
Ki Tak!

705
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:12,736
So flashy. She's too flashy.

706
00:50:12,736 --> 00:50:14,706
Don't say a word today.

707
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:18,776
Everyone! The sponsor of this camping trip is here.

708
00:50:18,776 --> 00:50:23,306
This is a safe place where outsiders can't enter due to strict access control.

709
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:24,956
Even drones can't enter.

710
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:29,276
Chairman Shim Mi Young has made this camping trip possible.

711
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,466
A round of applause!

712
00:50:32,216 --> 00:50:33,316
Thank you!

713
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:35,206
Beautiful conglomerate lady!

714
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,816
That's right. I'm a conglomerate.

715
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:40,416
- Go and have a blast. 
  - Okay! 

716
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,226
- Be careful, guys! 
 - Yeah.

717
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:45,306
Why a camping trip all of a sudden? As if it's not hectic enough.

718
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:46,596
No, no, no!

719
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:50,056
You're not seeing the whole picture.

720
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:52,006
Is sulking going to solve your problems?

721
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:54,656
Joy will find those who smile.

722
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,896
How could I just sit back as an aunt

723
00:50:56,896 --> 00:50:59,346
when my beloved niece is feeling like shit?

724
00:50:59,346 --> 00:51:01,786
Haven't you heard a nephew's wish is an aunt's command?

725
00:51:01,786 --> 00:51:03,376
Such a saying existed?

726
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:04,606
Shut up!

727
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,296
Don't you dare mess with me. Don't even look my way.

728
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:08,956
I'm off-limits.

729
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:12,086
This lady already has a sweetheart.

730
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:15,016
Ki Tak! This is my first time camping.

731
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:16,896
Did she just reject me when I didn't even propose?

732
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:21,076
Wait a minute. She's been speaking down to us since last time.

733
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:23,796
Oh, I didn't even pick that up.

734
00:51:23,796 --> 00:51:28,556
Gosh, is that what you call a conglomerate's aura?

735
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:31,486
Oh, shit.

736
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:33,376
I said this is my first time camping.

737
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:35,436
It's my first time, too.

738
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:00,626
 Come here! 

739
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,916
Kids, come over here!

740
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,756
Hurry up!

741
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:14,076
All right. Say hi to Mom.

742
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:17,556
 - Mom, I love you!  
 - Ahjumma, get better soon!

743
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:20,036
Mom, let's go camping together!

744
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,216
Bye, Mom!

745
00:52:21,216 --> 00:52:25,066
 - Mom, I love you!  
 - Ahjumma, I love you!

746
00:52:25,066 --> 00:52:27,726
 - Mom, I love you! 
 - Ahjumma, get better soon! 

747
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:30,336
 Mom, get better soon! 

748
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:32,696
 Mom, let's go camping together! 

749
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,896
This is how you do it.

750
00:52:56,896 --> 00:52:59,496
What do you say? Do I look like a chef?

751
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:12,936
Why does it have such a luxurious scent?

752
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:15,986
Meat always tastes the best outside.

753
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:18,676
Gosh, it's so good!

754
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:26,326
Unbelievable! I thought you were a robot!

755
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:29,076
I'm seeing you in a new light.

756
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,406
By the way, why do you keep skipping honorifics?

757
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:33,796
Is it your privilege as a conglomerate?

758
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,936
Aren't you on the verge of bankruptcy anyway?

759
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:37,786
Where is your manners?

760
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:39,406
If you don't like it, you can skip it, too.

761
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:42,186
You think I can't?

762
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:44,966
You do the scallions.

763
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:47,696
I'll do the onions.

764
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:54,326
You're the first person to skip honorifics like this to me.

765
00:53:54,326 --> 00:53:57,076
I love it!

766
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:00,636
Cheers.

767
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:02,756
Cheers.

768
00:54:06,836 --> 00:54:09,836
What's wrong? Did you get a cut?

769
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:14,486
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

770
00:54:14,486 --> 00:54:16,446
You should just kick back and relax like me, too.

771
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:19,026
She said she's got it today.

772
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:21,956
I'm your friend now, huh? You!

773
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:24,536
You!

774
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:26,836
Cheers again!

775
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:29,536
Are all alive things become friends with everyone?

776
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:31,686
It's true and not true.

777
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:34,936
Sometimes, it takes time to become friends.

778
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,036
How come?

779
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:41,836
Because everyone needs a different amount of time to open up.

780
00:54:41,836 --> 00:54:44,906
Hey, Phillip. Let's change seats.

781
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,836
Don't you even know ladies first?

782
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:50,836
Kids come before ladies.

783
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:54,256
You should yield since you're the oldest sister.

784
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,166
Or Hannah can yield.

785
00:54:56,166 --> 00:55:00,366
I don't want to. I also want to sit next to Ahjussi.

786
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:04,966
All right, that's enough fighting. Should we go look at the stars now?

787
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:06,576
There.

788
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:09,236
It's pretty.

789
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:15,136
 Look at this! 

790
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:18,356
Hey, look!

791
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,346
You can draw pictures!

792
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:29,166
Cheers.

793
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:32,476
Gosh, that's nice.

794
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,646
Honey.

795
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:45,106
What's wrong? It's a happy day today.

796
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:48,046
I don't know.

797
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:50,716
I just keep getting tears.

798
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:56,646
It'd have been great to have Geum Ra Hee and Go Myeong Ji with us

799
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:59,866
when we're having such a happy moment.

800
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:08,636
You're right.

801
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:12,736
The kids' laughter is the best ASMR.

802
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,076
It's so lovely to hear.

803
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,396
I heard this from someone.

804
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:26,736
People whose childhoods were happy

805
00:56:26,736 --> 00:56:31,136
can live off of those memories their entire lives.

806
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:35,016
And people whose childhoods were unfortunate

807
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,646
live their entire lives

808
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,816
trying to recover from those wounds.

809
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,806
That's why...

810
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:47,776
I thought about what my childhood was like.

811
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:56,696
But there was nothing to reminisce about.

812
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:04,506
♫  Inside a corner of my emptied heart  ♫

813
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:08,156
♫  It's forever, no, it's passing by  ♫

814
00:57:08,156 --> 00:57:11,346
♫  Don't lock up my paradise  ♫

815
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,276
If we had happy childhoods,

816
00:57:18,456 --> 00:57:20,916
would we be...

817
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:23,736
living different lives by now?

818
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:27,596
You can't change the past.

819
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,436
But the future can be changed.

820
00:57:32,136 --> 00:57:36,016
As long as you have the will.

821
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:38,336
Ta-da!

822
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:40,636
Let's all take a picture together.

823
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:43,236
When you're out camping, you have to take pictures.

824
00:57:43,236 --> 00:57:45,936
I'll take it now. Give me a big smile!

825
00:57:45,936 --> 00:57:48,226
- All right! 
 - Come here!

826
00:57:48,226 --> 00:57:50,696
W-Wait—

827
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:53,826
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

828
00:57:57,676 --> 00:58:01,586
♫  until the moment comes  ♫

829
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:08,056
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

830
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,176
- We're— 
 - I'm so sorry, but excuse me.

831
00:58:12,176 --> 00:58:14,336
Could I buy some ointment, please?

832
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:17,436
- Oh, sure. Come inside. 
 - Thank you.

833
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:26,256
What's this? Everyone left?

834
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,166
Yeah.

835
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,606
   

836
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:36,626
Let's clean up.

837
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:15,986
   

838
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:37,056
   

839
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:42,196
What's up, Hyung?

840
00:59:42,196 --> 00:59:44,196
Do you need to talk?

841
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,426
   

842
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:55,686
 Han Mo Ne announced she is getting back with CEO Hwang Chan Seong 

843
00:59:55,686 --> 00:59:59,436
 after her scandal with Chairman Min Do Hyeok of Seongchan Group. 

844
00:59:59,436 --> 01:00:02,236
 CEO Hwang stated Han Mo Ne's adultery scandal stemmed from a misunderstanding. 

845
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:04,636
Han Mo Ne asked me to give you this.

846
01:00:04,636 --> 01:00:09,196
 At the same time, he announced Han Mo Ne's retirement from the entertainment industry. 

847
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:13,736
 Dear Min Do Hyeok. 

848
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:18,336
 I hope my decision won't shake you up. 

849
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:22,456
 I asked Chairwoman Shim to prepare the camping trip yesterday. 

850
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:26,686
 I wanted to spend time with everyone for the last time. 

851
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:30,166
 Thanks for smiling at me, Min Do Hyeok. 

852
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,646
 Memories of yesterday will help me endure it all. 

853
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:38,236
 I'm going to start the final act of my life now. 

854
01:00:38,236 --> 01:00:42,036
 Although, only fake smiles and fake happiness will be awaiting me. 

855
01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:46,536
 I'm going to consider it a walk up a steep slope. 

856
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:51,136
 After taking it step by step like that, 

857
01:00:51,136 --> 01:00:54,536
 there will come a day when the harsh uphill will end. 

858
01:00:56,856 --> 01:00:59,136
Great job, Mo Ne.

859
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:04,536
The house feels bright again now that you're back.

860
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:10,636
You'll keep your promise. Right?

861
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:13,836
That you won't lay a finger on Min Do Hyeok.

862
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,536
Of course.

863
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:18,116
All your penalty litigations will be withdrawn, too.

864
01:01:18,116 --> 01:01:20,736
I don't care how much I have to pay in penalties.

865
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:24,336
I already put up my house and real estate for sale, too.

866
01:01:24,336 --> 01:01:30,436
Just keep the promise that the talk of the affair doesn't resurface.

867
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:34,686
I want that more than anyone.

868
01:01:34,686 --> 01:01:38,306
There's only one thing I want from you.

869
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:41,356
Never get involved with Min Do Hyeok.

870
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:46,056
Please just promise me that.

871
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:49,066
I promise you.

872
01:01:49,066 --> 01:01:52,136
I'll never seek him out again.

873
01:02:08,036 --> 01:02:12,536
 I came back to kill you. 

874
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,536
 I'll kill you first 

875
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:17,686
 and get rid of K in my own way. 

876
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:42,826
 I'll protect Min Do Hyeok and Hannah now. 

877
01:02:45,716 --> 01:02:52,686


878
01:02:57,616 --> 01:03:00,756
♫  Let's burn down  ♫

879
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:07,746
♫  Let's burn down  ♫

880
01:03:11,056 --> 01:03:15,116
♫  You can't shoot me down, you can't shoot me down  ♫

881
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:18,276
   

882
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:20,826
 We'll start the Lee Hwi So verification process now. 

883
01:03:20,826 --> 01:03:24,476
 While I'm getting the physical verification, keep your eyes on Luca. 

884
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,216
 Min Do Hyeok is plotting something. 

885
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:27,966
 Did Luca give you the wrong information or something? 

886
01:03:27,966 --> 01:03:30,086
 I'm your opponent from now on. 

887
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:31,806
 Give up on Gagok District now. 

888
01:03:31,806 --> 01:03:33,916
 Chairman Matthew is laughable right now. 

889
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,906
 I'm afraid Matthew will go berserk again. 

890
01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:37,936
 Shim Joon Seok is my enemy from now on. 

891
01:03:37,936 --> 01:03:39,576
 Matthew kidnapped Hannah. 

892
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:43,736
 I'm going to kill that bastard. 

893
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,756
♫  Oh, let's burn down  ♫
