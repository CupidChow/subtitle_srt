1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,300
I understand it all now.

2
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,880
The Mi Na I liked was the person from that night.

3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,430
But the person I am now is not the Kang Mi Na from then.

4
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,820
Are you really sure that no matter who I am,

5
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,970
or whose daughter I may be, you don't care?

6
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,630
I am no longer that young man from back then either.

7
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,230
Usually, when you get to know someone truly, that person turns out to be completely different from what you initially thought.

8
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,480
And ... the real love

9
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
starts from that moment.

10
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:33,540


11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,770
♫  Every single moment  ♫

12
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,440
♫  Your heart filled with anguish  ♫

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:55,120
♫  Reaches me, it draws me to you  ♫

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,250
♫  All the pain is healed now  ♫

15
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:14,880
♫  I will hold you in my embrace, like the warm breeze  ♫

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:28,600
♫  I will run to you, like the sunlight seeping through  ♫

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,750
♫  I will hold you in my embrace  ♫

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,540
   

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,080
Maybe this place is too open.

20
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,630
- The Hanju Hotel parking lot is always like this.
 - What?

21
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,760
It's just that this place is dark and secluded, so it's popular.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,880
It's like a sacred place for celebrity couples and couples having affairs.

23
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,310
It's just because the windows are tinted,

24
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,400
but there are people in all these cars, and they're all ... busy.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
They wouldn't care what's happening outside.

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,950
Even if they did, it's not like we're committing adultery.

27
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,060
But it is adultery in other people's eyes.

28
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,710
Right, I am Kang Mi Na!

29
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,090
With my cousin-in-law ... This isn't just inappropriate, it's absolutely dramatic!

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,530
- Where's your car? 
 - O-Over there.

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,070
T-Team Leader, why are you here?

32
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,860
I told you Director Han was probably still at the hotel, and you rushed out here.

33
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,250
You basically gave me directions about where you'd be.

34
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,070
So this is what happened.

35
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,640
What do you mean "this is what happened"? D-Did you see something?

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,670
No, I didn't see anything. I just got here.

37
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,240
Then what happened?

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,770
Isn't it obvious?

39
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,410
Just look at his face. If you'd been dating for a month, he wouldn't look like that.

40
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,830
Anyone can guess that you two just ...

41
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,520
Let's all take the same car.

42
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,960
   

43
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,700
But still, how could you just give away your shares without discussing it with me?

44
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,530
But still, it's because he acted so quickly that the matter was settled so fast.

46
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,790
Honestly, he's the one who should be upset since he lost his shares. Why are you picking on him?

47
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't overreact. I'm fine.

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,630
He was going too far.

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,590
Should I hand over some of Kang Mi Na's shares to you? What should we do?

50
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,050
If you hand them over to me, you might get in trouble.

51
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,390
I'm fine. It wouldn't be my first time getting into trouble.

52
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,850
Taking on a little more wouldn't make much of a difference.

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,410
Even if you both combined your shares, you wouldn't be majority shareholders.

54
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,530
It's pointless to give and take between you.

55
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,760
Now is not the time to talk about those things.

56
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,770
Actually, a report came in from the PR office a little while ago.

57
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,070
There seems to be rumors circulating about Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

58
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,260
What rumors?

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,260
"Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Yumin Group is not the real one."

60
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,070
"Someone is impersonating Kang Mi Na."

61
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,860
I would never have thought that the one who started that rumor was you.

62
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,140
Don't waste your energy denying it.

63
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,770
Nowadays, it isn't difficult to find where rumors start.

64
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,160
I didn't lie. I have evidence to support that.

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,640
What I want to know is what you have in mind.

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,740
I heard that my brother dumped you.

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,980
Are you attacking his wife because you still have feelings for him?

68
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,160
No thank you! I want to ruin Han Seong Wun.

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm not being vulgar. The term "ruin" is standard language.

70
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,090
Of course I tried telling Han Seong Wun first.

71
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,450
But he said that if I brought this up again, he'd bury me.

72
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,140
Seong Wun did?

73
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,710
He's flying high right now, thanks to his wife.

74
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,530
But let me tell you something, that wife is a fake.

75
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,490
You don't need to convince me.

76
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,740
What this means is ... there now seems to be one more person

77
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,450
who agrees with me.

78
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,860
We need to find a way to get out of it smoothly before rumors spread.

79
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm here ...

80
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,590
Why are you here? You didn't say you were coming.

81
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,370
Since when did I tell you before coming?

82
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,930
Hey, is it okay for another man to know

83
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,210
your key code and come in as he pleases?

84
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,990
Another man, my foot.

85
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,580
He's not a man. He is like a brother to me.

86
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,630
If he's like a brother, it means he isn't actually your brother.

87
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,950
I guess you let just anyone come in.

88
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,970
Meanwhile, Director Han here doesn't have a woman anywhere near him.

89
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,970
It's no wonder ...

90
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,700
You live alone but your house isn't even clean. Look how dirty this floor is.

91
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,640
Director Han's house is spotless even though I'm in and out of there constantly.

92
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,970
Team Leader, I'm about to get very offended right now.

93
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,630
What's with you?

94
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,430
You're not trying to say he's too good for me, are you?

95
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,840
Oh my god, your silence speaks volumes.

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,800
Are you really going to be like this? I thought we were getting close.

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,420
Sure, we got close, but he's still too good for you.

98
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm a prosecutor, you know. A professional!

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Do you think being a prosecutor is impressive? I was a prosecutor once too.

100
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,130
Three out of four people here are prosecutors!

101
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,130
I have to work on something with Yu Jun today, so why don't you guys clear out for now?

102
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,930
I'll come over once I'm done.

103
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,330
Yeah right, "work on something" ...

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,900
Let's do that. Let's go.

105
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,210
What kind of "work" at this hour, damn it ...

106
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,680
I think they're going to talk about me. It should be okay, right?

107
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,580
I'll drive Jo Yeon Ju home today, so why don't you head home?

108
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,130
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't get jealous like a loser. Be good to her.

109
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,980
I'll do the nagging.

110
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,010
Keep that look in your eyes,

111
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,490
and don't let time lessen your feelings.

112
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,650
Think about how hard it must be for her.

113
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,450
She has to live two lives, exact revenge and date, all at the same time.

114
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,200
She's being attacked from all sides.

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,160
Be good to her.

116
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,050
I'm not sure if we should be together like this.

117
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,480
I mean, what if someone crashes through the door like last time?

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,550
You now have the right to shout at them if anyone does, though.

119
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,360
Is that right?

120
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,930
To be honest, when I heard some of Yumin's shares would be given to Chairman Han,

121
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,990
I wondered whether it was right to do so. But I stamped the document because I trust you.

122
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,220
But what happened, really? The hotel.

123
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, you mean Seong Wun?

124
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,330
My father told me to teach Seong Wun some stuff, since he can't keep loafing around forever.

125
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,590
- That's all there is to it, right?
 - Of course.

126
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,250
So I'm planning to clear the way where I can in consideration of his situation.

127
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,710
But there are strange rumors circulating lately. I need your help.

128
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,830
What is it?

129
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,420
It seems there are gossip articles saying that sister-in-law's identity is fake.

130
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,520
That's a little too serious.

131
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,750
So I want to publicly run a DNA test on her.

132
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,120
    

133
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,490
 Goodness, congratulations, Chief District Prosecutor. 

134
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,350
 This is the last time I can drink outside with anyone. 

135
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,770
 - I need to watch my back now, you get it?
- Of course. 

136
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,140
 I can serve your junior prosecutors now, that's all right. 

137
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,640
 But can I still contact the prosecutor I met that day? 

138
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,420
 What? Who? 

139
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,080
 The female prosecutor I met for a moment, when I was inside. 

140
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,030
 I felt like we could reach an understanding. She likes luxury brands too. 

141
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,810
 Who? Do you mean Prosecutor Jo? 

142
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,140
 Yes! When I met her outside briefly, I almost offended her. 

143
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,500
 So I want to pay her a visit to apologize. 

144
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,320
 Hold on. Where did you see her? 

145
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,860
 She was at a luxury store and wearing luxury brands from head to toe. 

146
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,340
 When was that? 

147
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,100
 The day we had a soccer match with Japan. 

148
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,960
   

149
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,580
 Don't get me started! I was going to cool my head down during my break, so I went to an island to fish, 

150
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,710
 but I fell into the sea while fishing and was bed-ridden for days. 

151
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,620
 I lost my phone and everything else in the sea, and since that place was so remote, 

152
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,600
 I couldn't get a signal, or anything else which prevented me from contacting you. 

153
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,250
She went on vacation and fell into the sea ... but she was at a luxury store at the same time?

154
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,870
 There will be more and more people at the Prosecutors' Office who will catch on. Just pull out now. 

155
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,620
That's what I plan to do. As soon as I find the connection between the chief and Hanju, I'll get out of that house.

156
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,390
They must have sealed everyone's mouth at the detention center. It's really hard to find out what happened.

157
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,340
I checked with the guy planted by the Samgeori gang,

158
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,060
and there seems to be no one close enough to Lee Bong Sik to get the list from him.

159
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,050
Also, he's a famous gambler, so everybody cut off their connection with him.

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,770
I came here today to tell you this. But I guess that from now on, I shouldn't come in here even if I have a reason to see you.

161
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,630
By the way, on that day, you didn't

162
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,530
do something with Han Seung Wuk because you were drunk, did you?

163
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm the one who hates that kind of excuse the most!

164
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,340
That's the favorite line for rapists and murderers.

165
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,050
That's right. It was just a bit sudden.

166
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,260
Then, has the issue with your father been resolved?

167
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,270
Yu Jun ... I like Han Seung Wuk.

168
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,280
As you said, we are entangled in so many ways,

169
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,950
and nothing is resolved yet. But we should solve it from now on.

170
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,650
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

171
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,180
I hate it the most when people cross the line.

172
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,280
I got it. Let's not contact each other for personal matters anymore.

173
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,560
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

174
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,420
By the way, did you put away the bribes that I brought last time, the golden toad and the watch?

175
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,160
- No. 
 - I thought so! They're in your dressing room.

176
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,290
If I hadn't told you, then you might not have opened it until a year later. Take good care of it.

177
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,840
All right, I got it.

178
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,040
Fine. I'm leaving.

179
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,900
Also, don't forget the maintenance fee. If you don't pay for three months, they cut the water immediately.

180
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,600
Or do you want to schedule an automatic payment, right now?

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,640
You only paid when I saw your piled up bills and nagged you.

182
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,420
Also, dew condensation near your living room's balcony needs fixing before winter.

183
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,310
And that pink limescale encrusting your toilet—

184
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,760
Yu Jun ... Leave. Don't go crossing the line.

185
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,620
All right, I'm leaving and not crossing the line.

186
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,010
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye.

187
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,630
Madam Kang Mi Na's whereabouts are still unknown.

188
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,550
But it seems like someone else has been looking for Kang Mi Na recently.

189
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,570
Are you saying there's someone else besides the Yumin Group?

190
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,830
And when I went there for the USB drive, I heard something strange.

191
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,970
  Many people are willing to take people on their boats,  

192
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,360
  so it's not that difficult to sneak someone abroad these days.  

193
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,920
  Hey, look into this. Search among the guys who take people on boats.  

194
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,760
 Yes, sir. 

195
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,660
 She's pretty. 

196
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,860
 - Oh! This woman... 
 - What? 

197
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,730
 Isn't she that woman? Your wrist? 

198
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,790
 You're right. 

199
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,400
What are you saying?

200
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,670
Ms. Kang Mi Na fights really well.

201
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,700
That doesn't make any sense. Where are you right now?

202
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,260
They said she looked similar to a woman they know, so I went to the address they gave me. 
    

203
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,270
Come back for now. What do you think you're doing without even reporting to me first?

204
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,790
If you were going to be gone for this long, you should have put someone on her!

205
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,870
Yes, ma'am. I apologize.

206
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,240
The place you had to stop by is here?

207
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,780
Yes. Why?

208
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,550
Then I can't go in empty-handed. You go in first.

209
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,850
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes.

210
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,490
No, at ten o'clock.

211
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,300
- Uncle! Uncle! 
 - Four people, it's noted.

212
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,780
- What can I get for you? 
 - Uncle!

213
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,930
- What the—! When did you get here? 
 - Ages ago.

214
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,030
We're closing soon, so wait a little bit.

215
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,180
It's 38,000 won  (~$32) . I'll give you free soup.

216
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,530
Why are there so many customers here?

217
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,400
It must be nice that business is doing well.

218
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,900
So you're not her biological uncles.

219
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,650
What? Did you lie to him and say you were my biological uncles?

220
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,850
I swear. I never said that we were your biological uncles.

221
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,580
Isn't that right?

222
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,890
Yes, that's true.

223
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,290
What are you saying? He bought those because he thought you were my real uncles.

224
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,060
Have some of this. If you use knives often, your wrists must hurt.

225
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,980
You're so greedy for food!

226
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,860
Let's go back to what we were talking about. What happened with Lee Bong Sik?

227
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,600
I think his death has something to do with the Samgeori gang.

228
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,340
I came here to ask you to go out in the field for a while.

229
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,090
Hey, when your memory comes back,

230
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,780
then do you forget what you did when you lost your memories? Is that how it works?

231
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,820
Don't you remember how we all got crushed by the Samgeori gang?

232
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,340
You can't say that I got crushed!

233
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,930
Also, I'm not asking you to fight against them.

234
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,490
Lee Bong Sik fled abroad, and came back to Korea after gambling away all his money.

235
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,910
And even after he came back, he stayed in gambling houses day and night.

236
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,070
But you know the habits of those gamblers best.

237
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,440
Why are you talking about ancient stuff? We took our hands off it a long time ago!

238
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,030
I know! What would've happened if you hadn't stopped?

239
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,990
Gambling is nonsense, if you think about probability for a little bit.

240
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,460
- But how can someone put their entire fortune in it? 
 - Hey, you!

241
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,050
Who gambles with probabilities in mind?

242
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:18,240
You gamble with hope. That's what you bet on.

243
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,900
I hope you have that hope in your heart this time as well.

244
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,170
And please dig deep into Lee Bong Sik until the end.

245
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,050
But as you can see, our restaurant is running really well!

246
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,590
So if we start following someone's back for 24/7—

247
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,490
I'll pay for your loss during the investigation period.

248
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,630
- Will you? 
 - Yes.

249
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,620
Don't bluff again about having money!

250
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,660
You better worry about your rent.

251
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,210
Stop meddling.

252
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,220
H-Honey.

253
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,590
Seok Ho!

254
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,700
What should I do?

255
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,710
Doctor! Doctor!

256
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,390
So that's how your uncles have helped you until now.

257
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,680
They chased Lee Bong Sik with you.

258
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,570
When grandma passed away, we met again by chance at the hospital.

259
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,700
After the gang disappeared, they all got separated.

260
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,650
But the uncles came to the emergency room and recognized my grandmother and me.

261
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,470
But from what they said the other time, your father—

262
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,840
Excuse me. It's deeply connected to your father passing away,

263
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,570
so I understand it has to come out constantly.

264
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,910
But the Kang Myeong Guk that I know, is the one who starts a fire out of anger,

265
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,630
and he doesn't think about others at all.

266
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,660
And most of all, he has nothing to do with me.

267
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,740
I get it.

268
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,610
Are you disappointed in me because I seem so cold and cruel?

269
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,430
Don't be emotional, don't be sad, and don't lose your cool.

270
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,280
I bet you became who you are now by living with that in mind.

271
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:42,790
Also, I don't get easily disappointed by the person I love.

272
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,250
What? The person you love?

273
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,890
But it makes me feel bad letting you go into that house again.

274
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,700
I told you this before, didn't I?

275
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,330
That I seemed used to this level of crisis.

276
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,610
But after gaining my memory back, I realized it's true.

277
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,540
This is nothing.

278
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,780
All right! I'll get going.

279
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Thank you for stopping the summons for me. I didn't think it was possible to block it with shares.

280
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,550
Well, what's more important is who owns those shares.

281
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,060
Lee Bong Sik, who had a list that could harm Hanju, got arrested,

282
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,160
and when that list was going to go public, he died suddenly.

283
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,060
And there's a rumor that Kang Mi Na is on that list.

284
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,230
Why do you bring up something that's already over? What are you trying to say?

285
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,630
I guess you have a powerful connection in the Prosecutors' Office.

286
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,700
I also tried to fix it through a prosecutor I know, but they wouldn't collaborate among themselves.

287
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,900
It was very difficult.

288
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,150
It's common for chaebol families to bring family quarrels to the prosecution.

289
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,310
But prosecutors are not errand boys for those families! These little—

290
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,350
Because of the acquisition, you and I got into the same boat.

291
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,100
I think it's a waste if both of us have to manage ties in the prosecution.

292
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,400
Why don't you unite your connection in the prosecution with mine?

293
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,270
The prosecutors are so cocky these days. It's about time to change them.

294
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,420
Exactly! You know those prosecutors.

295
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,010
They're the kind of people

296
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,090
who don't even push their chair back in after a meeting!

297
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,880
You know a great deal about prosecutors.

298
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,400
I know them very well.

299
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,080
 There are strange rumors circulating lately. 

300
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,900
 It seems there are gossip articles saying that Sister-in-law's identity is fake. 

301
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,090
 So I want to publicly run a DNA test on her. 

302
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,450
What are you doing here?

303
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,460
Since we've been reducing the number of helpers after your accident, some areas are really unclean.

304
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,360
I wanted to see if this room was cleaned.

305
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,590
Do you expect me to believe that?

306
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,550
Why are you so irritable with me?

307
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,630
Because a relationship goes both ways.

308
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,540
What are you two doing?

309
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,460
Hyeong-nim came into a room in the absence of its owner.

310
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,090
- Why are you here?
 - What's with you both?

311
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,920
Is there something in here that I shouldn't see?

312
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,520
From now on, if you need to talk to her, see me directly instead.

313
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't talk to Nuna if you can, either.

314
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,840
- I guess every man in this family has eyes for you. 
 - Sorry?

315
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,640
When I talked about Seung Wuk last time, you talked as if you'd never see him again.

316
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,280
But he gave up his shares for your sake,

317
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,360
and Seong Wun doesn't even want to do anything against your wishes.

318
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,670
What's the secret to wrapping two men around your little finger?

319
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,380
-You were not like this before.
- Nuna.

320
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,250
You're right. Like you, I was just a chairman's daughter in the past.

321
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,530
But now, I am a chairwoman. That is my secret.

322
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,060
When you are truly mature, you should have good control over your emotions.

323
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:16,210
But these days, there's a vulgar trend of saying anything you want and calling that act "refreshing."

324
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,860
Your sister just insulted me, didn't she?

325
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,290
Wasn't my timing perfect?

326
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,790
But where have you been? I came home right after the ceremony ended and waited for you.

327
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,610
Since when were you so interested in where I've been?

328
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,760
You really must have no interest in me.

329
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,200
I've been interested in that for a while now.

330
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,720
Don't be like that, honey. I've dated a lot of married women,

331
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,310
and not many stay married because they love their husband.

332
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,360
You seem to understand a woman's feelings very well.

333
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,430
Don't look down on me so much.

334
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,350
You and I are in the same boat now.

335
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,090
I did manage to become a co-CEO thanks to you,

336
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,410
but you can also have both Yumin and Hanju by being with me.

337
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,840
- What?
 - Did you meet Han Seung Wuk today?

338
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,490
It's okay.

339
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,360
No matter what you do.

340
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,510
No matter who you are. I'm never going to divorce you.

341
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,520
What do you mean by that?

342
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,380
You're not Kang Mi Na.

343
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:51,290
What? Did you really think I believed that you were Kang Mi Na,

344
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,840
and protected you from Park So Yi and Nuna?

345
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,620
Knowing your real name and age is enough for me.

346
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,590
I didn't want to know more than that about the real Kang Mi Na, anyway.

347
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,260
I don't care who you are. Who you are right now is good enough for me.

348
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,290
"I don't care who you are"? What's with this sibling repertoire?

349
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,950
Are you saying that I have to keep pretending to be Kang Mi Na for you to keep your position?

350
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,250
Exactly.

351
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,060
But what if I don't need that position, as someone who is not Kang Mi Na?

352
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,420
As soon as I reveal that I'm not Kang Mi Na, your position will fly right away.

353
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,990
So the person who needs me in this position the most isn't me, but you.

354
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,740
And you wouldn't want anything to happen to me,

355
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,560
because you're not capable of protecting your wife's inheritance.

356
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,570
So from now on, not for me,

357
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,380
but for your own sake, keep your mouth shut and protect me if you want to keep your position.

358
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,200
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my heart.

359
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,180
I really need to get out of this house soon.

360
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,520
I'll die from stress. I'll die young at this rate, damn it!

361
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,130
Didn't you say that it wasn't likely he'd wake up?

362
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,970
 I'm sorry. 

363
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,320
Why did you just leave it like that until now?

364
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,270
Take care of it quickly.

365
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,740
   

366
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,230
Why did they call you as soon as he woke up?

367
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,350
When I was here last time, it seemed like a lot of money had gone into his treatment.

368
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,740
So I've been helping out by involving the Yumin Charity Group.

369
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,410
I asked them to call as soon as something happened.

370
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,110
I can't believe that woman. While Han Seong Hye was bragging about the money she gave them,

371
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,130
it was you who were really helping.

372
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,470
That's very kind of you.

373
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,670
It's not a big deal.

374
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,240
Then again, it might not be a big deal for rich people.

375
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,880
Let's go.

376
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,160
The thing is, I've been here since last night.

377
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,580
I called you only after I made sure that the doctor's visit was over, and a conversation was possible.

378
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,860
I stayed up all night here.

379
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,800
Too bad. You must be tired.

380
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,950
Do you remember who I am?

381
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,100
You ran me over with your car.

382
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,710
Youngest Madam.

383
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,520
What happened?

384
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,950
Why did you run over a stationary, harmless person?

385
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,730
I don't remember ...

386
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,860
I'm a professional at memory loss,

387
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,600
so stop trying to use it as an excuse.

388
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,690
Your call history shows that you called someone at Hanju.

389
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,240
I was in a tough spot.

390
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,770
There were some people I knew,

391
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,390
and shamelessly, I gave them all a call.

392
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,130
Fortunately, one of them said that he'll lend me money, and told me to go to Hanju Hotel.

393
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,130
I was waiting in the parking lot, and was about to head in as the appointment was near.

394
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,140
But I suddenly went into a seizure.

395
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,560
How do you know that person?

396
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,910
We met long ago when I worked at Hanju Factory.

397
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,280
"Hanju" is a bad fate.

398
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,040
Madam, please forgive him.

399
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:14,390
This person, ever since he suffered in the fire at the factory where he worked,

400
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,300
his epilepsy has become worse, and he randomly has seizures.

401
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,110
It's all a lie.

402
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,120
 To hit here if you start driving from there, 

403
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,070
 you have to turn the steering wheel at least once when you're over there. 

404
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,420
 The epileptic driver passed out, 

405
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,440
 the car drove straight ahead, but he still turned the steering wheel. 

406
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,600
I think so too. It's definitely a lie.

407
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,710
But why did she have to bring up the fact that his symptoms grew worse from the factory fire?

408
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,600
Especially when I'm a firm believer of strong-for-strong* and weak-for-weak.* 
  (A principle for justice and punishment) 

409
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,320
What's with you, Ahn Yu Jun? Why aren't you answering?

410
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,510
No way! Does he think it's a personal favor by not answering?

411
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,430
I was calling to ask for the files on the fire incident.

412
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,430
Wow, seriously! He's overreacting, such a cold-hearted jerk.

413
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,100
Oh, Yu Jun and I have known each other for a very long time.

414
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,940
Every time something happens, I automatically call him.

415
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,890
Oh, okay. That can happen.

416
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:52,950
But since we first met at the hospital, haven't we known each other longer?

417
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,340
What? Are you being jealous?

418
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,410
Yu Jun is not that kind of man. I know him well.

419
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,280
- Didn't you see how he didn't even pick up. He's like that.
 - Sure.

420
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,670
You're jealous.

421
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,290
Prosecutor Ahn.

422
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,220
- Prosecutor Ahn!
 - Yes?

423
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,930
Your phone.

424
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,050
I'm leaving early.

425
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,010
Goodbye.

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,140
He just got here. What's with him?

427
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,750
Hello. I'm Jang Seok Ho.

428
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,500
I'd like to talk to Manager Jeong Do Wu?

429
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,650
   

430
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,090
Do we really need to be here so early in the morning?

431
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,220
At times like these, it's best to stay out as much as you can.

432
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,270
If we slip up when we meet one of the guests,

433
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,870
it'll be quite awkward, especially when the tables turn once more.

434
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,810
But I still want to side with you, Eonni.

435
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,250
I'll just say I bought my stocks with you, Eonni.

436
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,150
Although they're a bit down right now, won't they rise again?

437
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,550
Agassi, winners are determined by when they withdraw their stocks.

438
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,350
For now, I'm going to stick with Sister-in-law.

439
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,100
Elder Sister-in-law, I think it's time for you to end things with Young Sister-in-law.

440
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,940
No matter how talented she is, you will basically be siding with our Younger Brother.

441
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,910
How could you talk that way about your own brother?

442
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,720
Aren't you even worried about your brother?

443
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,200
Usually sisters never worry about a brother unless he's dying.

444
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,650
Mother, what about you? What do you think of Brother-in-law and his wife?

445
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,000
There's Seong Wun who ruins everything he does,

446
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,520
and the other who stops everything from falling into ruin whatever anyone does. And they're together.

447
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,160
Well, I suppose it's a fight of spear-and-shield.

448
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,130
So, whose side are you on, Mother?

449
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:29,120
I wouldn't have to worry about this if Seon Wu's dad were alive.

450
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,520
I heard that some famous designer from Europe, or wherever, was brought over to make this.

451
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,300
The sofa does seem superior.

452
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,450
Oh, you're right! Everything seems like a piece of art.

453
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:56,870
I heard that there was a big, big fuss at the Designer's Choice about how Sister-in-law has good sense.

454
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:08,760
I have only two daughters-in-law, and one is annoying, and the other has no ability to read social situations.

455
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,800
You know Mom gets angry if you mention Oldest brother.

456
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,010
Ever since he died, it doesn't matter to you who takes over the company.

457
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,420
His death anniversary is coming up but no one cares.

458
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,780
Everyone is being so mean, that's why.

459
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:38,950
Anyway, between being annoying and lacking social sense, isn't lacking social sense better?

460
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:48,340
Director. Starting today, she will assist you in my absence.

461
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm Kim Eun Jeong.

462
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,270
She's been recommended by the Personnel team.

463
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,050
She has worked in a hotel, and we've checked her basic driving and task-managing skills—

464
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,790
I don't need the personal information. Did you tell Han Seong Wun that there's a conference this morning?

465
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,740
I did that yesterday.

466
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,820
Then why isn't he here yet?

467
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,790
Assist her well.

468
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,320
 The number you've been calling— 

469
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,640
He won't even answer.

470
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,170
The CEO isn't simply someone who greets people.

471
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,230
Perhaps he's golfing as usual. I'll check.

472
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,420
Should we just begin?

473
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,290
We can't do that when it's his first conference since becoming the co-CEO.

474
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,730
Let's wait for him for a few more minutes.

475
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,230
Chief Prosecutor?

476
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,700
- Did you do it right?
 - Yes, sir.

477
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,350
But, no matter how I think about it, this is spying.

478
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:23,260
Look here ...  "I am investigating an ideological movement as I keep an eye on Prosecutor Jo's daily life."

479
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,350
If that were the case, it would be spying. But even you can see a problem with her attendance, right?

480
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,230
Is there a problem with her attendance or not?  Answer "Yes" or "No".

481
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,390
Yes. But–
 - That's why,

482
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,520
as her supervisor, I'm telling you to report hourly on things she does during work. Is that so wrong?

483
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,140
No.

484
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,240
Can't you write any bigger?

485
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,670
Why did she go in and out so much?

486
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,720
Identical looking faces ...

487
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,260
And appearing in two different places at the same time ...?

488
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,740
   

489
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,170
   

490
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,120
Not even once?

491
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,050
 Do you know who I am? 

492
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,870
 Do you know who I really am? 

493
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:36,280
 But who is she saying she is? 

494
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,090
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Hanju Group? 

495
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,790
 Why is she Chairwoman Kang Mi Na? 

496
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,530
I thought she was just drunk and talking nonsense.

497
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,510
 Should I tell you why you both of you can't manage 

498
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,820
 to make Chairwoman Kang Mi Na come in? 

499
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,880
 It's because you received a car from Hanju Group. 

500
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,570
Are you the only prosecutor here? I'm here too.

501
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,230
Ryu Seung Deok, nicknamed Dog Nose during his ordinary prosecutor years ...

502
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,450
I was so good at sniffing out suspicious things.

503
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,540
For sure, they're one and the same.

504
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,390
But who's playing both characters?

505
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,530
Kang Mi Na or Jo Yeon Ju?

506
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,930
Prosecutor. To be honest, it's barely 170,000 won  (≈ $140). 

507
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,000
For stealing 170,000 won—

508
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,050
Wow, at the Prosecutor's Office?  Isn't this going overboard?

509
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,870
A measly 170,000 won?

510
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:51,010
Hey! Do you think 170,000 won is a small amount? Huh?

511
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,680
This damn company, seriously.

512
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,750
- Sorry, but It's an important call.
 - Sure, you should take it.

513
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:05,560
Yes, I didn't get to give it to you this morning because I had important things to do. Go ahead.

514
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,650
Team Leader, how can you be satisfied with an annual sale of 1.7 billion won  (≈$1.42 million)? Think about the money we invested. 

515
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,830
Invest another 5 billion.

516
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,900
How can you run a business if 5 billion is so precious? It's not 15 billion!

517
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,850
Invest it right now!

518
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:29,710
Do you realize how much people suffer because they don't even have 1.7 billion ... no, 17 billion—

519
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:36,090
- No. Do you realize how much 170,000 won is?  Seriously!

520
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,790
- What are you talking about? 
 - Me?

521
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,920
Anyway, since you don't seem repentant, let's wrap it up here.

522
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,900
Please leave. Leave.

523
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,110
That's it?

524
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,960
- Office Manager!
 - Yes?

525
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,910
How many more 1.7 billion's worth—

526
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,850
How many more minor, 170,000-won robbery cases do I have to handle today!

527
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,260
Do these case assignments make sense?!

528
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,610
Should I play with fire?

529
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,260
I thought it was switched with the entry-level prosecutor, too. But it wasn't.

530
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,850
To be honest,

531
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,240
you leave your desk several times a day. You know you've changed, right?

532
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,470
So it's not happening at the department level.

533
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,350
These assignments are being given from way above as a penalty!

534
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,920
That's what we think.

535
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,870
We find it hard to field your calls and continue to make excuses

536
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,190
every time you're not in the office.

537
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,010
"Way above"?

538
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,540
So, you're telling me to go directly to the chief, isn't that right?

539
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,750
Fine!

540
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,940
No— Prosecutor!

541
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,240
That wasn't what we meant.

542
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,530
We meant for her to stop stepping away so much.

543
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,370
She only hears what she wants.

544
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,010
Chief Prosecutor!

545
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,270
Damn it!

546
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,470
Don't you know how to knock?

547
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,280
How could you do this?

548
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,740
I hear you're the one assigning me the caseload.

549
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm not a newbie. Why are you assigning me cases like this!

550
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,730
Wait. I have a frozen shoulder right now and can't lower my arm.

551
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,730
The doctor said to avoid stress.

552
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:13,620
What, what's with the assignments?  Hey, when I gave you an important case, did you handle it right?

553
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,160
When I cleared your workload and said to just summons Kang Mi Na, did you listen?

554
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,820
Sit with me and let's talk for a bit.

555
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,940
I'm not going to sit. I can't!

556
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,480
- Let's talk! 
 - Must I tell you—

557
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,530
even about my physical embarrassment?

558
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,630
That's right! I have hemorrhoids.

559
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,790
The doctor said not to sit.

560
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,150
You do as you please with an important case. You won't do petty crimes.

561
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,600
Is this your personal office where you can do whatever you want?

562
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,380
If we followed the rules, you should have been penalized with Lee Bong Sik's case!

563
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,780
You should be grateful we assign you any cases.

564
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,790
How dare you come into a chief prosecutor's office,

565
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,040
and order me to sit down? Someone with hemorrhoids at that!

566
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,890
Do you want to be suspended?

567
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,190
No. I can't investigate if I am suspended.

568
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,780
- Get out.
 - Yes, sir.

569
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,470
Ah, I thought I would die from arm numbness.

570
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,980
Hallelujah!

571
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,570
Why is she so obsessed with Lee Bong Sik?

572
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,990
Ah, that temper of hers.

573
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,490
That's one hundred percent Jo Yeon Ju. It has to be.

574
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,610
There's no way Kang Mi Na can imitate that rudeness.

575
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,980
"One hundred percent."

576
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,860
Jo Yeon Ju is the one playing both characters.

577
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,210
Then where is Kang Mi Na?

578
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,880
It's me. When Prosecutor Jo became a prosecutor ...

579
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,120
you have her written statement, right? Send it to me.

580
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,020
Gosh, he's a devout Buddhist. What is with "Hallelujah" all of a sudden?

581
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:45,070
But why is he so angry with me?  He wants to do whatever it takes to pressure me, is that it, huh?

582
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,790
In the central district, I'm the human-code from the Hammurabi*. 
  (Babylonian code of laws) 

583
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,180
"An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth."

584
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,840
I need to pressure the chief!

585
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,160
But why aren't these uncles contacting me?

586
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,510
What?

587
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,220
What?!

588
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,860
I've been staking out the gambling house Lee Bong Sik frequented.

589
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,130
- Let me join you guys.
 - You're a new face.

590
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,140
I lived abroad, so it's my first time here.

591
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,160
 At the beginning, I let them win. Then I won here and there. 

592
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,910
 Then naturally, I met people who knew Lee Bong Sik. 

593
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,050
 I let them win a few times, 

594
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,460
 and they let their guard down and said things here and there. 

595
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,770
 I heard that Lee Bong Sik bragged big time 

596
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,650
 about leaving something amazing at the pawnshop in front of the gambling house. 

597
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,550
 "Most coins which hit a jackpot" 

598
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,680
 "are no comparison." I heard he was laughing as he said that. 

599
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,090
Wait, how are you there playing cards right now?

600
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,900
Don't you remember when we were at the Central District Office, how we all went to that gambling house?

601
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,780
Back then, you said I had to go in as bait since I was the youngest.

602
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,710
You taught me to do this.

603
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,750
Anyway, I think I'd better go.

604
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:28,920
As well as me, someone from the Samgeori gang also seems to be looking for the USB drive.

605
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay.

606
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,900
So you didn't answer your phone because you've been at a gambling house all this time?

607
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,810
Don't go overboard and feel burdened. I am treating it as a cognitive investigation.

608
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,750
I'm going.

609
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:44,750
He's the one who really went overboard.

610
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,340
It's me. Uncles, go to the pawn shop in front of the gambling house.

611
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,180
I think the USB is there.

612
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,180
I'll head over there, too. Okay.

613
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,350
How are we going to tell her that someone already took it?

614
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,760
She said the Samgeori gang was involved. Maybe it was one of their guys?

615
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,100
In any case, you make the call.

616
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,280
Why do you always make me do it?

617
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,480
Seriously.

618
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,850
Hey, isn't that the person we saw the other night at the gambling house?

619
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,370
Maybe he's one of the Samgeori gang?

620
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:58,570
It'd be two against one. Should we take him on?

621
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,200
But no matter what, we can't mention Yeon Ju or her position. Okay?

622
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,630
Of course! That goes without saying.

623
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,840
Mr. Jang Seok Ho?

624
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,040
Is he getting an injection?

625
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,090
  Well, well, who might this be? 

626
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,410
  It's been a while, lady. 

627
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:01,370
 I heard that Lee Bong Sik bragged big time about leaving something amazing at the pawnshop in front of the gambling house. 

628
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,250
 I heard he was laughing and saying it's an amazing coin. 

629
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,510
 "An amazing coin"? 

630
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,360
Hey.

631
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,380
You startled me.

632
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,410
That USB. Who told you to get it?

633
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:30,070
What? This chicken head must be crazy.

634
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,390
Hey, who are you? Take that off.

635
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,750
What? Hey!

636
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,980
Excuse me.

637
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,330
What is it?

638
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,720
Did you take the USB?

639
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,820
Who are you two?

640
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,580
He doesn't look like he'll be easy to take down. His arms and legs are pretty long.

641
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,310
We're here on behalf of a prosecutor from the Central District Office.

642
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,280
A prosecutor from the Central District Office?

643
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,210
Yes. From the Central District. Prosecutor J ...

644
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,880
I'm Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun from the Seopyeong District Office. Who did you say sent you?

645
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,380
Mom, can chickens fly?

646
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,990
How could a chicken fly?

647
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,800
Won't you take it off!

648
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,760
Why won't you take it off?

649
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,240
Ow, ow, ouch!

650
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,920
O-o-o-ouch! Ahhh!

651
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,810
Ouch! It hurts! It hurts!!

652
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,840
That's too bad.

653
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,690
I'll look into how the Samgeori gang is involved.

654
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,210
So, where are you headed?

655
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,190
I lost the USB, but it sounds like we gained something else. So I'm headed over there.

656
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,340
We'll talk later.

657
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,430
Be careful. Okay.

658
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,260
- So you passed the Bar exam the same year as Yeon Ju? 
 - Yes.

659
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,400
Getting involved like this in a case our Yeon Ju's is handling ...?

660
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,990
It's not the usual kind of case either. It's very dangerous.

661
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,980
Do colleagues usually help with things like this?

662
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,990
What kind of relationship do you two have?

663
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,770
- A comfortable relationship. 
 - Ahh...

664
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,470
"A Comfortable relationship."

665
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,560
Why do you ask an unimportant question in a situation like this?

666
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,850
Why not? Then what's important?

667
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,050
This Seopyeong address you put into the GPS.

668
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,190
It doesn't look like an official residence, but a residential complex in an expensive part of town.

669
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,620
Is it ... yours?

670
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,740
It's my mother's.

671
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,500
Ah ... "your mother's."

672
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,500
But ... ah ...

673
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,900
Oh yes, what is it? What?

674
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,820
I stayed up all night, so I'll just take a nap.

675
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,880
Isn't this guy better? Huh?

676
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,470
Than that rental guy?

677
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,310
He looks well off. He has a good job, he's young ...

678
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,150
Why is his status so important?

679
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,580
Then what?

680
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,430
Yeon Ju's feelings are what's important.

681
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,100
Hah!

682
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,670
You idiot. Be careful!

683
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,760
Gosh.

684
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,620
Our Prosecutor Ahn will wake up.

685
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:13,990
Since it's Hanju hospital, they won't cooperate with CCTV or whatnot in any way.

686
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,350
The police tell me that I should just assume we can't catch the culprit right now.

687
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,980
Fortunately, Jang Seok Ho took the syringe.

688
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,770
What was in it?

689
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,950
A lethal amount of thallium.

690
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,240
"Thallium"?

691
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,940
It's toxic. When injected with a lethal dose, nothing happens to begin with,

692
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,960
and then the person dies in the next two weeks from an unknown cause.

693
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,450
You were right, sir.

694
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,810
You tried to convince me to hide from the beginning.

695
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,670
But I was foolish. I'm sorry.

696
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,930
It's good that you're okay, though.

697
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,260
But what happened exactly?

698
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,220
He came to me and asked me to do something for a reward.

699
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:03,010
I was so strapped financially, and I thought it would help ease the situation a bit.

700
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,770
He said that the youngest madam had some business there that day.

701
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:15,190
I was supposed to wait and when he gave me the sign, I was to go and hit her car.

702
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,570
But ...

703
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:23,640
the madam showed up all of a sudden without any signal.

704
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,000
I took off, thinking I didn't want things to go wrong.

705
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,190
But I started having a seizure from being too tense.

706
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,430
But why did that person ask you to do something like that?

707
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,090
What's your relationship with him?

708
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,210
A while ago, when the Hanju factory fire incident occurred,

709
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:51,600
they paid me to make a false testimony.

710
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,150
What testimony?

711
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,870
That I saw someone setting the fire.

712
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,240
I trusted them this time because they paid me that other time.

713
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,270
What did you say?

714
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,060
Of course, I'm sorry for it.

715
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,760
That day ...

716
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,430
 There's a fire! Fire! 

717
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,690
 It's a fire! Fire! Go! 

718
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:19,300
Because that man went from room to room pounding on the doors and waking everyone up,

719
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,620
the factory workers were able to escape.

720
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:33,690
I suffered from smoke inhalation as I escaped,

721
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,290
but if it hadn't been for him, I would have died.

722
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:46,010
But I wasn't the only one who lied. That man too, he confessed that he set the fire.

723
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,410
The guys found this and brought it in.

724
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:02,110
And you tried to take care of him at the hospital but failed.

725
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,010
I apologize.

726
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,920
I can't even say anything to you since you've worked so hard all this time.

727
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,390
Are you tired lately?

728
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,780
Do you want to take a break?

729
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,700
Do you know what really pains me?

730
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,240
I never even thought to ask him if he'd really set the fire.

731
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:41,540
I thought, naturally, he was the type of person to set the fire.

732
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,120
So I cornered him ...

733
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,550
and asked why he did that.

734
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,820
But ... if what that man said is true, why didn't my father ever say that?

735
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,560
Never mind me,

736
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,120
he could've said that to someone just once, out of anger.

737
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,990
But why ...

738
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,090
Let's go and ask him about that incident again.

739
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,610
 Why do you keep blowing up my life like land mines hidden here and there? 

740
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,750
 Why? Why? 

741
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,190
 We'll never see each other again. 

742
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,610
I can't.

743
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,780
You have no idea how I badgered him.

744
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:41,020
Last time I saw him, I even said I'll never see him again.

745
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:46,550
Even then, your father never said anything mean to you, right?

746
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,800
I told you.

747
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,480
People who love don't get disappointed easily by their loved ones.

748
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,470
Let's go.

749
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,390
What brings you here, Nuna?

750
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,820
Sorry about this morning. The meeting was scheduled too early.

751
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,230
I'll try to attend tomorrow.

752
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,210
There is no meeting tomorrow morning.

753
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,930
Did you cancel because of me? You didn't have to go that far.

754
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,980
I didn't cancel it for the game you're playing. So don't worry.

755
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:52,080
You'll be arrested for drug use tonight. That's why I canceled it.

756
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,160
What are you talking about?

757
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,810
You know that medicine I gave you?

758
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,100
The one you take periodically when you can't sleep.

759
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,770
That ingredient is unique, so if they run tests with your hair or something,

760
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,770
it tests positive for narcotics.

761
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,280
Why? Did you think I would be idle while leaving you alone?

762
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:22,270
That's nothing. Who doesn't use drugs among people like us these days?

763
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:26,860
No one is probably exempt, but no family sits and watches while a family member is arrested.

764
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,090
But you won't be able to get out. Because after the drug arrest,

765
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:36,870
I'll release all those trashy video clips I gathered on you for tabloids.

766
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,840
No one will take your side at the company, either.

767
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,060
While you were playing games and not attending the meeting,

768
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:48,180
I vastly improved conditions for all the executives.

769
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,970
And ...

770
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,330
do you remember this?

771
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:03,490
Do you believe this could only happen to your Hyeong Seong Chan?

772
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,020
Do you think father will side with you?

773
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:11,960
Why? Because of your wife?

774
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,700
Hey, you also know that your wife is fake.

775
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,450
 What are you doing? 

776
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:07,210
 You're not Kang Mi Na. 

777
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:14,640
 Knowing your real name and age is enough for me. 

778
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,910
 I didn't want to know more than that about the real Kang Mi Na, anyway. 

779
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:21,930
 I don't care who you are. Who you are right now is good enough for me. 

780
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:26,780
 Are you saying I have to keep pretending to be Kang Mi Na for you to be keep your position? 

781
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,220
 Exactly 

782
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:34,170
 But what if I don't need that position, as someone who is not Kang Mi Na? 

783
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,230
You were always pretty quick, even as a child.

784
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:45,930
I knew ...

785
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,140
that you were not truly a hooligan but pretending to be one.

786
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,200
You just didn't want to end up like Seong Chan.

787
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,860
What are you doing? What are you trying to do?

788
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,430
What do you mean?

789
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:06,730
I'll gather people and reveal your wife's DNA test results.

790
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,580
Why didn't you hide it well till the end?

791
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:27,380
As long as you didn't harm me, I would've let you be.

792
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,520
All right. You no longer have a choice.

793
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,640
Tell me everything you know about Kang Mi Na.

794
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,760
Who is that woman?

795
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,060
That day ... The day of grandma's accident.

796
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,640
Did you set the factory on fire?

797
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:17,220
Is it true that you set the factory on fire?

798
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,950
No!

799
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,910
I didn't do it.

800
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,200
You didn't do it?

801
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,010
Then why didn't you say so?

802
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,010
Because I didn't believe you?

803
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:55,750
Or because everyone automatically assumed that you were the culprit?

804
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,210
It's not your fault.

805
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,210
I ...

806
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:16,720
received money for saying I started the fire.

807
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,760
You received money? From whom?

808
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,940
Who gave you the money?

809
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:30,710
I don't know who it was, but he came to me at the police station

810
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:36,740
and said he works for Hanju.

811
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,810
You received money from Hanju?

812
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,860
But why?

813
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:50,770
By chance, the money I spent on food and my education...

814
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,680
Was it money from Hanju?

815
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,380
   

816
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:29,620


817
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,940
   

818
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,860
   

819
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,020
You finally agreed to visitations.

820
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,910
Why do you keep annoying me? Why do you keep sending me letters?

821
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,760
I have a lot of time.

822
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:56,260
Why did you want to meet me? What is it?

823
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,940
I just want to come by now and then.

824
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:02,190
I have a lot of time.

825
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,840
I came to share good news today.

826
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,980
Forget it! The Bible, Buddhist scriptures, and the Quran ...

827
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:16,100
I've pretty much read all the good writings in here.

828
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,270
   

829
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,720
Then she suddenly got angry, and just left when

830
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,450
I was holding up my arm like this, as told to, because I hurt it.

831
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:30,170
She has her mom's temper.

832
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,800
Really?

833
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,170
Yes. All the women in our family are tough like that.

834
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,370
Both my mother and Yeon Ju's mom.

835
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:45,060
She said she became a prosecutor to catch the culprit behind her grandma's hit-and-run accident.

836
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,820
The prosecutor who covered it up seems to be connected to Hanju,

837
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,960
so she's still gathering evidence.

838
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,230
Would Hanju just let her do that?

839
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,160
She has been standing her ground well, so far.

840
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,950
You also want to hear about that day.

841
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,360
That's why you're here, right?

842
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,840
That's right.

843
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:15,770
I really want to know. Not only for me, but also for Yeon Ju's sake.

844
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:20,820
Does she know that you've been coming to see me?

845
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,560
No, not yet.

846
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,690
Then tell her, and then come back.

847
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:37,370
But if she finds out I've been coming secretly,

848
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,780
will she be disappointed in me?

849
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,790
I'm not sure.

850
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:47,710
It depends on how she feels.

851
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,210
There's something my mother once told me.

852
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:55,490
If a child makes a mistake and reaches out again,

853
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:59,920
the parents will take that hand immediately.

854
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,290
Isn't that the case?

855
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:08,000
Once we love someone,

856
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,820
we don't get disappointed in them that easily.

857
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,140
   

858
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,080
 You no longer have a choice. 

859
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,690
 Tell me everything you know about Kang Mi Na. 

860
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,730
 It looks like your savings account has matured. 

861
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,280
 All these things that happened in Seopyeong. 

862
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,200
 I'm Chief District Prosecutor, you bastard! 

863
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,030
 Whatever you guys are digging into, do you think this will work? 

864
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,640
 I've heard something about your alibi for that night that seems suspicious. 

865
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,370
 The day my father passed away, weren't you at the Seopyeong factory? 

866
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:44,830
 Jo Yeon Ju ... I feel like I've heard that name somewhere. 

867
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,580
 She is the daughter of the Hanju factory's arsonist. 

868
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,020
♫  Left alone in the middle  ♫
