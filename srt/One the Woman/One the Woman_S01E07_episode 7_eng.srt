1
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,440
- What do you usually do when you're by yourself?
 - Why do you ask? 
    

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,950
Judging from the way you speak and act,

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,050
I don't believe you were an ordinary person.

4
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,080
Usually, the things people do when they are alone give a good idea of who they are.

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,330
Why the sudden interest in who I am?

6
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm curious where you'll be going when you go back.

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,300
Also, I'm wondering if you were close with dangerous people.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,220
What ... are you worried ...

9
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,700
that I might be a dangerous person?

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,990
I'm wondering if you might find yourself in danger.

11
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,990
I am searching the entire world,

12
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,240
using all means available to me.

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,590
You will be able to return soon.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,200
By the way, why do you dislike being in hospitals?

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,880
I mean, if it's not that you absolutely hate it, I was hoping you would

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,700
- airlift food for me while I'm here.
 - Why would I do that?

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,220
I mean, I have to be stuck here for days and Team Leader says he can't come.

18
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,060
Do you hate being in hospitals that much?

19
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,670
When I go to a hospital, it brings up bad memories linked to this place.

20
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,250
Though they are all in the past.

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,090
It's not in the past then,

22
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,110
if you hate it every time you are reminded of it.

23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,730
All right, then. If there really is nothing to eat,

24
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,060
I'll wear a mask and go downstairs to the emergency room

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,450
and make myself some instant coffee.

26
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,160
Do you know this?

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,490
At night, the warmest spot in the hospital is in front of the ER.

28
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,580
They also have instant coffee there.

29
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,580
Because people visit there around the clock.

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,070
 This is a magic powder. 

31
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,800
 If you take it when you are exhausted, it gives you energy. 

32
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,120
 Do you know this? 

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,340
 The warmest place in the hospital at night is in front of the ER. 

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,740
 That's because people visit there around the clock. 

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,530


36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,650
I have to head out now.

37
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,780
Enjoy the meal.

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,160
Wait, why are you suddenly leaving?

39
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,210
All the time, things are going fine and then out of nowhere, he'll tell me to go home,

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,640
or he says he's going home.

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,970
What's wrong with him!?

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,420
He left so much of the sushi too. What a waste.

43
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,090
   

44
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,550
"How a chaebol chairwoman deals with being investigated by the prosecution ..."

45
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,290
"the press caught her on camera"

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,080
"eating sushi in a VIP hospital room."

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,550
Look at this.

48
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,920
The moment I'm not there, this kind of thing happens.

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,320
This won't do so I might have to go back to being her secretary.

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,430
What were they thinking?

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,830
She got admitted to hospital by lying about gastric cramps,

52
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,540
and they brought her food like that?

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,720
She must've made a scene saying she's hungry.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,870
Even if she did make a scene,

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,400
don't they have a brain?

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,660
They should've have taken something that would make sense if she got caught, like porridge.

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,350
They must've have got her a nincompoop secretary.

58
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,750
It was me.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,630
- Huh? 
 - I'm the one who took it to her.

60
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,720
I see ...

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,900
So ... What happened?

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,870
Well, what do you think?

63
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,950
The press was at the hospital,

64
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,480
and another warrant came from Seopyeong.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,020
So she pretended she had already recovered, and went home.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,210
By the way, the prosecutor at Seopyeong ...

67
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,660
You said you thought he wasn't after Kang Mi Na, right?

68
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,550
Even so ... Is it safe for her to make an appearance at the prosecution?

69
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,490
Did you say I was like a flower in a greenhouse?

70
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,700
I guess you could say that I grew up very sheltered.

71
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,390
But do you think this place looks like a shelter?

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,420
Everyone's the same once they leave their shelter. No matter where they grow up.

73
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,050
We could've taken care of this three years ago. What a waste of time.

74
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,880
Just so you know,

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,650
you'll be sorry,

76
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,270
- if you get rid of me right now. 
 - What did you say?

77
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you even know what I know!?

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,050
Your sister-in-law ...

79
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,510
Chairwoman Kang Mi Na ...

80
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,320
Don't you think she's a little strange?

81
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,430
So?

82
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,860
Kang Mi Na ...

83
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,670
might not be Kang Mi Na.

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,000
Is that what you are talking about?

85
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,360
I already have that information. What I need is evidence.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,630
Should I give you a chance?

87
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,210
If you bring me evidence, I'll let you live.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,060
I thought I'd learn about your appearance at the prosecution through the news again.

89
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,130
However, here you are bidding us goodbye before going.

90
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,820
I am very much obliged.

91
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,270
You ran away to the hospital without even telling us.

92
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,280
You should have come home right away when you were caught lying.

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,580
But you only come home at dawn, and then you leave right away.

94
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,900
There's a limit to how much disrespect we'll tolerate from you.

95
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,610
 Her last name isn't even Han but that family is all she talks about. 

96
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,640
 Oh well. She has an inferiority complex about her birth. 

97
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,330
 No wonder she obsesses about the Han family. 

98
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,940
By the way, where did you get your eyebrows tattooed?

99
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,740
The picture was taken from afar and you had no make up on, but the eyebrows were so vivid!

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,020
 What is she thinking? Asking such a question ... 

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,730
 Is she high even now? 

102
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,930
Stop talking about stupid stuff.

103
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,480
Do you think she's in the mood to respond to that?

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,060
 All his experience in cheating with various women ... 

105
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,450
 He can't understand what his father is thinking, 

106
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,970
 but he knows so well how a woman thinks. 

107
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,280
Why did you make such a big deal out of a simple witness interrogation?

108
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,920
Nothing bad will happen.

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,230
 She is so naive ... 

110
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,330
 That's why she gets scammed so easily. 

111
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,160
 That's right. I know all of your dirty laundry. 

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,470
 How dare you talk to me like this! 

113
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,710
 Do you all think I'll be going down by myself? 

114
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,600
By the way, everyone. You've all always treated me this badly,

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,270
but I guess you are not afraid of getting me summonsed by the prosecutors?

116
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,020
What would you do if I told them everything I know!?

117
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,570
Violation of the narcotics control act!

118
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,980
Alimony lawsuit for adultery!

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,420
Habitual assault!

120
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,660
Violation of the Capital Market Act and unfair trade practices!

121
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,190
Malpractice and embezzlement through accounting fraud!

122
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,410
Do you think you will be safe?

123
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,720
 If I did that ... 

124
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,870
 I would be quietly murdered in the garden before I even get out of the house. 

125
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,120
I don't have much to say. If you're caught on camera again,

126
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,700
it won't be just your own reputation that will be tarnished, but Hanju's image as well.

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,480
So try to keep a low profile.

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,310
The press might already be waiting there for you,

129
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,800
so tell the legal team team leader to take your car.

130
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,240
What about me?

131
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,550
There's that car our eldest daughter-in-law bought for when she goes volunteering.

132
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,630
Right, if you take that, no one will know it's you.

133
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,380
So they want me to treat this like some volunteer work for Hanju?

134
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,620
What the heck ...

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
What are you doing here?

136
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,800
I heard it all from Ajeossi

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,020
that Team Leader has to take your car so that you can go secretly

138
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,530
- to the prosecutors' office ... 
 - And so?

139
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,790
I know the Han family must've given you a hard time this morning,

140
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,390
and I was worried that you would lose your temper and say, "I know all your dirty laundry,"

141
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,060
"how are you all so confident letting me make an appearance?"

142
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,010
Who would do that? I didn't even begin to think about doing that.

143
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm here because the unexpected might happen,

144
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,470
just like when you were caught on camera.

145
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,290
You must not be feeling too good. Should I drive?

146
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,990
You're not used to this car, I'm sure.

147
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,500
   

148
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,650
 I printed the missing person's phone record, 

149
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,060
and you were the one who spoke most frequently with her on the phone.

150
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,890
- Still you said you have no idea where she could be? 
 -Yes.

151
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,360
However, I heard she appeared at the prosecutors' office.

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,180
- What's that about? 
 - I think it was a mistake.

153
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,850
They may be confused by someone who looks similar.

154
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,950
There's just a bunch of rumors,

155
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,180
but no one is coming forward about actually seeing her.

156
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,020
Then how is the investigation proceeding now?

157
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,850
She's a young woman,

158
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,460
so, at first, we focused more on it being that she simply ran away.

159
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,100
Now, we're looking at different possibilities.

160
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,950
- Different? 
 - You know, when a prosecutor disappears,

161
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,700
it often isn't anything good.

162
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,730
Do you think something happened to her?

163
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,940
Well, you know. Some get stabbed

164
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,340
by someone they indicted, out of resentment ...

165
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,160
Or if their case was related to corruption of someone powerful,

166
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,090
and they're found near a river dead, under the guise of suicide.

167
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,290
What are you talking about?

168
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,090
I'm just giving you examples ...

169
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,030
Everyone said,

170
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,050
her personality created a lot of resentment.

171
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,760
- That's true, but ... 
 - Anyway,

172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,550
we need to focus more on those possibilities from now on,

173
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,410
since there has been many cases like that.

174
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,280
There could've been an accident as well.

175
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,830
It's not easy for a prosecutor to disappear into thin air.

176
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,280
Slow down.

177
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,220
Slow down your nagging instead.

178
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,460
Driving is all about the flow.

179
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,810
If I go slow, the traffic will get worse because of me.

180
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,120
Come on, slow down. It feels you're going over 100 km/h.

181
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,100
Slow down, please!

182
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,890
I want to slow down, but it's not working.

183
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,940
Somethings wrong with the brakes.

184
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,390
What?

185
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,380
Trang, how long has it been since you cleaned up?

186
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,090
Just yesterday, we called someone to clean.

187
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,240
It's me, director Kim from Seongbukdong.

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,760
Can you tell me, where is the car that chairwoman Kang Mi Na took today?

189
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,630
 What's going on? 

190
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,930
Director, there's something wrong.

191
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,700
Yes, we're on it. Yes.

192
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,190
Damn it.

193
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,910
No wonder they told me to take this car.

194
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,340
Those Hanju jerks. No creativity, no diligence in how they work.

195
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,590
They kill someone by tampering with the brakes in 2021?

196
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,030
Now they're openly chasing me.

197
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,550
First, put it in a lower gear.

198
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,470
Slow down by doing that and find the safest spot to crash into.

199
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,900
If the car breaks down, those chasing me will say it's a car defect.

200
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,250
I can't let them do that!

201
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,930
This is why you keep getting in more and more danger!

202
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,600
Since when did you care so much?

203
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
You were just focused on finding Kang Mi Na, not caring about what happens to me.

204
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,360
Do you think I want to find her for her own sake?

205
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,600
If we can't find Kang Mi Na, they might kill you. Like now!

206
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,870
Then, you're looking for Kang Mi Na because of me?

207
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,210
In front! Look in front!

208
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,630
- What are you doing!? 
 - My head ...

209
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,240
What's wrong? Are you all right?

210
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,920
That looks like a drunk driver.

211
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,610
I think it's more than that. Maybe they're on drugs.

212
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,660
Go after them. Quickly.

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,080
Are you all right? Hold on.

214
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,800
Damn it. If I turn off the engine, the car might lose control  ...

215
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
I'll go straight to the prosecutors' office. Hold on, yes?

216
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,180
What to do?

217
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,250
Ready? Here we go ...

218
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,790
The Hanju Group daughter-in-law is coming after making a ruckus to avoid appearing.

219
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,540
She obviously won't come in from there for everyone to see.

220
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,390
If it's not through there, she'll go to the underground parking.

221
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,530
There's a bunch of reporters there too.

222
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,580
What is that?

223
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,570
Okay, I'm turning off the engine now. One, two ...

224
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,430
Three!

225
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,320
 Get out of the way. 

226
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,090
 Please wait. Clear the way. 

227
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,680
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

228
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,670
I'm fine.

229
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,160
I was trying to come in quietly and secretly.

230
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,190
But instead, I made a grand entrance.

231
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,780
Get off for now. It'll be even weirder to stay in here longer.

232
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,320
 Chairwoman! One moment please! 

233
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,090
 Chairwoman! Chairwoman! 

234
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,160
 Step back, please. 

235
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,020
 Stop, you're not allowed to take pictures. 

236
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,950
Huh?

237
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,150
 Chairwoman, a moment of your time, please! 

238
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,390
Nuna!

239
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,790
What happened? Are you all right?

240
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,040
I thought something bad had happened to you!

241
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,390
Do you know me?

242
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,460
Do you ... really know me?

243
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,290
Nuna ...

244
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,390
 This is a footage of the road near the Seopyeong District Prosecutors' Office this morning. 
   

245
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,100
 A compact car can be seen driving recklessly, switching lanes, 
   

246
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
 and even hitting the central reservation 

247
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,360
 in a very dangerous manner. 

248
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,020
 Many police and security-agency cars can be seen chasing this dangerously driven vehicle. 

249
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,440
 The person driving is none other than Yumin Group's chairwoman, Kang Mi Na. 

250
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,770
Aunt is the coolest.

251
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,580
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na who had to make an appearance, tried to avoid it in many ways. 

252
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,240
 Many police and security-agency cars ... 

253
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Isn't that Oppa Seung Wuk standing behind over there?

254
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,800
 It's reported that her chauffeur was driving, but 
   

255
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,740
 the cause has not been clarified. 

256
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,170
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, who stepped out of the car ... 

257
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,430
I was thinking of starting a scandal about them,

258
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,340
and burying them.

259
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,320
Instead, they're digging their own graves.

260
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,410
Idiot scamming bastard.

261
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,700
Where is Lee Bong Sik?

262
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,410
I'll send out the guys and I'll get him soon.

263
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,610
Why was security there?

264
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,480
Director Kim called them.

265
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,460
What?

266
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,160
Please forgive me. In the parking lot, we found out that the car has a problem.

267
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,400
So I told them to follow her.

268
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,680
What happened? The car was fine when I went volunteering last time.

269
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,370
Get the car first and get it scrapped.

270
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,950
All right.

271
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,840
What about the person? The person is the issue, scrapping the car is secondary.

272
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,280
We need to get Seung Wuk here and grill him, to find out what they are up to.

273
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,400
Seung Wuk is no more a kid who comes running because I tell him to.

274
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,560
He wasn't here because I called him either, last time.

275
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,010
He came because he wanted to.

276
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,430
Then? Are you going to just sit there doing nothing?

277
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,160
I'll make him want to come.

278
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,100
   

279
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,100
So what you are saying is that you are Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Yumin Group,

280
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,350
and you know nothing about a prosecutor named Jo Yeon Ju?

281
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,420
Who? What prosecutor?

282
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,800
The person I know you as is Jo Yeon Ju.

283
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,190
She was a prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

284
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,390
   

285
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,510
 Jo Yeon Ju? 

286
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,600
   

287
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,460
 My grandmother? 

288
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,240
 So, I did not impersonate a prosecutor. 

289
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,270
 Neither am I a fraud. But I'm a real ... 

290
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,180
prosecutor?

291
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,510
What's wrong?

292
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,870
 Aigoo, Your Ladyship. I can't believe I'm running into you here. 

293
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,170
 That's why he called me "your ladyship." 

294
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,760
 You haven't been in for a while. I was worried. Now I see you here! 

295
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,570
 That's why she recognized me back at the prosecutors' office! 

296
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,140
 That's why I'm good at fighting— 

297
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,770
 Huh? That's not right. 

298
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,600
Do prosecutors have special positions for professional athletes or something?

299
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,400
What the heck are you talking about?

300
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,430
How's your arm doing?

301
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,930
All right. It's not that bad.

302
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,650
- Someone tampered with the car brake, I think. 
 - Again?

303
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Thank goodness I told the press you were a chauffeur and took you away. It could have been bad.

304
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,270
By the way, do the Kang Mi Na stand-in and that prosecutor know one another?

305
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,300
I think so.

306
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,410
He summoned her to investigate Kang Mi Na.

307
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,940
If she admits to that prosecutor she's not Mi Na,

308
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,870
it's going to be a mess.

309
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,110
Honestly, as for me, I have no idea what you're talking about.

310
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,270
A prosecutor? Me?

311
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,940
Is this like a new type of entrapment?

312
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,330
Are you crazy?

313
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,850
Long-term habits don't go away just because you want them to.

314
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,030
Who cares about just some paper?

315
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,520
Only we prosecutors do.

316
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,070
Currently prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju is missing,

317
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,770
but the police are on it, so the truth will be revealed soon.

318
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,000
Now, let's start the investigation. Even if you're not a prosecutor,

319
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,820
you know that impersonation and perjury are serious crimes, right?

320
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,360
 Damn it. If I say I am Jo Yeon Ju, it'll be impersonation, 

321
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,560
 and if I say I'm Kang Mi Na, it'll be perjury. 

322
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,600
Prosecutor Sir,  may I speak with my lawyer, please?

323
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,950
Good news! I knew it!

324
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,860
Apparently I'm a prosecutor!

325
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,650
I knew it. I'm so smart. Right? Right?

326
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,400
Prosecutor?

327
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,760
Not someone who was indicted by a prosecutor?

328
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,180
What are you talking about? He said I'm Jo Yeon Ju from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

329
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju?

330
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,620
Then you're the prosecutor I was trying to meet ...

331
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,470
What?

332
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,800
Look how much she altered the picture.

333
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,460
There's no nose in the picture so I didn't recognize you in person.

334
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Why were you trying to meet me anyway?

335
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
You contacted me first.

336
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,040
I did? Why did I?

337
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,110
How would I know?

338
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,710
You left a voice message saying you had something to tell me about Hanju.

339
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,930
So I thought you'd be someone worth meeting and I called you.

340
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,070
But right after our call, you went missing.

341
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,180
Wait, wait. That prosecutor ...

342
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,660
Do you think he was on friendly terms with Jo Yeon Ju?

343
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,590
I don't know. You said you met him. You should know.

344
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,560
I don't think so.

345
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,300
I mean, look at her temper.

346
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,930
Who would be friendly with her?

347
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,700
Yes but ... he almost cried earlier.

348
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,480
He said he was worried something bad had happened to me.

349
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,330
And he almost cried. Doesn't that mean we must have been on friendly terms?

350
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,660
If you trust him so easily, what if he says something to Hanju? Do you think you'll be safe then?

351
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,220
You might not be able to go back to being a prosecutor.

352
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,320
What do I do, then?

353
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,070
   
   

354
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,410
How can they be this similar?

355
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,400
Where was she all this time that she now appears as Hanju's puppet?

356
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,620
   

357
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,310
I wonder ...

358
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,790
How much does a prosecutor like you earn?

359
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,860
Don't think about making a deal.

360
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,800
I'm not a prosecutor who sides with a chaebol.

361
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,170
You can't be too quick to decide something like that.

362
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,850
At one time, it wasn't possible to shake hands while holding a fist,

363
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,560
but nowadays, in this new era,

364
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,150
we can express goodwill while still holding a fist.

365
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,860
You have no memory,

366
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,720
so what made you think you are Kang Mi Na?

367
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,410
- Where did you hear that? 
 - You just told me yourself.

368
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,890
- You got me. 
 - Did ...

369
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,900
someone make you believe you are Kang Mi Na?

370
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,490
Given the circumstances, nobody forced me to think that.

371
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,320
There was just some misunderstanding by everyone.

372
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,520
Where is the real Kang Mi Na?

373
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,030
I'm looking for her.

374
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,470
Then, even if you didn't know who you were,

375
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,820
you knew you were not Kang Mi Na.

376
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,400
Why are you still pretending to be her?

377
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm not trying to impersonate her on purpose.

378
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,780
I thought I was Kang Mi Na too!

379
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,740
I'm not asking for excuses.

380
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,470
I only want to know what you're thinking.

381
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,340
Why do you want to know that?

382
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm doing what I always do.

383
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,090
You were not on my side that often, Nuna,

384
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,680
but I was always on your side.

385
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,360
I need to know what you are thinking if I'm going to take your side.

386
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,670
How can I help?

387
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,200
Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun accepts that if he divulges Kang Mi Na's current state,

388
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,990
or does not divulge it but leaks hints about it,

389
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,870
or does divulge it but nobody believes ...

390
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,650
And so on ...

391
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,210
That if any of the situations described herein occurs,

392
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,440
he will pay the stated amount of compensation.

393
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,410
She said she'll only trust me if I signed this contract. So I did.

394
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,670
I used the contract you signed as reference, Team Leader.

395
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,630
Since you admitted that you are prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju,

396
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,490
may I ask what I want to ask?

397
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,360
How are you doing healthwise, Nuna?

398
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,270
You look as if you've lost weight ...

399
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,670
Oh my, you can tell?

400
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,230
- Of course. Are you sleeping well? 
 - No ...

401
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,850
She's officially living as the Yumin Group chairwoman,

402
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,430
so her situation wouldn't be as bad as you think.

403
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,990
Is there a worse situation than putting someone in a car with broken brakes?

404
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,280
And by the way, who are you?

405
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,670
You suddenly show up and tell me to investigate Hanju,

406
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,760
and now you appear with Hanju Group's daughter-in-law.

407
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,320
What's more, she isn't even the real one, but made to act like her.

408
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,670
I told you earlier.

409
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,070
There were misunderstandings on all sides.

410
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,670
Now, we are all in the same boat.

411
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,360
You know, if it weren't for him earlier, I could've really died.

412
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,890
I'm sorry if that was rude.

413
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,930
I'm actually grateful to you for taking care of her.

414
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,230
Why are you grateful?

415
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,800
I should be the one thanking you.

416
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,020
You are so friendly towards our Kang Mi Na stand-in.

417
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,500
Who are you to be thanking me? You're not even close to her.

418
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,660
I can thank you because I'm close enough to her.

419
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:06,040
Wait. It's not the time to quibble over who's more thankful.

420
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,130
   

421
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,640
Why did you let them take the car?

422
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,860
Security took the car instantly! How was I supposed to stop that?

423
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,860
The Hanju people scrapped it right away and said it was due to poor maintenance,

424
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,950
and that's how the driver avoided being detained.

425
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,970
Then, are you saying it wasn't poor maintenance?

426
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,700
What have you gotten yourself into, Nuna?

427
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,950
At least, with all the buzz, the Hanju Group won't pick a fight about the interrogation itself.

428
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,270
Let's buy some time by acting as if the witness's interview is happening today.

429
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,760
And we'll think about how to proceed from now on.

430
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,690
"From now on"? Are you telling her to go back to Hanju Group?

431
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm following her around in case something happens.

432
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,600
What has following her solved?

433
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,770
She was forced to make an appearance because her picture was taken,

434
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,350
and was almost killed because you let her drive a dubious car.

435
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,840
If your dear nuna didn't call saying she's hungry, the photo wouldn't have happened!

436
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,880
Also, the accident! Your nuna's fine, but our director here, he hurt his arm.

437
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,510
You're hurt?

438
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,090
It's nothing.

439
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
What do you want to do, Nuna?

440
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,070
If the fact that I'm not Kang Mi Na is revealed,

441
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,100
the real Kang Mi Na will really be in danger.

442
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,040
I'll go back to my rightful place when the time comes, but that doesn't seem to be now.

443
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,320
Don't worry, with so many eyes on me, it might be safer.

444
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,800
The prosecutor said he'll keep it a secret for now,

445
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,910
so let's focus on finding the real Kang Mi Na as quickly as possible.

446
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,220
Did anyone come forward?

447
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,460
Director!

448
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,280
I'm sorry, what did you say?

449
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,180
What are you thinking about?

450
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,950
That prosecutor ...

451
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,580
Keeping the secret is great and all,

452
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,640
but why did he take her in his car?

453
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,840
What would she take, then?

454
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,420
The car she brought was scrapped. She's trying to leave quietly. Do you think she can just hop on a taxi?

455
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,120
And also, is this car a shuttle bus?

456
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,340
I have to drive you home and then you wanted me to take her home too?

457
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,520
Anyway,  the fake Kang Mi Na being prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju ... Goodness.

458
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,390
What a strange world we live in.

459
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,340
It's all so riveting.

460
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,410
We're not doing this for our own entertainment.

461
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,090
You said we were going to my home. Why are we here?

462
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,260
This is your house.

463
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,830
Here?

464
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,920
It was your grandmother's death anniversary not long ago.

465
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,470
You used to order a flower basket and visit her every year.

466
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,370
This must be what this is for.

467
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,140
You must be very close to me.

468
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,510
It took you long enough to realize that.

469
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,890
What? Why are you here?

470
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,920
I want to ask you the same thing.

471
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,390
He apparently moved here not so long ago.

472
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,880
- The apartment across from yours? 
 - Yes!

473
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,060
This is where you used to live?

474
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,570
Apparently. Isn't it fascinating?

475
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,530
Ah, you're the guy who stole her milk that day!

476
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,840
You stole my milk?

477
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
N-No, it's not that I stole it ...

478
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,780
You were caught red-handed.

479
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,580
It's just milk. Don't be so stingy.

480
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,190
I didn't steal it.

481
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,640
Yes! That's how casually you used to talk to me!

482
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,080
Your body remembers our back-and-forths.

483
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,940
Shall we go in, then?

484
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,550
Yes, I guess we shall.

485
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,020
Wow!

486
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,280
What's up with his expression?

487
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,390
Why did he hide that? Who does he think I am?

488
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,150
This is better than I thought.

489
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,660
There's even something like this in my home!

490
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,250
Oh, I love it.

491
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,970
A prosecutor 's salary is not so bad, huh?

492
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,690
Wow ...

493
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,210
It feels like I'm in the countryside, listening to the sound of water and the mountain.

494
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,610
By the way ... Besides my grandmother, I must not have any family who'd look for me if I'm missing.

495
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,610
Yes. All I know is that you were raised by your grandmother without your parents.

496
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,750
I didn't ask about your family too much.

497
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,350
You said you were close to me.

498
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,960
I became close because I didn't dig into your personal life too much.

499
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,940
 What? Who am I ? Why do I fight so well? 

500
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,020
 You're the successor of the Nammun gang. Of course you fight well. 

501
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,040
I didn't hear him leave ...

502
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,860
Is he still there?

503
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,570
The key code ...

504
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,010
Why does he know it?

505
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,890
Right, he might know because he's a fellow prosecutor.

506
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,550
A close fellow prosecutor.

507
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,060
They must be like brother and sister!

508
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,110
Right. That's possible in siblings-like relationships.

509
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,610
What's all this?

510
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,160
It was used for a reconnaissance mission.

511
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,640
- Reconnaissance mission? 
 - When the investigating agency recognizes there has been a crime,

512
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,650
they can start the investigation,

513
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,890
even without the victim reporting the crime or pressing charges.

514
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,990
I got a tip and gave it to you.

515
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,430
But I can't tell if that tip was right or wrong.

516
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,580
Wow, it seems I was living quite diligently.

517
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,340
I'd investigate even though no one pressed charges.

518
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,610
Well ... The deputy chief that you used to work with ...

519
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,420
was in a pickle because he lost a perpetrator unfairly a while ago.

520
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,880
So you were chasing that perpetrator without the chief knowing.

521
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,530
Wow! I was super loyal too!

522
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,170
Well ... It wasn't exactly that ...

523
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,060
Wow ...

524
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,350
For now, let's learn about yourself step by step,

525
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,000
and let's focus on other people.

526
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,260
- What? 
 - To cancel the missing person report, you need to go to work.

527
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,410
There will be people at work who may talk to you, even if briefly,

528
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,500
so you have to memorize all their personal details.

529
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,480
Again? Ah, I'm so sick of doing this!

530
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,680
The building is ...

531
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,000
soundproofed very well.

532
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,890
The structure is ...

533
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,230
Privacy is so well kept here!

534
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,450
I'll bring back your stuff I took later, little by little.

535
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,990
I don't think you're in a condition to continue as a prosecutor,

536
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,920
so apply for a leave of absence as soon as you get to work.

537
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,240
I will. Being both a chaebol and a prosecutor is a bit too much.

538
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,790
But ... isn't resting and getting your memory back the priority?

539
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,880
Even if the crime of impersonation is established,

540
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,250
if you get a diagnosis of memory loss,

541
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,130
it will be considered an extenuating circumstance and nothing big will happen to you.

542
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,300
Why are you still being pushed around by those people?

543
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,120
All this time, you didn't know who you were, but now ...

544
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,190
Or ... Is there something that's concerning you?

545
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,560
 Are you all right? Are you hurt? 

546
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,120
I wish it wasn't the case ...

547
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,210
What? What? Why? What is it?

548
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,260
Don't think about anything else, and memorize this.

549
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,230
   

550
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,640
Did he leave or not?

551
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,270
What is she doing?

552
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,410
You can't put an iced towel on an old wound.

553
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,490
A massage with a warm towel relieves the pain more.

554
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,770
I'm going to go see a doctor with the team leader later.

555
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,510
You're not fooling me! You said you hate hospitals. You would've already gone if you meant that.

556
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,640
You're a prosecutor,

557
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,320
how do you know how to do this?

558
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,590
Good question. Maybe I got hurt all the time. This feels so natural.

559
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,860
Okay.

560
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,150
- What are you doing? 
 - Stay like this for now.

561
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,120
You're supposed to keep bruises above your heart level. And don't use your arm for a while.

562
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,300
I'm sorry. I haven't had time to eat even one meal today.

563
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,880
What? This isn't me!

564
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,840
What on earth! Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

565
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,070
- I hit you so hard. Up, like this. 
 - Ah, yes.

566
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,240
Put your hands up.

567
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,690
This is my house, and I'm the one who's hungry.

568
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,610
Why are you ordering what you want to eat?

569
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,020
I wanted to eat jok-baengyi* since I was in the hospital. 
  (Spicy sliced pigs feet and sea snail dish)  

570
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,880
And if you've hurt your  muscle, it's good to eat this type of food.

571
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,690
You almost died this morning, and you don't even know who did it,

572
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,880
yet you have the heart to enjoy jok-baengyi. How impressive.

573
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,260
The doctor after the accident told me

574
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,600
that even if the memory is gone, the emotions are still there.

575
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,260
Maybe my life was always full of crises.

576
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,150
That's what I'm thinking. I'm so used to this feeling.

577
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,400
I guess I didn't live such a easy-breezy life.

578
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,360
You'll find your memory for sure, now that you know who you are.

579
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,150
I really hope that's true.

580
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,490
When people go through hardship,

581
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,310
they bring out old memories,

582
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,710
and get cheered up and heal and all that.

583
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,720
But I have none of that ...

584
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,700
Other people drive on the freeway in a four-wheel drive in the middle of winter,

585
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,960
but I felt like running alone barefoot on a dirt road.

586
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,620
No one has only good memories, you know.

587
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,700
There are many things you'll be able to do because you don't know your past.

588
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,720
- I ate it because you gave it to me. 
 - I didn't make any comment.

589
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,990
You can't make a wrap with one hand, so I made it for you.

590
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,880
Why did you put so much garlic?

591
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,410
Oh ... You're a spice wuss. You don't know how to appreciate tasty food.

592
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,290
You're so tacky sometimes.

593
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,300
What?

594
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,210
You're such a different person with just the same face.

595
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,470
I don't know what I was thinking.

596
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,490
Are you talking about Kang Mi Na?

597
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,840
Why? What were you thinking?

598
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,540
I was reminded of when we first met.

599
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,200
A woman whom I'd never seen before,

600
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,670
who appeared frail yet so determined at the same time.

601
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,280
That's what I was thinking about.

602
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,050
She must've been struggling herself, but she comforted me as I was struggling more.

603
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,480
I keep getting reminded of that time, these days.

604
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,580
What's up with all that detail?

605
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,520
All right, fine!

606
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,010
What? You asked me.

607
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,030
As if you gave details when I asked questions in the past.

608
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,890
I've stayed too long. I'm going to head out!

609
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:08,120
- If you put all of that together, how am I supposed to clean up? 
 - Figure it out.

610
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,000
Can I put my arm down!?

611
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,390
Do whatever you like!

612
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,750
When am I supposed to put it down ...

613
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,540
What am I supposed to do with all this.

614
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,670
You've got a knack for getting into accidents, huh?

615
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,650
Especially for dirtying our family name without even getting a scratch yourself.

616
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,140
It's your specialty, isn't it?

617
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,990
I liked it better in the past.

618
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,290
I liked so much more the miserable girl you were before your head injury.

619
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,140
Why is everyone bringing up the past so much today?

620
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,580
What makes the past so great?

621
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:51,050
If you are going to say something, just talk about me! Me!

622
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:55,370
What? All right, good you brought it up. Are you out of your mind?

623
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,830
Why was Seung Wuk in the car with you?

624
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,800
You're determined to have dirty tabloid articles spreading all over the place.

625
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,750
If the car hadn't had that problem, no one would've known who was in it.

626
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,070
Every single member of this family has some dirty tabloid article floating around, anyway.

627
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,850
What?

628
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,760
I heard you scrapped the car right away.

629
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,360
Leaving that car alone wouldn't have helped anyone.

630
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,560
It'll hurt the company if it's revealed our car was faulty.

631
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,200
What if it was not faulty?

632
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,850
Why did something like that happen, if the car was not faulty?

633
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,440
Are you interrogating people now that you went through an interrogation?

634
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,030
Are you saying someone did that on purpose?

635
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,630
You dirtied our company's name and instead of taking the responsibility you're blaming someone else?

636
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,550
All right, I understand. I'll give a press conference tomorrow,

637
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,460
apologize to Seopyeong City for driving dangerously, pay the fee,

638
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,070
give funds for the development of the city of Seopyeong,

639
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,730
recognize the car was faulty and recall all cars of that model.

640
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,480
That would lift up the company's image, and I'll be taking responsibility.

641
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,090
- You, how dare you ... 
 - Stop, both of you!

642
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,090
Human beings tend to take other people's consideration for granted,

643
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,590
but you are crossing the line.

644
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,740
Do you think that consideration is toward you?

645
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,790
No, it is for the leader of Yumin.

646
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,060
If you can't keep that role, you will drop lower than before.

647
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,080
Stop doing things that hurt your position.

648
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,140
Leave the matter of the car as poor maintenance and let it pass quietly.

649
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,420
I'll take care of the press.

650
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,380
All right, I'll do that.

651
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,200
Seeing that the prosecutor took you in while following all protocol,

652
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,680
there mustn't have been too much of a problem at Seopyeong.

653
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,380
Just keep on the prosecutor's good side while being interrogated.

654
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,260
That's important for you personally as well.

655
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,330
Says someone who is on the wrong side

656
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,560
of a Korean prosecutor for good.

657
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,560
How come there's not even one security camera at a rich house?

658
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,390
 Who can it be? 

659
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,130
 Get the car first and scrap it. 

660
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,090
 The father-in-law, who scrapped the car right after the accident. 

661
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,400
 When hurting your head, you should have been thoroughly injured so you couldn't move. 

662
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,910
 Just go and jump onto a car again. 

663
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,590
 The mother-in-law, who is openly upset that I didn't die. 

664
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,650
 - What is this car? 
 - I bought it yesterday. 

665
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,150
 The sister-in-law, who is the owner of the car. 

666
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,820
 - How is my youngest sister-in-law doing? 
 - The big sister-in-law who fed me soybean noodles, 

667
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,550
 to test whether I was indeed Kang Mi Na.. 

668
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:54,130
 I really wish you to be successful. 

669
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,820
 The husband, who would be the legal heir to the fortune if I die. 

670
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,580
 She's crazy! 

671
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,360
 The younger sister-in-law, who might do something from being high. 

672
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,070
 And another person who is suspicious of who I am. 

673
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,960
- The director! 
 - Yes?

674
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,990
- You called me, why are you shocked? 
 - Huh?

675
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,980
How are you feeling?

676
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,330
I'm good.

677
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,900
What are you doing here anyway?

678
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,070
When I came back from grocery shopping with Trang,

679
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,100
there was a puddle of oil on the ground.

680
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,630
Someone did something to that car

681
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,110
in the parking lot here, right?

682
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,490
President Han Seong Wun removed the security cameras,

683
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,860
because of his personal life.

684
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,730
The car is already scrapped.

685
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,220
It'll be hard to find the culprit.

686
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,530
When you make people do kitchen work,

687
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,380
you can tell right away if they are smart or not.

688
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,680
You seem to have more than one trick up your sleeve.

689
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,840
And you must know you are in danger.

690
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,280
Why do you keep staying here?

691
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,270
Why are you telling me all this?

692
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,170
Whose side are you on?

693
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:12,640
There's more in the world than my side and other people's sides.

694
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,240
I'm sorry if I was talking out of line.

695
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,780
What are you doing here?

696
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,220
Why were you with Seung Wuk in that car?

697
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,780
Do you have no conscience? You think  you are in a position to ask me that?

698
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,680
I ended it with So Yi.

699
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,380
- So I can ask, now. 
 - What?

700
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,070
You won't have to be irritated by that kind of problem anymore.

701
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,010
So how about you be more careful of your conduct as well, now?

702
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,700
Conduct, my ass.

703
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,120
What? Now that your wife's circumstances are different, you ended it with that woman?

704
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,340
Look at this. You've betrayed both your faithful wife

705
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,980
and your faithful mistress.

706
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,540
You really are trash, huh?

707
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,560
It's business for both of us.

708
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,260
Why don't we just get along?

709
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,100
You keep mentioning business or whatever.

710
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,080
But for me ...

711
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,730
What's this business with you worth for me?

712
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,980
You know that chaebol family inheritance goes to one person these days.

713
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,760
If they divided it fairly,

714
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,630
and the rest team up, it'll become a waste.

715
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,250
Well, I guess Father won't just give it all to me because of who I am,

716
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,550
but if you and I are a team, we have a chance.

717
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,400
If we have one kid, all the inheritance

718
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,460
will be ours.

719
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,160
Don't you want that?

720
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,520
Wow, I know you're a chaebol's son ...

721
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,790
But still, you are too ignorant of how the world works.

722
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,370
In what world does the parent-in-law give the inheritance to the daughter-in-law?

723
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,110
They all give it to their sons and grandsons.

724
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,120
How dare you try to use me just for your own greed, and call this business?

725
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,960
If not business, what is it then?

726
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,120
- What? 
 - You ...

727
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,950
You're not the same Kang Mi Na as before.

728
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,720
I find you way more attractive now that you have power and some money.

729
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,120
I'm thinking of staying in this room starting today.

730
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,570
A-A-Are you all right?

731
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,400
Are you good at fighting? If not, don't come near me.

732
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,660
I am not sure how strong I am myself.

733
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,770
You could really die.

734
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,600
Do you hate me this much?

735
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,460
How about this? Today's accident,

736
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,320
- is it really because of a defect? 
 - Huh?

737
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,860
Except me, who needs you in this family?

738
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,980
Don't you think you need someone on your side?

739
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,240
I hope you can give it some thought.

740
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,480
The news are going crazy.

741
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,860
I wonder what Yumin Group is doing since they're not blocking them.

742
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,250
Why do you think Yumin is staying put?

743
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,850
As the interest in Seung Wun's wife goes up,

744
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,930
the overall stock of Yumin goes up as well.

745
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,760
Since corruption in the prosecution is also thrown in, people aren't only speaking ill of her either.

746
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,370
Even the scarf and the sunglasses she wore are selling out.

747
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,530
The news talking ill about her is no big deal, in that situation.

748
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,240
What's the hotel loss of the first and second quarter?

749
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,570
The credit rating agency seems to be keeping an eye out.

750
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,670
It's not enough for you to worry.

751
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,930
It's even stranger if you say I shouldn't worry, when the economy is this bad.

752
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,780
Are you ...  using the same method as before to operate the Hanju Hotel?

753
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,460
- I don't know what you mean. 
 - Stop trying to just fill up your own account,

754
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,160
and look at the whole of Hanju Group.

755
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,350
Why do I need to do that? The whole Hanju Group is not mine.

756
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,800
- How dare you! 
 - Out of all your children,

757
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,280
I do the best, but because I'm a daughter, I always feel I come in second.

758
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,100
Do you understand that feeling?

759
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,680
Why does it bother you that I only care about getting my own fill?

760
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,750
You want to give some power to that idiot Seong Wun now that he can benefit from his wife.

761
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,200
But you're worried he and I will battle for the inheritance in the future,

762
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,060
and that my wealth will become my weapon if that happens.

763
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,450
Just as you did in the past.

764
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,580
I'll make sure to put our hotel among the higher rated ones in the business.

765
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,660
Stop rushing me as if you gave me everything, when all you gave was an opportunity.

766
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,520
Give me enough time to do it.

767
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,770
Who is the enemy?

768
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,810
Who is an ally?

769
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,290
Also, in the middle of all this,

770
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,020
I can't even remember where the bathroom is at the  Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office,

771
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,800
and I still have to go to work.

772
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,080
   
   

773
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,460
How could I have no personal life whatsoever?

774
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,910
   

775
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,660
- Hello? 
   - Is that you, Yeon Ju? 

776
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,400
 Yeon Ju, it's me, Uncle! 

777
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,690
 What on earth have you been doing? 

778
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,410
I have an uncle?

779
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,710
Uncle!

780
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,610
Where are you, Uncle?

781
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,090
   

782
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,370
So, what you are saying is ...

783
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:51,900
I became a prosecutor after changing my last name, because having a gangster father might have hindered my career,

784
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,830
and after Grandmother died,

785
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,360
you two, who aren't related to me by blood,

786
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,660
raised me like family after my father went to jail?

787
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,150
Yes.

788
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,120
I was over 20 years old, what do you mean you raised me?

789
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,310
I don't think she lost her memory.

790
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,550
You really are a born prosecutor.

791
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,510
Very sharp.

792
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,480
Who were those gangsters that chased after me that day?

793
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,980
They are, uh, the Samgeori gang from Seopyeong.

794
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,620
You showed up in the middle of their turf war and threw punches around,

795
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,660
- so they almost got rounded up by the police. 
 - Amazing!

796
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,720
I'm a hero who rounded up a gang?

797
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,510
Wow, I'm ...

798
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,270
Wait, what about my father?

799
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,870
When did he get arrested? For what?

800
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,020
My name is Han Seung Wuk.

801
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,610
Do I ... know you?

802
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,120
I'm the son of Han Gang Sik.

803
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,770
The son of the man you killed with arson.

804
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,140
I came to ask about that day.

805
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,450
What can I say n-n-now?

806
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,590
At that time, did you ...

807
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,650
by any chance commit arson because Hanju ordered you to?

808
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,850
I have never even seen

809
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,810
the faces of any high-ranking Hanju people.

810
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,440
If you reveal that you were ordered to do it, your sentence could be reduced.

811
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,580
You seem to think

812
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,620
- I must have been ordered by the Hanju people. 
 - Excuse me?

813
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,440
Even if I say it's not my fault now,

814
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,030
no one would believe me.

815
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,880
Even my daughter doesn't believe me.

816
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,990
You can just speak the truth.

817
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,160
There's no reason people won't believe the truth.

818
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,200
You are naive.

819
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,510
There's no way to persuade people to believe you when they have decided not to.

820
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,600
I have nothing to say,

821
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,400
so please don't come back.

822
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,740
Please open the door.

823
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,340
Well ...

824
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,770
We only know you hated it whenever we brought up your father.

825
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,130
Why don't you go talk to him yourself?

826
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,470
Exactly what happened ...?

827
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,320
Seopyung Penitentiary is not accepting any visitors for Kang Myeong Guk this month.

828
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,890
What happened? It seems he doesn't want visitors.

829
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,460
There's no one else who would visit aside from us, no?

830
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,160
Is he telling us he doesn't want us to come?

831
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,720
Yeon Ju. About your memory ...

832
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,270
Can't your memory be fixed?

833
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,530
It should recover.

834
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:13,660
But it's the first time. The first time someone asks me whether it can be fixed.

835
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,860
I mean ... there's money you owe us.

836
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,900
What? I borrowed money from you guys?

837
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,450
No, no. You didn't borrow.

838
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,930
You gave us money periodically,

839
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:28,420
- but you gave it to us because...
 - You. Came to us.

840
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,310
No matter how much a prosecutor flies or crawls, just because you win in a case

841
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,030
doesn't mean  it is of any help to the victims.

842
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,320
That's why you would receive money from the offender,

843
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,300
give them non-indictment, then we punished them,

844
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,970
and you gave the money to us!

845
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,980
   

846
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,050
 Aren't I pretty much like Jeon Wu Chi*, 
 (Taoist sorcerer during the Joseon dynasty) 

847
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,890
 or Hong Gil Dong*? 
(Korean "Robin Hood") 

848
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:58,620
 I'm like the ace who's unfairly stronger than the others. 

849
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,790
 How could there be such a just person? 

850
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,740
I'm the ultimate righteous person!

851
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,750
So righteous! Oh, hello.

852
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,890
- Isn't she prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju?
- Who?

853
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:28,050
Ah! The person who went on leave to report the corruption within the prosecution? That's her?

854
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,680
But why's she here today?

855
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,890
Could today be the D-Day? Huh?

856
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,930
- D-Day? 
 - D-Day?

857
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,030
D-Day ...

858
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,500
   

859
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,550
Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok ...

860
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,870
I used to work with him,

861
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:53,460
but went missing doing a reconnaissance mission out of loyalty to him, hm?

862
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,180
Congratulations!

863
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,350
 Being a human being means that even when you rule the world,  

864
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:12,690
 a single nightmare can fill you with anxiety for the whole day. 

865
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,920
 I never know when something might happen, and my mind's in hell.  

866
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,760
Huerk!

867
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,800
Pro ... Prosecutor Jo?

868
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:42,930
Pro ... Prosecutor Jo!

869
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,210
Congratulations, Chief District Prosecutor.

870
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:00,890
I mean ... Do you know how worried I've been?

871
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,960
What, what happened?

872
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,880
Don't get me started! I was going to cool my head down during my break, so I went to an island to fish,

873
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,980
but I fell into the sea while fishing, and was bed-ridden for days.

874
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,840
I lost my phone and everything else in the sea, and since that place was so remote,

875
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,520
I couldn't get a signal, or anything else, which prevented me from contacting you.

876
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,730
That place ...

877
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:26,010
Exactly where is that place?

878
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,550
Why are you asking ...?

879
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,490
What do you mean, "why"? I'm planning to search that place first thing if you disappear again.

880
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:40,610
You don't have family members or close friends I could contact. I was at my wits' end, you know?

881
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,120
I even reported you as a missing person!

882
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,290
I apologise. But don't worry.

883
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,370
I'm never going there again, or even close to it.

884
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:56,780
But you see ... Prosecutor Jo, did you perhaps ...

885
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:03,350
talk about stabbing the prosecution in the back or handing a tablet over to the police?

886
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,310
You didn't say such things around here, did you?

887
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,220
Me?

888
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,620
 What a joke. How on earth could you trust a prosecutor? 

889
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,500
 Don't you know what type of people prosecutors are? 

890
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,380
 They're experts at finding the next influential person whose boots they'll lick. 

891
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,910
 So many public prosecutors want to be backed by someone to gain wealth and fame. 

892
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,610
 You can still say this, even after looking at the tablet? 

893
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:28,170
 Who knows? Maybe they were roped into doing something to me by those people. 

894
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,360
I've never done such a thing!

895
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,420
That was probably not me. Someone must have been mistaken.

896
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,690
Ah, is that so?

897
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:41,500
What happened to the reconnaissance mission you started before you went on leave, then? Did you lose him?

898
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,920
Ah, that.

899
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,410
 Reconnaissance mission? 

900
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:49,290
 The deputy chief that you used to work with ... was in a pickle 

901
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,520
  because he lost a perpetrator unfairly a while ago.  

902
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,550
 So you were chasing after that perpetrator without the chief knowing. 

903
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,140
That ... You knew about that?

904
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,100
Ah, what are you talking about?

905
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,750
I heard about it from Section Chief Park after you went missing.

906
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,600
- He told me you went after Lee Bong Sik?
 - Yes.

907
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,400
But it seems the report was false.

908
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,470
I didn't obtain any result.

909
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,860
The report was false?

910
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,570
Yes.

911
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,600
 - I'm asking if someone followed you around. 
 - Who would— 

912
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,330
 Someone did come after me, but if they had caught me and I told them that, would I be here? 

913
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,140
To be honest, Chief, ever since I fell into the water and nearly died,

914
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,230
I haven't fully recovered.

915
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,060
I also keep forgetting things.

916
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:42,090
I'm planning to send in a leave request and rest for a few months.

917
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,580
- You'll go on leave?
 - Yes.

918
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,830
I mean, I think it'll be hard to work like I did before.

919
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,620
Anyway, I'm really sorry for making you worry!

920
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,540
Yes, sure, all right.

921
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,060
I'll be heading in!

922
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,220
- Yes. Watch your health. 
 - Yes, sir.

923
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,690
I can understand her lying about cursing the prosecution ... But why keep it a secret that she saw Lee Bong Sik?

924
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,090
And why go on leave?

925
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,440
What is she up to?

926
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,560
 I got a tip and gave it to you. 

927
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:34,850
 But I can't tell if that tip was right or wrong. 

928
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,400
- Section Chief. 
 - Yes?

929
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,660
I talked to you about a reconnaissance mission before I left on vacation, right?

930
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,260
Ah, right. I forgot about that because I was so busy!

931
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,440
- Was Lee Bong Sik really there?
 - Right.

932
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,790
- This is the naturally expected reaction.
 - What?

933
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,990
I mean, if I left after receiving a tip from someone, the first thing you'd want to know

934
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:59,000
would be whether the tip was correct, whether Lee Bong Sik was really there.

935
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,310
Right.

936
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:05,060
But to ask me whether I lost him ... that's strange.

937
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,540
   

938
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,300
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

939
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,730
Hurry up and use your influence to send me overseas!

940
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,860
Hey. That's why I gave you money last time, so you could leave.

941
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,730
Do you take me for an idiot?

942
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,710
Ah, damn it! That was all in the past!

943
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,540
I've gotten myself in deep shit with those Hanju jerks!

944
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,480
 I really messed up this time.  

945
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,130
 If you help me get out of the country, I'll really live as if I'm dead this time! 

946
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,460
Just help me leave!

947
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,710
Wait. You went to Hanju?

948
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,750
You moron, you're completely insane!

949
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,760
Who did you seek out in Hanju?

950
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,840
Let's meet up first, okay? I'll tell you when we meet.

951
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,300
Fine. I'll see you there later.

952
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,880
Why are there so many— Oh!

953
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,990
I'm sorry.

954
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,190
 Bong Sik. You're Bong Sik, aren't you? 

955
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,310
Are you all right?

956
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,720
 These two ... look exactly the same? 

957
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,260
   

958
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,360
     

959
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,560
 Do you know this? 

960
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,750
 At night, the warmest place in the hospital is in front of the ER. 

961
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,910
 They also have instant coffee there. 

962
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,340
 Because people visit there around the clock. 

963
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:36,490
♫  It's glimmering  ♫

964
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:43,670
♫  The vision of you who holds the light of the setting sun  ♫

965
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,020
   

966
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:50,260
♫  Every single day  ♫

967
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:56,890
♫  Your heart that resembles longing  ♫

968
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:04,590
♫  Reaches me, it draws me to you  ♫

969
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:10,740
♫  All the pain is healed now  ♫

970
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:24,330
♫  I will hold you in my embrace, like the warm breeze   ♫

971
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:35,780
♫  I will run to you, like the sunlight seeping through  ♫

972
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,050
 Miss? Are there any other family members ...?  

973
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:46,050
 There are many papers that will need to be signed at the mortuary, and many decisions to make ... 

974
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,890
 Isn't there an adult you can call? 

975
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,970
 Why don't you change into this and wait, at least? 

976
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:01,470
 Wash your face in the bathroom too. Hm? 

977
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,730
 You need to toughen up if you want to hold your grandma's funeral alone. 

978
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:25,540


979
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,940
   

980
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:44,970
♫  I could disappear from this tedious daily life  ♫

981
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:50,360
♫  and no one would realize  ♫

982
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:55,690
♫  The feeling of being left alone in the middle of the city  ♫

983
01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:00,400
♫  hurts so much  ♫

984
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,020
♫  Nobody knows  ♫

985
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,840
♫  No one talks to me  ♫

986
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,640
   

987
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,620
 Do you know why conning people is a bad thing? 

988
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,690
 It's because people in the most dire situations are the ones who fall into the trap. 

989
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:19,190
 Don't you think you're letting your true colors show too much, now that your situation has changed? 

990
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,870
 Rather than revealing my true self, I'd say I'm back in my right mind.   

991
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,180
 It was Mr. Han Seung Wuk who was driving when you had the accident, wasn't it? 

992
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,510
 I'm completely fine with getting beaten up this much, it's no big deal— 

993
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,760
 It is to me! Stop getting hurt! 

994
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,720
 This nuna, really ... she's seriously getting me concerned. 

995
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,340
 How the hell did I plan to run two jobs, when I'm the center of attention like this? 

996
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,180
 These two ... 

997
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,960
 They look exactly the same?
