1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,810
   

2
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,530


3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,730
Darn hangover.

4
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,710
This damn alcohol...

5
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,380
It must've been a while.

6
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,310
I haven't drunk in a long time, and now I feel like death.

7
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,320
Ouch.

8
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,330
I ... didn't go home?

9
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,580
The household must be in an uproar. Damn.

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,030
I must be crazy! Crazy.

11
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,880
And next? What happened next?

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,460
I think there was something really important.

13
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,300
I didn't make any weird calls or anything, did I?

14
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,120
I don't believe this!

15
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,480
Crazy!

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,980
   

17
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,660
What the heck did I say to this ajumma?

18
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,680
 Do you know who I really am? 

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
 I'm not Kang Mi Na. 

20
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,290
 I'm! Jo! Jo! ... Jo! 

21
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,570
And next? What was next?

22
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,240
What did I say?

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,900
Oh crap!

24
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,990
- What? 
 - Where are you?

25
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,940
Just how much did you drink last night?

26
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,450
What the heck did you say to my mom that she refuses to come out of her room?

27
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,940
And ... anything else strange?

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,320
What else? You're the one who's strange.

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,330
I know it was nuts yesterday due to the list. Still, how can you be out all night?

30
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,200
List?

31
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,720
   

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,150
 The police are yet to release a statement regarding the memo left by the art con man, Lee Bong Sik, 

33
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,530
 who committed suicide while being investigated. 

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,390
 The police has stated there was no 

35
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,670
  police brutality nor violation of human rights. 

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,560
 - Was it suicide or murder? 
 - Who is the prosecutor in charge of the case? 

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,050
 Did you receive special orders from Hanju Group? 
  

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,080
- Excuse  me 
 - Please, step aside.

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,390
Until I find the connection between the chief prosecutor and Hanju,

40
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,150
I can't get kicked out of the house.

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,460
What exactly did I say in my drunken state?

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,210
All right. For now, let's go to work.

43
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,490
It's fine! So what if I don't remember. I'm used to it.

44
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,190
I can absolutely handle it.

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,170
- Last night ... 
 - Wait a minute!

46
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,250
I don't remember what happened last night, so ...

47
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,100
You don't ...

48
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,930
- remember? 
 - No no. I'm not playing dumb, like a coward.

49
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,020
I only remember up until then. But after that ...

50
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,110
- What's "that"? 
 - "That"?

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,320
That is ...

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,510
So ...

53
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,410
Do you remember sprawling on the floor?

54
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,810
- I remember! I do!
 - And getting into your place thanks to me?

55
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,310
 Try to guess it! Guess my passcode. 

56
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,450
That's right. Then ...

57
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,650
 No matter whose daughter you are, or whom you resemble ...  

58
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,480
 Or who has feelings for you ... 

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,310
 Those things don't matter to me. 

60
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,910
 I won't watch anyone take from me what I desire, 

61
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,380
 or the things I want to do anymore. 

62
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,050
I was thankful. So I ...

63
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,160
- Ki ... 
 - Yeah, that!

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,120
I only remember until that part, but that's it.

65
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,180
It's all over the place after that. Well ...

66
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,370
Is that so?

67
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,470
Are you all right?

68
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,140
Why did you drink so much last night? And what's with the call?

69
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,600
I called you too? What did I say?

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,720
You'll regret it if you know. Should I tell you?

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,130
No! Please don't.

72
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,940
Maybe she's still in shock from Lee Bong Sik's death yesterday.

73
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,020
What's with her?

74
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,580
 When I said my memory ended there, 

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,770
 why did he make that expression? 

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,690
 I must be missing something important. What's this weird feeling? 

77
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,240
Hey!

78
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,600
After all the things you said last night, why are you silent today?

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,940
Did I call you as well, Chief?

80
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,120
- What did I say? 
 - You swore at me.

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,200
- Is that all? 
 - What do you mean "Is that all"? You cursed your superior, the Chief Prosecutor.

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,950
Well, I understand last night was rough for you, so I'll let it slide.

83
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,330
Get it together.

84
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,980
Summons Hanju's daughter-in-law, Kang Mi Na, and begin investigating.

85
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,390
What about Lee Bong Sik's case?

86
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,250
You're still on that? I told you to bury it.

87
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,230
Will you risk your entire career just to investigate that one case?

88
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,770
- Did you give up on getting a promotion? 
 - Is a promotion the only thing you can threaten me with?

89
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,280
Yes! I gave up on it!

90
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,290
Lee Bong Sik didn't commit suicide. I'll find the culprit.

91
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,130
Hey!

92
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,770
Don't give up on it. Why are you going so far? Don't give up on your promotion.

93
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,290
Do you want to get sent to the countryside, while you run around finding the culprit or whatever?

94
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,480
You have a bright path ahead of you.

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,610
Just do what you're told, will you?

96
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,300
Look here ...

97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,570
We'll close Lee Bong Sik's case with Kang Mi Na and call it even.

98
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,240
Deal?

99
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,900
You have three days.

100
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,380
I'll take you off your other cases. So within three days,

101
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,510
make sure you call Chairwoman Kang Mi Na

102
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,150
here to the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

103
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,390
The countryside? I'll go if I have to.

104
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,920
I'll resolve quarrels between the grandpas and battle with the ahjummas

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,480
who run off with the money from the local credit unions they operate.

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,580
A life like that won't be so ...

107
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,790
It's bad ... I'd never be able to see the inside of the Central District Office again.

108
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,130
You're an unpredictable, yet very predictable, type of person.

109
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,420
Weirdly, you always sober up with milk after getting hammered.

110
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,580
Yu Jun. Most women

111
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,870
who reject a guy three times in a row,

112
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,170
usually feel bad and treat him nicely,

113
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,740
or keep their distance from him, right?

114
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,450
But I'm different. We'll stay like this for the rest of our lives.

115
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,130
We'll be the left Green Dragon* and right White Tiger* of the Korean prosecution. 
  (*mythical symbols in Feng Shui) 

116
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,650
Don't misunderstand. I'm not here because of you. I'm here because the Chief Prosecutor called me.

117
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,260
Why?

118
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,640
 We're going to dig into Kang Mi Na for real this time. 

119
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,810
 Don't act up and just follow my lead, watching out for my cues, got it? 

120
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,370
 Did you bring the report from when you investigated her? 

121
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,190
 Yes. 

122
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,440
 Let's see ... 
   

123
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,180
 Which one is Kang Mi Na? 

124
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,220
 The one wearing sunglasses. 

125
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,550
 They're all wearing sunglasses, goddammit. 

126
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,420
 The tall woman. 

127
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,970
 She's a head taller than all of them. 

128
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,110
 September 17, 2019. 

129
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,070
 She did volunteer work at a shelter that was suspected of embezzling support funds. 

130
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,320
 What is this? Is this all? 

131
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,420
 - Yes. 
 - Yes? 

132
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,530
 Are you kidding me? 

133
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,830
 You barged into Yumin's chairwoman's office with just a drug tip. 

134
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,220
 But walk in here with just one sheet of paper? 

135
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,430
 Your senior prosecutor is trying so hard to teach you how to fish and this is all you can catch? 

136
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,330
 I don't really like fish. 

137
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,360
 - Get out. 
 - Yes, sir. 

138
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,670
 This punk. I've seen him have cod stew at lunch before. 

139
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,760
He's all fretful because he's in cahoots with Hanju.

140
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,870
No matter how much I look at it, Lee Bong Sik must have died because of them.

141
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,870
What will you do? Will you really summons Kang Mi Na?

142
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,630
- There's nothing to do. The list is fake anyway. 
 - How will you prove that?

143
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,700
Do you know why my identity hasn't been found out yet?

144
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,340
Because the real Kang Mi Na has not shown up.

145
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,680
No matter how well a fake does, when the real deal shows up,

146
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,670
the fake one becomes obvious right away.

147
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,550
I must find the original list made by Lee Bong Sik.

148
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,800
- Do you think it still exists? 
 - I'm certain of it.

149
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,630
That was why the Chief was always afraid of him.

150
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,520
- Also ... 
  You should get me a boat and stow me away,  

151
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,470
 or transfer some money into a Swiss account. 

152
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,470
 As you say, don't you think I need some tangible evidence 

153
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,880
   to decide whether l give that to you? 

154
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,760
He definitely said he would hand it over to me.

155
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,650
Gosh, I'm sure this rascal was connected to someone.

156
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,700
Where on earth do I need to look?

157
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,350
- You asked me if the Samgeori gang stowed Kang Mi Na away like with Lee Bong Sik, right?  
 - Yes.

158
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,250
It doesn't seem as if they did.

159
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,500
I wonder if Lee Bong Sik was acting alone,

160
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,230
and the Samgeori gang was actually connected to people he was trying to hide from.

161
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,460
They were the ones who gave me the drug tip on Kang Mi Na.

162
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,130
Then do you mean that Hanju is linked to the Samgeori gang?

163
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,050
Lee Bong Sik, you rascal. You shouldn't have been that pretentious and butted in.

164
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,770
Serves you right.

165
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,680
Hello, yes, Chairman.

166
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,940
The disclosure of the list was too theatrical.

167
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,650
Exactly. What happened?

168
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,450
It puts me in a bind if you make a move without giving me a sign beforehand.

169
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,900
What do you mean?

170
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,600
The affair happened while I knew nothing about it.

171
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,750
Now people are speculating that we kept the list secret on purpose,

172
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,290
and that Lee Bong Sik had connections in the prosecution ...

173
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,770
There are all these misunderstandings, and now I'm in a very difficult position.

174
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,360
What attitude is this?

175
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,880
- Sorry? 
 - The only thing I did,

176
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,920
was to discreetly indicate that something seemed a bit wrong with Lee Bong Sik's list.

177
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,250
What are you talking about?

178
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,750
I apologize. It seems I was not well informed.

179
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,570
No wonder the prosecution is misunderstood.

180
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,520
Why on earth didn't you disclose the list earlier? Now things are complicated. Goodbye!

181
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,890
He dares to put the blame on me?

182
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,440
So he decides to draw the line very clearly.

183
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,460
Who got me into this hell of a situation?

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,390
What did I say? Didn't I say that the chief prosecutor would act as if he had found our weakness, if we weren't careful?

185
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,170
Father.

186
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,860
Why are you telling me this?

187
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,490
In the end, it's your fault that all this happened, Father.

188
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,780
Be it back then, or now.

189
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,030
 You must brace yourself. 

190
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,150
 In the end, it's your fault that we reached this point.  

191
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,960
   
   

192
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,190
 What is this, a military operation? Why are we suddenly having a board meeting this early in the morning?  

193
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,310
 I regret the trouble caused by the scandal of Chairman Han Gang Sik's embezzlement   

194
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,950
 and accounting fraud, when the merger is right in front of us. 

195
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,410
 However, for the sake of us all, I do not think it sensible  

196
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,020
 that the company's image and stock price continue to suffer 

197
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,710
  from my older brother's personal mistake. 

198
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,020
 Therefore, everything that has happened thus far 

199
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,160
 should be buried right here and now. 

200
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,600
 From now on, I will shoulder all tasks that are related to Chairman Han Gang Sik. 

201
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,760
  In the interest of time, we will take the decision  

202
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,620
 by a show of hands instead of an anonymous vote. Those who agree to the merger, raise your hand.  

203
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,770
 Hanju Hotel's Chairman Han Gang Sik passed away in a fire 

204
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,890
  at Hanju Fashion's factory in Seopyeong yesterday night.  

205
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,540
 Hanju Fashion and Hanju Hotel held an emergency meeting this morning where their merger was decided. 

206
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,200
 Managing Director Han Seong Hye, the new CEO of Hanju Hotel,    
    

207
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,260
 is known to have been a key element in leading the management of Hanju Fashion. 

208
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,850
 A new change in the management is thus expected.  

209
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,230
 This situation is similar to 14 years ago.  

210
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,130
Just like now, an agreement was reached behind the scenes back then too.

211
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,660
Now, you'll pass through the re-evaluation somehow,

212
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,330
and scheme with the accounting firm to get an advantageous estimate of the shares and complete the merger.

213
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,170
What is most similar to that time is that the owner doesn't have a clear conscience. Don't you think?

214
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,180
What is my sister-in-law doing? She didn't even come home last night.

215
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,010
Why are you asking me this?

216
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,480
I think this is a fair question to ask you since you ran out of here as soon as you saw her on the news.

217
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,490
Rumors that her name is on that list have spread all around.

218
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,670
You know that a hotel business is, to a large extent, about its reputation.

219
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,090
It's not really desirable right now for Yumin to stand out.

220
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,770
What about using Hanju as the company's name after the merger?

221
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,220
I also think it'd be best for me to be sole CEO.

222
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:29,020
Since it's come to this, I'll do you a favor and downsize the company for the merger. It'll be a win-win.

223
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,410
What if I reject any of these propositions?

224
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm not asking for your approval, here.

225
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm just letting you know.

226
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,950
If, despite that, you reject this,

227
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,660
things will get more tiring for Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

228
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,090
Are you done talking, then?

229
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,640
Do you want to have a meal together before you go?

230
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,720
I have a prior engagement.

231
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,490
The negotiations with Yumin went well.

232
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,550
We'll take this opportunity to dismiss employees with higher salaries

233
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,390
and those who usually don't listen to orders well.

234
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,160
We'll fire all of them.

235
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,200
What did your superiors say?

236
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,000
What do you think? They said to bring Kang Mi Na over right away.

237
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,990
By the way, you know how Kang Mi Na and I look so alike although we are not related at all?

238
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,850
Then don't you think there could be someone else around who looks like we do?

239
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,740
Can't we find someone?

240
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,860
Please say things that make sense.

241
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,500
Right. Why am I even trying to talk to you?

242
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,260
If you want to whine, go whine to Director Han.

243
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,350
How can I whine to him ...

244
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,840
 All this time, I used to tell you these things.  

245
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,810
 But now I can't tell you anymore.  

246
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,810
Really, I must've been so annoying!

247
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,330
Seriously. Dammit.

248
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,060
Don't tell him if you don't want to. There's no need to act this way.

249
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,200
The car is under Hanju Group's name? Are you sure?

250
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,590
   

251
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,470
All right.

252
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,290
   

253
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,970
What is the link between the punk who doesn't like fish, Jo Yeon Ju, and Hanju?

254
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,560
Right.

255
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,060
I hope this food suits your taste.

256
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,500
Is there anyone who cooks three meals a day, who dislikes dining out?

257
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,680
I love eating out, regardless of what is on the menu.

258
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,590
I wanted to greet you in person last time.

259
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,460
I apologize. The situation at the time prevented me from doing so.

260
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,280
Don't worry. I can imagine you hadn't wanted to set foot in that house ever again.

261
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,870
I couldn't even eat the cockles you sent me ...

262
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,070
because they reminded me of my dad.

263
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,760
I made them so that you would think of your father.

264
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,190
I hope you will return to the US now.

265
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,600
Fourteen years ago,

266
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,560
your father and I were really close.

267
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm aware of that.

268
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,540
But ... I was also close to the current chairman.

269
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,870
Neither of them knew about the other.

270
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,760
You know, some people are like that. They can come and go between two others

271
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,210
without revealing any cards, and they just observe the situation.

272
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,520
Do you mean something like Switzerland? Neutrality?

273
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,670
It's more like a double agent.

274
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,430
Back then, I thought I had no choice since I was living in their home.

275
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,700
But I've been feeling indebted to you ever since your father passed away like that.

276
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,270
I wonder if some things happened because of what I said or did.

277
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,900
Since then, I haven't stood on anyone's side.

278
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,730
It couldn't have been 100% your fault.

279
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,690
So I'd like it if you didn't think that way.

280
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,070
It's something I heard from someone.

281
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,200
Thank you.

282
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:36,540
However, it seems like Chairman Han still thinks I'm his spy.

283
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,440
That's also why I'm seeing you today. He asked me.

284
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,440
He is entirely capable of letting go of Director Han Seong Hye

285
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,760
in order to hold hands with you. He's that sort of person.

286
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:56,590
I think he is curious about what you'd think of a merger in your favor.

287
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,230
- I'm—
 - No.

288
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,480
Don't tell me anything.

289
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,380
I'd have to relay whatever you say.

290
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,380
I'll tell him that I heard nothing from you.

291
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
This is tasty.

292
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,340
Michelin isn't the absolute standard, but it's not a bad idea to use it as a reference.

293
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,470
That's right. If they had found out who I was, Mi Na's mother-in-law would already be throwing a fit.

294
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,720
Since she's been silent until now, I'll assume I haven't been caught.

295
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,430
Wait, no ... She might be trying to keep me off guard just to strike better.

296
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,910
What if there are a bunch of police officers waiting for me inside?

297
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,610
She isn't such a meticulous person, though.

298
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,970
I drank too much last night and seem to have made a mistake.

299
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,240
So did you sleep in your apartment in front the Prosecutors' Office?

300
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,950
Pardon?

301
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,280
Why are you so shocked?

302
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,610
Rumor says you'll be summonsed again.

303
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,730
Since you're being called there so frequently,

304
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,500
I figured you rented an apartment in front of the place.

305
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,270
Shouldn't you start looking for one now?

306
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,590
 Hello, Mother-in-law. It's me. 

307
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,490
 How could you do this to me? 

308
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,050
 I knew as soon as you made me prepare breakfast at 5 a.m., 

309
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,210
 that you people were awful. 

310
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,770
 But do you have to make me suffer this much? 

311
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,470
 I see you're really losing your mind because of the list. 

312
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,950
 Serves you right. 

313
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,790
 Listen to this ajumma! You're laughing? Really? 

314
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,000
 Ajumma, let's see how much longer you'll be laughing! 

315
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,250
 l'll reveal everything! 

316
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,930
 Your weakness that no one knows about, 

317
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,700
 it's all in my hand! 

318
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,190
What? Did you really call me "ajumma"?

319
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,260
You must be crazy.

320
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,630
 Do you know who I really am? l'm not Kang Mi Na. 

321
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,160
 l'm! Jo ...  

322
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,010
 Jo ... Jo ...  

323
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,480
 What are you doing? Stop— 

324
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,290
 l'm a Joseon* queen! 
 (Ancient Korean dynasty) 

325
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,580
 l'm a Joseon queen! Mother of the na—! 

326
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,970
 You're completely out of your mind. 

327
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,330
 Hey! How dare you submit me to this drunken outburst? 

328
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,020
 Aish! The call was cut off. 

329
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,740
 Why did you stop me talking to her? 

330
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,220
l have a feeling that that wasn't the end.

331
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,210
What are you mumbling about?

332
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,060
Hey. Last night, you said you had damaging information about me. What is it?

333
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,460
 l don't want to remember. 

334
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,960
 No ... l must. 

335
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,150
 But l really don't want to ... No ... 

336
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,300
Hey! l'm talking!

337
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,580
What has she found out about me now?

338
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,650
There are several things I'm uneasy about.

339
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:42,190
 I can't believe that even today, some grandfathers still promise their grandchildren in marriage.  

340
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,250
 That's funny, isn't it? 

341
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,420
 You most likely know that l'm still mourning. 

342
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,170
 That's why l was uncomfortable coming here. 

343
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,400
 My family must have pressured you. 

344
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,900
 No. Had Grandpa not shown me your picture, then that would have been the case. 

345
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,200
 But after l saw your picture, l knew I'd like to meet you. 

346
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,750
 Are you feeling all right now? 

347
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,060
 - Sorry? 
 - On the day my father passed away, 

348
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,980
 l heard you were at the hospital  because something unfortunate happened. 

349
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,730
  Instead of successfully dying by suicide one day, after behaving uselessly all your life,  

350
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,090
 why don't you do something of value for our family, for once? 

351
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:40,850
 So that he can grow his business, the old man at Hanju Group wants to become related to us by marriage.  

352
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,190
 With risk management in mind, it's not a bad offer for us. 

353
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,380
 As for me, I'd be glad to have you  of my sight, 

354
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,760
 and wouldn't it suit you to leave my house as soon as possible, too? 

355
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,840
 l'd rather not talk about that. 

356
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,950
 l want to forget what happened that day. 

357
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,400
 l understand. 

358
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,440
 As you said, when l use this telescope  

359
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,200
 and see how big the universe is, 

360
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,180
 it really makes me feel like my worries are nothing. 

361
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,010
 l thought you'd like it too. 

362
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,860
 Me? 

363
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,920
 Did l say anything like that? 

364
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,310
 How do I use it? 

365
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,340
 Well ... look here. 

366
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,980
- Restructuring is out of the question! 
 -  Out of the question! Out of the question! 

367
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,110
- Hanju Group, cancel the merger! 
  - Cancel it! Cancel it! 

368
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,280
If you transfer management, you should transfer the employees too!

369
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,470
- Why won't you? 
 - Restructuring is out of the question!

370
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,610
- Hanju Group, cancel the merger! 
  - Cancel it! Cancel it! 

371
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,840
- Guarantee the employees will stay!  
  - Guarantee it! Guarantee it! 

372
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,690
- Guarantee it! 
  - Guarantee it! 

373
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,840
Guarantee it! 
  - Guarantee it! Guarantee it! 

374
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,190
Guarantee it!

375
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,740
Managing Director.

376
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,860
- What is she doing?
- She's kneeling down. Dang!

377
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,410
Dear members of the Hanju Hotel family,

378
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,360
I'm sure that many of you ...

379
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,130
probably remember me from 20 years ago.

380
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,620
Hanju Hotel is a place I built together with you.

381
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,200
While studying abroad, I came back every vacation

382
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,330
to wash dishes in the kitchen, and serve tables at every event.

383
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,680
Those of you who were with me when I was washing dishes

384
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,400
are all here,

385
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,240
so why wouldn't I want to keep going together with you?

386
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,320
But as you know,

387
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,910
our Hanju is on the side of being taken over

388
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,780
and Yumin tried to find fault with us and said we need a re-evaluation,

389
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,660
and now they even requested a large-scale restructuring.

390
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm so sorry towards all of you,

391
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,130
and I don't know what to say ...

392
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,720
Then it was the Yumin side that one-sidedly requested restructuring and not you?

393
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,240
It hurts my ego, but that's the truth.

394
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,770
Yumin's Chairwoman Kang Mi Na is giving orders behind the scenes without even appearing in person,

395
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,840
so what can I ...

396
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,450
Isn't that an excuse? Aren't you related to Yumin's chairwoman?

397
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,090
I think Yumin's Chairwoman Kang Mi Na

398
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,280
has different ideas.

399
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm really sorry.

400
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh my, Managing Director, why would you go so far as to kneel?

401
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,430
Doing this here isn't going to get anything done. Am I right?

402
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,950
Shouldn't we go to Yumin Group?

403
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,240
- What do you think? 
 - This won't work.

404
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,800
- Let's all go to Yumin Hotel! 
  - Let's go! Let's go! 

405
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,910
- Let's go! 
- Hurry up!

406
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,810
- Pack up the banners quickly! 
- Quickly!

407
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,080
Hey, hurry up...

408
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,820
- Cancel the restructuring! 
  - Cancel it! Cancel it! 
   

409
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,600
- Give up the merger!
- Huh?

410
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,680
What is that?

411
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,120
Why are they looking for Kang Mi Na?

412
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,370
Stop making it obvious that you're scared.

413
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,680
They're saying they're protesting so the chairwoman had better come out for negotiation.

414
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
I got scared.

415
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,230
But why would they want Chairwoman Kang Mi Na?

416
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,770
- What do they want to talk about?
 - I'm wondering, too.

417
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,460
Stop showing interest in Hanju Hotel! 
    

418
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,690
They aren't even Yumin Hotel employees.

419
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,370
There might still be some reporters.

420
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,890
It wouldn't be a good idea to talk to them because the media might take pictures of you.

421
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,800
- Let's just pass by.
- They wouldn't block me or anything, would they?

422
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,030
Since you couldn't go to work yesterday, it'd be bad if you miss work again today.

423
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,290
It's a tough situation.

424
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,220
How about if I cover up a little,

425
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,000
so they can't tell I'm Kang Mi Na?

426
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,230
- How's this?
 - You've got to wear something on your face.

427
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,240
- Then this.
- Try it. Good. Good.

428
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,210
Okay.

429
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,500
- Cancel the merger! 
  - Cancel it! Cancel it! 

430
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,830
- Cancel the acquisition that kills the workers! 
  - Cancel it! Cancel it! 

431
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,540
Stop showing interest 
    

432
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,790
- in Hanju Hotel ... 
- There is Kang Mi Na right there!

433
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,170
- Oh, how did he know?
- What are we going to do?

434
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,050
I didn't want to use this method. In the Republic of Korea,

435
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,210
there are two ways to get out of a bad situation like this. Money or a loud voice.

436
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,050
- Do you plan on using money?
 - No. Voice.

437
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,540
 - Say something! 
- Cancel the merger!
- Answer us! 

438
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,990
Fire!

439
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,480
Let's go! Hurry!

440
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,670
Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, why are you running away like a coward?

441
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,820
- Why?! 
- Why are you always hiding behind the scene?

442
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm not deliberately trying to hide from you.

443
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,220
It's because I have a situation.

444
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,530
- We're also in a tough situation! 
 - That's not it! Wait—

445
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,880
I mean, I actually have so much to say.

446
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,830
If you're about ready,

447
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,250
let's go to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. It doesn't look like we'll make it to work today.

448
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,210
Why would Hanju employees throw eggs at me?

449
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,980
Could Hanju be behind this?

450
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,400
I can't even sue them or anything. Seriously.

451
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,690
But ...

452
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,220
But what?

453
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,870
He sued.

454
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,900
Who did?

455
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,170
 What? He's still at the police station? 

456
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,350
 I said put him under prosecution already! 

457
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,560
 What an arrogant jerk. 

458
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,320
 How dare he throw something at my wife? Eggs? 

459
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,080
 I'll make sure that rascal rots in prison for the rest of his life 

460
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,720
 so he can't even look at a quail egg ever again! I'm so enraged! 

461
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,080
That guy, seriously. Why did he suddenly change his stance?

462
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,200
He's really no help whatsoever.

463
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,730
Assaults fall under the jurisdiction of the police anyway,

464
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,990
so it'll take some time for the case to reach the prosecution.

465
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,540
Yes, Office Manager.

466
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,490
- Prosecutor, you need to  come in quickly. 
 - Why?

467
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,590
The person who threw eggs at Kang Mi Na in a protest has been sent to us for assault.

468
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,850
But Kang Mi Na's husband is pestering the chief, so we need to handle it by today.

469
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,020
You're the only one in the division who is free enough to take it.

470
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,460
I mean, if she gets hurt somehow

471
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,490
it won't do us any good either.

472
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,300
If this isn't the most loving husband in the world right here.

473
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,880
She just got hit by a few raw eggs.

474
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,550
Don't you think you've really allied yourself with the wrong person?

475
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,570
It doesn't look like it's about an alliance right now.

476
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,850
- What do you mean? 
 - Think about it.

477
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,860
In the past, mom could beat her with eggs as if it was a full-body massage, and he wouldn't even react.

478
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,420
Don't tell me you like her for real?

479
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,370
Not at all! What? That's nonsense.

480
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,100
Who likes whom? I definitely don't.

481
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,160
Seeing the fuss he makes about it,

482
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,510
they'll be making a baby anytime soon.

483
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,240
Sister-in-law isn't young anymore,

484
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,950
and I don't think she intends to have any.

485
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,250
You already have a grandchild in Seon Wu.

486
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,760
Age? What a joke. Hey.

487
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,060
After the accident last time, the hospital director ran every test possible including an ovarian function test,

488
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,190
and he said her ovaries were way too healthy.

489
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,140
Really?

490
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,030
But last time for sure ...

491
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,270
 I'm sterile. 

492
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,400
 - What? 
 - So, 

493
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,860
 there's nothing for you to worry about. 

494
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,050
 As long as he is with me, he won't have  ... 

495
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,180
 any direct second generation heir. 

496
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,990
What?

497
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,390
It's nothing.

498
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,310
Where did you get the guts to attack the chairwoman of a big conglomerate?

499
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,490
You thought that even though the world is trash,

500
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,100
even chaebols should have some common sense, right?

501
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,010
But you see, conglomerate chairmen can skip that common sense

502
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,160
and drag you to the Central District Prosecutors' Office in less than half a day.

503
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,250
Your hit was a superb bull's eye. What an impressive curveball.

504
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,650
It's not easy to have a good grip on an egg,

505
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,630
but you hit her square on the forehead.

506
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,370
- Did you play baseball in your youth? 
 - Yes, a bit during high school.

507
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,450
Look here! This is a criminal assault.

508
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,070
Under Article 260 of the penal code, physical assault can get you sentenced

509
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,680
to two years in prison or a fine up to five million won  (≈ $4,200) .

510
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,210
How could I get fined 5 million won just for throwing an egg?

511
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,650
You ...! Have you tried getting hit by an egg?

512
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,910
It was so humiliating and degrading!

513
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,150
Pardon?

514
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,100
Of course, I've never been hit either.

515
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,770
But as a human, shouldn't you have that much sympathy for others?

516
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,980
Assault can't be prosecuted without the victim's will. You won't be punished if they don't want it.

517
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,200
So if you apologize to Chairwoman Kang Mi Na right here, I'll let her know and we'll end this. Okay?

518
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
- I won't. 
 - Why not?

519
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,190
I can't apologize to a woman like her.

520
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,920
What did that woman do?

521
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,780
She had no idea you were dismissed, you know.

522
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,040
Why would you come all the way to Yumin Group to throw eggs when it's not even your company?

523
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,590
Did you receive orders?

524
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,330
It's Yumin who's acting behind the scenes. I heard they forced a large-scale restructuring.

525
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,300
What? Who said that?

526
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,530
Our managing director, Ms. Han Seong Hye.

527
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,590
Heol! You actually believe that woman?

528
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,940
Our managing director went as far as to kneel and to apologize for being unable to take us with her.

529
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,620
She respects and loves the employees so much. Why wouldn't we trust her?

530
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,300
Heol! Is getting on her knees such a big deal?

531
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,580
After getting an upset stomach from drinking, I knelt before my toilet yesterday morning.

532
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,850
Does that mean I respect and love my toilet, then?

533
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,760
What's this comparison? In any case, I feel too wronged to apologize.

534
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,290
She's been playing around all her life and became the owner due to luck.

535
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,370
So when she tells us to leave, do we have to say "Yes, Madam" and go?

536
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,480
I wouldn't go this far if my daughter were healthy.

537
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,090
She needs to go to the hospital twice a week for dialysis.

538
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,350
If I get fired, I will lose our medical insurance. I can't think straight in this situation.

539
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:02,410
Honestly, shouldn't the police or the prosecutors help people like us?

540
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,210
You only slap the man who already feels like crying. This is too mean.

541
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,970
Wh-What is it?

542
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,150
Who said I'd slap the man who feels like crying?

543
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,980
With my character, it's the bad person who gets slapped across the face.

544
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,670
Prosecutor!

545
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,920
Did you know about the large-scale restructuring enforced before the merger with Hanju Hotel?

546
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,300
I did hear about it.

547
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,000
If they want to fire people, the right thing to do is fire the decision-makers, starting with the owner.

548
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,550
Why fire only those who do as told? Will you proceed with the merger this way?

549
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,540
This isn't such a simple issue.

550
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,750
Hanju Hotel is also the company that my father used to manage.

551
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,840
Doing the merger and returning Hanju Hotel's management to how it should be may be more important—

552
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,570
I didn't want to act like the ruler of someone else's company, so I tried to avoid it,

553
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,320
but this is really going too far.

554
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,350
As long as you get Hanju Hotel back, don't you care what becomes of its employees?

555
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,540
For prosecutors, right and wrong may be a priority, but it's different for businesses.

556
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,480
Keeping the company running might actually be better for Yumin employees.

557
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,860
I see you're no different from the Hanju family at all.

558
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,590
Don't tell me your goal is solely to get Hanju Hotel back?

559
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,850
How is this different from Han Seong Hye, who kneels for union members

560
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,150
but ruthlessly fires them behind their backs?

561
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,720
It's difficult for us to reject or request anything.

562
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,110
What if Hanju and the prosecution scheme to send Chairwoman Kang Mi Na to prison?

563
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,530
You're right. I'm in no position to make such a request.

564
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,130
I crossed the line again. I'm sorry for wasting your time.

565
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,240
Is Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju all right after getting hit by those eggs?

566
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,770
Didn't you say you were going to see her?

567
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,830
Are you going to talk through me even though you meet, now?

568
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,850
It's because she never tells me about having a hard time.

569
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,780
She has bigger fish to fry right now. Getting hit by a few eggs is not the problem.

570
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,530
The Central District Prosecutors' Office is asking her to bring in Kang Mi Na.

571
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,230
And if she doesn't summons her, she'll likely be sent to the countryside.

572
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,890
And since Lee Bong Sik died, there's no one left who can say the list is fake.

573
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,120
And I guess she can't tell you those things like she used to.

574
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,740
Isn't it so strange, Ajussi?

575
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,360
I know that it's not her,

576
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,070
but I keep getting the feelings I used to have in the past when I looked at her.

577
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,760
You just fell in love with someone else. Why does it seem so complicated to you?

578
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,100
I said to cut ties to make things easier for you, but this is too uncomfortable for me.

579
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,590
Just do things by following your heart.

580
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,360
Follow my heart? I'm not sure it's all right for me to do that.

581
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,800
For someone who lived in the US, you talk like you've lived during the Gabo reforms*. 
  (1894-1896) 

582
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,170
Listen. You only know if an automatic door opens or not

583
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,940
once you stand in front of it.

584
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,490
And to make the needle of a compass move, you have to move around.

585
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,740
You have to do something to know whether it'll work or not.

586
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,930
What exactly do you want to do?

587
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,760
Last time, you left as if you'd never come and see me again.

588
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,240
What brought you all the way here?

589
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,640
I heard that you were capable of holding my hand

590
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,620
instead of Managing Director Han Seong Hye's.

591
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,920
I thought you took after your father,

592
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,330
but I see that you also have a level-headed side.

593
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:36,000
Yes. I've realized that whether Managing Director Han Seong Hye holds a favorable position in the merger or not,

594
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,030
it won't concern you in any way.

595
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,240
I knew you were like this with your siblings, but not with your children as well.

596
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,630
This is an agreement for transfer of shares.

597
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,930
It's for ten percent of Yumin Electronics, which I possess.

598
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,870
As you know, we at Yumin are in trouble because of Lee Bong Sik's list.

599
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,250
I thought you'd be able to take action regarding it.

600
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,810
Oh, and also ... I have one small condition relating to the merger.

601
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,070
I'm sure you don't mind, do you?

602
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,920
This is good. In that case, I think I also have one condition.

603
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,850
Halt the process of Kang Mi Na's summons?

604
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,190
   

605
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,530
Is this a game of "White flag, Blue flag"*? You can't change your mind so many times! 
  (*a game of speed and reflexes) 

606
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,050
Isn't that what you wanted?

607
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,990
What is the reason though?

608
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,790
Wouldn't you know best

609
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,960
about that reason?

610
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,520
Pardon?

611
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,070
I saw you getting into Hanju Group's car.

612
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,790
You're absent from your office at the drop of a hat, these days.

613
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:10,060
And I thought there were more than a few strange things in your behavior ...

614
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,410
Ahn Yu Jun brought this to me.

615
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,730
Should I tell you why you both of you can't manage

616
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,170
to make Chairwoman Kang Mi Na come in?

617
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,550
It's because ...

618
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,700
you ...

619
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,020
   

620
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,380
received a car from Hanju Group.

621
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,650
How could you already get yourself a sponsor?

622
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,690
What kind of deal did you do with Hanju Group? Did they contact you directly?

623
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,080
Then you should've reported that to me.

624
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,140
Yeon Ju, I am also a prosecutor.

625
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,250
If you accept things like this without even reporting it to me,

626
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,790
I have no choice but to turn into a thug.

627
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,430
- Chief District Prosecutor— 
 - Yes, I am the Chief Prosecutor of the Central District Office!

628
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:18,530
My insight and intuition are the major reasons

629
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,940
why I have made it this far!

630
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,190
What will happen to you? With that crappy intuition of yours,

631
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,160
how will you survive in this organization that is as ruthless as a bowl of chilies?

632
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,460
- Then what about the car? 
 - Don't accuse an innocent.

633
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,150
Have you never accepted a ride in your entire life as a prosecutor?

634
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,310
Why are you suddenly acting like you're whiter than white?

635
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,560
This is so unlike you.

636
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,440
Thank goodness he's got a crappy instinct. It could have been worse.

637
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,940
By the way, what's with Hanju all of a sudden?

638
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,580
   

639
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,530
 This afternoon, Hanju Hotel and Yumin Hotel signed a merger. 

640
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,800
 They announced the joint corporation will be established under the name of Hanju Hotel. 

641
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,300
 Managing Director Han Seong Hye will join hands 

642
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,110
 with Han Seong Wun, second son of Chairman Han Yeong Sik. 

643
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,520
 He has not been in the management team until now. 

644
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,870
 They have been appointed as co-CEOs of the new Hanju Hotel. 

645
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,510
 It is anticipated that they will both begin to actively compete 

646
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,060
  over the succession of the group ... 

647
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,040
He chose well with whom to align.

648
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,590
Mom, didn't you know either?

649
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,740
Hey, what did I say to  Seong Wun earlier?

650
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,060
- Do you think he was badly offended?
 - You didn't say much earlier.

651
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,940
But you're always throwing biting remarks at him, except for earlier.

652
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,460
I'm sure he was offended every day.

653
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,690
What should I do?

654
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,450
What's going to happen to my Seon Wu now?

655
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,380
- Oh no ... 
 - Hey.

656
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,680
Stop making so much fuss over nothing.

657
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,040
It's not as if he's going to inherit the entire company now.

658
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,200
He's just a co-CEO of the hotel, nothing more.

659
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,820
Let's go.

660
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,710
- Mom.
 - Mother.

661
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,680
 Both Hotels have stated that there will be no restructuring  

662
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,700
 and have firmly denied all rumors of a large-scale staff cutback. 

663
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,420
 There are no special conditions 

664
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,690
 except for the fact that all employees must be able to stay in the workplace. 

665
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:27,520
 Those with overlapping tasks will be sent to a new business team. 

666
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,160
 This was all done at the insistent request of Managing Director Han Seong Hye. 

667
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,080
 I'd like to express my sincere gratitude and respect 

668
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,080
 to Managing Director Han Seong Hye, 

669
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,780
 who insisted on the transfer of the entire staff body. 

670
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:54,400
You changed the terms of the merger without even telling me.

671
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,420
- And what's going on with Seong Wun? 
 - Well, Seung Wuk

672
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,350
offered to transfer ten percent

673
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,330
of his Yumin shares to us.

674
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,090
It means we'll obtain the shares

675
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:09,610
while also reducing Seung Wuk's power in Yumin,

676
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,580
so I don't think the board has any reason to object to it.

677
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,820
Well, I think we're gaining even more

678
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,700
than what we had initially planned. So, just sign it.

679
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,040
But why would he

680
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,700
do all this? For Sister-in-law?

681
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,980
Do we need to know that?

682
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,990
Everyone is competing for more shares these days,

683
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,150
and this is not a losing deal to us.

684
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,060
And if he's destroying himself because of insignificant personal feelings,

685
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,040
then it's even better for us.

686
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,230
Besides, I can appoint whom I want to run my affiliate company.

687
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,870
Should you be angry like this?

688
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,030
Why are you acting as if you own Hanju Group?

689
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,320
What kind of deal did Mr. Han Seung Wuk do with them?

690
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,680
The summons got canceled,

691
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,710
and the people from the union are completely gone too.

692
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,550
Why don't you ask him?

693
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,250
But what's this?

694
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,320
Stock transfer approval request?

695
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,840
Why are stocks suddenly being transferred to Hanju Group?

696
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,290
   

697
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,020
It seems like Director Han is transferring his stocks to Hanju Group.

698
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,220
It seems the board approved it immediately,

699
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,920
and sent it in for your approval.

700
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,140
- Where is he now?
 - He must be announcing the merger.

701
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,080
Is it over?

702
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,960
 I have memories of Hanju Hotel from when my father would take me to look for a site 

703
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,790
 where to establish it at the time of its foundation. 

704
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,520
 Because of this, I have a special connection to the hotel. 

705
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,010
 My father would often quote 

706
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,800
 the words of an American human rights activist. 

707
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,190
 "Walls turned sideways are bridges." 

708
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,150
  "Walls turned sideways are bridges." 

709
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,940
Now, the wall between Yumin and Hanju is being turned sideways to become a bridge.

710
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,240
The ceremony should be over by now, right?

711
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,900
Even if the ceremony ended, there's usually a lengthy after-party.

712
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,710
He might still be at the hotel.

713
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,070
Thank you.

714
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,910
   

715
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:25,020
Next, let's hear from the CEO of Hanju Hotel about its new start.

716
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,860
I am the CEO of Hanju Hotel,

717
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,180
Han Seong Wun.

718
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,700
To keep up with 2021 trends, Hanju Hotel will show an even more

719
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,700
youthful side and lead the way.

720
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,900
I will strive to make this happen.

721
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,960
   

722
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,010
Did you hand over your stocks to Hanju?

723
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,270
Why? That's such a waste.

724
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,460
You said you couldn't do anything because you didn't know how I was feeling. So why?

725
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,460
You remembered that?

726
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,850
  I won't leave when told to, or let others take what's mine.  

727
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,720
 I came to Korea after deciding to stop doing that. 

728
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,170
 No matter whose daughter you are, or whom you resemble ...  

729
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,030
 Or who has feelings for you ... 

730
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,310
 Those things don't matter to me. 

731
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,100
 I won't watch anyone take from me what I desire,  

732
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,600
 or the things I want to do anymore. 

733
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,340
♫  I will hold you in my embrace  ♫

734
00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:00,710
♫   like the warm breeze  ♫

735
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:05,070
♫  I will run to you,   ♫

736
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,770
♫  like the sunlight  ♫

737
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:14,680
♫   seeping through  ♫

738
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:21,760
♫  I will hold you in my embrace,   ♫

739
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,600
♫  like the natural ...  ♫

740
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,370
 You—! 

741
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:30,050
 How could you break into someone's house and kiss me as you please? 

742
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,510
 You did it. 

743
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,030
 My first kiss! 

744
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,190
 Your drunken antics are seriously incredible. 

745
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,620
 You would have spent the entire night outside if I hadn't helped you in. 

746
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,250
 Please sober up, all right? 

747
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,100
 My first kiss ... 

748
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,700
 There's water in the fridge, right? 

749
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,560
 To reveal the chief's corruption, 

750
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,350
  I worked my butt off all this time ... 

751
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,500
  But because of Hanju, everything is ruined! 

752
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,120
  Seriously, the more I think about them ... 

753
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,900
 Listen to this ajumma! You're laughing? Really? 

754
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,530
 Ajumma, let's see how much longer you'll be laughing! 

755
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,630
 You totally lost your mind. 

756
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,800
 I'll reveal everything! 

757
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,580
 Your weakness that no one knows about. 

758
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,930
 It's all in my hand! 

759
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,400
 Do you know who I really am? 

760
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,550
  I'm not Kang Mi Na. 

761
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,360
 I'm Jo ... Jo ...  

762
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,480
 Jo! 

763
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,130
 What are you doing? Stop— 

764
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,600
 l'm a Joseon queen!  

765
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,280
 Hey! How dare you submit me to this drunken outburst? 

766
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,400
 The call was cut off. 

767
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,500
 Why did you stop me talking to her? 

768
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,720
 Look. 

769
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,900
 Right now, I have ... 

770
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,540
 messed everything up in so many ways ... 

771
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,990
 but do you know what has been the worst of it all?  

772
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,150
 It's the fact that all this time,  

773
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,910
 I used to tell you these things.  

774
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:31,050
 But now I can't tell you anymore.  

775
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,610
 Why, you ask? 

776
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,520
 Because I've come to like you. 

777
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:45,660
 But because of that guy Kang Myeong Guk, 

778
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,210
 your father passed away. 

779
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,730
 So why do you stop me from talking? 

780
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,370
 No wonder I drink. 

781
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:35,020
   

782
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,470
 Just why do you continue to take the milk delivery if you don't even drink it? 

783
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,370
 You also had a pile of milk cartons stacked by your door before. 

784
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,100
 I do drink milk. 

785
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,360
 Sporadically... when I need to calm down.  

786
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,260
 Do you think milk is a kind of tranquilizer? 

787
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,100
 In the past, when my father was looking for possible sites for Hanju Hotel, 

788
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,980
 he took me along for the travel experience. 

789
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,270
 There was this thing he often told me. 

790
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,990
 Apparently some human-rights activist said it? 

791
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,160
 "Walls turned sideways are bridges." 

792
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,410
 Even if the wall falls down, it's not the end, because you can just step on it to cross over. 

793
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,830
 There will be other ways. 

794
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,180
 Though my feelings haven't changed, I don't know how you feel. 

795
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,930
 So it's truly difficult to either console you 

796
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,000
 or get closer to you. 

797
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,490
 I can't do anything ... 

798
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,910
 I'll get going.  

799
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,750
 Sleep well. 

800
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,720
 I might have 

801
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,890
 heard something really important just now ... 

802
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,790
What about those words?

803
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,660
Fourteen years ago,

804
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,480
I heard the exact same thing from someone.

805
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,240
 Would you like to drink this? 

806
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,030
 There's something my father used to tell me often. 

807
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:38,130
 He said it's something a human-rights activist has said. 

808
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:42,190
 The quote says, "Walls turned sideways are bridges." 

809
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,390
 When tomorrow morning comes, my father may be revealed as 

810
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,560
 a different person than the one I thought he was. 

811
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,360
 My father has always felt 

812
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,670
 like a strong wall that I could rely on. 

813
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,830
 It will be different now. 

814
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,310
 Still, I believe he will become that bridge for me in some way. 

815
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,120
 A bridge that ... 

816
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,400
 will lead me to a different world than the one I came from. 

817
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,630
 I don't think I can tell 

818
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,620
 this story to just anyone, because it sounds corny. 

819
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,220
 Please forget it now that you've heard it. 

820
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,060
 Thank you ... 

821
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,690
 for today. 

822
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:15,790
That person then was you, Han Seung Wuk, right?

823
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,170
Are you saying that person wasn't Mi Na

824
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,150
but you, Jo Yeon Ju?

825
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,360
It was me.

826
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,750
That day, I also lost the grandmother whom I had relied upon all my life.

827
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,140
Before my grandmother passed away,

828
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:17,790
she said she didn't want me to be unable to do anything in the future because she was gone.

829
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,560
Back then, I didn't even understand what that meant.

830
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,650
After hearing your story,

831
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,270
I also thought I should cross over

832
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,970
to another world through my grandmother.

833
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,840
That is why I haven't forgotten what you said.

834
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:42,920
It's possible that I was able to come this far thanks to your story.

835
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,950
I understand it all now.

836
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,880
The Mi Na I liked

837
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,600
was the person from that night.

838
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,060
But the person I am now

839
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,130
is not the Kang Mi Na from then.

840
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,690
Are you really sure that no matter who I am, or whose daughter I may be,

841
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,730
you don't care?

842
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,550
I am no longer that young man from back then either.

843
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,030
Usually, when you get to know someone truly,

844
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:21,050
that person turns out to be completely different from what you initially thought.

845
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:25,190
And... the real love

846
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,280
starts from that moment.

847
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,310
♫  A new me everyday  ♫

848
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,470
♫  I'm probably  ♫

849
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:43,490
♫   not the person   ♫

850
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:46,760
♫   everyone wished for  ♫

851
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,940
♫  Someday  ♫

852
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,560
♫  I want to become the light  ♫

853
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,200
♫  Somewhere  ♫

854
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,350
♫  I want to find myself  ♫

855
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:09,110
♫  One day  ♫ 
♫  If the day comes when I confront my feelings   ♫

856
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:16,020
♫  I will surely cry, hugging myself in my own embrace  ♫

857
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:23,240
♫  Someday, Someday  ♫

858
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:46,590


859
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,720
   

860
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,570
 Especially that two-week diagnosis must be reviewed carefully. 

861
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:57,250
 Because there are more and more cases where it's been judged as assault rather than injury. 

862
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,700
 Hey Yu Jun, did I tell you this? 

863
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,270
 The two-week doctor's diagnosis needs to be scrutinized carefully. 

864
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:06,590
 Because there are more and more cases where it's been judged as assault rather than injury. 

865
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:09,050
 - Hey, Yu Jun. 
 - Yes.
 - Did I tell you this? 

866
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,320
 The two-week diagnosis has to be scrutinized carefully, because these days 

867
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,960
- it's being judged as assault rather than injury more and more. 
 - Okay. I got it.

868
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,800
 Wake up, Man! I told you. 

869
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,690
 That two-week doctor's diagnosis really has to be carefully scrutinized. 

870
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,800
 Yu Jun. Hey, Yu Jun! Yu Jun? 

871
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,180
 Yeon Ju missed you this much. 

872
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:31,140
 My heart is thump-thump-thumping away, I tell you. 

873
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,990
 Yeon Ju really likes you. 

874
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,450
 Can you come to see Yeon Ju now? 

875
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,080
 Can you? 

876
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,330
 Can you, can you, can you now? 

877
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:53,180
 Aigoo. 

878
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,990
   

879
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,780
 The poor flounder ... 

880
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,430
 Poor thing! 

881
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:05,070
 How can you cut off a poor fish's head like that, swoosh-swoosh? 

882
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,540
 Bad men. You bad men. 

883
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:11,410
 Uncles, you are bad men! 

884
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:15,350
♪  Bad men  ♪

885
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,850
♪  Bad men  ♪

886
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:25,860
♪  You who cuts off fish's heads just like that, swoosh-swoosh  ♪

887
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:30,880
 ♪ Flounder! Poor flounder ♪ 

888
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,340
 - Hey, Jo Yeon Ju!
- Hey! 

889
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,820
 Can you call yourself the chief district prosecutor? 

890
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:39,280
 Can you call yourself a Korean prosecutor? 

891
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,080
 You chaebol's errand boy. 

892
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,920
 You freaking trash. You ***** and ***** !! Wait and see. 

893
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,650
 Do you know who I am? 

894
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,180
 Do you know who I really am? 

895
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,370
 Hey! Are you crazy? You don't respect the hierarchy. 

896
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,480
 Hello? You hung up on me, damn it! 

897
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,200
 I can't believe this. 

898
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,320
 To hear foul profanity from a junior way younger than I am. 

899
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,330
 But who is she saying she is? 

900
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,820
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Hanju Group? 

901
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:19,210
 How is she Chairwoman Kang Mi Na? 

902
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,450
   

903
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:31,080
 I told you. People who love don't get disappointed easily by their loved ones. Let's go. 

904
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,720
 It seems there are gossip articles saying that Sister-in-law's identity is fake. 

905
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,610
 So I want to publicly run a DNA test on her. 

906
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:39,490
 You and I got into the same boat. 

907
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,170
 Why don't you unite your connection in the prosecution with mine? 

908
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,790
 Chief Prosecutor! 

909
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:47,930
 Don't you know how to knock? 
 I thought she was just drunk and talking nonsense. 

910
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,000
 You know the medicine I gave you? 

911
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,010
 Do you believe this could only happen to your hyeong Seong Chan? 

912
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,890
 No matter what you do. 

913
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,220
 No matter who you are. I'm never going to divorce you. 

914
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:00,260
 You are not Kang Mi Na.
