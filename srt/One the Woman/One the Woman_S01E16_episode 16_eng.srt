1
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,120
   

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,950
Oh no, why are they coming this way?

3
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:54,590


4
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,760
   

5
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm not finished.

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,060
   

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,150
Send them all to the police.

8
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,640
   

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,960
     

10
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,520
I won't talk long.

11
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,500
I will make the new Hanju that I've always dreamed of.

12
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,130
Why is Seung Wuk in there?

13
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,730
- There was no good reason to kick him out. 
 - What about the rest?

14
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,990
The two that were trespassing were sent to the police office,

15
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,810
but Jo Yeon Ju isn't a current offender,

16
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,020
and a prosecutor from Seopyeong Branch Office is here too so ...

17
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,330
Go ahead.

18
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,260
When did we start sending just the guilty people to jail?

19
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,750
Why don't you let it slide for today?

20
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,990
That prosecutor will be demoted soon anyway,

21
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,130
so all the things she's doing will end in just a few days.

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,340
"End in just a few days" ...

23
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,050
Is that woman, Jo Yeon Ju, going to disappear in a few days or something?

24
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,580
Why was the team leader getting out of the car?

25
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,350
He was planning with us from start to end. Why is he suddenly acting like that?

26
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,580
If that was his plan, wasn't he fooling us from the start?

27
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,320
I don't know.

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,810
- There must be some reason behind it. 
 - "Reason"?

29
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,360
What reason can there be in this situation?

30
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,510
All that remains is the Jeong Do Wu side of it, right?

31
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,730
No matter how much he's questioned,

32
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,750
he stubbornly keeps saying that it was all his doing.

33
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Since your uncles are not around,

34
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,890
I'll go to Kang Mi Na's hospital. What about you?

35
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,810
Don't ask me, I can't trust anyone.

36
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,250
There might be a traitor among us.

37
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,390
She must've been quite shocked.

38
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,290
I guess so.

39
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,020
I am Director Kim Gyeon Sin. Do you know that?

40
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,640
Yes, Director.

41
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,790
Can I see ...

42
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,900
Manager Jeong Do Wu's résumé  from when he first joined the company?

43
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,640
Is there no possibility of recovery?

44
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,000
We're at a stage where it's too late to do anything.

45
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,740
By the way, there's something strange.

46
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,390
What is it?

47
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,320
 The number you are calling is unavailable, you may leave a message— 

48
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,720
 The number you are calling is unavailable— 

49
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,240
 The number you are calling is unavailable— 

50
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,910
- Hello? 
 - Oh, incredible, he answered!

51
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,360
Stop calling me!

52
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,540
Do you think I can answer right away in a situation like this?

53
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,360
It's because I'm so frustrated! What's going on!?

54
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Tell Seung Wuk

55
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,700
that I'm sorry.

56
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,150
Whatever! Let's meet up first.

57
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,210
No, wait ... How can I meet you if I don't trust you?

58
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,250
But I can't just not meet up ...

59
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,330
Something came up.

60
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,670
I'll tell you the details when we catch up.

61
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,020
Can I really just meet up with you?

62
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,120
You're not trying weird things again, right?

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,190
I'm not that much of a bad guy.

64
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,510
If I was really going to be a spy,

65
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,000
I wouldn't have been standing next to Han Seung Hye in the open.

66
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,510
Do we have to talk at such a noisy place?

67
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,340
Haven't you seen the movies?

68
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,840
If you whisper in a quiet place because it's something important, someone will eavesdrop for sure.

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
We need to talk casually at a noisy place like this,

70
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,810
so no one pays attention to us.

71
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,450
And even if we're bugged, it's hard to hear us in a place like this.

72
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,010
Also, why would I trust you and meet

73
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,360
in a secluded place, just the two of us?

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,930
What on earth ...

75
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,880
So what happened?

76
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
The truth is ...

77
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,330
when Seung Wuk's father passed away, I already knew about the account books.

78
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,660
If I had mentioned that to CEO Han,

79
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,310
he might not have gone to the factory.

80
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,830
Oh my ... How could

81
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,800
you hide that fact until now?

82
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
By nature,

83
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,630
it's hard for people to admit their wrongdoings.

84
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,080
Human beings are like that.

85
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,400
Even so, since you were so close to him, you should have been loyal.

86
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Loyalty? Loyalty is great and all,

87
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,540
but will "loyalty" alone keep paying me one million won*  (≈$860)  every month?

88
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,930
My father has been in hospital for the last 20 years.

89
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,400
Loyalty is a luxury to someone like me.

90
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,830
Anyway, I guess there's no secret in this world. Han Seung Hye blackmailed me with that fact.

91
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,640
So I had no choice.

92
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,440
So now what are you going to do?

93
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,130
What do you want me to do?

94
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,360
Team Leader, even with your backstory, this isn't right.

95
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,910
Will you live as a chaebol's gofer* for the rest of your life? 
  (Errand boy) 

96
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,080
I mean, you can just open an attorney's office.

97
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,490
That's easy to say.

98
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,770
I've never had a high position in the law, nor am I from a huge law firm.

99
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,430
it's not like I just spend a penny or two on my household.

100
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,100
You're still daydreaming.

101
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
What's wrong with being a chaebol's gofer?

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
I told you, if I'm shunned by this side,

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,310
I'll have to find a way to live on the other side.

104
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,130
Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju, you know well about gangsters.

105
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,210
Even the lowest gang member

106
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,090
takes the head of the boss when betraying the gang.

107
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,270
How can I go to the other side with nothing in my hands?

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
What ...

109
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,780
Did you ...

110
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,170
put something in this?

111
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,200
Damn that team leader.

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,240
How much did he put in that drink?

113
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,260
I know, right?

114
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,910
I told him I have to kill you in front of my eyes, so he must've used just enough to keep you alive.

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,800
Look here, Director Han Seung Hye.

116
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,120
What I'm most confident with is

117
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,710
a private, undisturbed one-on-one interrogation.

118
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,680
Whether I had to make a deal, or lie, or yell,

119
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,660
if I decided to,

120
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,720
I always got the answer I wanted from the suspect.

121
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,550
So? Are you going to try and interrogate me in that state?

122
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,990
No. Today, I'll just ask for a favor.

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,280
Turn yourself in. The recording from when you killed CEO Han Gang Sik,

124
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,000
and hit my grandmother, I heard it all.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,590
It was an accident, wasn't it?

126
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,740
You must still believe you are a prosecutor.

127
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,640
What if I turn myself in? The law is always on the side of the strongest.

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,500
What happened then slid away without anyone knowing.

129
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,710
At that time, if Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok

130
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,800
hadn't turned a blind eye for his own benefit,

131
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,790
you wouldn't have turned out like this.

132
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,060
Turn yourself in, even if it's late.

133
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,220
Also the fact that you tried to kill the real Kang Mi Na in a car accident,

134
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,110
and the fact that you killed Lee Bong Sik, the man I staked my whole prosecutor career on,

135
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,270
and even the fact that you killed Jang Seok Ho and his wife at the reservoir...

136
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,360
just confess to them all ... and turn yourself in.

137
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,610
Why would I? Do you have any evidence?

138
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,280
All I did was give orders, so there's no evidence.

139
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,050
That's why you're begging me to turn myself in.

140
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,160
I dealt with them without getting a single drop of blood on my own hands.

141
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,310
You and the real Kang Mi Na ...

142
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,740
will both become the same soon.

143
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,150
How many

144
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,970
did you admit to murdering just now?

145
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,440
What?

146
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,630
In the case of requesting or plotting murder using power or rank,

147
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,000
the sentence is death, or five or more years in prison.

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,480
I told you, I always get the answer I want.

149
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,160
This whole time, did you think I was just a player in your game?

150
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,240
 Do you know how to attack those chaebols? 

151
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,130
 Their weakness is this. 

152
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,120
 They're people who think they've got where they are on their own, 

153
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,660
 so they believe that they are always right. 

154
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,350
 You have to attack that part. 

155
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,360
 Are you telling me to be a traitor just like Han Seung Hye wants? 

156
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,520
 It's great! You fit the role perfectly! 

157
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,920
 I lived my life that way because I had to, 

158
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,410
 how could you treat me like Yeopo* who keeps changing teams? 
  (A character in the Chinese story, "Three Kingdoms")  

159
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,750
 Oh, come on! All right. 

160
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,670
 Team Leader, you are like 

161
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,670
 a  lotus flower that blooms in mud, very virtuous. 

162
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,730
 Is that good enough? 

163
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,560
 I mean, if you say you won't do it, 

164
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,100
 I can't force you. 

165
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,020
 I told you before, 

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,320
 you should use a pawn to catch a queen. 

167
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,230
 If you don't have power, no one keeps you in check, 

168
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,220
 so it's possible to change teams. 

169
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,290
 Then, will you do it? 

170
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,090
 If you were going to do it anyway, why did you make such a fuss? 

171
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,580
 Try being an office worker for 30 years. 

172
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,550
 You can't say "I'll do it" without protest. 

173
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,030
 Once Han Seung Hye gets the team leader on her side, it's my turn. 

174
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,090
 She'll think I'll be a bother, just as I was on the inauguration day. 

175
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,170
 She'll try to get rid of me at any cost. 

176
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,060
 Do you think she'll trust me 100%? 

177
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,080
 That's why we need some appetizing bait. 

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,180
 All the original evidence we have, take it to her. 

179
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,290
 And when she says she wants to kill me, make it so she can. 

180
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,260
 I'm against it. I can't gamble with your life. 

181
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,800
 Don't worry. As long as we make her join the gambling, 

182
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,580
 I can get her to confess for sure. 

183
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,200
 Even if you get the confession, how are you going to arrest her? 

184
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,360
 "If bugs get into the rice bag," 

185
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,130
 "you have to leave it on a rooftop with lots of sunlight." 

186
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,200
 Then the bugs will crawl out of the dark, wet rice. 

187
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,010
 So you're saying that we need to publicly humiliate her in broad daylight, 

188
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,790
 and in a very luxurious way. 

189
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,880
 A public humiliation ... 

190
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,900
Just as you said, our country's laws are mostly on the side of those with power,

191
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,660
but once in a while, the laws support the weak.

192
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,140
That is, when it is publicized.

193
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,070
Are you delirious from being close to death? What are you talking about?

194
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,170
That's why I give this advice to those in unfair situations.

195
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,470
"If you think you'll get beaten up by people with power,"

196
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,330
"then, make sure you get beaten up where there is CCTV."

197
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,340
If you get beaten up where no one can see you and you land a lucky punch,

198
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,620
then if the powerful sue you,

199
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,090
there will be no way to prove what happened.

200
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,640
Today, I did nothing.

201
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,350
You just ruined yourself by being reckless.

202
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,330
And the thing that makes bad people become reckless

203
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,010
is that divine providence from above.

204
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,800
Han Seung Hye, that lady acted like she's some really nice person,

205
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,510
but it turns out she's crap! Crap!

206
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,140
Ryu Seung Deok is the Chief District Prosecutor ...

207
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,260
Our channel, "The Man Who Teaches You Law,"

208
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,480
checked the statute of limitations right away,

209
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,980
and for Chief District Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok, the statute of limitations has passed,

210
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,030
so legally bringing him to justice seems improbable,

211
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,190
do you think that makes sense?

212
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,430
 - It's unbelievable! 
- Isn't this insane? 

213
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,450
 Does this make sense? 

214
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,010
 The world is so dirty! Dirty! 

215
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Everything you just said, from beginning to end,

216
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,010
was broadcast live.

217
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,970
   

218
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,500
   

219
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,050
How much of that stuff did he put in my drink?

220
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,770
I said so, didn't I? That I won't be fooled twice.

221
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,030
Are you all right?

222
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,910
They're filming here, so let's get out.

223
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,300
♫  Reaches toward me   ♫

224
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:40,070
♫  and leads me to you all the pain is healed now.  ♫

225
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,510
♫  I will hug   ♫

226
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,040
♫  and wrap you.  ♫

227
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,640
♫  Like a warm  ♫

228
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,420
♫  breeze  ♫

229
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,140
   

230
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,530
Hey, Honey, it's me. I can't come home for a few days.

231
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,430
And also, our house might get searched,

232
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,830
so take everything that's worth anything and go somewhere else.

233
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,240
Your mother's house or your friend's house. You have many places!

234
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,130
   

235
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,070
Seonbae, if I'm inspected, all my accounts and phone calls will get revealed.

236
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,310
Then it's over for me. I'm dead.

237
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,830
Seonbae, I blocked everything for you last time

238
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,650
so this time, please save me.

239
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,210
Seonbae, Seonbae—... Hello?

240
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,140
Hello!

241
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,410
Prosecution!

242
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,180
South Korea!

243
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,870
What did they ever do for me!

244
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,290
I want to go back!

245
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,410
When a person is too angry,

246
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,540
they can say things that are not true.

247
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,570
That woman was spewing such nonsense, so ...

248
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,800
What are you all doing?

249
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,020
Are you going to leave me to splutter on?

250
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,460
Well, first of all, she filmed without your consent.

251
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,440
So if she tries to use it as legal evidence,

252
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,300
we can make it an issue.

253
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,240
In the worst case, we can says it's a deepfake*, 
  (A skillfully edited video) 

254
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
and that it's fake news.

255
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,330
We stopped all the live videos,

256
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,950
and it wasn't on prime-time news or anything, so don't worry.

257
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,970
You have all of the evidence anyway, right?

258
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,050
Lee Bong Sik's list,

259
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,410
the bugging device I took,

260
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,660
and the USB from Kang Mi Na, I brought all of them. Everything!

261
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,540
This is so harsh!

262
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,430
I'm the oldest here, yet both of you are ordering me around.

263
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,790
You had me install that webcam or whatever on the ceiling of the basement,

264
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,900
and it took so much labor. Do you realize the effort?

265
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,950
I didn't just sit around either.

266
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,960
First of all, I'm the one who recruited all the live streamers,

267
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,660
- and I went to hospitals here and there— 
 - Right! And was I just sitting around?

268
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,710
You put so much of that drug in the water, my head still hurts!

269
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,350
- I know. You could've just pretended to add some. 
 - That's what I'm saying!

270
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,470
I mean, she told me to make it realistic!

271
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,380
I thought you might care about me too much,

272
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,450
and just give me plain water.

273
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,420
We didn't need to go so "method",* did we? 
  (Referring to "Method acting") 

274
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,140
Wow, when I recall your evil laugh as you looked at me,

275
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,870
it still gives me the creeps ...

276
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,890
You said they would surely bug us,

277
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,830
so I had to act correctly!

278
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,760
You didn't have to talk about it so seriously either!

279
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,460
"Chaebol's gofer"?

280
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,260
Gofer?!

281
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,680
And calling me a hundred times?

282
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,300
And who raged at me as soon as I answered the phone?

283
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,270
I mean, at the inauguration,

284
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,630
did we decide that you'd get out of her car! No, we didn't!

285
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,830
When you got out so confidently, I was shocked!

286
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,680
How can I trust someone whose thoughts show so clearly on her face,

287
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,610
and let her act?

288
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,050
You had to be authentically shocked for Han Seung Hye to believe it!

289
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,510
I told you, he had a reason.

290
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,610
What "reason"!

291
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,830
In the worst case scenario, we have that criminal who confessed for the incident 14 years ago.

292
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,990
How about pinning all the crimes on him?

293
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,750
When we were told to take a break,

294
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,360
that was the signal.

295
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,790
Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, Lee Bong Sik, Jang Seok Ho,

296
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,860
the Director of Sun Star gallery ...

297
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,950
Do you admit to murdering these people,

298
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,850
and did Managing Director Han Seung Hye order the murders?

299
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,170
Yes.

300
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,330
That incident from 14 years ago,

301
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,820
was that also her doing?

302
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Yes.

303
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,880
Why are you suddenly changing

304
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,670
all your previous testimony?

305
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,460
 Your little sister 

306
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,190
 was hospitalized for a long time, wasn't she? 

307
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,860
 When she was little, 

308
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,410
 I heard she had surgery thanks to Han Seong Hye. 

309
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,790
 That's right. 

310
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:05,160
 If there had been an opportunity to fix her illness afterwards, 

311
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,450
 what would Han Seong Hye have done? 

312
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,750
 She would have made it possible by any means. 

313
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,810
 It's the résumé of Manager Jeong Do Wu who worked in Hanju security. 

314
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,480
 He only had his grandparents and a younger sister. 

315
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,150
 Apparently she underwent major surgery for acute kidney failure as soon as he was hired. 

316
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,030
 And Han Seong Hye helped with that. 

317
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,520
 Han Seong Hye did? Why? 

318
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,380
 She was given Hanju Fashion at a young age, 

319
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,330
 so perhaps she wanted to build a reputation of "noblesse oblige".* 
 (People of privilege acting honorably) 

320
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,750
 Apparently she went around looking for workers in such circumstances. 

321
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,120
 So all that money 

322
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,390
 has been going toward his younger sister until now? 

323
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,350
 There is something strange. 

324
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,740
 There were many chances for her acute kidney failure to heal. 

325
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,520
 She was named several times on the rotation list for kidney donation, 

326
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,860
 but the patient refused surgery. 

327
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,690
 Did Mr. Jeong Do Wu refuse the surgery? 

328
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,120
 Ah, Ms. Han Seong Hye takes the calls about this matter. 

329
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,170
 It was she who refused surgery. 

330
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,860
 That's why the patient's condition worsened. 

331
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,350
 She wanted to keep your weakness, so she could use you as her servant. 

332
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,880
 She's someone who held a person's life hostage. 

333
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,860
I just asked why you're retracting your testimony.

334
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,820
Because ...

335
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,850
I feel betrayed.

336
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,750
   

337
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,710
Here's the script.

338
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,520
The news for your last day is quite extravagant.

339
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,280
 I heard that Han Seong Hye used tabloid articles 

340
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,220
 to hurt you and her brother and kick you off the pedestal. 

341
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,370
 So you're bound to be fired. 

342
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,140
 So what. Did you come here to see how I'm doing? 

343
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,530
 No. Well, it did happen because of your own fault, 

344
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,040
 but you've worked hard to get to your position, 

345
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,930
 so I was hoping you'd be able to do a better job 

346
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,560
 as a journalist, and as an anchor. 

347
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,200
 All right, shall we begin? 

348
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,440
Hold on!

349
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,110
Yes, I got it.

350
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,450
Let's leave out everything related to Hanju.

351
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,220
 Apparently Hanju is threatening to remove all their ads. 

352
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,810
 Okay, let's begin! 

353
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,520
 Three, two, one! 

354
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,190
   

355
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,540
This is your first piece of news.

356
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,450
Urgent news. This evening, Chairwoman Han Seong Hye's evil deeds

357
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,060
were sent out in a live broadcast, causing an uproar.

358
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,710
- What is she doing? 
 - She—

359
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,790
What's wrong with her?

360
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,490
Hey, you, you, you, have you gone mad?

361
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,220
Hey!

362
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,690
 For those who missed the live broadcast, 

363
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,480
 our company, SBC, was planning to tell you the details. 

364
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,390
But because Hanju Group threatened to pull all its ads

365
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,940
if one word this event gets out,

366
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,250
we are unable to mention it. For that,

367
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,780
and for being a news anchor who is unable to deliver the truth,

368
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,800
I apologize.

369
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,180
There must be reasons why Hanju is preventing reports.

370
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,370
Did she drink?

371
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,590
 Next. Due to our recent stock market— 

372
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,550
Eonni's gone mad, right?

373
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,750
No matter how much she wants the company ...

374
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,790
She's gone mad, completely mad.

375
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,460
- We know nothing. 
 - Mom ...

376
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,340
Right now, getting involved with Seong Hye

377
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,910
means we'll all fall together.

378
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,380
Do you want to sink with her?

379
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,370
Don't take her calls, even if she does ring.

380
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,260
What will you do about attending the Substantial Examination of Warrant Validity?

381
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm not going.

382
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,150
Nowadays, if you don't appear,

383
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,230
it's seen as a sign for an arrest as a means of penance ...

384
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,860
Don't make me say it twice.

385
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,750
I'm not going.

386
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,680
Understood.

387
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,260
Yes, Congressman. It's me, Director Han Seong Hye.

388
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,370
Ah, I see.

389
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,400
Then when can I call you?

390
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,500
Yes.

391
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,100
Hello, Mr. Minister. I'm Director Han Seong Hye—

392
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,480
Han Seong Hye?

393
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,880
Yes, Director Han Seong Hye?

394
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,910
Chief Prosecutor?

395
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,080
About this incident—

396
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,290
It's good of you to call me. Save me.

397
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,680
You know all the strings you have? Congress, Senate, everywhere else?

398
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,940
You must have more strings than I do.

399
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,700
Why didn't you give their sons retirement congratulatory funds and stuff?

400
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,010
Last time, the Wu—

401
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,920
That's the real Han Seong Hye. Han Seong Hye.

402
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,420
- Oh, he's coming out!
- He's here!

403
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,600
You issued a warrant for almost the entire Hanju family that includes past crimes and bribes. Are you confident of seeing this to the end?

404
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
You put the Seopyeong gangs in jail because they were connected to Hanju.

405
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,340
Why have you announced a war against both the gangs and chaebols?

406
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,360
What do you mean?

407
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,230
So from now on, do you have another goal as a prosecutor?

408
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,520
I didn't prosecute them for my own benefit,

409
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,370
I just prosecuted them because they were criminals.

410
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,340
Isn't that the role of prosecutors?

411
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,970
 - Prosecutor, Prosecutor!
 - Did you get that? 

412
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,920
 One more word, please! 

413
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,630
 It doesn't matter what! 

414
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,440
My position right now is just like this leaf.

415
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,980
Damn, are you crying?

416
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,870
Goodness, look at those dark circles!

417
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,650
You haven't slept at all, have you?

418
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,620
Who can't sleep? Who? I slept very well!

419
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,200
I heard that you expressed your intention to resign in a rush yesterday, but it wasn't processed due to the press running wild.

420
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,770
Everyone who is investigating me is my subordinate,

421
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,720
and I ... am the law!

422
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
I know it better than you guys!

423
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
It's scarier because you know it better!

424
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,880
Do you need to go this far?

425
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,230
Do you need to put me in jail?

426
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,250
I mean, did I kill someone or what?

427
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,370
I just ... I just closed my eyes for them once!

428
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,570
Among the professionals around me,

429
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,130
if we just talked to them, no one would admit their wrongdoing unless we took it this far.

430
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,020
You damn—... What kind of impossible normality is that?

431
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,080
Look at this! You're not admitting to it.

432
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,890
Jo Yeon Ju!

433
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,490
Do you think I won't be able to climb back up? Huh?

434
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,970
You are bound to see me sometime soon.

435
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,170
Yeah, all right, whatever.

436
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,720
I have no interest

437
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,090
in what evil people promise.

438
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,730
Good work!

439
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,450
Yes, what is it?

440
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,910
 Kang Mi Na, woke up. 

441
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,340
I managed to pass the bar exam and become a prosecutor,

442
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,700
thanks to my amazing memory and deduction skills,

443
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,860
and I was able to solve all the obstacles before me ...

444
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,140
 How could I pretend to sleep like Kang Mi Na? 

445
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,950
 I guess Kang Mi Na even slept like a perfect lady. 

446
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,140
 Well ... 

447
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,590
 Did you say you're two years older than Kang Mi Na? 

448
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,400
 It unlocked. It's today's date. 

449
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,380
 It was your birthday. 

450
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,510
 Mi Na! 

451
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,790
 He will be all right. 

452
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,120
 Oppa is different than he looks. 

453
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,450
I mean, why do I find my amazing memory and deduction skills to be a burden right now?

454
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,770
Why am I going through all kinds of scenarios of my own imagination?

455
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,860
Stop deducing, Jo Yeon Ju, you ajumma!

456
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,620
Damn it!

457
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,330
Let's hurry and go inside. She says she must meet you, Yeon Ju.

458
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,290
Oh, I see. But ...

459
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,520
how about you go in first?

460
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,060
Just me?

461
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,180
Why? How about you, Yeon Ju?

462
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,510
Well ...

463
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,400
You haven't seen her in a long time. I'm sure you have a lot to say to each other.

464
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,790
I'm sure she's not feeling settled.

465
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,030
People's feelings are usually pretty simple.

466
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,700
If you truly like someone, it's not that complicated.

467
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,070
Let's go in.

468
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,360
Right.

469
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,450
I'm happy to meet you, Ms. Jo Yeon Ju.

470
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,250
Let me introduce myself formally. I'm Kang Mi Na.

471
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,780
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.

472
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,090
Long time no see, Oppa.

473
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,260
So, what happened?

474
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,200
I don't even know.

475
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,490
When I woke up, everything was back in its place.

476
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,250
But how could we look exactly the same?

477
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:05,880
I know. I checked with my father so many times.

478
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,290
But seeing how my father kept emphasizing that he'd want me to be a rich man's daughter,

479
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,080
I think my mom gave birth to me.

480
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,970
As for me, my aunt was in the labor room

481
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,260
and saw my mother giving birth to me right next to her.

482
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,520
She ran a paternity test as soon as I was born.

483
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,060
Geez, that aunt of yours.

484
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,760
But ... anyway ...

485
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,460
I'm sorry that I inadvertently pretended to be you for so long.

486
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,490
I think I'm the one who should apologize.

487
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,850
Han Seong Hye did that to you while trying to kill me.

488
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,000
I thought that she'd merely accuse me

489
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,500
of being a drug addict then send me to a psychiatric ward.

490
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,300
That was so naive of me.

491
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,980
You had no idea. So you couldn't help it.

492
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,260
Had you known there would be an airplane accident, you wouldn't have run away like that.

493
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,520
If I hadn't run away then,

494
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,030
right after the airplane accident,

495
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,850
I would've been killed without anyone's knowledge.

496
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:11,410
Thanks to the two of you, I'm alive today.

497
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,920
But why didn't you take your tablet with you?

498
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,830
At first, I was going to meet Oppa overseas

499
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,230
and give it to him somehow.

500
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,050
All I could do was to run away,

501
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,520
but I wanted to see someone destroy Hanju.

502
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,970
But right before I ran away,

503
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,930
I changed my mind.

504
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,360
Why?

505
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,220
When my life hit rock bottom,

506
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,850
I started considering other people's lives.

507
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:50,320
I thought that manipulating Oppa's life any further for my sake,

508
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,200
would be wrong.

509
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,090
More than anyone ...

510
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,820
I want to apologize to you, Oppa.

511
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,260
After I returned to Korea

512
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,970
and saw you living with my face,

513
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:16,380
I started wondering if I was too cowardly all this time.

514
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,230
That's why I decided to find

515
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,500
Han Seung Hye's weaknesses.

516
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,530
Most of my life was filled with pain until now.

517
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,580
But there were some nice gifts along the way.

518
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,820
I think you two were like that for me.

519
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,790
I feel sorry toward the two of you,

520
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,900
and I'm grateful.

521
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:06,230
So what other crimes were committed by Han Seung Hye that aren't revealed yet?

522
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,080
As for that, everyone at Hanju

523
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,330
is being punished by the law according to their own crimes,

524
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,130
except for my mother-in-law.

525
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,400
That's right.

526
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,460
Except for torturing her daughter-in-law, she hasn't broken the law herself.

527
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,080
As for those additional crimes,

528
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,050
I think that more than anything, they will be extremely painful for my mother-in-law.

529
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,420
So I'd like to tell her myself.

530
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,920
It's also my share

531
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,130
of revenge.

532
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,710
I thought you were in a coma.

533
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,450
You sure live a long life.

534
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,550
How dare you show up here?

535
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:25,290
Did you come to see what I'm doing in this big house all by myself?

536
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,100
You're still the same.

537
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,540
I almost died several times by your daughter's orders.

538
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,220
Don't you want to say any words of apology?

539
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,310
So? Did you die?

540
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,390
You didn't die.

541
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,690
You didn't die and you will get to live in wealth.

542
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,410
Stop being so arrogant. Do you think you gained the world?

543
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:55,760
In the end, you were afraid of us and wanted to hide behind your new face.

544
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,910
Just because I changed my face,

545
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,130
do I look like I'm hiding behind it?

546
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,120
And so? What are you trying to do now?

547
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,590
I'm here because I have something to tell you,

548
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,820
and I'll leave after I say what I have to say.

549
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,400
As you said, I have a tenacious lifeline,

550
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,990
so I managed to survive many times.

551
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:40,000
But why did your oldest son die in vain

552
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,590
at the same time Father tried to overlook Han Seong Hye

553
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:51,360
and promote your oldest son to the Vice Chairman position?

554
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,210
What are you saying?

555
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,270
 I'm so tired ... 

556
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,800
 What are you feeding me? 

557
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,110
 Did Nuna tell you to do it? 

558
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,270
 I won't become a victim like Hyeong because of not being careful. 

559
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,600
 I won't become a victim. 

560
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,120
 I wont ... 

561
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,370
 Brother-in-law went to volunteer at the animal shelter with Sister-in-law 

562
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,410
 and died of an asthma attack. 

563
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,400
 Since then, you hated hearing of volunteering at animal shelters, 

564
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,810
 so I ended up going there alone. 

565
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,330
 As expected, the dog shampoo that Sister-in-law had donated to the shelter that day 

566
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:52,350
 contained an ingredient that could be lethal for asthma sufferers. 

567
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,020
If only Brother-in-law's asthma inhaler, which he always carried, had been with him,

568
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,590
he could've survived.

569
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,940
But it disappeared that day.

570
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,120
As to where it was found,

571
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,410
why don't you ask your second son?

572
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:20,670
Because he was so afraid of his Nuna, he kept his mouth shut, even though he knew all along.

573
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,130
 I just want to live quietly. 

574
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,660
 I don't want to end up like Hyeong. 

575
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,470
I tried to get Director Han Seong Hye to confess to all she had done.

576
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,190
But under the circumstances, I didn't think it would mean much

577
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,220
to add one more crime to those she had committed.

578
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,390
So I'm only telling you, Mother.

579
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,230
Shut that mouth of yours. Get out of here right this minute!

580
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,660
You won't be going to jail for torturing me, Mother.

581
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:03,730
But instead, your beloved son was driven to his death by another child of yours,

582
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,740
and the other child kept quiet even though he knew.

583
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:13,280
Please keep thinking about this and, for the rest of your life,

584
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,520
live locked up in the prison that you built for yourself.

585
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,850
   

586
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,110
We will now reveal the results of voting on the agenda item

587
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,900
about the dismissal of the Hanju family.

588
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,040
   

589
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,200
Here. Am I too late?

590
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,830
We need 66.7% of attendees to vote "Yes." 
    

591
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:50,330
Since the result did not meet the required number of votes, the agenda item has not passed.
   

592
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,820
Those who opposed their dismissal! Are you crazy?

593
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,890
How could we let owners like them run the company?

594
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,890
You don't have to be moral to run a company. That is a separate matter.

595
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,080
What the hell is he saying?

596
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,130
Excuse me.

597
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,720
I'm late. Can we vote again?

598
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,500
- What? 
 - Who's that?

599
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,450
Who are you?

600
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,260
Is Director Kim that powerful?

601
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,990
Hanju Group's "Director" title isn't to be taken lightly.

602
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,960
I'm sure Grandpa gave her the best stocks, and that she has quite an influence among the shareholders.

603
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,760
I guess late bloomers can be quite scary.

604
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,030
She always said she was neutral. Must she show her true colors going there so late?

605
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,850
 At the end of a long, drawn-out re-voting at the Hanju Group's Shareholders' Meeting, 

606
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:59,370
 with 67.1% "Yes" votes and 32.9% "No" votes, 

607
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,610
 the dismissal of Chairman Han Yeong Sik's family has been decided. 

608
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,060
 With this, Chairman Han Yeong Sik's family has become the first leading family to be dismissed by shareholders. 

609
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,820
 And an arrest warrant for Director Han Seong Hye has been finally issued, 

610
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,030
 and she will be arrested soon. 

611
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,280
 The Deputy Chief Prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in charge of the warrants said 

612
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,990
 that suspicions are justified and that she may choose to flee, as he issued her warrant. 

613
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,370
   

614
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,720
 Early this early morning at a reservoir in Gyeonggido, 

615
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,230
 missing Managing Director Han Seong Hye was found dead. She was due to be arrested. 

616
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,350
 At the time of discovery, the corpse was extremely damaged. 

617
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:36,030
 But the clothes and rings she was wearing at the time 

618
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,700
 were on the body. 

619
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,420
 In other news, Hanju's executives held a meeting and brought in Han Seung Wuk to head the company.  

620
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,520
 He is the late Chairman Han Gang Sik's son. 

621
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,460
 Hanju Group memorialized the late Chairman Han Gang Sik as an honorary Chairman 

622
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,960
 as they expressed sorrow for the death of Managing Director Han Seong Hye. 

623
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,800
 They canceled the new Chairman's installation ceremony and other events. 

624
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,830
You must be going to Vietnam.

625
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,700
Do you want me to tell you a Vietnamese proverb?

626
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,400
"Keep walking outdoors in the dark, and you will eventually encounter a ghost." 
  (In Vietnamese) 

627
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,010
This is what it is in Korean.

628
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,240
"Misbehavior eventually catches up with you."

629
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,670
How did you ...

630
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,170
I know people like you too well.

631
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,480
The true cowards can't kill themselves. Do you know why?

632
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,850
Dying is so scary.

633
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,160
So I looked at the corpse very carefully.

634
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,540
The clothes and shoes,

635
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,920
and the watch and rings were all yours.

636
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,940
But the underwear!

637
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,780
It wasn't what I had hand-washed at your house at one point.

638
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,120
How dare you pretend to die with dignity by suicide?

639
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,330
How many times do I have to tell you?

640
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,950
Turn yourself in. Okay?

641
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,240
I was going to let her be elegant to the end.

642
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,150
But it can't be.

643
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,930
Strike!

644
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,600
Out!

645
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,830
   

646
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:54,010
I guess Han Seong Hye thought that everyone was afraid

647
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,670
to admit to their wrongdoings from their past and to apologize.

648
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:03,680
But that's only for people like her.

649
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,460
She must've thought that you'd be hiding everything from me.

650
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,770
It was tough for me to tell you, too.

651
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,700
But no one in this world is perfect.

652
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,080
You just have to know that and not repeat your mistakes.

653
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,400
I feel much better now that I've paid my debt from that time.

654
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,400
Hey, Seung Wuk!

655
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,360
Yes?

656
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,230
I've quit my job at the company, and I've repaid my debt now.

657
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,480
I'll just be an ajeossi to you now.

658
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,840
Let me live in peace.

659
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,940
Don't make me drive anymore.

660
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,210
I'm off. You have a friend, right?

661
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,800
Yes.

662
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,270
   

663
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,060
How do you feel?

664
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:29,000
I've just finished my sprint, but I feel like

665
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,890
I'm now running a marathon. That's how I feel.

666
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,670
Now I'm wondering where I should run,

667
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:39,250
and where my place is.

668
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,860
Your place?

669
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,230
You said this a long time ago.

670
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,260
Wherever you are and whatever you're doing,

671
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,030
if something happens,

672
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,510
you don't want to live a life

673
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,990
where you only wonder what happens to your company stocks.

674
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,150
So I've been thinking,

675
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,430
how should I live?

676
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:04,760
I'm not sure, though.

677
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,020
From long ago until now,

678
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:11,620
I've never lived without having a goal or revenge in mind.

679
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:17,940
Now that all that is over, I have no idea what I should do with my life.

680
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,120
Let me know when you find your answer.

681
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,420
I guess you've found what you need to do.

682
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,240
I'll be waiting for you.

683
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,410
   

684
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,210
Who sent that?

685
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:46,160
The owner?

686
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,330
The rumor has it that your sashimi is so fresh.

687
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,950
You even opened up your second branch.

688
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,740
Stop being mad.

689
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,730
Are you still mad about going to the police station?

690
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,600
Hey! ... Hey ...

691
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,950
Do you think we're angry about going to the police station?

692
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,580
It's because you didn't tell us that you were a fake.

693
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,900
Don't talk to me. Many people are asking us about opening our branch. I'm crazy busy.

694
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,070
- Oh-ho? 
 - Stop it already.

695
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,910
Come on now.

696
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,060
Right, Uncle Pil Gyu? As expected ...

697
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,710
- Where is my father?
- I won't tell you.

698
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,420
I'm mad at you!

699
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,590
- You came.
 - Oh, yes.

700
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:37,600
With a second branch, you need to hand out flyers to attract customers.

701
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,830
These flowers won't do it.

702
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,270
How come

703
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,120
you're more clueless than me, who has been behind bars for over ten years?

704
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,270
Who's inspired by flyers these days?

705
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:52,290
Everyone gives out coupons through apps and promotes through SNS*. 
  (Social Network Service) 

706
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:57,060
We have dinner reservations already booked.

707
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,670
   

708
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:09,110
Why open a store as soon as you were released? You should have taken a break.

709
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:14,400
Uncle Pil Gyu says your wrist will hurt if you use the knife too much. Take this.

710
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,350
You should've bought it after finding out what my role is at this sashimi place.

711
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:24,140
I never even used a knife when I was with a gang. Why would I use one now?

712
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,800
We have a chef.

713
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,560
Then I guess I'll take it back.

714
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,840
Aigoo, but still ...

715
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,270
How can you take it back?

716
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,820
I can hurt my joints while counting money.

717
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,720
Take it slow.

718
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,030
I can see that I don't need to worry about you anymore.

719
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:55,840
Are you leaving now?

720
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,540
Yes.

721
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,450
All right.

722
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,740
- Yeon Ju ...
 - Don't—

723
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,530
Don't say anything mushy.

724
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,630
Don't say anything.

725
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:19,000
Aigoo, give me a napkin. This got on my hand.

726
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,180
I'll go now.

727
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,050
Be careful.

728
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,820
Yes.

729
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,720
I'm really leaving.

730
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,410
Stress, stress.

731
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,940
They always tell me to resign.

732
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,780
I mean why? Over what?

733
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,410
Why do they pick on me whenever they hold a stockholders' meeting?

734
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,660
Did I ever sneak around with someone and steal the money?

735
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,540
What have I done that they keep telling me to bring in professional management?

736
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:08,550
It's because you keep uselessly putting together donation funds for the foundation.

737
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,290
That's why the shareholders

738
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,960
keep misunderstanding it as a fund laundering account.

739
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,970
I'd love to smash her over the head.

740
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,660
She's so quick.

741
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,450
How did she find out about fund laundering?

742
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,250
I finally got rid of the fake one and now the real one shows up.

743
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:44,130
But the real one isn't too easy.

744
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,370
Is she real for sure?

745
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,260
The good times are gone. Shit!

746
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,450
I just don't get it.

747
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:04,090
Isn't this a useless effort and only for show?

748
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,140
It's better for people like us to pay more taxes.

749
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,530
How many briquettes can we deliver as volunteers?

750
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:14,320
And Sister-in-law, I don't understand you even more.

751
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,460
Why did you come back and suffer voluntarily?

752
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,380
I went back to my family and no one welcomed me there either.

753
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:27,440
Never mind what else, I couldn't bear to see my Seon Wu walk on eggshells since he's the only grandson.

754
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,750
I just couldn't bear it.

755
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,240
Don't you think we know?

756
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,480
You thought Oppa Seung Wu would take over Hanju all by himself.

757
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,680
But they unexpectedly brought in professional management.

758
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,750
You figured, "Ah, my Seon Wu might get a chance, too."

759
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,980
That's why you're back.

760
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,420
If you know that so well,

761
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,390
why don't you work hard and stop fiddling around?

762
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,680
Father says an economic offense doesn't even count as an offense.

763
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,670
He says he'll return when he's released.

764
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:56,410
I heard he's gnashing his teeth in prison.

765
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,400
We should help him too!

766
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,260
Father is too much.

767
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:11,660
But how did Mother change so much?

768
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:15,160
She's got no energy.

769
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,290
 Ninety-one. 

770
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,340
 Ninety-two. 

771
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,760
 Ninety-three. 

772
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,360
 Ninety-four. 

773
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,070
 Ninety-five. 

774
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,620
 Ninety-six. 

775
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,230
 Ninety-seven. 

776
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,540
 Ninety-eight. 

777
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,250
 Ninety-nine. 

778
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,630
 One hundred. 

779
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,720
 I won't go down like this. 

780
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,290
 I won't go down. 

781
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,290
 I will not go down. 

782
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,730
 How dare you do this to me. 

783
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,140
 How dare you! 

784
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,770
How many times do I have to say it?

785
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:19,850
I have no interest in how wicked people end up.

786
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:23,010
I don't care if they do squats or make bodybuilding videos in prison.

787
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:26,360
Don't even tell me about stuff like that.

788
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,930
But I heard you opened up your own practice.

789
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,170
You spread the word throughout the industry.

790
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,130
For me to run the business, word of mouth is important.

791
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,500
Anyway, your father has been released and is settling down.

792
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,800
You must feel relieved.

793
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,780
Yes.

794
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,730
Actually, I'm here to say goodbye.

795
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,500
Are you finally leaving?

796
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,470
Yes.

797
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:56,360
I've been doing this and that while trying to find my place.

798
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:03,230
No matter where I am and what I'm doing, I think my place is next to my man.

799
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,300
Are you sure it's all right to rent this place to someone else?

800
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,330
Yes. That's what I'm saying.

801
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,970
Otherwise, why don't you move in here?

802
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:25,300
Gosh, you were talking about a demotion. Look at you moving onto the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

803
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,860
I'm very proud of you.

804
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:33,320
Anyway, because of you, I got to live very economically in Seoul with its expensive housing prices.

805
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,410
Thank you so much for not raising my rent.

806
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,720
Sure.

807
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,220
I've been so grateful, Nuna.

808
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,320
What's with you ...

809
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,850
I didn't do anything for you.

810
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,510
Either you always came home late because you forgot that I was waiting for you,

811
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,730
or you didn't come home.

812
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:57,460
In the midst of that, while waiting for you ...

813
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,210
I studied so hard.

814
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,870
That's why I got good grades from the Judicial Institute.

815
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,760
And ...

816
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:11,010
I was grateful that you didn't feel bad for me.

817
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,630
That's why I could face you as if I was fine.

818
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:28,360
I think this is truly goodbye for me.

819
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:36,060
♫  Please tell me now, please tell me now  ♫

820
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:40,430
♫  Please tell me the right answer  ♫

821
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:46,610
♫  Please tell me now, please tell me now  ♫

822
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:50,480
Right ... Someone said this ...

823
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,010
At times, there are people who are like gifts even in the midst of a tough life.

824
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:01,080
I think you were my gift, Yu Jun.

825
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,990
Take care.

826
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,730
   

827
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:33,520
Mr. Han, how do we know how far away a star is from us?

828
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:42,140
Since the Earth orbits the sun, the same star appears to be at different points depending on where we stand.

829
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:46,840
If you know the difference, you can calculate and measure the distance.

830
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,790
This is what we call "Annual Parallax."

831
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,650
Why are you smiling all of a sudden?

832
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:02,220
Oh, "Annual Parallax" is called "Yeonju Shicha" in my native language, Korean.

833
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,010
This word just makes me feel good.

834
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,870
Why?

835
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:52,980
 My life has always consisted of dreaming about another place instead of where I was. 

836
01:08:52,980 --> 01:09:01,110
 But now when I look back, I realize that what I truly missed were the past moments. 

837
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,270
 I wanted to be someone different from who I was. 

838
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:10,840
 But in the end, I was able to do everything because of being myself .

839
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,690
 No matter what my face looked like, I didn't lose myself, 

840
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:19,190
 and that was why I could do anything. 

841
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,800
   

842
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,250
   

843
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,050
You worked so hard and passed the bar exam.

844
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,230
And the first thing you wanted to do is ...

845
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,940
There's no jokkbaengi in the USA.

846
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,400
Let's just eat jokkbaengi and go back. All right?

847
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,520
The land is so vast in the US. So many people got on my nerves.

848
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,420
You're all dead. You just wait.

849
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,330
   

850
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,580
   

851
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,310
Gosh ...

852
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,210
Did you call him?

853
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:10,190
He's been asking me every day when we're coming back.

854
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,260
That's why he asked you.

855
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,950
♫  Remember the words spoken through dry lips  ♫

856
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,690
Attorney Jo! Attorney Jo!

857
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:20,330
Where do you think you're going?

858
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:24,010
Gosh, seriously. What is that?

859
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,630
Jokkbaengi.

860
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,120
You brought this smelly thing all the way here?

861
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:33,540
That's what I mean! I brought this smelly thing just in time for your plane to land.

862
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,450
Stop using me.

863
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:41,490
I don't know anyone else in Korea, Ajeossi.

864
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,640
Where did you get it?

865
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,970
Where do you think?
