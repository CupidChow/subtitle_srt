1
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,760
It wasn't my fault.
    

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,540
I received money in exchange

3
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,880
for confessing that I set the fire.

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,670
You received money?

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,760
From whom? From whom did you get it?

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,400
I don't know who he was.

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,280
But when that man came to visit me at the police station,

8
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,820
he said he worked for Hanju.

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,510
You received money from Hanju?

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,190
Why?

11
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,330
So the money I used to eat and study ...

12
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,410
Was that Hanju's money?

13
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,550
Exactly why did you take that money? Why?

14
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,480
Perhaps ...

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,110
the Hanju worker who came all the way to the police station ...

16
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,120
Was it this man?

17
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,450
     

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,450
     

19
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,680
 You! You made a fuss saying you'd burn this place down! 

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,050
 And you really did it! 

21
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,650
 - What is he saying? 
 - What! 

22
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,590
 - Is that true? 
 - That monster! 

23
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,020
I was accused by an entire crowd at the scene.

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,890
I wasn't given a choice, and was dragged to the police station then and there.

25
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,790
   

26
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,660
I heard that my mother was sent

27
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,700
to the crematory without having a funeral.

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,020
I was only able to go all the way there after a great deal of begging.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,380
 Why are you here? Who do you think you are? 

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,450
 It's all because of you, Dad. 

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,910
 Why did you call Grandma? 

32
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,060
 Whenever you show up, it's always a mess! 

33
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,840
 You should've just stayed in jail. Why did you get out! 

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,530
 Yeon Ju ... 

35
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,450
 Dad's being misunderstood right now. 

36
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,880
 The truth will be revealed soon. Really! 

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,750
 I swear before my mother. 

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,640
 It really is a misunderstanding. As soon as I'm released, 

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,110
 I'll explain everything, all right? 

40
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,130
 Oh, oh, Mother ... 

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,590
   

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,200
 Welcoâ€” 

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,880
 May I put this leaflet ... 

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,770
 Tape one up over there and go. 

45
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,980
 Investigations reveal that the fire at the Hanju factory on the 2nd 

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,580
 was caused by a former employee's revenge. 

47
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,240
 A Seopyeong police officer on the case said  

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,800
 the suspect, Mr. Kang, spoke many times about burning down the factory. 

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,420
 His arson began in a factory trashcan, 

50
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,850
 and he has admitted to his crime. 

51
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,130
You disappeared like that.

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,560
When I saw on the news that you had confessed,

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,870
how do you think I felt?

54
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,380
It felt like the final straw I was grasping

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,700
suddenly broke at that moment.

56
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,770
 I had no choice. 

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,430
 Who are you? 

58
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,310
 If you are my lawyer, please get me out of here. 

59
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,710
 This is really unfair. 

60
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,180
 - What is?
 - Sorry? 

61
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,480
 - What is unfair?
 - I didn't cause the fire! 

62
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,450
 But you were going to. 

63
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,120
 No, that ... that was just a manner of speech! 

64
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,310
 I wasn't actually going to set it on fire. 

65
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,300
 Will people believe you? 

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,860
 Even if you say that, 

67
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,500
 who'll believe a past criminal 

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,080
 who used to be in a gang? 

69
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,440
 You'll find it hard to get out anyway. 

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,300
 Criminals like you should be familiar with this situation. 

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,190
 What do you think about living 

72
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,860
 a quiet life while getting money for it? 

73
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:53,390


74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,390
At that moment,

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,260
I thought that what my daughter needed

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,880
wasn't some incompetent father.

77
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,450
It was money.

78
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,230
So I accepted. All I demanded was

79
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,490
that you to never find out

80
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,700
that I was the one who sent you the money.

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,740
Why did you decide that on your own? Why?

82
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,410
You ... when I was next to you,

83
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,400
you were always victimized.

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,490
But why would you think like that!

85
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,570
 Whenever you show up, it's always a mess! 

86
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,180
 You should've just stayed in jail, why did you get out! 

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,270
 Why do you keep blowing up my life like land mines are hidden here and there? 

88
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,550
 Why? Why? 

89
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,760
Ms. Yeon Ju.

90
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,720
Okay then, you no longer have a choice.

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,350
Tell me ... Tell me everything you know about Kang Mi Na.

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,590
Who is that woman?

93
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,700
A while ago,

94
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,450
I found a medicine bag in her room with someone else's name on it.

95
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,920
   

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,100
 Jo Yeon Ju. 

97
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,040
   

98
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,400
It had a hospital's name instead of a pharmacy's name,

99
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,910
so I called the hospital immediately.

100
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,610
Apparently my wife has records in one of their wards.

101
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,210
I went and asked right away.

102
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,070
 Which room is patient Jo Yeon Ju in? 

103
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,840
 I want to visit her. 

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
 It shows that she was discharged. 

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,280
 She came and left right away. 

106
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,040
 That's not right. 

107
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,360
 This woman, was it her? 

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,690
 Yes, it was her. She stayed for a little bit and was discharged. 

109
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,270
 May I see her record? 

110
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,340
 I'm sorry, but that's a hard request. 

111
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,550
I didn't get any further.

112
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,050
She told me she couldn't reveal VIP patients' personal information.

113
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,960
Is that all?

114
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,970
You only know her name and age?

115
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,940
Really, Nuna!

116
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,420
That woman ... what will happen to her?

117
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,460
Haven't you grasped the situation yet?

118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,770
Jo Yeon Ju ...

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,470
I feel like I've heard that name somewhere.

120
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,150
Find a person for me.

121
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,150
All I know is the name and age.

122
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,130
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,460
Here.

124
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,610
When I was young, I was often called to emergency rooms.

125
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,840
"Your father was stabbed,"

126
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,090
or "your father punched someone into a paste."

127
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,570
There were so many incidents like that.

128
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,190
So that's why you knew these were in emergency rooms.

129
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,430
That money ...

130
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,300
Someone told me that Grandma had claimed insurance for me.

131
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,040
I was young, so I didn't even think of looking through the documents.

132
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,240
There's no way to find that person anymore.

133
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,840
I don't have the courage to face you anymore.

134
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,670
You don't need to think that way.

135
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,580
No. "One person is never 100% responsible when something happens."

136
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,430
My grandma used to say that.

137
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,840
But ... today, after hearing what happened,

138
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,410
I think it is because of me.

139
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,270
If I had just stopped grandma from going there that day,

140
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,260
she'd still be alive.

141
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,880
My father also wouldn't have let himself be accused so willingly.

142
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,260
Well, it is all my fault.

143
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,210
But ... what kind of life is like this?

144
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,620
Since I was born, there has never been a time when I didn't work hard.

145
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,780
How come I constantly have to feel ashamed, embarrassed

146
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,220
and miserable like this?

147
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,740
I hate it so much. Really.

148
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,360
It's understandable.

149
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,640
You told me that he didn't do a good job as a dad.

150
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,090
In and out of jail. Getting out when people were about to forget the incident.

151
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,880
Causing problems for your grandma and you

152
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,250
that embarrassed you.

153
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,170
Your grandmother had to make a living by herself.

154
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,020
How do you know all this so well?

155
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,750
Your father told me.

156
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,830
On top of that, you learned the truth about your dad today.

157
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,670
I can understand that you hate it.

158
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,570
So ...

159
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,310
Let's get rid of at least one of the issues.

160
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,240
What do you mean?

161
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,970
You have to find who did that to your grandma.

162
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,260
You also have to get revenge on the lawyer from then.

163
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,840
You also have to hate your father, and have to act like Kang Mi Na.

164
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,950
Aigoo ... You must have been struggling for so long.

165
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,010
Let's get rid of at least one by starting with your hatred toward your father.

166
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:11,170
How can I do that right away? There are things I said, things I did ...

167
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,520
You said humans are complex and multidimensional.

168
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,590
You said that yourself.

169
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,330
So think, "That may have been me in the past, but I guess I've grown as a person,"

170
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,180
and you should accept it.

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,910
Here.

172
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,970
Cheers.

173
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,260
Cheers.

174
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,630
Cheers.

175
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,410
I feel cheered up.

176
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,320
I cheered you up, didn't I? One more?

177
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,710
   

178
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,720
   

179
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,860
   

180
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,780
She's the daughter of the Hanju factory arsonist.

181
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,120
   

182
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,750
   

183
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,810
   

184
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,360
 The prosecutor in charge, at the time, was Ryu Seung Deok from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' office. 

185
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,560
Both the Hanju factory's arson and the hit and run incident

186
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,680
must not have been investigated very seriously.

187
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,650
He's an enemy for both of you.

188
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,820
Jeong Do Wu gave money to someone named Jang Seok Ho and told him to kill Kang Mi Na.

189
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,880
It was because Kang Mi Na had something that could harm the Hanju Group.

190
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,300
And you're saying that we found details of the incident from 14 years ago on her tablet?

191
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,530
Yes, 14 years ago Jeong Do Wu paid Jang Seok Ho to give false testimony

192
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,830
and blamed it on Yeon Ju's father.

193
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,750
I'm also sure that the Hanju group committed the arson.

194
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,610
So ...

195
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,230
the most important thing is

196
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,040
that you two aren't the children of the people

197
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,510
who harmed each others' parents.

198
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,680
That's good.

199
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,550
Is that important right now?

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,620
That is the most important thing to me.

201
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,020
For today, at least, let's go home and rest comfortably.

202
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,450
No way, how can I go and sleep at the Hanju family house after hearing all these stories?

203
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,620
No, I'll just tell them I'm working overnight at the office,

204
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,540
so cover for me, will you?

205
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,090
I think we'll go to Seopyeong early in the morning anyway,

206
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,160
and listen to her father's story a little more.

207
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,510
Do that, then.

208
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,730
Oh, right, the schedule ...

209
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,390
Tomorrow there's a memorial service for the death anniversary of Chairman Han's oldest son,

210
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,360
and also a shareholders' meeting.

211
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,250
The meeting must be happening because of the shares I handed over.

212
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's just be there so we're not late for the meeting.

213
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,320
By the way, if you stay out again, will they let it slide?

214
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,660
I let it slip once and now she stays out like it's second nature.

215
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,130
Are you sure she's at work?

216
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,560
Wherever she is, I hope she's there at the memorial service.

217
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,370
There are not many people attending, so having the Chairwoman of Yumin Foundation would look good for us.

218
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,190
Is looking good so important to you?

219
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,860
Why did you even come up with the memorial service?

220
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm so frustrated holding the service with just a few family members.

221
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,170
How could you say that?

222
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,120
It's better if I believed he lives somewhere far away,

223
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,450
but holding this memorial service as if it's a special day reminds me that my son is dead.

224
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,310
Mother-in-law ...

225
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,480
You love your oldest son so much ...

226
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,820
What a waste, if he were alive, both your love and your stock would be all his.

227
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,090
Hey! By the way,

228
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,470
is Seong Wun not home either?

229
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,630
These two ... Are they acting up as a couple or what?

230
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,060
I knew you'd come.

231
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,880
How dare you call me?

232
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,160
You came anyway, even though you didn't have to.

233
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,880
I knew I could rely on you.

234
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,350
- Were you destroyed by your older sister? 
 - What?

235
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,930
What? "Destroyed" is not slang, it's standard language.

236
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:26,110
By the way, don't you think at all when doing something?

237
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,710
I mean ... Do you even have a brain?

238
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,760
Why call me when all this is happening?

239
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,530
Because of your perfect diction, it definitely hits differently when you swear at me.

240
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,660
Before I start swearing at you with perfect diction, don't ever call me again.

241
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,070
Do you think I'm here because I still have feelings for you?

242
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,810
I came to warn you.

243
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,030
You better stop acting up because your life hurts and be quiet.

244
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,500
My life is still not hurting.

245
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,410
Yours is not hurting?

246
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,260
What are you talking about?

247
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,990
Why would I tell you that?

248
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,790
Enjoy drinking for the last time and go home.

249
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,960
Tomorrow, after the shareholders' meeting, you will be ignored.

250
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,000
What's up?

251
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,470
Now you're Chief District Prosecutor, are you saying you're above the Chief of Seopyeong Branch?

252
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,960
You haven't contacted me once.

253
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,090
I have no time to joke around. What is it?

254
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,000
Why are you acting all busy?

255
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,720
You know the Hanju's daughter-in-law case that got you transferred here in the past?

256
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,980
 Yes, what about it? 

257
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,850
You know the kid who took charge of it? Ahn Yu Jun?

258
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,230
 I was looking for him because I had some work for him. 

259
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,010
 I couldn't see him anywhere. 

260
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,370
But ... he was at the archives room.

261
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,730
What are you saying?

262
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,920
 I wondered what he was doing, so I looked at his application for inspection. 

263
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,610
 You know the Hanju factory arson case from the past? 

264
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,170
 He copied everything from that and took it with him. 

265
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,240
 Did you happen to give him a separate order regarding the Hanju Group? 

266
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,440
   

267
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,100
   

268
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,770
Hey, it's me. Is Prosecutor Jo in?

269
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,690
She took sick leave today.

270
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,280
What?

271
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,590
Damn ...

272
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,210
Oh, you're here already!

273
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,130
Since no one has come in, I came out to check the time.

274
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,840
Ah, yes. We'll be in soon.

275
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,010
Seeing that you came yesterday and again today, that punk must really be giving you a hard time?

276
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,320
Normally, punks who go around setting fires don't have a sense of guilt.

277
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,800
He also comes from a gangster background, so I'm sure he's even worse.

278
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,320
Good luck.

279
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,630
So ... just because I heard all that yesterday ...

280
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,450
it doesn't mean that I'll suddenly be fine.

281
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,010
But anyway, we both had a misunderstanding.

282
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,410
You're also not completely innocent since you were paid to be falsely charged.

283
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,460
You're an accomplice!

284
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm fine,

285
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,350
so strengthen your heart now.

286
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,640
Whether I strengthen my heart or not,

287
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,550
I'll try to get you out.

288
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,200
I wanted to help you at least once.

289
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,720
I intended to serve my time by telling myself,

290
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,800
it's punishment for my mother passing away.

291
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,730
But because of hiding the truth,

292
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,430
I ended up doing the wrong thing by him.

293
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,520
I also thought I should tell you that what happened to his father

294
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,090
wasn't because of me.

295
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,210
I said, I got it.

296
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,760
But what in the world happened that day?

297
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,590
That was the day I heard you were released.

298
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,160
 You made kong-bij*. Did Father come by? 
  (A thick Korean bean soup)  

299
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,610
 Just eat quietly. 

300
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,020
 When was he released? I'm not eating. 

301
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,190
 He didn't come here! He said he wouldn't come home because he knew you'd be like this. 

302
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,870
 He walks on eggshells around you,  

303
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,940
 and he's so busy from that, that he doesn't come to see me, even when I make his favorite, kong-biji. 

304
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,160
 He said it's been a while since he was released. 

305
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,510
 He said he got a job! At a big company. 

306
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,200
 - "Big company"?
 - The Hanju Fashion factory over there. 

307
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,700
 Are you sure he won't be protesting like last time? 

308
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,900
 He's an employee! A production worker. 

309
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,860
 I don't know how long he's going to last. 

310
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,290
 He said it's almost been a month. 

311
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,390
 Grandma! 

312
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,060
 Throw away that hope of yours now. 

313
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,860
 "I'm done now. I'll never fight again." 

314
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,070
 He said that, but the cops still called us. 

315
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,370
 Was it just once or twice? He didn't get his act together because you kept falling for it since you're his mom. 

316
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,430
 You're right. My Yeon Ju is so smart. 

317
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,840
 From now on, I should never fall for it. 

318
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,100
 I should give him a harsh scolding and guide him toward the path of virtue. 

319
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,710
 But this kind of stuff is for actors on TV. 

320
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,810
 It's a story about mothers of independence fighters. Great people like them. 

321
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,890
 But I can't do that because I feel bad for not raising my child right. 

322
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,060
 Who else would happily greet him and make him a meal, if it's not me? 

323
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,890
 What about you? Whenever someone talks about your father, you lose your temper and get into fights. 

324
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,930
 You even dropped out of school. What about you? 

325
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,210
 What have you done so right for me that lets you look past your bad behavior? 

326
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,100
 I am just asking you to think about me too. 

327
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,600
 So let's say you're like that because he's your child. What have I done wrong to deserve this? 

328
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,980
 Not all children please their parents. 

329
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,120
 And it's the same for parents and children. 

330
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,480
 It can happen that you don't like your parents. 

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,440
 It may seem unfair when you see someone has good parents ... But what can you do about it? 

332
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,370
 That darn fool ...  

333
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,660
 At least we're lucky we had a call to say he's working at a factory 

334
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,000
 rather than a call from the police station. 

335
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,220
 He'll be fine, as long as he doesn't lose his temper and beat people up. 

336
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,100
 I don't trust him. I bet it will only be a few days until he causes a problem this time, too. 

337
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,490
   

338
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,300
 You know about the burglary at the office yesterday, don't you? 

339
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,790
 - Where customers' payments completely disappeared?
 - Yes. 

340
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,750
 It's either a100% inside job, 

341
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:03,810
 or even if it was done by an outsider  ... we're thinking that there is probably an inside accomplice. 

342
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,120
 I saw that you had a criminal history and a record. 

343
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,440
 From what I learned, it also seems that your family is struggling. 

344
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,820
 What are you saying? 

345
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,900
 I haven't even been here that long. 

346
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
 How would I know where that money is? 

347
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,130
-  Search me! 
 - That day ... apparently someone really high up was coming.

348
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,680
Which is why I think they were trying to cover it up as fast as they could.

349
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,210
 I'm telling you, they didn't want to believe me from the start! 

350
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,460
 They wanted to say that I was the culprit! 

351
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,760
 I haven't even work yet, but they gave me next month's pay and told me to leave. 

352
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,190
 If they really thought I did it, why give me this money? 

353
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,980
 They have no evidence either, but they still framed me as the culprit. 

354
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,510
 So they gave me this because of their guilty conscience! 

355
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,570
 If they investigated, they'd know it wasn't you. What's wrong with them? 

356
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,720
 They're saying that they investigated, and they saw I had a criminal record. 

357
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,690
 Is everyone with a record a thief? 

358
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,810
 As you know, it was all violence with me, Mom. I'm clean regarding theft! 

359
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,550
 Gosh ... that's something to boast about! 

360
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,920
 All this time, you've always beaten people for the smallest things, 

361
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,510
 and have tried to solve everything with your strength. 

362
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,270
 That's why you're a suspect when something happens! 

363
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,890
 If that's how you're going to talk, I'm hanging up! 

364
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,200
 How dare these punks look down on Nammun gang's protector? 

365
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
 I can't take this ... I won't take it! 

366
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,620
  I'm going to burn this in front of them so all those punks can see! 

367
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,790
 This worthless money ... 

368
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,450
 I'm going to burn it to ash where everyone can see. 

369
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,320
 You hurt my pride. 

370
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,980
 Theft? Who do they think I am? 

371
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,840
 Damn it. 

372
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,440
 What is it?! 

373
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,830
 What foolish thing are you doing over there? 

374
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,670
 Burn what? You idiot ... just how much did you drink? 

375
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,170
 You fool. 

376
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:48,230
 Don't be a nuisance in the middle of the night. Just stay right there, all right? 

377
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,110
 I will go there now. 

378
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,110
 Don't do anything, and stay still! 

379
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,640
 Where are you going? 

380
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,490
 We have to go get your father. Lead the way. 

381
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,750
 You see? He did end up causing trouble. 

382
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,380
 What is it now? Did he get into a gang fight somewhere? 

383
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,410
 He hasn't caused trouble yet. 

384
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,970
 Go ahead and knock yourself out! I'm not going. I'm sick of this. 

385
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,600
 I'm doing this because I want them to listen to me. 

386
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
 Burning this, 

387
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,550
 isn't such a big disaster. Why is that old woman overreacting? 

388
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,550
 Damn ... that old lady. 

389
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,750
 How is she going to come here at this hour of night? 

390
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,930
 The old lady should just stay home ... 

391
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,300
 How is she thinking of getting here? 

392
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,940
 Why is there smoke? 

393
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,610
 I haven't even set it on fire. 

394
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,480
But ... I got a strange feeling.

395
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,710
Why? Why did you?

396
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,490
It seemed a little ... different from earlier.

397
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,180
 What is this? 

398
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,490
 Something was burning that wasn't there earlier. 

399
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,350
 There was a Hanju Fashion logo on the cover. 

400
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,040
   

401
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,970
An accounting ledger ...

402
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,300
It looked something like that.

403
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,530
Are you saying that an accounting ledger from Hanju Fashion was outside?

404
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,700
 He might have been trying to move the ledgers elsewhere.  

405
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,250
 Or maybe he was trying to burn them because he thought it was too late ... 

406
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,610
 Because of those ledgers, he couldn't get out of the factory even when it was on fire. 

407
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,430
An accounting ledger was outside ... but why was he inside?

408
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,800
Maybe he wasn't able to come out ...

409
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,430
The higher-up who was supposed to come that day ... maybe it was your father?

410
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,690
My father came without notice,

411
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,770
which is why nobody knew he was inside the burning factory.

412
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,730
They later found his car in the parking lot.

413
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,280
It seems he drove himself there, too.

414
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,060
Then who was the super higher-up who was supposed to come that day?

415
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,190
I'm not sure ... At that time, Hanju Fashion was under Hanju Products.

416
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,310
It might have been my uncle.

417
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,340
He was the president of Hanju Products at that time.

418
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,560
It was he who benefited most after my father passed away.

419
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,460
You said that your father's car

420
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,620
was the only one at the parking lot that day, right?

421
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,020
While working as a prosecutor, a warrant is usually requested for a hit-and-run case.

422
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,270
I got close to a traffic-police lieutenant because of that, and he said this ...

423
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,530
"The most important thing in a hit-and-run case"

424
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,180
"is where the car appeared from?"

425
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,350
My grandmother's accident

426
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,920
was so long time ago there were no CCTVs at the scene,

427
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,590
let alone around the area.

428
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,120
There were no witness and no traces of anything,

429
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,150
so I couldn't figure out just where that car came from.

430
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,510
What if something happened between Chairman Han Yeong Sik and your father,

431
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,760
and after that, the chairman left in his car.

432
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,390
There's a possibility that he might've hit my grandmother.

433
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,700
I think I'll have to go to Seopyeong Branch Office. Let's go.

434
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,590
   

435
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,370
If we look at the case report,

436
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,550
it's a complete mess.

437
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,320
Most of the conversations from the investigation process have been omitted.

438
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,080
- Can they do that?
 - What they choose to record

439
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,630
is decided by the prosecutor in charge of preparing the report.

440
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,090
Then did a higher-up even come by that day?

441
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,430
According to the prosecutor's report, the factory people testified

442
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,740
that no one was scheduled to come by or actually came by.

443
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,750
   

444
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,180
 But that man, Jeong Do Wu, 
   

445
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,890
 who went around that night asking people to bear false witness, 

446
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,020
 was Chairman Han Yeong Sik's driver at the time. 

447
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,740
Right ... that's why it's hard to say if he went there alone on the day of the accident.

448
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,820
But Chairman Han's alibi was recorded. He was at his office at that time.

449
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,800
Being at the office could be fabricated.

450
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,500
There's also a witness who appeared only in the very early reports, isn't there?

451
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,930
He said that he heard someone fighting while he was leaving work late.

452
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,310
That person is in the prosecutor's record, too.

453
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,280
But the next day, he changed his testimony

454
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,710
to say he might've heard wrongly.

455
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,880
Then we'll have to find that person!

456
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,480
He passed away.

457
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,760
He passed away about two weeks after the factory accident.

458
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,990
His death was presumed to be due to overworking,

459
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,540
so there wasn't much investigation.

460
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Seriously ...

461
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,840
Hey, but ... what's up with the smooth back-and-forth?

462
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,540
How are you guys doing so well?

463
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,590
   

464
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,440
 I brought it in just in case 

465
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,870
 you might be interested in the Hanju Group. 

466
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,930
I did all the investigation I was able to do and brought it in.

467
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,740
I recently found out that the witness passed away after I gave him the USB.

468
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,520
But, so much time has passed,

469
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,720
and there are no medical records left.

470
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,180
There wasn't much that I could do.

471
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,900
So you're saying that now we have to discover something that's not even in the prosecutor's report,

472
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,310
as well as things we don't know about because time has passed, right?

473
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,080
That's right.

474
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,200
- Why are you getting up?
 - It looks like the savings account has matured.

475
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,690
- What do you mean?
 - All these things

476
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,920
that happened in Seopyeong.

477
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,390
Let's go and get our money. Let's go!

478
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,110
Aigoo, aigoo, Prosecutor Jo!

479
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,040
- Wow! It's been a long time!
 - You're well, right?

480
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,560
The dispatch route for fire trucks is ...

481
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,880
 "the road of life"! 

482
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,090
You haven't changed a bit.

483
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,170
If you need anything or have any problems,

484
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,870
you can contact this man anytime.

485
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,470
Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun from the Western District Office in Seopyeong.

486
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,250
Gosh, as for our Seopyeong station,

487
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,890
even before the Fire Civil Services Act changed, we were allowed to ram

488
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,200
fire trucks into any vehicles parked illegally.

489
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,670
You've made sure it is done in goodwill

490
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,980
and had them pay all the penalties, Prosecutor Jo.

491
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,040
Thanks to that, it's made our job so much easier.

492
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,700
Gosh, that was a given.

493
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,850
Ambulances and fire trucks must be able to go wherever without problems.

494
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,230
That's not all. Since you know all the connections,

495
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,500
the corruption with the higher-ups' fire inspections

496
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,120
was caught without fail.

497
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,870
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say all that.

498
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,180
Of course. You know how to say everything you want

499
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,330
and be cautious at the same time. You haven't changed.

500
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,160
A person shouldn't change.

501
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,070
But you know, you've lived in Seopyeong for nearly 15 years, right?

502
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,200
In Seopyeong, a nice city to live in,

503
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,290
- there aren't that many fires, right?
 - Right.

504
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,540
Why? What do you want to know?

505
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,930
Can you speak with me for a moment?

506
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,650
Sure. Let's go inside.

507
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,250
That "savings account" she mentioned ...

508
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,800
I guess she relied on people.

509
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,150
The fire at the Hanju factory. Sure, I remember.

510
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,900
It was when I first started.

511
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,810
They say you remember those moments until you retire.

512
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,050
- Someone died that night, right?
 - Yes.

513
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,160
Many people lived in the dormitory,

514
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,870
but someone got them out beforehand.

515
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,800
But you know, people are so strange.

516
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,250
I thought he was such an upright person,

517
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,580
but it turned out he was the arsonist.

518
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,520
By any chance, did you notice anything strange at the site that night?

519
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,430
The deceased person was probably

520
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,130
trapped because of the firewall coming down.

521
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,030
It was already too late when we found him.

522
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,530
When there's a fire, victims are usually

523
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,920
found near an exit or by a window.

524
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,460
So it wasn't strange to find him there.

525
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,560
But there was no trace of anything.

526
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:06,060
- "No trace"?
 - When they come to the firewall,

527
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,020
they usually fumble around looking for it

528
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,740
or slam into it.

529
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
It really breaks your heart

530
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,420
seeing hand prints on the firewall,

531
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,480
or traces of their efforts trying to open the shutters.

532
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,430
But then that time ...

533
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,370
there were no traces of that whatsoever.

534
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,720
Even if he used all his energy trying to get to that point,

535
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,480
he was lying too straight to say it happened that way.

536
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,090
But since it was arson,

537
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,070
I figured the police would conduct an autopsy or something.

538
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,310
So I let it be.

539
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,480
   

540
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,300
I never heard about any autopsy.

541
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,250
Before the police arrived at the hospital, my uncle moved my father to Hanju Hospital.

542
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,100
Wherever they moved him, they could've requested an autopsy.

543
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,620
There was no request to begin with.

544
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
He's a chief prosecutor.

545
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,570
Why is he asking me to record what his junior is doing on her sick day off?

546
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,930
Is this for an investigation?

547
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,140
Since she can't go to the police, she wants to get it through the fire station?

548
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,230
These guys are trying to be clever.

549
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,990
 - Wow! It's been a long time!
 - You're well, right? 

550
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,310
Let me see. This is Ahn Yu Jun,

551
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,580
but who is this jerk?

552
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,350
Where have I seen him?

553
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,680
Was he an employee at the mall?

554
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,630
   

555
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,600
What? She showed up in Seopyeong?

556
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,050
Yes. She's going around in broad daylight with two men.

557
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,740
Are you sure it's the woman who chased you for the USB?

558
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,780
Geez, I'm telling you I'm sure.

559
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,100
It doesn't matter if she had a mask on. Guys like me have gut feelings.

560
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,730
What should I do? I'm following her right now.

561
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,980
Just follow her for now.

562
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,200
And have you heard of the name Jo Yeon Ju?

563
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,640
"Jo Yeon Ju"?

564
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,610
Wait, I've heard that name a lot.

565
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,140
- Is that tabloid article true?
 - Yes.

566
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,130
Wow, what does this mean?

567
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,070
So you weren't trying to quieten that rumor,

568
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,580
you submitted a paternity test to try and prove the rumor true?

569
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,490
I couldn't tell you, but that is the fact.

570
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,470
So why are you telling me now?

571
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,730
The paternity test's results from the sample you provided will be ready today.

572
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,200
Since we're tight for time, the analysis will be delivered directly to the shareholders' meeting.

573
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,530
You'll have to reveal the results there.

574
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,610
Wow, that means the Chairwoman's position at Yumin is done for.

575
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,470
No, that's not a problem here.

576
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,640
She'll be arrested right away.

577
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,890
I contacted SBC* and planted a reporter at the shareholders' meeting. 
  (Seoul Broadcasting System) 

578
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:17,420
Once you reveal it, it's only a matter of time before the whole world knows.

579
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,380
But is it right to reveal it as publicly as this?

580
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,900
If we're not careful, we could be humiliated for being deceived by a fraud like her.

581
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,430
Oh, my. I'm doing this for your sake, though.

582
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,260
Are you?

583
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,630
You should pay attention to your own interests.

584
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,680
After all, she's Chairwoman of Yumin. It won't be easy to remove her unless it's done publicly like this.

585
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,500
Besides, the deceiver is at fault. We who fell for it are the victims, aren't we?

586
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,320
Well, I guess so.

587
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,780
We can't lose something bigger just by trying to avoid some humiliation.

588
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,920
Then where is my real niece?

589
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,160
The fake one must know.

590
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,330
But the fake one could've done something to the real one, don't you think?

591
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,290
It's horrible to think that,

592
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,740
but we don't need the real one to appear at this point.

593
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,950
I do think the Prosecutors' Office could investigate properly, though.

594
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,560
What do you think about that, Director?

595
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,770
Well, if that happens,

596
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,790
my heart will break, but what can we do.

597
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,810
That girl was always a troublemaker for our family. And we weren't that close anyway, even though she is my niece.

598
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,460
In any case, as long as that fraudster is arrested,

599
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,240
I won't forget how hard you worked for this, Director Han.

600
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,150
Do you think there were CCTVs inside the Seopyeong factory?

601
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,890
Even if there were, they wouldn't still be around.

602
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,860
Instead of asking factory workers from that time,

603
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,190
how about we look for witnesses who might've been nearby?

604
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,760
Since the factory was in such an isolated spot,

605
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,790
no one frequented that area besides factory workers.

606
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,550
There is someone who was near the factory.

607
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,650
Who?

608
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,120
Me.

609
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,200
My grandma got into an accident near the factory that day.

610
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,810
I was close to my grandma.

611
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,710
Do you remember anything?

612
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,680
That's the problem. I was so out of it that day.

613
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,110
I can barely remember things that are so spotty in my memory.

614
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,370
 It's worth it. Since we're relying on her memory, it can't be used as evidence. 

615
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,070
But it could be helpful to the investigation.

616
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,850
If you're desperately wanting to remember, it could be effective.

617
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,710
- All right, shall we start?
 - Yes.

618
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,360
Relax as you inhale and exhale.

619
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,940
Let's start now.

620
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,370
Bring out your past memories.

621
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,000
Deep in your heart, what kind of images

622
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,630
have you stored, like a camera?

623
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,810
All right, let's go back into your memory.

624
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,540
It is now the evening of October 2, 2007.

625
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,340
 Gosh, this temper of mine is all from Grandma. 

626
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,950
 I can't believe she was miffed just because I got angry. 

627
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,970
 The buses stop working early. Isn't she scared to go out by herself this late at night? 

628
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,750
It's strange ...

629
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,840
What's strange?

630
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,520
The buses end early in this area,

631
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,360
and cars don't often come here. But there's a car.

632
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,160
What's even stranger is that,

633
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,330
luxury cars like that one don't come here.

634
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,790
Why is that car here?

635
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,840
What model of car is it?

636
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,070
I don't know. It's my first time seeing that kind of car.

637
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,260
But the car's emblem is ...

638
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,170
like a scarab beetle.

639
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,730
I see.

640
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,600
And now you can see the car's license plate.

641
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,520
What is it?

642
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,630
Five and ...

643
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,920
eight! I see an eight.

644
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,890
     

645
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,350
   

646
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,930
3-2-5-8.
    

647
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,000
A scarab beetle emblem.

648
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,640
It was my Uncle's car. 
    

649
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,140
There are no more articles on it.

650
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,870
There was no release of a limited-edition model, either.

651
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,060
Yes, I understand.

652
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,980
They scrapped that car on October 3, 2007.

653
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,100
That's the very next day.

654
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,130
Chairman Han Yeong Sik drove that car alone and hit my grandmother.

655
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,370
And Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok covered it up for him.

656
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,370
But right now, if Chairman Han doesn't admit to it, there's nothing we can do.

657
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:06,590
Too much time has passed and there's no evidence that it was him.

658
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,380
Too much time has passed. We have a suspect but no evidence.

659
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,930
There's a method that I use sometimes in situations like this.

660
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,830
What's that?

661
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:21,070
When people are fearful, go for the surprise attack.

662
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:28,870
 Normally, you find evidence and then go in. 

663
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:33,580
 But we're just going in, without evidence. 

664
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,930
Why is he here?

665
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,920
What brings you here?

666
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,580
I was in America when I heard of Hyeong Seong Chan's passing, so I wasn't able to come and see him.

667
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,170
I thought I should come by at least once.

668
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,790
Come in.

669
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:10,130
Living with guilt can't be comfortable for anyone.

670
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,320
So, if we start stirring up an event that has long passed,

671
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,080
all those forgotten memories

672
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,070
will float up like rice in sikhye*. 
  (A drink with rice floating inside) 

673
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,920
No matter how much time passes, on this day, it always feels as if it was yesterday.

674
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,140
A sudden death will do that to you.

675
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,510
The day my father died is still fresh in my mind as well.

676
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,770
The day my father passed away,

677
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,870
weren't you at the Seopyeong factory?

678
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,840
 And then suddenly, he'll get flustered, like he has a glitch. 

679
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

680
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,410
I've heard something about your alibi for that night that seems suspicious.

681
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
Alibi?

682
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,440
What have you heard, to be saying such things?

683
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,280
Do you have any proof that I was there?

684
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,040
I don't.

685
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,210
But the proof that you weren't there isn't quite believable either.

686
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,290
 They'll go straight to see their accomplice they haven't contacted in all this time. 

687
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,260
 They will do strange things after that. 

688
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,400
I don't know why I have to say something like this,

689
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,660
but if there is a witness you can believe, would that be enough?

690
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,410
Do you have someone like that?

691
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,320
Director Kim.

692
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,230
Weren't you at the company's offices the night Seung Wuk's father died?

693
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,710
You said you had something to tell me.

694
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,910
Yes. I was there.

695
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,980
 It's more like a double agent. 

696
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,650
 I was also close to the current chairman. 

697
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,950
Seung Wuk, shouldn't you leave now?

698
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:28,800
It's Seong Chan's memorial day. Aren't you being a little too disrespectful to my father on a day like this?

699
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,810
Damn ...

700
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,080
I've always wanted to ask you, at least once,

701
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,200
because I wanted to know how you remember that night.

702
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,020
I'm sorry for bothering you.

703
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,320
What have you been doing lately?

704
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,580
I'm working, as usual.

705
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,790
"As usual"?

706
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,420
If a so-called prosecutor is working as usual,

707
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,140
you should just bury your face into the cases assigned to you.

708
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,230
Are you a groundhog? Why are you digging around here and there?

709
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

710
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,290
Yeah right.

711
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,870
What's this?

712
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,010
Isn't this you?

713
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,630
I'm not sure.

714
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,040
This bastard. Are you playing around with me now?!

715
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,460
You had better quickly come clean.

716
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,620
 Prosecutor Jo! Wow. 

717
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,740
 Long time no see. 

718
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,150
Why did you do that? Did Jo Yeon Ju ask you to do it?

719
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,710
I don't accept requests like that.

720
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,340
What?

721
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,560
Seriously, you green-ass general prosecutor.

722
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,720
Do you think our organization is a joke?

723
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,880
Do you think I'm your friend?

724
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,710
I found out that your family's a bit wealthy,

725
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,710
so you might think there's nothing to be afraid of in this world.

726
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,880
But do you think that in this country,

727
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,650
there is any family that can survive a tax audit?

728
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:30,770
Do you want me to get your cousins, their near and far families, and ruin all of them to the bone!?

729
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,810
Don't make your whole household a mess by acting like a headless chicken.

730
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,690
You should stop here.

731
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,060
Aren't you going to answer?

732
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,780
My goodness, this bastard.

733
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,070
Hey! Don't you know who I am?

734
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,820
I'm Chief District Prosecutor, you bastard!

735
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,680
If I say "bury," everyone buries. Do you understand!?

736
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,780
No matter what you're trying to find out,

737
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,070
do you think this will work?

738
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,290
I'm not doing it because it'll work.

739
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,550
Even if it doesn't work, that's fine.

740
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,820
So are you ...

741
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:24,020
going to keep playing this game?

742
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:37,740
You ... When you summonsed Chairwoman Kang Mi Na for investigation,

743
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,310
who was the one who showed up?

744
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,260
Was it Kang Mi Na

745
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,020
or Jo Yeon Ju?

746
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,400
What is Jo Yeon Ju scheming right now?

747
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,310
Did you think I wouldn't have someone tail her?

748
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,310
What was Seung Wuk talking about, after suddenly showing up?

749
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,310
I know! He totally ruined our party.

750
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,480
Hey! Do you think my son's memorial service is a party?

751
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,030
How can you make that kind of comparison?

752
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,820
I think we let Seung Wuk run free for too long.

753
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,490
Along with my sister-in-law, he'll be sorted out soon.

754
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,340
Everyone has been played by Seung Wuk and my sister-in-law.

755
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,820
Or rather, by the woman pretending to be her.

756
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,390
What are you saying?

757
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:39,670
It's not the time for me to say it right now, but you'll find out everything soon after the shareholders' meeting.

758
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,110
I thought we shouldn't stay until the end of the service because of that  meeting.

759
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,620
I think we should go now.

760
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,490
This is really great.

761
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,260
And to think that you're the only son I have now.

762
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,010
Aigoo!

763
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:07,410
Until what time did you drink last night?

764
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,640
You haven't had so much for a while. Why do it again?

765
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,530
It suits me better to live as an immature idiot.

766
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,650
What's wrong with you?

767
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,340
Did you use drugs?

768
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:21,020
I'm not doing anything as I wish.

769
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,390
It's all about what Nuna wants.

770
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,450
What are you talking about?

771
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,890
Get yourself together and wake up.

772
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,250
Your wife has given you a once-in-a-lifetime chance,  so why are you like this in front of your father?

773
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,080
"Chance"?

774
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,980
Didn't you hear what Nuna said?

775
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,750
It's all over.

776
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:47,130
By any chance, are you meaning the gossip about Sister-in-law?

777
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,960
Are you saying that the gossip about Chairwoman Kang Mi Na being fake

778
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,820
is real?

779
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,090
Why is everyone throwing up such nonsense?

780
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,820
Why are you telling us that now?

781
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,540
Gosh, since Sister-in-law had no issues with her tablet's log in,

782
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,920
I thought it was just gossip.

783
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,500
But I did think it was weird.

784
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:12,060
Not long ago, you had her tested after her accident

785
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,380
and you said she had healthy eggs.

786
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,820
- What about it?
 - She had told me earlier

787
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,810
that she was barren.

788
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,770
What?

789
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:27,260
If that rumor turns out to be true,

790
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,060
I told all kinds of stuff to someone I don't even know!

791
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,730
I kissed her butt so much to flatter her. Gosh!

792
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:42,010
Hey! Kissing her butt is nothing here!

793
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,090
Someone I don't even know

794
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,530
twisted my arm and talked casually to me.

795
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,090
You mean, I was so humiliated by someone like that?

796
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,680
This doesn't make sense!

797
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,990
My goodness. What's going on here?

798
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,590
In fact, besides disclosing the stake change,

799
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,920
there is one more important topic to discuss on today's agenda.

800
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,310
There have been so many rumors

801
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,210
surrounding Yumin Group's Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

802
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,520
More than anything else,

803
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,200
tabloids were circulating and saying that she's a fake.

804
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,010
So in our own way, we contemplated how we should go about

805
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,640
addressing this crisis.

806
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,070
We decided to go head-on and face this issue.

807
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,030
I will speak for myself.

808
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:28,130
Must you discuss such fake news in a meeting like this?

809
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:32,790
If it's not true, it'll be clean and simple to discuss it and explain yourself.

810
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,710
So I have just received paternity test results

811
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,880
between former Chairman Kang Jang Su

812
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:46,870
and Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

813
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,300
What did you run the test with?

814
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,160
I'm sure you couldn't have retrieved his body from the accident.

815
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,440
You're right.

816
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,450
So the villa that Oppa used to enjoy,

817
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,120
Bosung Villa is still being maintained.

818
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:09,450
We didn't have time to clean up the property, but who would've known how useful this would turn out to be?

819
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:13,610
I obtained his razor and toothbrush from there.

820
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,900
And as for Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, I don't know why but

821
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,080
you've been out of the office a lot, and it was hard to meet with you.

822
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,090
Therefore, Chairwoman Kang Mi Na's sample was provided by someone who lives with her,

823
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,800
a member of the Hanju family.

824
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,800
Team Leader, what do I do?

825
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,070
Should I just run away right now?

826
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,960
That'd be even weirder.

827
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:50,010
It seems that the test

828
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,520
revealed something very serious, which we cannot overlook.

829
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,490
So we'll hear the Chairwoman explain herself in public

830
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,940
and ask her to be accountable.

831
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,900
Later you might say that we switched results and whatnot.

832
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:10,030
To prevent any of those suspicions, I'll open the envelope right here.

833
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,520
   

834
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,570
You're all busy people, so I'll just read the crucial information.

835
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,970
"The genes of client Kang Jang Su and"

836
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:33,050
"client Kang Mi Na's were tested in 15 different items, and as a result,"

837
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:38,670
"there are 14 items showing that they share the same genes."

838
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,420
Give me a moment, please.

839
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,250
What are you doing? Hurry up and read on.

840
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,340
Yes, yes, yes ...

841
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:02,390
"Various genes display appropriate links,"

842
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,550
"and they're biologically related"

843
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:12,570
"with 99.9999% certainty."

844
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,610
   

845
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,000
   

846
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:29,490
â™«  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  â™«

847
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,150
â™«  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  â™«

848
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,090
â™«  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  â™«

849
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,700
What did you just say?

850
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,710
Why?

851
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,410
 I'm biologically related to Chairman Kang Jang Su? 

852
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,300
â™«  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  â™«

853
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:08,060
â™«  Let's ride a guitar with a motorcycle  â™«

854
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,580
   

855
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,690
Five and ... eight?

856
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,930
Eight! I see an eight.

857
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:23,910
Now, you'll slowly wake up.

858
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,970
But there's someone in front of me over there.

859
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,560
Grandma?

860
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,390
Grandma.

861
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,530
Don't go, Grandma. Don't go.

862
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,280
 If only I had hung onto Grandma and stopped her from going, 

863
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,070
 she would still be alive. 

864
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,170
 It was 

865
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,100
 all my fault. 

866
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,690
Wait a minute.

867
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,750
I think she has something to say.

868
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,090
Shall I continue?

869
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,790
 Grandma. 

870
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,620
 Grandma. 

871
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,850
 Grandma. 

872
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,550
 Is it you, Yeon Ju? 

873
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,830
 Grandma! 

874
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,490
 Grandma, don't go. It will be bad if you go now. 

875
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,880
 I have to go. 

876
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,330
 Your father is in deep trouble right now. 

877
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,310
 You can't go! If you go now, you'll die! 

878
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,090
 No. I have to go. 

879
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,560
 Even if you tell me not to go, I have to go. 

880
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,590
 I'll be right back. So be well. 

881
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,720
 I said you can't! 

882
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,630
 You'll die because of me. 

883
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,170
 Why would I die because of you? 

884
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,370
 You got your terrible temper from me. 

885
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,950
 If you tell me not to go, do you think I won't go? 

886
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:47,210
 My son is about to cause trouble. I have to go and stop him. 

887
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,990
 I said you can't. 

888
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:54,510
 If you go now, I'll never live in peace. 

889
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,740
 You'll die because of me, 

890
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,520
 and I'll blame and hate myself for the rest of my life. 

891
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,900
 Will you still go? 

892
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,840
 Aigoo. I knew you'd be like this. 

893
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,090
 People who listen well to elders 

894
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,320
 are Olympic gold medalists on TV. 

895
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,890
 Great people like that listen well. 

896
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:20,290
 But since you're my granddaughter, I knew you wouldn't listen to me. 

897
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:27,000
 Yeon Ju ... with everything in this world, 

898
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,580
 one person is never 100% responsible when something happens. 

899
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,040
 It's all because of myself. 

900
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,510
 It's because I'm the one to blame. And because your dad is the one to blame. 

901
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,500
Do you understand?

902
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,270
 A fire starts because of the one who started it. 

903
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:58,540
 And a car accident is caused by a bad driver. 

904
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,480
 Whether you live a good life or not is your responsibility. 

905
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,880
 So, you should stop all that now. 

906
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,210
 From now on, think of yourself and live well. 

907
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:13,490
 I do live well, Grandma. 

908
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:17,590
 I became a prosecutor. 

909
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:24,160
 And the fire at that factory ... Father didn't start it! 

910
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,690
 You're successful, my puppy. 

911
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:44,100
 See? Your father may lose his temper and hit someone, 

912
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,860
 but he's not the type to start a fire. See? 

913
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:56,270
 Grandma, I'll make sure to find 

914
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,930
 out who did that to you. 

915
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:05,080
 And I'll clear Father's name, too. 

916
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:10,060
 So, don't worry, Grandma, you can go now. 

917
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:14,390
 All right. 

918
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,880
 All right, all right. 

919
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:33,170
â™«  One day If the day comes when I confront my feelings  â™«

920
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:36,810
â™«  I will surely cry  â™«

921
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,910
â™«  Hugging myself in my own embrace  â™«

922
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,130
â™«  Some day  â™«

923
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:08,610
 Why don't you wear these shoes at least? 

924
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,040
 Grandma! 

925
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:44,740


926
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:52,090
     

927
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:55,270
 I also express deep disappointment in the Hanju Group who used my DNA sample 

928
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,690
 without my consent. 

929
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,630
  I don't want to make you into my enemy.  

930
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,870
  Father fired Nuna, but I survived.  

931
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,120
  Is it because of me? It's because of that woman. 

932
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,410
 Add me to your game, Hyeong. 

933
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:09,360
  Stop doing these useless things! What you're attacking is my company as well! 

934
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,010
 I've lived such an exhausting life. 

935
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,970
 I begged at the feet of people who had no intention of giving me anything. 

936
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,420
  Are you sure you raised me?  

937
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,910
 I think you tried to use me. 

938
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:21,970
 I will take care of Chairman Han Yeong Sik, so you take care of Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju. 

939
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:27,000
â™«   All the pain is healed now   â™«
