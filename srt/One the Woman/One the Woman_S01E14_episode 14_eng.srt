1
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,610
A few times, I ran some errands for Han Yeong Sik.
    

2
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,850
When he left something in your grandfather's room,

3
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,720
I took it to the Chairman's office.

4
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,290
Sometimes it was a ballpoint pen

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,970
and sometimes a wallet.

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,650


7
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,950
I learned much later

8
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,590
that those were bugging devices.

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,390
That day, Chairman Han Yeong Sik

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,550
wasn't at the site where your father was harmed.

11
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,690
The person at the factory that day

12
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,400
was Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

13
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,370
You must still be busy,

14
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,760
even though you no longer have to wear two hats.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Why are you talking down to me as if you know me?

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,750
That's funny.

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,710
I will reveal what you've been doing until now.

18
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,790
I think that's my line.

19
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,250
Instead of just losing your memory, did you lose your mind as well?

20
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,400
Have you forgotten everything?

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,320
No. My mind is clearer that ever.

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,420
You ... what did you go around doing that night?

23
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,330
On your way out of the factory,

24
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,630
you hit my grandmother with your car

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,590
and killed her.

26
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,110
I did feel something hit my car that day.

27
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,240
Was that a person?

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,930
What?

29
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm going to kill you

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,680
with my own hands.

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm curious as to

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,570
what some random general prosecutor can do against a chaebol.

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,630
What "some random general prosecutor"

34
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,410
can do when she's hooked,

35
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,190
is something to look forward to.

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,380
A person like you must've done other dirty stuff, too.

37
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,150
Indiscriminate target investigation,

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,900
over investigation, entrapment, extensive search operation,

39
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,530
announcement of suspected crime before prosecution!

40
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,310
I will use all of my judicial power,

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,980
and I will wreck you.

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,390
This is why we need to improve the prosecution system.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,680
You don't know what a chaebol is, do you?

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,030
I've never lost to little bugs like you.

45
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,090
You've only fought when you can win.

46
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,600
You've never even started a losing fight, have you?

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,980
I've fought in both winning and losing fights.

48
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,660
When it's a fight I'll clearly lose,

49
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,440
I attack and attack until I win.

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,710
Try all you can with your money,

51
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,690
I will do all I can with the law.

52
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,510
Why are poor people always so aggressive??

53
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Destitution is a scary thing.

54
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,800
And you even lost to one of those with nothing.

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
The person your father chose

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,390
wasn't you,

57
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,190
it was me.

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,510
What?

59
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,650
Yes, that's what the law does.

60
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,420
When I try to slap you with my right hand, the law is supposed to stop that hand.

61
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
In that case,

62
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,480
I can always slap with my left hand.

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,320
That's the law you're talking about.

64
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,410
- Hey, you!
 - Prosecutor Jo, calm down. Don't lose your temper.

65
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,520
What are you talking about? She slapped me!

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,650
Hey, Where are you going? What?

67
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,780
Oh, my goodness!

68
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,380
I haven't been slapped in a long time.

69
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,630
Gosh ... Hey!

70
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,550
Prosecutor Jo!

71
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,690
 You, what did you go around doing that night? 

72
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,380
 - Father.
- On your way out of the factory, 

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,980
 you hit my grandmother with your car 

74
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,620
 and killed her. 

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,170
 Ah ... 

76
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,980
How is the search for Kang Mi Na going?

77
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,740
There hasn't been much progress.

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
Can't we just assume she's already dead somewhere?

79
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,140
   

80
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,250
   

81
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,130
Why are you just arriving!

82
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,350
The person at the factory that night

83
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,080
wasn't Chairman Han Yeong Sik but Han Seong Hye.

84
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
What is it with your reaction?

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,770
She's the one who hit my grandma with her car.

86
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,400
I know.

87
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,110
 The person at the factory that day was Managing Director Han Seong Hye. 

88
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,120
 How do you know that she was there? 

89
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,080
 That's because ... 

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,870
 After running an errand for Chairman Han, 

91
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,240
 I was on my way home. 

92
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,150
 Her car was scrapped the next day. 

93
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,300
 I was aware that the police were investigating what had happened, 

94
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,120
 but I didn't say a word. 

95
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,260
 I was never asked to run such errands anymore. 

96
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,560
 Maybe because Chairman Han Yeong Sik didn't want to know 

97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,620
 that I realized there was a car accident. 

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,110
Is that why she said ...

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,450
 Managing Director Han Seong Hye, 

100
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,830
 should I also mention you? 

101
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,490
I wonder what else Director Kim knows.

102
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,880
Maybe she even knows the secret of the Bermuda Triangle*! 
  (Mysterious region in the North Atlantic Ocean) 

103
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,170
Did you find anything on your Chief Prosecutor?

104
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,970
I did, a big one.

105
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,600
Han Seong Hye can run around all she wants.

106
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,310
The attempted murder of Kang Mi Na

107
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,390
will be verified by Mr. Jang Seok Ho.

108
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,090
Also, Lee Bong Sik's murder

109
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,580
and the Samgeori gang are being investigated by Yu Jun.

110
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,280
So it won't be too many days before everything comes to light.

111
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,970
- Hey, Yu Jun. 
- Nuna,

112
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,970
what has happened with Chairman Han Yeong Sik?

113
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,770
Apparently an arrest warrant has been issued

114
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,690
for the art-bribery case and it includes his tax-evasion embezzlement.

115
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,260
I was also asked to hand over the warrant documents for  Kang Mi Na.

116
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,760
What? Already?

117
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,080
 Do you admit to everything? 

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,380
 - Can you give us a word? 
- Is it true? 

119
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,640
 Say something! 

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,350
 Is it true?! 

121
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,730
 Chairman! 

122
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,740
 Is it true?! 

123
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,340
Well, look here ...

124
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,280
I haven't seen you in a while.

125
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,270
You called me many times.

126
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,610
I couldn't answer because I was busy.

127
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,780
Who handed over the information about my company?

128
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,380
Was it my head lawyer who resigned?

129
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,740
I already had enough information with me.

130
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,600
Are you doing this to take me down with you?

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,730
Why would I go down with you?

132
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,120
Hanju needs to save me.

133
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,660
Then you should've prevented things from getting this bad!

134
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,900
Do you think I'll leave you alone after going through all this?

135
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,130
Do you still have no idea what this situation is like?

136
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,770
The one who has the final say for my survival

137
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,860
has already changed.

138
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm sorry. It's chaotic due to the forced search and seizure.

139
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,410
I wasn't contacted separately about your arrival.

140
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,800
It's all right. The situation is poor after all.

141
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll take care of the immediate matters

142
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,760
as needed, in place of my father.

143
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,070
Yes, I understand.

144
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,620
Did you give them all of my father's phones?

145
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
There are not just one or two.

146
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,650
No. I kept this on me.

147
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,480
What's the password?

148
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,810
I need to contact Chairman Han first before I can give it to you.

149
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,860
You didn't know this until just now,

150
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,160
but now you know.

151
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm here on my father's behalf,

152
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,700
so what kind of respect is this?

153
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,190
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,610
Please clean this room first.

155
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,130
Yes.

156
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,680
 With allegations of embezzlement, tax evasion and breach of duty, 

157
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,330
 the prosecution has filed an arrest warrant 

158
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,480
 against Hanju Group's Chairman Han Yeong Sik. 

159
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,170
 According to Seoul District Prosecutors' office, 

160
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,290
 there are concerns about destruction of evidence and evasion, so— 

161
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,130
Wow! This is about villains trying to screw each other over

162
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,640
and seeking a justice of their own.

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
What's happening?

164
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,120
My raccoon-like Chief Prosecutor has sided with Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

165
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,870
This ... with this big one as the bait.

166
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,660
"This"?

167
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,420
The CCTV record of that night.

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,540
 Fourteen years ago, 

169
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,180
 your father asked me for a favor. A favor related to you, not business. 

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,140
 Are you saying that the evidence is related to me? 

171
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,760
Are you okay?

172
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,720
I don't know what to say.

173
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,750
But ... well ... Since we have new evidence,

174
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm sure we'll only need to apply for a re-investigation of the Seopyeong case.

175
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,580
And once Yu Jun begins to investigate,

176
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,910
they won't be able to skip through like they did back then.

177
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,700
That means we're nearing the end.

178
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,190
Are we really?

179
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,760
If I could only slap these assholes ...

180
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,200
I mean, I saw Han Seong Hye this afternoon,

181
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,880
and I really wanted to just slap ...

182
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,140
I should have.

183
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,620
Oh, it's pissing me off again.

184
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,350
I wonder how many more emotions

185
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,550
I need to work through

186
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,670
in order to fight people like them.

187
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,050
That's what I'm thinking.

188
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,420
I know.

189
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,510
At first, even I thought

190
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,430
I should simply punish those who sinned. That's how I started out, at least.

191
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,670
But after going up against Han Seong Hye at the  office this afternoon,

192
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,970
I felt dizzy from the reality of things.

193
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,520
We won't become like them.

194
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,280
We will make them stand before the law.

195
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,190
But once everything is over,

196
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,810
are you going back to the States?

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
That place isn't mine either, to be honest.

198
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,490
I don't want to live a life wondering

199
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,140
what would happen to my company's stocks if something goes wrong,

200
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,350
no matter where I am or what I'm doing.

201
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,550
I might be overstepping, Yeon Ju,

202
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,840
but I also want you to feel the same way,

203
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,100
for yourself.

204
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,460
Cheer up.

205
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,640
Wait.

206
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,330
- Cheers! 
- Cheers.

207
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,340
This cheers you up, doesn't it?

208
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,300
It does.

209
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,040
Eat.

210
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,910
How can they just arrest a big company's chairman?

211
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,700
Isn't this some political scheme?

212
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,250
According to my sister,

213
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,940
apparently an internal whistleblower reported father's corruption within the department.

214
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,130
A "whistleblower"?

215
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,340
Within the department, there are a bunch of enemies that I can think of,

216
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,690
how am I supposed to know who did this?

217
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,190
Hey, how's the company running?

218
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,820
Eonni seems to be taking care of everything in place of Father.

219
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
What's Seong Wun doing, then?

220
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,880
He's better off not becoming an obstacle for Eonni.

221
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,720
Seong Hye, this girl! Isn't this the time for getting her father out of this mess instead of filling in for him?

222
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,130
Think about all the prosecutors her father managed!

223
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,000
How can she let him be arrested so easily?

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,150
It's as if she's been waiting—

225
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,440
Oh my. Has she been waiting?

226
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,330
Oh, my head. I've lost my appetite.

227
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,330
Well, is there anything to whet my appetite?

228
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,810
From what I can tell, with your loud voice,

229
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,690
it seems like you could eat and digest rocks out of anger!

230
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,320
- Why did you ask me to make porridge? 
- What?

231
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,280
Director Kim suddenly asked for leave, so there's nothing at home either!

232
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,240
Sister-in-law is also out of the house.

233
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,060
Since there's no need to be careful of rumors either,

234
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,790
I've called back the people who worked here,

235
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,570
so you can ask them for something

236
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,330
when they return to work tomorrow.

237
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,670
Why are you acting like this?

238
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,460
I'm tired of being submissive too.

239
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,520
I want to stop reading other people's moods,

240
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,510
and I want to say whatever I want to.

241
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,990
She ... even she's acting like that?

242
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,840
She's saying she won't commit to meaningless pity.

243
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,550
Although you might have some say around the household if little brother runs the company,

244
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,610
if Eonni takes over, it will be a different story.

245
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,890
Now, you're a mere back-room elder

246
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,180
with a few shares!

247
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,390
What?

248
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,500
Back-room ...

249
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,050
Hi, good morning.

250
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,770
What? What is it? Did something happen?

251
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,680
You should check the notice board.

252
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,080
   

253
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,910
  
   

254
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,060
   

255
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,030
"Office suspension"?

256
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Chief. Why are you suspending me out of nowhere?!

257
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
The disciplinary commissioner is not listed, and there is no record of a disciplinary meeting.

258
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,500
And what's the reason?

259
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,100
Why are you shouting at me?

260
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,180
Didn't you get the message?

261
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,220
Someone filed a complaint against you!

262
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,810
I mean, a government prosecutor pretended to be a chaebol and forged a fake identity—

263
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,350
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,830
"Complaint"?

265
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,020
Hanju filed a complaint against me?

266
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,860
What offense did I commit against Hanju by adopting an identity?

267
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,270
Who filed it?

268
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,710
The President of the Yumin Foundation?

269
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,610
I mean, whatever the cause, it's not as if there was a decision made!

270
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,130
Why am I being punished as soon as the complaint is filed?

271
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,160
Aren't you aware of disciplinary laws for  prosecutors?

272
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,850
Regardless of the verdict,

273
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,440
in a case where demeaning the dignity of a prosecutor or neglecting a job—

274
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,370
I know, I know!

275
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,420
But it's well known that we prosecutors punish each other lightly,

276
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,690
so why am I being suspended!

277
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,630
Because you're not on our side anymore.

278
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,320
Do you think it ends with suspension?

279
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,050
You've been chosen for the Examination of Eligibility.

280
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,650
You know that you're fired if you aren't eligible, right?

281
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,940
So whether or not you had a personal grudge, why didn't you keep toeing the line?

282
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,950
I mean, a mere prosecutor

283
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,200
being a chaebol. Do you think that's possible?

284
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,480
It seems that you trust chaebols too much.

285
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,090
Do you think a chaebol will

286
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,170
support a mere chief prosecutor until the end?

287
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,470
Are you worrying about me?

288
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,140
You should worry about yourself.

289
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,890
Me? Don't worry!

290
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,010
They can't help but take care of me.

291
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,870
All right, I get it.

292
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,350
You keep relying on them

293
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,840
all the way to the end.

294
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,710
What a life! She worries about others

295
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,840
when her life is about to fall apart.

296
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,150
It's perfect weather for listening to the clock.

297
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,960
Why is ...

298
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,020
Who, who is it?

299
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,790
Who was in this room ...

300
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,490
Korean prosecutors really do work speedily, don't they?

301
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
Look at how the investigation request was filed immediately.

302
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,890
I came here on the premise I'd be fooled by Managing Director Han Seong Hye again,

303
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,190
but I think it's good I made a visit.

304
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,350
How can you be so ... similar?

305
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,010
You're certain you've got nothing to do with my older brother, right?

306
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,460
How could you fool all those people at once?

307
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,470
What did you do with my niece?

308
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,650
How did you ... erase her without letting anyone know?

309
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,710
What?

310
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,160
You hid her!

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,460
Did anyone else take advantage of my niece's disappearance?

312
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,760
I suppose the investigation will reveal everything if I wait.

313
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,510
Ah, my gosh ... just thinking about the embarrassment I went through—

314
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,470
You better be prepared to spend the rest of your life in prison!

315
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,340
What! So are you saying that I did something to your niece?

316
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,740
That's why you're being sued.

317
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,230
Do you think I am suing you, with all this embarrassment,

318
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,380
just because I want some money from you?

319
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,670
   

320
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,870
The Chief Prosecutor contacted us.

321
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,350
While it will be hard to arrest Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju,

322
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,900
they'll investigate her without detention.

323
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,870
Is that it?

324
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,830
There was nothing else.

325
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,080
He reports everything and boasts about it.

326
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,340
He's one of those tiring types.

327
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,360
He said he has some evidence

328
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,740
about what happened that day, 14 years ago.

329
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,480
What do you think it might be?

330
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,470
I'm asking you what you think that Chief Prosecutor has.

331
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,260
For evidence ...

332
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm guessing it's the factory's internal CCTV files.

333
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,410
Back then, there wasn't a CCTV in your room,

334
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,080
so perhaps it's the corridor's CCTV?

335
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,290
That's bad news.

336
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,330
Excuse me?

337
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm talking about you.

338
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
What are you going to do?

339
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
When Uncle died,

340
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,130
you're the one who helped me escape.

341
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,810
If you had taken Uncle to the hospital back then, wouldn't he have lived?

342
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,920
   

343
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,250
 Uncle, it would have been nice if you had told me in advance that you were coming in. 

344
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,860
 Asking the workers for the ledgers when I'm not around ... 

345
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,740
 I heard you were living in the factory after setting up an office. 

346
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,890
 Where are you coming from? 

347
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,180
 I need to take a break sometimes, too. 

348
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,840
 I rushed here after hearing that there was something wrong with the ledgers. 

349
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,080
 But considering your attitude, 

350
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,230
 it seems that there's no point in looking further. 

351
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,060
 For now, I shall take these. 

352
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,300
 Uncle— 

353
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,930
 Talk to me for a moment. 

354
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,640
 To be honest, this is ... 

355
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,890
 it isn't all that negative for you either. 

356
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,180
 Are you trying to break a deal with me? 

357
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,590
 It's not that. 

358
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,100
 Why did you touch the ledgers? 

359
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,600
 If you can't do it on your own, you have Seung Wuk. You also have your siblings, Seong Chan and Seong Wun. 

360
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,360
 Was that it? 

361
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,220
 It's my first business. 

362
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,440
 Is that why you came here to find evidence that my business is doing poorly 

363
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,590
 and accruing debt? 

364
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,760
 Now that it looks like Grandpa will oust me, let alone not make me his heir, 

365
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,230
 you must think Seung Wuk will take all my share? 

366
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,460
 Don't jump to conclusions. 

367
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,610
 Rather than the loss of money, 

368
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,770
 your grandfather will be more disappointed by your actions right now! 

369
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,900
 Think of your grandfather who trusted you. You should not be acting this way. 

370
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,440
 Are you threatening me by using Grandfather as an excuse? 

371
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,350
 Are you treating me like a blackmailer? 

372
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,520
 Should family attack one another, using each other's flaws? 

373
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,420
 "Family"? 

374
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,140
 You're so naive. 

375
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,790
 Just as expected of the eldest son of Hanju Group who will inherit it all in the end anyway. 

376
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,890
 I can't talk to you anymore. 

377
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,500
 Wait! 

378
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,040
 Don't you know that taking these away without permission 

379
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,930
 could be a problem? 

380
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,390
 Do you think that by hiding it from me like this, you can hide it forever? 

381
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,450
 Nothing will change, 

382
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,830
 even if you wait one or two days more. 

383
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,960
 Let go! Give it to me! 

384
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,230
 Uncle? 

385
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,160
 Uncle! 

386
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,260
 Uncle! 

387
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,350
 Yes. 

388
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,570
 Out of the blue, your uncle told me that he's stopping by the office. 

389
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,300
 Is something going on with the merger on your side? 

390
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,370
 I don't know either. 

391
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,930
 Well then, look into it! 

392
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,470
 When the merger with Hanju Fashion is completed, 

393
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,310
 your position in the family will be considerably different, 

394
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,760
 and your uncle won't be able to notify me like this anymore. 

395
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,490
 If I had to wait for your younger brothers to shape up, 

396
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,060
 I would continue to be humiliated. 

397
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,240
 It was the right decision to give you Hanju Fashion when you were stubborn about it. 

398
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,280
 Figure out what happened, and call me back. 

399
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,840
 Yes. 

400
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,140
 Yes. 

401
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,110
 He ... 

402
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,540
 It's too late. 

403
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,610
 An accident ... It was an accident. 

404
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,400
 He did that to himself while trying to take the ledgers from me. 

405
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,780
 I see. 

406
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,860
 It's an accident anyway, so there's no point in making matters worse! 

407
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,440
 Not only for me, but for you too. 

408
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,660
 Think carefully. 

409
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,940
 In my family, do you think anyone besides me would look after you? 

410
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,000
 If something happens to me, it's over for you as well. 

411
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,010
 I was never here. Uncle was alone when that happened to him. 

412
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,980
 As long as you clean this up, 

413
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,860
 I can link the police to whomever after the fact 

414
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,250
 and take care of the situation. Do you get what I mean? 

415
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,230
 This damn factory. 

416
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,260
 I don't care what happens to it. 

417
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,750
 Burn it! 

418
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,950
 Do something ... 

419
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,150
 Anything to fix this! 

420
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,860
 Let's move. 

421
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,050
 Go home. 

422
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,780
If you had reported it back then,

423
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,930
I wonder if Uncle could've lived.

424
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,370
If the Chief Prosecutor ever reveals those CCTV files,

425
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,580
while I'll be in a pinch,

426
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,170
there will be no one to protect you.

427
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,320
Do Wu ...

428
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,110
What should I do?

429
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,180
   

430
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,800
"A prosecutor pretending to be a chaebol?"
 "What did I just read? She's a con-artist."

431
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,960
Con-art—

432
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,550
"It's rumored she took immense amounts of money from the beginning."

433
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:48,220
"This f***ing **** of a ****** mad for ***** ** money!"

434
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,160
Stop! Did you just—

435
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,880
Next comment!

436
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,710
"Isn't prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju's original name Kang Yeon Ju?"

437
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,130
"I think she looks similar to a kid I went to school with,"

438
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,950
"her father used to be a hopeless gang member and went to prison."

439
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,740
I made such a huge fuss about investigating Han Seong Hye down to her bones.

440
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,310
Now it seems I'm being investigated down to my bones instead!

441
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,630
I mean, how can my secret identity, which I kept hidden for 10 years,

442
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,900
be revealed by a Korean netizen in an hour? Is that possible?

443
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,890
For now, I'll capture it.

444
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,390
Fine. I'll sue everyone who takes it too far.

445
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,580
There should be a "later," right?

446
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,770
What did you say?

447
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,390
I mean, considering your situation right now ...

448
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,520
What if it's decided that you can be arrested?

449
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,600
What arrest? The Chief Prosecutor is just overreacting!

450
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,160
I mean, why would anyone arrest me? I have the most definite identity?

451
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,350
Two months of suspension is quite right!

452
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,830
Even I have a lot to do!

453
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,950
This is a small misunderstanding, don't worry.

454
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,490
But Prosecutor, why did you do it?

455
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,760
If you had a temporary memory loss, you could have returned the moment your memories came back.

456
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,010
Why did you involve yourself in that strange mess?

457
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,900
Exactly how far do you plan to go?

458
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,480
What are you talking about?

459
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,980
Do you think you can hide the truth forever?

460
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,080
I know everything.

461
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,950
"The truth"?

462
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,910
You mean the truth you want to believe in.

463
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:36,720
The delusion that your oh-so-great father didn't die so pitifully.

464
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,110
How shameless can you be as a human?

465
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,460
Finish this with me, without involving that woman.

466
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,850
You don't need to include the Executive Director.

467
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,610
That woman almost died because of the accident you caused.

468
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,310
I feel that you're mistaken about something.

469
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,120
Do you think you'll be safe?

470
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,200
What did you say?

471
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,370
You're bound to go down with them anyway.

472
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,160
And that accident,

473
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,730
do you have any evidence that I did it?

474
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,400
"Evidence"?

475
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,460
Right.

476
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,330
Yeah, let's talk after I bring in that evidence.

477
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,090
You still haven't come to your senses.

478
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,640
Don't you get it?

479
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,400
You and that crazy prosecutor,

480
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,340
you're both totally ruined.

481
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,860
What?

482
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,130
For the retrial of the arson,

483
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,010
who would've guessed they'd question you first for the Kang Mi Na impersonation case?

484
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,910
So, basically ... since I look similar in appearance to Kang Mi Na,

485
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,960
and since I hold a grudge toward Hanju because of my father,

486
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,150
I worked with a person called Han Seung Wuk

487
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,250
and kidnapped Kang Mi Na, and then pretended to be her.

488
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,610
But when it seemed like the truth would be revealed, I resumed my original job as a prosecutor?

489
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,840
How many pages of nonsense did they write?

490
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,670
So is this damned prosecutor going to investigate me with this crazy story?

491
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,370
What else can you do when the Chief Prosecutor issued the warrant?

492
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,550
Basically they're asking you to drag Kang Mi Na here!

493
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,200
But as they couldn't find this one person,

494
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,370
most of them are thinking that she's dead.

495
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:28,100
If this goes from being a missing-persons case into a murder case without a body ...

496
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,260
Seriously. So am I about to be the leading suspect in a murder case?

497
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,130
Does that make sense? It was Han Seong Hye who tried to kill Kang Mi Na!

498
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,990
I mean, we have the driver whom Han Seong Hye arranged!

499
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,170
Ah, about that ...

500
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,110
 What? 

501
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,380
 I'm sorry. They were taking a walk together as they always did ... 

502
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,220
 This married couple, who were found dead this morning, 

503
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,850
 is known to be linked to the missing Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Yumin Group. The police has started its investigation. 

504
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,890
 It has been confirmed that before the chairwoman went missing, they caused the accident in which she was involved. 

505
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,370
 It's also been discovered that they were residing at Han's villa who works for Yumin Group. 

506
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,780
 The reason for their stay at Han's villa 

507
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,430
 has not been revealed— 

508
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,790
 As you ordered, I've contacted the prosecution and said that you'll fully cooperate with them. 

509
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,550
 I'll send the documents across as they are requested. 

510
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,100
 Give them everything. Hanju of the past doesn't exist anymore, anyway. 

511
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,420
Why are you bringing that up now?

512
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,150
I've been busy since this morning because of all the calls coming in.

513
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,910
Where's Han Seung Wuk then?

514
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,390
Right now, he is at the other police station for that investigation.

515
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,810
But I'm sure there won't be a misunderstanding

516
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,460
since his alibi is definite.

517
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,770
But you know, there's a slight problem because we paid

518
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,190
Jang Seok Ho's hospital fees.

519
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,540
Han Seong Hye abandoned him, so we took care of him with a charitable heart!

520
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,410
You should have given him just enough money, but you gave too much.

521
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,330
For the worst-scenario case, I'll contact the people in the States,

522
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,430
so he can leave right away.

523
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,960
What about the Seopyeong factory retrial?

524
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,830
We have the USB, so we can still have a retrial, right?

525
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,260
Yes, Yu Jun, it's me. What is it?

526
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,160
Right, Nuna.

527
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,530
Regarding the Seopyeong factory arson case,

528
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,700
the arsonist turned himself in.

529
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,340
What? Who? Did what?

530
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,060
 Through his attorney, he turned himself in at the 

531
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,800
 Western District Office in Seopyeong. They initially investigated the incident. 

532
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,750
 The detectives are bringing him in right now. We'll start questioning him straight away. 

533
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,560
   

534
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,710
 At the time, Director Han Seong Hye 

535
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,300
 wanted to reveal that President Han Gang Sik had tampered with the ledgers. 

536
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,800
 The two of them had an argument. 

537
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,670
 I went into the office when I heard them arguing. 

538
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,970
 Managing Director Han Seong Hye left first. 

539
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,050
During the process of stopping the chairman from chasing her,

540
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,170
he bumped his head on the desk

541
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,630
and collapsed.

542
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,780
Did he die?

543
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,130
What?

544
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,460
I asked whether he died because of the head injury.

545
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,900
I think so.

546
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,960
And you did not perform any rescue actions, such as calling 911?

547
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
- Yes. That's correct.
- What about the fire?

548
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,770
Why did you set the fire?

549
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,550
 This worthless money ...  I'm going to burn it to ash 

550
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,420
 where everyone can see. 

551
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,980
 What is it?! 

552
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,750
 Seriously! 

553
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,990
 Geez ... 

554
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,400
 Damn ... that old lady. How is she going to come here at this hour of night? 

555
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,530
 Back then, in the process of running away, 

556
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,850
 I saw someone trying to set a fire. 

557
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,970
I thought it would make sense to blame the fire on him.

558
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,430
So at first you weren't planning to set the fire,

559
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,530
but you saw someone setting a fire and this gave you the idea of arson,

560
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,800
and you even requested others

561
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,570
to testify falsely?

562
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,130
Yes.

563
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,450
Where was Director Han Seong Hye when this was happening?

564
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,170
She had been walking out,

565
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,310
and apparently she grabbed a passing taxi.

566
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,110
Did she leave her car there?

567
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,730
Yes.

568
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,700
Back then, she wasn't a good driver. She avoided driving at night in the countryside.

569
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,900
So in the process of returning to Seoul with her car, Mr. Jeong Do Wu,

570
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,600
you also managed a hit-and-run?

571
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,480
Yes.

572
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,830
Did Managing Director Han Seong Hye

573
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,070
then hide all these events for you?

574
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,310
I requested her to.

575
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,280
She seemed to think that everything happened because of her,

576
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,690
so she said she'll cover up the incident,

577
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,210
since the person had passed away anyway.

578
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,010
That's why I burned

579
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,390
the ledgers too.

580
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,300
Mr. Jeong Do Wu,

581
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,720
are you asking me to believe what you're saying right now?

582
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,180
 Don't you get it? 

583
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,420
 You and that crazy prosecutor, you're both totally ruined. 

584
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,880
   

585
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,170
   

586
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,600
 Let's go! 

587
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,940
 Give us a word, please! 

588
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,400
Stop. I've got nothing to do with Kang Mi Na.

589
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,890
Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju! You're rumored to be involved in embezzlement, is that true?

590
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:30,630
That's—!

591
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,100
Why do you look so similar to the real Kang Mi Na?

592
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,610
They say Kang Mi Na's a step-child!

593
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,380
Are there secrets about your birth as well?

594
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,450
What kind of question is that?

595
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,670
Can you stop?

596
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,710
I heard you dated the original Kang Mi Na!

597
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,180
What is your relationship with Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju?

598
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,610
Is it true that Kang Mi Na's appearance suits your personal taste?

599
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,570
Let's just head in, for goodness' sake!

600
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,270
Wait, Yeon Ju—

601
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,530
Do you think the shareholders will acknowledge

602
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,150
a daughter who stabbed her father in the back?

603
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,810
What about your meals?

604
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,980
They should be to your satisfaction.

605
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,470
I know you better than you think I do.

606
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,620
You're not a big enough person to run Hanju.

607
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,360
If only Seong Chan had been around,

608
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,420
you wouldn't be in this position!

609
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,010
It's starting to get cold.

610
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,910
I'm getting worried since you get cold so easily, Father.

611
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,150
Don't believe that I'll end here.

612
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,500
Are you thinking you can do something more?

613
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,310
All you can decide now

614
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,180
is what to do during the rest of your life,

615
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,260
in prison.

616
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,080
That cruel thing!

617
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,490
   

618
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,910
Jo Yeon Ju goes in ...

619
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,240
Han Seong Hye goes in ...

620
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,030
I go in ...

621
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,450
Han Seong Hye leaves ...

622
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,020
I leave ...

623
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,570
Where's Jo Yeon Ju?

624
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,940
 It's impossible for a living person to disappear so quickly. 

625
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,240
 It's honestly impossible 

626
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,570
 that all these people with wealth and power cannot find one person. 

627
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:07,440
 In this case, a possible answer that we can explore is 

628
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,260
 whether or not they are intentionally looking for the person. 

629
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,410
Gosh, she says that so easily.

630
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,730
They say that stuff, but have they ever tried to find a person?

631
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,370
But when the show, "Unanswered Questions," says something like that, I tend to believe them.

632
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,640
 When someone suddenly disappears ... 

633
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,150
 A corporation this big can't ... 

634
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,370
Are you still watching TV?

635
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,590
What did you buy?

636
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,510
Earlier, a special show about doppelgängers* was on. 
  (People who look identical) 

637
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,830
Right now, we're watching "Unanswered Questions."

638
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,500
You're making me deliver your food. Are you guys going to do this all day?

639
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,220
What else can we do?

640
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,960
We can't go outside because of the reporters, and you won't let us order food.

641
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,840
That's because you order too much food, Ms. Yeon Ju.

642
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,370
He won't let us order because they'll ask how many people are here.

643
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,880
It's not that much.

644
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,800
Are you guys going to give up like this?

645
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,780
I'm a suspended, ex-gang prosecutor on corruption cases.

646
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,790
Han Seung Wuk is a Korean-foreigner.

647
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:06,570
You're a double-agent who took off from Hanju at the perfect time.

648
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,990
What more can we do?

649
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,810
But public opinion shows that some people support us.

650
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,160
There are a few people on the internet posting comments.

651
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,390
Those "few people on the internet" ... it's me.

652
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,800
Are all those posts by you?

653
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,970
What can we do when we're trapped inside all day? So we post comments.

654
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,260
What's this?

655
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,790
It's for you, Han Seung Wuk.

656
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,010
   

657
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,620
   

658
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,760
   

659
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,600
   

660
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,880
What's this?

661
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,750
Hanju Chemicals' theft of thallium* case? 
  (Toxic, heavy-metal element) 

662
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,090
Something like this happened?

663
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:03,450
Thallium was discovered in Jang Seok Ho's syringe.

664
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,110
   

665
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,670
What is all this? 
    

666
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,770
It's a transaction record between

667
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,010
Han Seong Hye and Jeong Do Wu.

668
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,300
How come there are so many regular monthly expenses?

669
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,430
There's definitely something going on.

670
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,720
   

671
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,640
   

672
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,670
This is ...

673
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,130
What? What?

674
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,560
This is Hanju Fashion's financial record from 14 years ago.

675
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,860
It's an internal document. Even I'm seeing it for the first time.

676
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:38,820
But who sent these to you, Han Seung Wuk?

677
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,450
Where was this?

678
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,230
It was stuck in the mailbox.

679
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,160
There's a Seongbukdong Post Office stamp on it.

680
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,600
Shouldn't we look into this?

681
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:59,010
How about some jokkbaengi* for dinner? 
  (Braised pig trotters) 

682
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,830
Let's have it delivered.

683
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,940
Are you eating again?

684
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,490
 He's here! 

685
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,330
 Does she order jokkbaengi often? 

686
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,300
 Who took the food in? 

687
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,340
 - Did you see anything strange? 
- What exactly did she order? 

688
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,950
 Please tell us! 

689
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,760
 Over here! 

690
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,750
 How many people were in there? 

691
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,400
 Please tell us what you saw. 

692
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,850
 How many servings did she order? 

693
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,610
 Did you see anything? 

694
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,680
 News just arrived that says Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju ordered jokkbaengi. 

695
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,210
Do you think there's a meaning behind this? 
   

696
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,830
Yes, of course. As for jokkbaengi,

697
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,590
it's a mixture of jokkbal and golbaengi.

698
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,170
The fact that she ordered this, means that

699
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,860
the food expresses how she's feeling right now.

700
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,080
In another words, as a chairwoman and a prosecutor,

701
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,680
you could say she's feeling guilty about leading a double life.

702
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,310
Then she might want jjamjjammyeon* for the next meal. 
  (Noodles with blackbean sauce) 

703
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:09,330
 If she were to order fried chicken, she'd order half and half. Would that be  

704
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,380
 your prediction? 

705
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,910
 What we should consider here is that 

706
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:17,300
 we captured her eating jokkbaengi, right? 

707
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,410
 Based on the information ... 

708
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,720
As for the orders you're missing out on, today,

709
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,420
I'll pay you for those.

710
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,690
Please have some of this.

711
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,510
Take your time.

712
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,700
 She's not drinking with jokkbaengi. 

713
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,750
 This is highly suspicious. 

714
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,800
Should I get you some beer?

715
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,500
 If you consider the people around Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju ... 

716
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,040
So the person just put it in there.

717
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,030
I don't think there are CCTVs here.

718
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:50,510
Exactly. There is a lot of foot traffic around here, too.

719
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't know who sent it,

720
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,310
but isn't it worth trying again with this evidence?

721
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,460
It's still lacking.

722
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,190
All the pieces of evidence are missing that crucial, minuscule "something."

723
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,740
Really?

724
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,180
When I studied for my exams, the toughest question to answer

725
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:14,390
was when a multiple-choice question asked, "Find the correct answers below."

726
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,730
I found it hard because there were multiple correct answers.

727
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,080
What are you talking about?

728
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,600
I wonder if this is so hard because many answers are given to us.

729
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,070
Shouldn't we just find the one crucial answer?

730
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,110
That is, find that woman, Kang Mi Na.

731
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,710
So I'm wondering, what kind of person is Kang Mi Na?

732
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,240
You know her well.

733
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,740
No, not her history.

734
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:44,000
They say that knowing a person's background and actually knowing the person are vastly different.

735
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,610
I don't mean the part that she was miserable or had a story ...

736
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:52,210
I wonder what kind of person Kang Mi Na is.

737
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,300
 You and I are the same class. 

738
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,050
 You chose me because I'm an heir of this family. 

739
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:04,980
 I thought they had some dumb chick sitting on that seat, so I went to see her. 

740
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,550
 And I ended up meeting ... 

741
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,230
 a con man. 

742
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,970
 But she wasn't the idiot I imagined. 

743
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,910
 She suggested a deal. 

744
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,550
Was that woman a good person or a bad person?

745
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,410
What would she have done in a situation?

746
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,790
What the—?

747
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,650
This isn't the time to sit around like this!

748
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,880
Why?

749
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,060
Your father is in jail. Both daughters-in-law have left home.

750
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,500
Only the three of us remain.

751
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,850
At this rate, we'll get some trashy stocks, have to bow to Seong Hye all our lives,

752
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,060
and live on an allowance.

753
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,930
Honestly, I don't think that's so bad.

754
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,940
Shut up!

755
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,250
Come down right this minute.

756
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,660
Okay, the real Kang Mi Na ...

757
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,420
Without her, you're nothing.

758
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,900
I wonder if she's dead?

759
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,820
Did the fake one who lived in our house really kill the real one?

760
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,080
About the fake Kang Mi Na,

761
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,970
no matter how much I think it over, she's not the type to kill someone.

762
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,340
I'm usually spot on with women.

763
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,670
Is that something to brag about?!

764
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,240
You tell me.

765
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,320
You do nothing all day,

766
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,320
yet your specialty is analyzing people.

767
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,450
If I were my younger sister-in-law, I would've looked for a chance to escape.

768
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,640
Don't you think her family is hiding her?

769
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,900
But her side of the family all died,

770
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,890
on the same day. So we have no one to ask.

771
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,480
You're missing something.

772
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,500
Whatever she does,

773
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,910
the fact that they probably didn't even pretend to listen to her.

774
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,920
You don't know how sad that life is.

775
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,040
You should've been a bit nicer, as you were once in the same boat.

776
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,690
Why did you make her life so hard?

777
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,480
I couldn't even utter a word in front of your grandmother.

778
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,050
But even with all those beatings, that girl wouldn't bend!

779
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,500
I did it because she was annoying!

780
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,610
Whenever I saw her I thought,

781
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,760
"I should've lived like that."

782
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,820
How twisted.

783
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,130
Then I guess we can cast her family aside.

784
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:32,980
It would've been hard for her to escape so perfectly on her own.

785
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,430
I already removed all her friends.

786
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,480
So who got to meet her in the meantime?

787
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,980
She volunteered at the prison,

788
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,170
and went around dealing in paintings.

789
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,200
Mom, what if we end up finding the real Kang Mi Na?

790
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,510
Hey! Your life hangs on it!

791
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,580
Your wife is Yumin's Chairwoman!

792
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,580
Don't think about useless things, just concentrate for now.

793
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,490
All right, all right.

794
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,940
 I was surprised that you called me suddenly. 

795
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,990
 After coming in here, 

796
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:31,420
 there have been moments that made me organize my thoughts. 

797
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,550
 In my office, if you open the drawer of my small table, 

798
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:40,590
 there's a ballpoint pen that I used a long time ago. 

799
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,710
 Without telling anyone, 

800
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,990
 bring that to me, please. 

801
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,890
What will you do about dinner?

802
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,650
I'll simply have a glass of whiskey here.

803
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,840
I'll get it prepared.

804
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,010
 Before I left for America, I held Mi Na back. 

805
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,310
I asked her to leave with me.

806
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,010
I thought that maybe we were in the same boat.

807
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,610
I arrogantly thought like that.

808
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,880
But ... I was rejected.

809
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,180
Mi Na voluntarily chose Hanju and not me.

810
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,480
Which is why I was hurt even more.

811
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,860
But when I think about Kang Mi Na now, as a person,

812
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:49,000
she wasn't someone who lost to anyone, at least inside her heart.

813
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,210
If she is that kind of a woman, then what is she trying to do now?

814
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,710
She gathered the family's weaknesses to break free from Hanju,

815
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:00,380
and she was gutsy enough to make a deal with that conman, Lee Bong Sik, to get out of the country.

816
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,780
Isn't it a little strange that she hasn't returned, even though she's now Yumin Group's successor?

817
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,190
Hiding a dead body is much harder than you think.

818
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,850
We just keep thinking that we can't find her,

819
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,820
but why isn't Kang Mi Na  showing up in person?

820
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,280
If she's not dead,

821
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,120
or if she hasn't lost her memory somewhere, then ...

822
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,320
Sit down. Let's have a drink together.

823
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,150
You selected and served only the nuts I like.

824
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,640
You have such good sense.

825
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,980
Thank you.

826
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,520
Is it really a "sense," though?

827
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,780
Pardon?

828
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm having trouble understanding.

829
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,550
What ...

830
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:01,710
The genetics test, what do you think about it?

831
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,020
Those people may have forged the result sheet.

832
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:14,890
Anyway, for her to pass as a biological child means that the test was run using Kang Mi Na's specimen.

833
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,850
That's why I changed my thinking.

834
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,370
It's not about who switched the result sheets.

835
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:28,100
It's about who is the person that has Kang Mi Na's specimen?

836
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,150
 This was sent by the President of Yumin Foundation. 

837
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:45,040
 Give both that and this sample to my assistant, Jeong Do Wu, outside. 

838
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,950
   

839
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,320
Yes, ma'am.

840
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,960
 So we have someone who had to run away because they knew Han Seong Hye's weaknesses. 

841
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,610
And this someone will never be safe as long as Han Seong Hye is still there.

842
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:14,400
Also, who is someone that has Kang Mi Na's specimen to run a genetic test?

843
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,850
Do you mean Kang Mi Na herself?

844
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,520
That woman is nearby Han Seong Hye.

845
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,700
Right after the accident, is there someone new who showed up around Han Seong Hye?

846
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,480
It must have been a shame.

847
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,570
I very nearly fell for it.

848
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,420
 The door that anyone who's new will push first, 

849
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,740
 you shouldn't have opened it with familiarity. 

850
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,290
 You also shouldn't have tried to hide your wound as that made it more obvious. 

851
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,960
I think there's some sort of misunderstanding.

852
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,890
Then eat.

853
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,460
I'm telling you to eat that.

854
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,600
This is no fun. Shall we stop?

855
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,190
This is a genetics test that I ran with your hair.

856
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,930
Are you here to get revenge or something?

857
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,100
Do you still think I'm bad?

858
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,640
Who's the one who has been tricking me?!

859
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,940
She just left.

860
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,440
Catch her.

861
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,520
Where are you going?

862
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,370
What's wrong?

863
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,650
Oh, you're not well it seems.

864
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,140
What are you doing? You should help her.

865
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,140
Where are you hurt?

866
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,790
Run away, quickly!

867
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,670
Those guys are probably really looking down on us now.

868
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,570
We got our asses beat by them last time, so it's understandable.

869
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,990
This time, you said that we can beat them up all we want, right?

870
01:03:58,990 --> 01:03:59,920
That's what I said!

871
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,900
They're dead meat.

872
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,170
Let's get going!

873
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,720
You bastard!

874
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,370
   

875
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,020
 This horrible life 

876
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,260
is over now.

877
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,490
 My face just needs to be completely different. 

878
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,060
 A face that nobody will recognize as mine ... 

879
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,750
 a completely new face. 

880
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,650
 It went very well. 

881
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,710
 She looks like a different person. 

882
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,960
 What do you think? 

883
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,190
 It's so exciting! 

884
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,950
 Yes. 

885
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,420
Get in! Ms. Kang Mi Na!

886
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,240
♫  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  ♫

887
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,850
♫  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  ♫

888
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:25,610
♫  Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar  ♫

889
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:28,690
   

890
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,590
 If I had known that you were suspicious about the factory fire, 

891
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:40,410
 I would have told you about Han Seong Hye sooner. 

892
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,420
 I'm sorry for telling you this so late. 

893
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,130
 As I'm sure you've heard, 

894
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,480
 it looks like Seong Hye was planning to reveal your father's accounting fraud. 

895
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,800
 All these years, my father has given so much of himself to Hanju Fashion and Nuna Seong Hye! 

896
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,400
 I've heard something about your alibi for that night that seems suspicious. 

897
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,600
 Do you have any proof that I was there? 

898
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,610
 Shouldn't you leave now? 

899
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:12,620
 Aren't you being a little too disrespectful to my father on a day like this? 

900
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:25,170
 If you say one word, it can be resolved, Uncle. 

901
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,510
 You can save all of them! 

902
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,900
 From now on, I will shoulder all tasks that are related to Chairman Han Gang Sik. 

903
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:37,140
 What is most similar to that time is that the owner doesn't have a clear conscience. Don't you think? 

904
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:48,380
 But even that time when his relationship with Chairman Han was bad, 

905
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:54,220
 what worried your father the most, Han Seung Wuk, was you 

906
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,810
 Whenever something happened to you, Seung Wuk, he worried  

907
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,840
 about you living a life where the first thing you thought was  

908
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,630
 "What will happen to our company's stocks?" 

909
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:13,680
 When I heard that you returned from America, 

910
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,950
 I was reminded of your father a lot, and I was worried about that too. 

911
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,030
 Father ... 

912
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,500
♫  Someday  ♫

913
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,270
 I miss you. 

914
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:40,960
♫  I want to become a light  ♫

915
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:47,670
♫  Somewhere, I want to find myself  ♫

916
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:55,450
♫  One day, if the day comes when I confront my feelings  ♫

917
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:02,180
♫  I will surely cry, hugging myself in my own embrace  ♫

918
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,810
♫  Someday  ♫

919
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,850
♫  Someday  ♫

920
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:17,630


921
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:29,240
   

922
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,820
 There's something more about Han Seong Hye that all of us don't know. 

923
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,730
 Seong Hye's life is in my hands, and she's the only one who doesn't know about it. 

924
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:38,830
 So are you saying that I'm fired as a prosecutor? 

925
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:42,190
 So if you wanted life to be comfortable, you should have aligned with a chaebol too. 

926
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:45,020
 Your father has something up his sleeve. 

927
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,950
 I don't think he's just saying it to scare you. 

928
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,420
 Connect me to Lawyer No Hak Tae. 
   

929
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,920
 Bad people tend to act more recklessly when they seem to be doing well. 

930
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,880
 It is usually because they find out they've been fooled. 

931
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,860
 Anyway, they want to testify when they are in unfair situations. 

932
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,400
 Let's just say that we're breaking up now.
