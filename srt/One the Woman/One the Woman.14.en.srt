1
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,610
A few times, I ran some errands for Han Yeong Sik.
[Episode 14]

2
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,850
When he left something in your grandfather's room,

3
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,720
I took it to the Chairman's office.

4
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,290
Sometimes it was a ballpoint pen

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,970
and sometimes a wallet.

6
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,950
I learned much later

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,590
that those were bugging devices.

8
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,390
That day, Chairman Han Yeong Sik

9
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,550
wasn't at the site where your father was harmed.

10
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,690
The person at the factory that day

11
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,400
was Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

12
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,370
You must still be busy,

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,760
even though you no longer have to wear two hats.

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Why are you talking down to me as if you know me?

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,750
That's funny.

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,710
I will reveal what you've been doing until now.

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,790
I think that's my line.

18
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,250
Instead of just losing your memory, did you lose your mind as well?

19
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,400
Have you forgotten everything?

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,320
No. My mind is clearer that ever.

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,420
You ... what did you go around doing that night?

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,330
On your way out of the factory,

23
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,630
you hit my grandmother with your car

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,590
and killed her.

25
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,110
I did feel something hit my car that day.

26
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,240
Was that a person?

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,930
What?

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm going to kill you

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,680
with my own hands.

30
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm curious as to

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,570
what some random general prosecutor can do against a chaebol.

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,630
What "some random general prosecutor"

33
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,410
can do when she's hooked,

34
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,190
is something to look forward to.

35
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,380
A person like you must've done other dirty stuff, too.

36
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,150
Indiscriminate target investigation,

37
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,900
over investigation, entrapment, extensive search operation,

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,530
announcement of suspected crime before prosecution!

39
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,310
I will use all of my judicial power,

40
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,980
and I will wreck you.

41
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,390
This is why we need to improve the prosecution system.

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,680
You don't know what a chaebol is, do you?

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,030
I've never lost to little bugs like you.

44
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,090
You've only fought when you can win.

45
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,600
You've never even started a losing fight, have you?

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,980
I've fought in both winning and losing fights.

47
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,660
When it's a fight I'll clearly lose,

48
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,440
I attack and attack until I win.

49
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,710
Try all you can with your money,

50
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,690
I will do all I can with the law.

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,510
Why are poor people always so aggressive??

52
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Destitution is a scary thing.

53
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,800
And you even lost to one of those with nothing.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
The person your father chose

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,390
wasn't you,

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,190
it was me.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,510
What?

58
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,650
Yes, that's what the law does.

59
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,420
When I try to slap you with my right hand, the law is supposed to stop that hand.

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
In that case,

61
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,480
I can always slap with my left hand.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,320
That's the law you're talking about.

63
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,410
- Hey, you!
- Prosecutor Jo, calm down. Don't lose your temper.

64
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,520
What are you talking about? She slapped me!

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,650
Hey, Where are you going? What?

66
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,780
Oh, my goodness!

67
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,380
I haven't been slapped in a long time.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,630
Gosh ... Hey!

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,550
Prosecutor Jo!

70
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,690
You, what did you go around doing that night?

71
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,380
- Father.
- On your way out of the factory,

72
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,980
you hit my grandmother with your car

73
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,620
and killed her.

74
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,170
Ah ...

75
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,980
How is the search for Kang Mi Na going?

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,740
There hasn't been much progress.

77
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
Can't we just assume she's already dead somewhere?

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,140
[Han Yeong Sik]

79
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,250
[Han Seong Hye]

80
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,130
Why are you just arriving!

81
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,350
The person at the factory that night

82
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,080
wasn't Chairman Han Yeong Sik but Han Seong Hye.

83
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
What is it with your reaction?

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,770
She's the one who hit my grandma with her car.

85
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,400
I know.

86
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,110
The person at the factory that day was Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

87
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,120
How do you know that she was there?

88
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,080
That's because ...

89
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,870
After running an errand for Chairman Han,

90
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,240
I was on my way home.

91
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,150
Her car was scrapped the next day.

92
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,300
I was aware that the police were investigating what had happened,

93
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,120
but I didn't say a word.

94
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,260
I was never asked to run such errands anymore.

95
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,560
Maybe because Chairman Han Yeong Sik didn't want to know

96
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,620
that I realized there was a car accident.

97
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,110
Is that why she said ...

98
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,450
Managing Director Han Seong Hye,

99
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,830
should I also mention you?

100
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,490
I wonder what else Director Kim knows.

101
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,880
Maybe she even knows the secret of the Bermuda Triangle*!
(Mysterious region in the North Atlantic Ocean)

102
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,170
Did you find anything on your Chief Prosecutor?

103
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,970
I did, a big one.

104
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,600
Han Seong Hye can run around all she wants.

105
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,310
The attempted murder of Kang Mi Na

106
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,390
will be verified by Mr. Jang Seok Ho.

107
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,090
Also, Lee Bong Sik's murder

108
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,580
and the Samgeori gang are being investigated by Yu Jun.

109
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,280
So it won't be too many days before everything comes to light.

110
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,970
- Hey, Yu Jun.
- Nuna,

111
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,970
what has happened with Chairman Han Yeong Sik?

112
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,770
Apparently an arrest warrant has been issued

113
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,690
for the art-bribery case and it includes his tax-evasion embezzlement.

114
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,260
I was also asked to hand over the warrant documents for Kang Mi Na.

115
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,760
What? Already?

116
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,080
Do you admit to everything?

117
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,380
- Can you give us a word?
- Is it true?

118
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,640
Say something!

119
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,350
Is it true?!

120
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,730
Chairman!

121
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,740
Is it true?!

122
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,340
Well, look here ...

123
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,280
I haven't seen you in a while.

124
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,270
You called me many times.

125
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,610
I couldn't answer because I was busy.

126
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,780
Who handed over the information about my company?

127
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,380
Was it my head lawyer who resigned?

128
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,740
I already had enough information with me.

129
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,600
Are you doing this to take me down with you?

130
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,730
Why would I go down with you?

131
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,120
Hanju needs to save me.

132
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,660
Then you should've prevented things from getting this bad!

133
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,900
Do you think I'll leave you alone after going through all this?

134
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,130
Do you still have no idea what this situation is like?

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,770
The one who has the final say for my survival

136
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,860
has already changed.

137
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm sorry. It's chaotic due to the forced search and seizure.

138
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,410
I wasn't contacted separately about your arrival.

139
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,800
It's all right. The situation is poor after all.

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll take care of the immediate matters

141
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,760
as needed, in place of my father.

142
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,070
Yes, I understand.

143
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,620
Did you give them all of my father's phones?

144
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
There are not just one or two.

145
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,650
No. I kept this on me.

146
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,480
What's the password?

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,810
I need to contact Chairman Han first before I can give it to you.

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,860
You didn't know this until just now,

149
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,160
but now you know.

150
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm here on my father's behalf,

151
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,700
so what kind of respect is this?

152
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,190
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,610
Please clean this room first.

154
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,130
Yes.

155
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,680
With allegations of embezzlement, tax evasion and breach of duty,

156
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,330
the prosecution has filed an arrest warrant

157
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,480
against Hanju Group's Chairman Han Yeong Sik.

158
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,170
According to Seoul District Prosecutors' office,

159
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,290
there are concerns about destruction of evidence and evasion, so—

160
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,130
Wow! This is about villains trying to screw each other over

161
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,640
and seeking a justice of their own.

162
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
What's happening?

163
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,120
My raccoon-like Chief Prosecutor has sided with Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,870
This ... with this big one as the bait.

165
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,660
"This"?

166
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,420
The CCTV record of that night.

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,540
Fourteen years ago,

168
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,180
your father asked me for a favor. A favor related to you, not business.

169
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,140
Are you saying that the evidence is related to me?

170
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,760
Are you okay?

171
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,720
I don't know what to say.

172
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,750
But ... well ... Since we have new evidence,

173
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm sure we'll only need to apply for a re-investigation of the Seopyeong case.

174
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,580
And once Yu Jun begins to investigate,

175
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,910
they won't be able to skip through like they did back then.

176
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,700
That means we're nearing the end.

177
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,190
Are we really?

178
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,760
If I could only slap these assholes ...

179
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,200
I mean, I saw Han Seong Hye this afternoon,

180
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,880
and I really wanted to just slap ...

181
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,140
I should have.

182
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,620
Oh, it's pissing me off again.

183
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,350
I wonder how many more emotions

184
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,550
I need to work through

185
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,670
in order to fight people like them.

186
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,050
That's what I'm thinking.

187
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,420
I know.

188
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,510
At first, even I thought

189
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,430
I should simply punish those who sinned. That's how I started out, at least.

190
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,670
But after going up against Han Seong Hye at the office this afternoon,

191
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,970
I felt dizzy from the reality of things.

192
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,520
We won't become like them.

193
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,280
We will make them stand before the law.

194
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,190
But once everything is over,

195
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,810
are you going back to the States?

196
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
That place isn't mine either, to be honest.

197
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,490
I don't want to live a life wondering

198
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,140
what would happen to my company's stocks if something goes wrong,

199
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,350
no matter where I am or what I'm doing.

200
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,550
I might be overstepping, Yeon Ju,

201
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,840
but I also want you to feel the same way,

202
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,100
for yourself.

203
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,460
Cheer up.

204
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,640
Wait.

205
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,330
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,340
This cheers you up, doesn't it?

207
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,300
It does.

208
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,040
Eat.

209
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,910
How can they just arrest a big company's chairman?

210
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,700
Isn't this some political scheme?

211
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,250
According to my sister,

212
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,940
apparently an internal whistleblower reported father's corruption within the department.

213
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,130
A "whistleblower"?

214
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,340
Within the department, there are a bunch of enemies that I can think of,

215
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,690
how am I supposed to know who did this?

216
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,190
Hey, how's the company running?

217
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,820
Eonni seems to be taking care of everything in place of Father.

218
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
What's Seong Wun doing, then?

219
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,880
He's better off not becoming an obstacle for Eonni.

220
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,720
Seong Hye, this girl! Isn't this the time for getting her father out of this mess instead of filling in for him?

221
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,130
Think about all the prosecutors her father managed!

222
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,000
How can she let him be arrested so easily?

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,150
It's as if she's been waiting—

224
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,440
Oh my. Has she been waiting?

225
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,330
Oh, my head. I've lost my appetite.

226
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,330
Well, is there anything to whet my appetite?

227
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,810
From what I can tell, with your loud voice,

228
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,690
it seems like you could eat and digest rocks out of anger!

229
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,320
- Why did you ask me to make porridge?
- What?

230
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,280
Director Kim suddenly asked for leave, so there's nothing at home either!

231
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,240
Sister-in-law is also out of the house.

232
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,060
Since there's no need to be careful of rumors either,

233
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,790
I've called back the people who worked here,

234
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,570
so you can ask them for something

235
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,330
when they return to work tomorrow.

236
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,670
Why are you acting like this?

237
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,460
I'm tired of being submissive too.

238
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,520
I want to stop reading other people's moods,

239
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,510
and I want to say whatever I want to.

240
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,990
She ... even she's acting like that?

241
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,840
She's saying she won't commit to meaningless pity.

242
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,550
Although you might have some say around the household if little brother runs the company,

243
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,610
if Eonni takes over, it will be a different story.

244
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,890
Now, you're a mere back-room elder

245
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,180
with a few shares!

246
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,390
What?

247
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,500
Back-room ...

248
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,050
Hi, good morning.

249
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,770
What? What is it? Did something happen?

250
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,680
You should check the notice board.

251
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,080
[Notice]

252
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,910
[Prosecutor: Jo Yeon Ju]
[Details of penalty: Office suspension, two months]

253
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,060
[Penalty date: 27.10.2021]

254
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,030
"Office suspension"?

255
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Chief. Why are you suspending me out of nowhere?!

256
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
The disciplinary commissioner is not listed, and there is no record of a disciplinary meeting.

257
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,500
And what's the reason?

258
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,100
Why are you shouting at me?

259
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,180
Didn't you get the message?

260
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,220
Someone filed a complaint against you!

261
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,810
I mean, a government prosecutor pretended to be a chaebol and forged a fake identity—

262
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,350
Are you out of your mind?

263
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,830
"Complaint"?

264
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,020
Hanju filed a complaint against me?

265
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,860
What offense did I commit against Hanju by adopting an identity?

266
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,270
Who filed it?

267
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,710
The President of the Yumin Foundation?

268
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,610
I mean, whatever the cause, it's not as if there was a decision made!

269
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,130
Why am I being punished as soon as the complaint is filed?

270
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,160
Aren't you aware of disciplinary laws for prosecutors?

271
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,850
Regardless of the verdict,

272
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,440
in a case where demeaning the dignity of a prosecutor or neglecting a job—

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,370
I know, I know!

274
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,420
But it's well known that we prosecutors punish each other lightly,

275
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,690
so why am I being suspended!

276
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,630
Because you're not on our side anymore.

277
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,320
Do you think it ends with suspension?

278
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,050
You've been chosen for the Examination of Eligibility.

279
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,650
You know that you're fired if you aren't eligible, right?

280
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,940
So whether or not you had a personal grudge, why didn't you keep toeing the line?

281
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,950
I mean, a mere prosecutor

282
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,200
being a chaebol. Do you think that's possible?

283
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,480
It seems that you trust chaebols too much.

284
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,090
Do you think a chaebol will

285
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,170
support a mere chief prosecutor until the end?

286
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,470
Are you worrying about me?

287
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,140
You should worry about yourself.

288
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,890
Me? Don't worry!

289
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,010
They can't help but take care of me.

290
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,870
All right, I get it.

291
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,350
You keep relying on them

292
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,840
all the way to the end.

293
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,710
What a life! She worries about others

294
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,840
when her life is about to fall apart.

295
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,150
It's perfect weather for listening to the clock.

296
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,960
Why is ...

297
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,020
Who, who is it?

298
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,790
Who was in this room ...

299
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,490
Korean prosecutors really do work speedily, don't they?

300
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
Look at how the investigation request was filed immediately.

301
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,890
I came here on the premise I'd be fooled by Managing Director Han Seong Hye again,

302
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,190
but I think it's good I made a visit.

303
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,350
How can you be so ... similar?

304
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,010
You're certain you've got nothing to do with my older brother, right?

305
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,460
How could you fool all those people at once?

306
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,470
What did you do with my niece?

307
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,650
How did you ... erase her without letting anyone know?

308
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,710
What?

309
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,160
You hid her!

310
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,460
Did anyone else take advantage of my niece's disappearance?

311
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,760
I suppose the investigation will reveal everything if I wait.

312
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,510
Ah, my gosh ... just thinking about the embarrassment I went through—

313
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,470
You better be prepared to spend the rest of your life in prison!

314
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,340
What! So are you saying that I did something to your niece?

315
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,740
That's why you're being sued.

316
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,230
Do you think I am suing you, with all this embarrassment,

317
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,380
just because I want some money from you?

318
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,670
[An extraordinary fraud case involving a prosecutor pretending to be a corporation chairwoman]

319
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,870
The Chief Prosecutor contacted us.

320
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,350
While it will be hard to arrest Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju,

321
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,900
they'll investigate her without detention.

322
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,870
Is that it?

323
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,830
There was nothing else.

324
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,080
He reports everything and boasts about it.

325
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,340
He's one of those tiring types.

326
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,360
He said he has some evidence

327
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,740
about what happened that day, 14 years ago.

328
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,480
What do you think it might be?

329
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,470
I'm asking you what you think that Chief Prosecutor has.

330
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,260
For evidence ...

331
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm guessing it's the factory's internal CCTV files.

332
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,410
Back then, there wasn't a CCTV in your room,

333
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,080
so perhaps it's the corridor's CCTV?

334
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,290
That's bad news.

335
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,330
Excuse me?

336
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm talking about you.

337
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
What are you going to do?

338
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
When Uncle died,

339
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,130
you're the one who helped me escape.

340
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,810
If you had taken Uncle to the hospital back then, wouldn't he have lived?

341
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,920
[Hanju Hospital]

342
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,250
Uncle, it would have been nice if you had told me in advance that you were coming in.

343
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,860
Asking the workers for the ledgers when I'm not around ...

344
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,740
I heard you were living in the factory after setting up an office.

345
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,890
Where are you coming from?

346
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,180
I need to take a break sometimes, too.

347
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,840
I rushed here after hearing that there was something wrong with the ledgers.

348
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,080
But considering your attitude,

349
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,230
it seems that there's no point in looking further.

350
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,060
For now, I shall take these.

351
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,300
Uncle—

352
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,930
Talk to me for a moment.

353
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,640
To be honest, this is ...

354
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,890
it isn't all that negative for you either.

355
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,180
Are you trying to break a deal with me?

356
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,590
It's not that.

357
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,100
Why did you touch the ledgers?

358
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,600
If you can't do it on your own, you have Seung Wuk. You also have your siblings, Seong Chan and Seong Wun.

359
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,360
Was that it?

360
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,220
It's my first business.

361
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,440
Is that why you came here to find evidence that my business is doing poorly

362
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,590
and accruing debt?

363
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,760
Now that it looks like Grandpa will oust me, let alone not make me his heir,

364
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,230
you must think Seung Wuk will take all my share?

365
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,460
Don't jump to conclusions.

366
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,610
Rather than the loss of money,

367
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,770
your grandfather will be more disappointed by your actions right now!

368
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,900
Think of your grandfather who trusted you. You should not be acting this way.

369
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,440
Are you threatening me by using Grandfather as an excuse?

370
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,350
Are you treating me like a blackmailer?

371
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,520
Should family attack one another, using each other's flaws?

372
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,420
"Family"?

373
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,140
You're so naive.

374
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,790
Just as expected of the eldest son of Hanju Group who will inherit it all in the end anyway.

375
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,890
I can't talk to you anymore.

376
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,500
Wait!

377
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,040
Don't you know that taking these away without permission

378
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,930
could be a problem?

379
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,390
Do you think that by hiding it from me like this, you can hide it forever?

380
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,450
Nothing will change,

381
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,830
even if you wait one or two days more.

382
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,960
Let go! Give it to me!

383
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,230

384
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,160
Uncle!

385
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,260
Uncle!

386
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,350
Yes.

387
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,570
Out of the blue, your uncle told me that he's stopping by the office.

388
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,300
Is something going on with the merger on your side?

389
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,370
I don't know either.

390
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,930
Well then, look into it!

391
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,470
When the merger with Hanju Fashion is completed,

392
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,310
your position in the family will be considerably different,

393
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,760
and your uncle won't be able to notify me like this anymore.

394
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,490
If I had to wait for your younger brothers to shape up,

395
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,060
I would continue to be humiliated.

396
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,240
It was the right decision to give you Hanju Fashion when you were stubborn about it.

397
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,280
Figure out what happened, and call me back.

398
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Yes.

399
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,140

An accident ... It was an accident.

403
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,400
He did that to himself while trying to take the ledgers from me.

404
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,780
I see.

405
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,860
It's an accident anyway, so there's no point in making matters worse!

406
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,440
Not only for me, but for you too.

407
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,660
Think carefully.

408
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,940
In my family, do you think anyone besides me would look after you?

409
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,000
If something happens to me, it's over for you as well.

410
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,010
I was never here. Uncle was alone when that happened to him.

411
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,980
As long as you clean this up,

412
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,860
I can link the police to whomever after the fact

413
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,250
and take care of the situation. Do you get what I mean?

414
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,230
This damn factory.

415
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,260

417
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,950

Go home.

421

If you had reported it back then,

422
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,930
I wonder if Uncle could've lived.

I mean, why would anyone arrest me? I have the most definite identity?

You're bound to go down with them anyway.

And that accident,

472
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,730
do you have any evidence that I did it?

473
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,400
"Evidence"?

474
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,460
Right.

475
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,330
Yeah, let's talk after I bring in that evidence.

476
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,090
You still haven't come to your senses.

477
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,640
Don't you get it?

478
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,400
You and that crazy prosecutor,

479
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,340
you're both totally ruined.

480
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,860
What?

481
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,130
For the retrial of the arson,

482
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,010
who would've guessed they'd question you first for the Kang Mi Na impersonation case?

483
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,910
So, basically ... since I look similar in appearance to Kang Mi Na,

484
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,960
and since I hold a grudge toward Hanju because of my father,

485
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,150
I worked with a person called Han Seung Wuk

486
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,250
and kidnapped Kang Mi Na, and then pretended to be her.

487
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,610
But when it seemed like the truth would be revealed, I resumed my original job as a prosecutor?

488
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,840
How many pages of nonsense did they write?

489
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,670
So is this damned prosecutor going to investigate me with this crazy story?

490
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,370
What else can you do when the Chief Prosecutor issued the warrant?

491
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,550
Basically they're asking you to drag Kang Mi Na here!

492
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,200
But as they couldn't find this one person,

493
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,370
most of them are thinking that she's dead.

494
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:28,100
If this goes from being a missing-persons case into a murder case without a body ...

495
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,260
Seriously. So am I about to be the leading suspect in a murder case?

496
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,130
Does that make sense? It was Han Seong Hye who tried to kill Kang Mi Na!

497
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,990
I mean, we have the driver whom Han Seong Hye arranged!

498
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,170
Ah, about that ...

499
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,110
What?

500
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,380
I'm sorry. They were taking a walk together as they always did ...

501
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,220
This married couple, who were found dead this morning,

502
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,850
is known to be linked to the missing Chairwoman Kang Mi Na of Yumin Group. The police has started its investigation.

503
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,890
It has been confirmed that before the chairwoman went missing, they caused the accident in which she was involved.

504
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,370
It's also been discovered that they were residing at Han's villa who works for Yumin Group.

505
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,780
The reason for their stay at Han's villa

506
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,430
has not been revealed—

507
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,790
As you ordered, I've contacted the prosecution and said that you'll fully cooperate with them.

508
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,550
I'll send the documents across as they are requested.

509
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,100
Give them everything. Hanju of the past doesn't exist anymore, anyway.

510
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,420
Why are you bringing that up now?

511
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,150
I've been busy since this morning because of all the calls coming in.

512
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,910
Where's Han Seung Wuk then?

513
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,390
Right now, he is at the other police station for that investigation.

514
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,810
But I'm sure there won't be a misunderstanding

515
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,460
since his alibi is definite.

516
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,770
But you know, there's a slight problem because we paid

517
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,190
Jang Seok Ho's hospital fees.

518
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,540
Han Seong Hye abandoned him, so we took care of him with a charitable heart!

519
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,410
You should have given him just enough money, but you gave too much.

520
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,330
For the worst-scenario case, I'll contact the people in the States,

521
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,430
so he can leave right away.

522
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,960
What about the Seopyeong factory retrial?

523
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,830
We have the USB, so we can still have a retrial, right?

Right, Nuna.

Regarding the Seopyeong factory arson case,

527

the arsonist turned himself in.

528
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,340
What? Who? Did what?

529
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,060
Through his attorney, he turned himself in at the

530
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,800
Western District Office in Seopyeong. They initially investigated the incident.

531
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,750
The detectives are bringing him in right now. We'll start questioning him straight away.

[Western District Office in Seopyeong]

At the time, Director Han Seong Hye

534
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,300
wanted to reveal that President Han Gang Sik had tampered with the ledgers.

535
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,800
The two of them had an argument.

536
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,670
I went into the office when I heard them arguing.

537
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,970
Managing Director Han Seong Hye left first.

538
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,050
During the process of stopping the chairman from chasing her,

539
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,170
he bumped his head on the desk

540
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,630
and collapsed.

541
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,780
Did he die?

542
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,130
What?

543
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,460
I asked whether he died because of the head injury.

544
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,900
I think so.

545
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,960
And you did not perform any rescue actions, such as calling 911?

546
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
- Yes. That's correct.
- What about the fire?

547
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,770
Why did you set the fire?

548
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,550
This worthless money ... I'm going to burn it to ash

Damn ... that old lady. How is she going to come here at this hour of night?

554
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,530
Back then, in the process of running away,

555
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,850
I saw someone trying to set a fire.

556
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,970
I thought it would make sense to blame the fire on him.

557
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,430
So at first you weren't planning to set the fire,

558
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,530
but you saw someone setting a fire and this gave you the idea of arson,

559
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,800
and you even requested others

560
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,570

561
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,130
Yes.

Where was Director Han Seong Hye when this was happening?

563
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,170
She had been walking out,

564
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,310
and apparently she grabbed a passing taxi.

565
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,110
Did she leave her car there?

566
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,730
Yes.

567
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,700
Back then, she wasn't a good driver. She avoided driving at night in the countryside.

568
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,900
So in the process of returning to Seoul with her car, Mr. Jeong Do Wu,

569
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,600
you also managed a hit-and-run?

00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,480
Yes.

571
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,830
Did Managing Director Han Seong Hye

572
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,070
then hide all these events for you?

573
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,310
I requested her to.

574
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,280
She seemed to think that everything happened because of her,

575
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,690
so she said she'll cover up the incident,

576
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,210
since the person had passed away anyway.

Yes, of course. As for jokkbaengi,

696
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,590
it's a mixture of jokkbal and golbaengi.

697
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,170
The fact that she ordered this, means that

In another words, as a chairwoman and a prosecutor,

When I studied for my exams, the toughest question to answer

was when a multiple-choice question asked, "Find the correct answers below."

725
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,730
I found it hard because there were multiple correct answers.

What are you talking about?

727

I don't mean the part that she was miserable or had a story ...

I wonder what kind of person Kang Mi Na is.

736
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,300
You and I are the same class.

737

You chose me because I'm an heir of this family.

738
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:04,980
I thought they had some dumb chick sitting on that seat, so I went to see her.

739
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,550
And I ended up meeting ...

740
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,230
a con man.

741
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,970
But she wasn't the idiot I imagined.

742
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,910
She suggested a deal.

743
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,550
Was that woman a good person or a bad person?

744
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,410
What would she have done in a situation?

745

758
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,820
Did the fake one who lived in our house really kill the real one?

759

About the fake Kang Mi Na,

760
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,970
no matter how much I think it over, she's not the type to kill someone.

761
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,340
I'm usually spot on with women.

762
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,670
Is that something to brag about?!

763

Don't you think her family is hiding her?

768

But her side of the family all died,

769

on the same day. So we have no one to ask.

770

776

I couldn't even utter a word in front of your grandmother.

777

But even with all those beatings, that girl wouldn't bend!

778
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,500
I did it because she was annoying!

779
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,610
Whenever I saw her I thought,

780
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,760
"I should've lived like that."

781
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,820
How twisted.

782
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,130
Then I guess we can cast her family aside.

783
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:32,980
It would've been hard for her to escape so perfectly on her own.

784
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,430
I already removed all her friends.

785

So who got to meet her in the meantime?

786
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,980
She volunteered at the prison,

787
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,170
and went around dealing in paintings.

788

there have been moments that made me organize my thoughts.

796

In my office, if you open the drawer of my small table,

797
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:40,590
there's a ballpoint pen that I used a long time ago.

798
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,710
Without telling anyone,

799
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,990
bring that to me, please.

800
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,890
What will you do about dinner?

801
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,650
I'll simply have a glass of whiskey here.

802

803

I asked her to leave with me.

805
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,010
I thought that maybe we were in the same boat.

806
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,610
I arrogantly thought like that.

807
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,880
But ... I was rejected.

808
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,180
Mi Na voluntarily chose Hanju and not me.

809
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,480
Which is why I was hurt even more.

810
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,860
But when I think about Kang Mi Na now, as a person,

811
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:49,000
she wasn't someone who lost to anyone, at least inside her heart.

812
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,210
If she is that kind of a woman, then what is she trying to do now?

813
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,710
She gathered the family's weaknesses to break free from Hanju,

814
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:00,380
and she was gutsy enough to make a deal with that conman, Lee Bong Sik, to get out of the country.

815
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,780
Isn't it a little strange that she hasn't returned, even though she's now Yumin Group's successor?

816
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,190
Hiding a dead body is much harder than you think.

817
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,850
We just keep thinking that we can't find her,

818
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,820
but why isn't Kang Mi Na showing up in person?

819
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,280
If she's not dead,

820
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,120
or if she hasn't lost her memory somewhere, then ...

821
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,320
Sit down. Let's have a drink together.

822
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,150
You selected and served only the nuts I like.

823
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,640
You have such good sense.

824
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,980
Thank you.

825
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,520
Is it really a "sense," though?

826
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,780
Pardon?

827
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm having trouble understanding.

828
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,550
What ...

829
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:01,710
The genetics test, what do you think about it?

830
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,020
Those people may have forged the result sheet.

831
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:14,890
Anyway, for her to pass as a biological child means that the test was run using Kang Mi Na's specimen.

832
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,850
That's why I changed my thinking.

833
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,370
It's not about who switched the result sheets.

834
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:28,100
It's about who is the person that has Kang Mi Na's specimen?

835
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,150
This was sent by the President of Yumin Foundation.

836
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:45,040
Give both that and this sample to my assistant, Jeong Do Wu, outside.

[Kang Mi Na, DNALSK, Gangnam-gu Hangangro 18-32, Seoul]

838
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,320
Yes, ma'am.

839
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,960
So we have someone who had to run away because they knew Han Seong Hye's weaknesses.

840
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,610
And this someone will never be safe as long as Han Seong Hye is still there.

841
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:14,400
Also, who is someone that has Kang Mi Na's specimen to run a genetic test?

842
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,850
Do you mean Kang Mi Na herself?

843
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,520
That woman is nearby Han Seong Hye.

844
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,700
Right after the accident, is there someone new who showed up around Han Seong Hye?

845
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,480
It must have been a shame.

846
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,570
I very nearly fell for it.

847
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,420
The door that anyone who's new will push first,

848
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,740
you shouldn't have opened it with familiarity.

849
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,290
You also shouldn't have tried to hide your wound as that made it more obvious.

850
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,960
I think there's some sort of misunderstanding.

851
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,890
Then eat.

852
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,460
I'm telling you to eat that.

853
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,600
This is no fun. Shall we stop?

854
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,190
This is a genetics test that I ran with your hair.

855
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,930
Are you here to get revenge or something?

856
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,100
Do you still think I'm bad?

857
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,640
Who's the one who has been tricking me?!

858
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,940
She just left.

859
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,440
Catch her.

What's wrong?

862
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,650
Oh, you're not well it seems.

863
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,140
What are you doing? You should help her.

Where are you hurt?

01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,790
Run away, quickly!

866

Those guys are probably really looking down on us now.

867
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,570
We got our asses beat by them last time, so it's understandable.

868
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,990
This time, you said that we can beat them up all we want, right?

869
01:03:58,990 --> 01:03:59,920
That's what I said!

870
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,900
They're dead meat.

[Epilogue]

889
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,590
If I had known that you were suspicious about the factory fire,

890
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:40,410
I would have told you about Han Seong Hye sooner.

891
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,420
I'm sorry for telling you this so late.

892
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,130
As I'm sure you've heard,

893
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,480
it looks like Seong Hye was planning to reveal your father's accounting fraud.

894
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,800
All these years, my father has given so much of himself to Hanju Fashion and Nuna Seong Hye!

895
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,400
I've heard something about your alibi for that night that seems suspicious.

896
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,600
Do you have any proof that I was there?

897
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,610
Shouldn't you leave now?

898
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:12,620
Aren't you being a little too disrespectful to my father on a day like this?

899
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:25,170
If you say one word, it can be resolved, Uncle.

900
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,510
You can save all of them!

901
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,900
From now on, I will shoulder all tasks that are related to Chairman Han Gang Sik.

902
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:37,140
What is most similar to that time is that the owner doesn't have a clear conscience. Don't you think?

903
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:48,380
But even that time when his relationship with Chairman Han was bad,

904
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:54,220
what worried your father the most, Han Seung Wuk, was you

905
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,810
Whenever something happened to you, Seung Wuk, he worried

906
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,840
about you living a life where the first thing you thought was

907
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,630
"What will happen to our company's stocks?"

When I heard that you returned from America,

909
