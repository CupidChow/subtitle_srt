1
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
   

2
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,820
   

3
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,870


4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Prosecutors and gangsters ... What do these two have in common?

5
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,010
   

6
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,440
This is our territory.

7
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,510
No one outside knows what happens in here. 
    

8
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,510
First ... They each have their territory.

9
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,350
So ...

10
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,620
you can relax.

11
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,040
The investigators made you very uncomfortable, right?

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,220
Even during Lee-Bong-Sik-gate*, it wasn't this bad. 
  (wordplay on the USA political scandal, "Watergate") 

13
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,650
It's getting harder and harder to find someone in the prosecutor's office that I can communicate with. 
    

14
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,100
Don't worry. It's nothing if we don't indict.

15
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,920
It's not like every Tom, Dick and Harry can prosecute.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,660
Second ... Just as we use weapons, gangsters have weapons they use without hesitation.

17
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,040
There's no proof you bribed the National Tax Service director with a painting. What can they do?

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,800
Anyway, Lee Bong Sik got rid of it,

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,410
so the customer list for that painting won't ever be revealed. Don't worry.

20
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,480
This time as well, I will only trust in you, Deputy Prosecutor.

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,060
Do I have that kind of clout?

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,150
These days people say

23
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,020
that prosecutors are one office below the Ministry of Justice.

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,760
In this world, how much can be overcome with one's own strength?

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,260
If you win borrowing someone else's strength, that's having strength as well.

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,770
Oh.

27
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm being called. Rest well and go. When the prosecutor in charge is changed, everything will be fine.

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,940
Yes, Attorney General. Yes, salute!

29
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,720
Third ... If you look closely, prosecutors and gangsters are nothing freaking special,

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,750
but both act as if they're incredibly special.

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,560
They are a "legitimate" gangster organization,

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,610
and we ... we are an "illegitimate" gangster organization. That's all. 
    

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,590
What words do you think I live by?

34
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,320
I don't know.

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,070
"There's nothing to fear about meeting a prosecutor."

36
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,300
Still, since I was 14 years old, I feel an urge to pee when passing a government office.

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,510
How can I walk into the public prosecutor's office and report something?

38
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,980
Then will you all receive criminal punishment together after using weapons with the Samgeori gang?

39
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,870
The times have changed.

40
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,210
If they're thugs like the Samgeori gang,  it's 100% certain that their night club

41
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,890
will have some proof of minor workers, tax evasion and violating the food hygiene law.

42
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,050
Just find that and submit it.

43
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,560
Let the law of the land take care of them neatly.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,980
We're not so confident ourselves when it comes to that food hygiene law.

45
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,400
I keep on telling you about that!

46
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,860
If you're going to meet the prosecutor, you must be confident. Then what must you have?

47
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,260
Courage?

48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,380
They said all the smart kids went to college and didn't stay in the gang.

49
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,190
This right to prosecute, only a prosecutor has it.

50
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,650
So if you can manipulate that well, then this crime isn't even a crime. Who will manipulate it and how?

51
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,180
Come on now. I was going to subtly take care of you later.

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,540
If you speak so plainly ...

53
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,820
You knew, huh?

54
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,120
I almost misunderstood you. What took you so long?

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,540
We should make it easy for each other.

56
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,380
It's not so easy to make requests of the general prosecutor.

57
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,270
Do you know how much stress I have?

58
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,700
Hyeong-nim, the Samgeori gang have forced their way in with weapons just now.

59
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,400
What? These punks are taking the initiative.

60
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,370
I think you'll have to avoid them for now.

61
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,620
Are you still fighting over the right to operate night clubs like this?

62
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,520
The times have changed, so how is it that there's no progress?

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,610
What is this bitch saying?

64
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,510
Seeing as you're cursing at me, you must not know me.

65
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,540
You stupid punk.

66
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,560
You're talking to the direct successor of the Nammun gang in Seopyeong.

67
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Oh-hey! Don't mention the past.

68
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,420
Have you taken some drugs or what?

69
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,070
Child, who are you?

70
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,440
Ow, that hurts!

71
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,560
- Hey, get her!
 - Hey, get her!

72
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,190
   

73
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,390
   

74
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,790
- Nuna. 
- You surprised me. What's the Seopyeong branch doing here?

75
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,940
Were you at Seopyeong yesterday? 
    

76
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,800
You smell like pain relief patches. Am I right?

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,010
Why would I go all the way there?

78
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,630
Yesterday, the Seopyeong Samgeori gang went to overthrow the World Cup gang

79
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,310
but because someone suppressed them and disappeared, they couldn't do anything and left.

80
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,920
Anyhow, the war on crime is the task we prosecutors must forever embrace, isn't it?

81
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,370
My informant saw you.

82
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,660
It's the one who was wearing the yellow training suit, right? I knew it as soon as I saw him.

83
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,930
Are you still taking bribes from criminals, as you did in Seopyeong?

84
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,760
We've been having conflicts with the police lately over organized crime.

85
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,180
If you had been caught when the police went in, you would have been in big trouble.

86
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,760
All right,  Yu Jun. I'll try hard to get caught by only you.

87
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,820
Your suit is pretty today.

88
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,390
That's not what I'm talking about.

89
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,420
Why have you become like this?

90
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,800
You weren't like this at the training institute or when you first started.

91
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,490
You speak as if you know me really well.

92
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,080
But you might be the only one who thinks we're that close.

93
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,310
Could that be? Could I not know you, Nuna?

94
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,300
When your head is spinning about

95
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,810
whether the Second or Third Division Deputy might become the next Chief Prosecutor.

96
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,280
Which line do you have to align yourself with ...

97
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,930
Nuna!

98
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh, hey. Give me that.

99
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,180
Thank you.

100
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,920
- Have you arrived at work? 
 - Have you had breakfast?

101
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,340
Where's the smell of pain relief patches coming from?

102
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,180
Prosecutor Jo, were you up all night again?

103
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,170
I read so many reports that my neck hurts.

104
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,400
As expected, our Third-Division ace.

105
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,580
Our Third Division works this much.

106
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,380
These days, it's hard to find people who passionately work all night.

107
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,310
I've got a long way to go if I'm going to keep up with you, Deputy Chief.

108
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,780
The prosecutor with stamina and two hearts, Ryu Seung Deok.

109
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,210
I've cut out the newspaper article and carry it around in my heart like this.

110
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,450
Hey.

111
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,760
"Two hearts"? That's the article from Lee-Bong-Sik-gate, right?

112
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,170
The huge scandal over our Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok, who lost out on making the arrest at the last minute.

113
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,900
So what if he has two hearts? He should catch one criminal.

114
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,240
He uselessly stays up all night

115
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,760
and can't concentrate at the important moment and loses them right before the arrest.

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,330
- Isn't that so?
 - Yes. No. That's ...

117
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,240
It's all right. Speak comfortably.

118
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,490
-The thing is ... 
 - Don't worry about Deputy Prosecutor Ryu and speak comfortably.

119
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,330
Since you stayed up all night, was there efficiency?

120
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,260
Truthfully, I didn't stay up all night.

121
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh, you didn't stay up all night?

122
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,020
- I can't say I didn't stay up all night.
 - Then you're saying you did stay up.

123
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,990
- It's not certain. 
 - If it's not certain, you're saying you didn't stay up all night.

124
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,530
I also can't say that it's not true that I didn't stay up all night.

125
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,490
Well, anyway,

126
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,680
there was efficiency.

127
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,710
Right? 
 - Yes.

128
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,790
- Right. 
 - Go inside.

129
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,420
I didn't upset either of them. That's a prudent outcome.

130
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,260
You were investigating Lee-Bong-Sik-gate, asking for  my cooperation, to align yourself with Deputy Chief Ryu.

131
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,490
Is there any new information? You came because of that, huh?

132
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,150
How can you talk about it here so senselessly, you pretty punk?

133
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,370
It's essential info, so let's talk about it privately. I'll call you. Hurry up and go.

134
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,070
She's in a league of her own. Her character is so abrasive.

135
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,390
Even if you search the entire world for that kind of human being,

136
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,410
she is the only one.

137
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,020
   

138
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,430
I told you to come down a long time ago, why are you only coming down now?

139
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,090
   

140
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,430
You saw the tabloid article, right?

141
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,590
You're not even saying you're sorry now?

142
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,890
Hey, if it weren't for you, would my son have wandered around outside and been swept up in strange rumors?

143
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,400
The father is even being investigated by prosecutors for the company.

144
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,250
These dirty rumors come out about the son?

145
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,720
Do you even know you should be sorry?

146
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,430
Why is there no answer? Do my words not seem like words?

147
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,300
Mom, that's enough. 
    

148
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,370
It's obvious the employees have eyes.

149
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,910
What reason do they have to walk through the living room?

150
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,510
I warned you.

151
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,490
I can let you eat and sleep in our house, but don't act proud.

152
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,250
If you're the daughter of a mistress, act like one.

153
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,970
Hurry up and go upstairs.

154
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,830
- Why are you coming home so early? 
 - I was up all night and I'm just coming in now.

155
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,480
Even I, who had to take care of that tabloid article, am staying still.

156
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,120
Why are you giving Sister-in-law a hard time over Seong Wun's tabloid article?

157
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,490
What are we going to do if she starts to have other thoughts over this?

158
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,700
If we give her leeway for no reason, she could turn on us and sue.

159
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,190
Act like a good person in moderation. Human beings are all the same.

160
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,000
If you don't step on them, they'll crawl up.

161
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,560
   

162
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,630
Did you call me, Deputy Chief?

163
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,880
Yes, Prosecutor Jo. Do you play the stock market?

164
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,350
You know him, right? The CEO of Golden Circle, who came in last month for embezzlement.

165
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,990
Your Lordship, this is really high-class information.

166
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,530
If I do this for you, I'm getting out safely, right?

167
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,680
I told you not to worry. Financial crimes are difficult to investigate.

168
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,420
It's complicated, even for the reporters.

169
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,910
There's nothing comfortable about getting out either.

170
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,580
I shouldn't have started an entertainment agency.

171
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,580
Those kids are gathering every night and doing drugs because I'm not there.

172
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,230
- Even if investigators come, call first and don't go running.
 - Don't I have to go with them?

173
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,310
As long as it isn't drugs or they don't see you in flagrante delicto*, they won't be carrying a warrant. 
  (The act of committing a crime) 

174
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,530
According to criminal procedure, the investigator must receive the suspect's consent

175
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,370
to take him to the station for questioning.

176
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,910
You can refuse them.

177
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,180
But what kind of tip is it?

178
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,710
I see her ladyship here is also quick to catch on. We understand each other.

179
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,250
- I know, right? Hey, give Prosecutor Jo a tip as well.
 - Shall I?

180
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,520
- Come over here.
 - Yes.

181
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,740
You will be assigned a case next week.

182
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,520
You know the Hanju Group's National Tax Service Director bribery case, right?

183
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,810
The Second Division has the case for now,  but it seems they have the mistaken impression that it involves a slush fund.

184
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,450
Take it and look over it well.

185
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,800
- You understand, right? 
 - Of course.

186
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,600
Fine. It's time for Prosecutor Jo to become bonded with Hanju Group.

187
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,110
Sister-in-law, are you all right?

188
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,830
Mother is very angry.

189
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,680
Yes, I'm all right.

190
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,250
Sister-in-law, be understanding. Mother is excessive because it has to do with her son. 
    

191
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,030
Of course, you wouldn't know because you don't have a son.

192
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,930
What is brother's tabloid article about this time?

193
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,350
The children won't send it to me since it's about our household. 
    

194
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,650
I guess you haven't seen it yet.

195
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,750
"A third-generation H-Group member, who is usually a source of gossip over his messy personal life,"

196
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,850
"engaged in disorderly conduct with a certain sports star K in an airplane bathroom."

197
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,380
Oh my. My, oh my.

198
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,350
"No one noticed as Hanju Air's new plane"

199
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,990
"has bathrooms larger than its rival's."

200
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,240
- It has such convincing appeal. 
 - Tabloid articles originally make crazy things make sense.

201
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,350
- Don't you know our oppa? 
 - This wasn't fabricated.

202
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,490
Sister-in-law, what will you do if his actions create a child outside somewhere?

203
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,610
Restrain your husband.

204
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,360
Would he listen if I tried to restrain him?

205
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,240
She acts so pitifully.

206
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,550
At times like this, your life is more comfortable.

207
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,560
The husband you should crackdown on is not in this world anymore.

208
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,090
Why you—

209
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,260
Prosecutor, the perpetrator of the Mecca assault is here.

210
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,190
- Where is he? 
 - He said he'd sit on the sofa ...

211
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,230
What kind of valuable guest does he think he is that he's sitting on the sofa?

212
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,450
I think he's a relative of Songseong Construction's chairman.

213
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,210
Who?

214
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,020
You will know since you're the expert, but there's some injustice here.

215
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,770
If you don't know what you did wrong, there will always be a sense of injustice.

216
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,750
The other side was the first to provoke me.

217
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,810
I bought a nice car and wanted to take it for a spin

218
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,620
but that delivery scooter was so bothersome before my eyes. How could I not get annoyed?

219
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,800
- So you hit someone? 
 - It's not as if I hit him for free.

220
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,860
Are you Jo Tae Ho from "Veteran*" or what? 
  (2015 South Korean action film) 

221
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,600
Can you do that to someone if you throw some money at them?

222
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Ms. Prosecutor, you must like movies. Don't like them too much.

223
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,320
Yoo Ah In is sent to prison in the movie but what would happen if that happened in real life?

224
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,550
The prosecutor in charge took it easy on Yoo Ah In, and I think he became the executive director of that company?

225
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,410
From what I've heard, our elder relative says he's taken out some insurance with you.

226
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,720
Could you become the executive director of Songseong Group or not?

227
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,220
I can't believe it.

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,780
So the elder you're talking about ...

229
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,820
This is you, this is your wife, your cousin,

230
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,670
sister-in-law, father.

231
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,400
You're saying this is Chairman Song.

232
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,230
No, it's the father of the brother-in-law of my sister-in-law. It's one whole family.

233
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,650
Family, my butt.

234
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,740
Then are Biden and Putin in one family?

235
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,090
Let's go with non-prosecution. He said you'd treat me well.

236
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,680
Yes, Chairman. It's me.

237
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,390
Why is Seong Wun not to be found?

238
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,590
At this age, the father is disgraced at the prosecutor's office and the son is disgraced in the airplane.

239
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,150
The household is doing well.

240
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,120
Don't worry too much. I think the company stocks have recovered.

241
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,950
I worked a bit on the comments and Sinyeong Airlines, which we bought recently, has caught public interest.

242
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,710
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

243
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,470
Are you saying you don't even want to eat your meals with us?

244
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,890
You told her not to eat in front of you since her picking at her food yesterday bothered you.

245
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,870
Sister-in-law does eat way too little.

246
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,960
I thought she lived only drinking water.

247
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,300
Just eat enough not to die. It would be annoying for you to leave this house by dying.

248
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,780
Mother, how should we prepare for Grandfather's memorial service?

249
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,560
Should all of us women go to the salon together and leave together?

250
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,720
My Seon Wu will be standing up in front of everyone as the eldest grandson for the first time,

251
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,080
so I think he'll need a makeover.

252
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,720
Don't you have to go to Jeju Island tomorrow, Sister-in-law?

253
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,340
Jeju Island? Why?

254
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,110
No, I'm talking to Little Sister-in-law.

255
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,930
Tomorrow is the opening of Little Sister-in-law's family's Jeju Hotel.

256
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:17,230
Oh, they beat you in obtaining a permit to build.

257
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,560
I wondered if you had to go, but couldn't say anything.

258
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,360
I heard that your mother is having her 70th birthday party there.

259
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,450
- Oh, you didn't know, Sister-in-law? 
 - I spoke out of turn.

260
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:36,150
She must have only invited immediate family. It's a little ambiguous to call you immediate family, Sister-in-law.

261
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,430
Could you not speak every word that pops into your head?

262
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,140
Anyhow, your family is so selfish.

263
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,270
If they call to gather everyone and take a picture and you're not there,

264
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,180
how much would people gossip?

265
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,060
That damn "I'm sorry."

267
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,470
These days, even if you ask the phone, it gives more varied answers than you do.

268
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,320
How did we make an in-law connection with such a dirty household?

269
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,560
It's my biggest resentment that I listened to you that time and gave my permission.

270
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,940
I should have opposed her until the end.

271
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,560
Stop it. I spent my whole life without the help of my wife's family.

272
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,630
I thought my children should receive some business help.

273
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,290
Did I know they'd push a child born illegitimately into our house?

274
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,510
I would rather be relaxing in the prosecution's interrogation room.

275
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,740
Why is he bringing up my family?

276
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,870
You leave out the fact that you had no influence because you were the second son.

277
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,290
If there hadn't been a fire at the factory that time ...

278
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,850
- Mom. 
 - Why?

279
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,580
Hey, for the next while don't show yourself or breathe in front of me.

280
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,790
No, leave.

281
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,870
Get out!

282
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,940
Do I not have a temper? Aren't you being too much?

283
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,880
It's my son's sister-in-law's younger—

284
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,430
- Brother-in-law. 
 - Yes, brother-in-law.

285
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,240
How can I explain it? 
 - Cousin's younger sister's husband.

286
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,160
Cousin's younger sister's husband. Yes.

287
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,310
Anyhow, it seems that the young man has been quite rude.

288
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,180
- Chairman. 
 - Yes?

289
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,730
Are the prosecutors of the Republic of Korea pushovers?

290
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,330
Since last year, you gave money to the deputy general manager, the chief prosecutor,

291
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,110
and the deputy chief prosecutor of our District Prosecutors' Office when they were your dinner guests.

292
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,260
Didn't you!

293
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh yes. I did.

294
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,010
What about me?

295
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,460
- Excuse me? 
 - Why don't you give me any money?

296
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,440
Why aren't you giving me any extra besides the regular payments?

297
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,740
I'm an old-timer who shaves baseball bats in the Seoul Central District.

298
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,010
I will accept and eat until I'm satisfied.

299
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,440
How can you  barely show your appreciation and then send your in-laws, second cousins, and everyone else you know?

300
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,420
Please calm down.

301
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,270
I think I was neglectful in showing my sincere appreciation.

302
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,120
But still, we did back-door deals together in the past, so does our connection need those things?

303
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,790
Real connections don't come from playing golf or drinking.

304
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,560
They're created by doing back-door deals together. Don't you think so?

305
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,390
If I hadn't introduced you to the deputy prosecutor during that case,

306
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,740
would you have been able to go from Seoul's bottom

307
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,830
to the place you are now?

308
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,520
What are you talking about right now?

309
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,450
Connections?

310
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,650
Look here, Chairman.

311
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,970
Connections are needed by the side that wants something.

312
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,070
You think a mere prosecutor will get scared if you bring up old news as a weakness, right?

313
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm not like that. It's good you brought it up.

314
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,130
I've come here from the bottom, like you.

315
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,100
So you're the one who should be careful.

316
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,600
I know best where to hit for it to hurt, since we've come from the same place.

317
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,140
I was short-sighted.

318
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,230
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,520
You don't need to apologize like that.

320
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,190
Well even with medication, if there are no side effects, there isn't any effectiveness either.

321
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,870
Let's overcome the side effects and do well. I've eaten well and I'll go now.

322
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,260
Yes, Uncle. Aren't you done yet?

323
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,060
- Look, you punk. 
 - Aish!

324
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,380
Hey. Do you guys know who you are doing this to?

325
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,520
Who are you? Who are you?

326
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,150
Do you think that in all of the Republic of Korea, you're the only one to have backup?

327
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:59,100
Even if we wanted to do things according to the law, you wiggle out like a mudfish and we have to step up.

328
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,580
Hey Yeon Ju, we're almost done.

329
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Finish up now. There's some fieldwork tomorrow too.

330
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,900
Okay. I hear you.

331
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,390
Hey, is it okay to beat up someone and then throw them a few banknotes, on a small scale?

332
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,830
It should be about this much. Take this and go abroad for the next little while.

333
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,320
The victim says that he doesn't want to see your face in the Republic of Korea for the next little while.

334
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,460
- You understand? 
 - Yes.

335
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,610
- Yeah?! Are you kidding me? 
 - Yes.

336
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,230
If I see you wandering around I'll just ...

337
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,850
Take it, punk. Take it.

338
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,200
- Did you enjoy dinner? 
 - Yes.

339
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,830
That Mecca assault from earlier, make it non-prosecution.

340
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,300
What?

341
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,070
Instead, increase the settlement money by eighteen times what they wanted to pay.

342
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,240
We have to crush people who have a lot of money with money.

343
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,290
Yes.

344
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,500
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to use some vacation I've amassed.

345
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,340
Both of you shouldn't work overtime for about a week and don't come to work on the weekends. Get some rest.

346
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,300
- Is there something wrong? 
 - I suppose you should know since we're on the same team?

347
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,150
I might be able to go out to do an undercover investigation regarding Lee Bong Sik-gate.

348
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,200
"Lee-Bong-Sik-gate"?

349
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,850
That guy sold fake paintings to chaebols*  and ran off. 
  (wealthy conglomerate family members) 

350
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,700
Our Seoul Central District totally saw blood because we lost him.

351
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,980
When was it? You always carry it around with you, Prosecutor.

352
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,820
It's already been three years.

353
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,560
Many chaebol families have fallen for the art scam. 
    

354
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,990
It's rumored they were using the paintings as bribes

355
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,460
and slush funds.

356
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,200
There will be many chaebols who sighed aplenty over him getting away.

357
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,190
Then, has that Lee Bong Sik struck again?

358
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,140
There's info that he may strike again. If it's been three years, it's about time for the money to have run out.

359
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,740
Someone who has had fun with this kind of scam will definitely return for the same crime.

360
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,870
Oh, is it some type of investigation principle?

361
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,080
No. That's what they said on last week's "Unanswered Questions" show.

362
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,060
Then it's not even that he will strike again but that he may strike again.

363
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,600
So are you taking time off work based on gossip that he might be returning and what you heard on a variety show?

364
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,600
For this, I have to go without reporting it. It's the case that troubled the deputy prosecutor three years ago.

365
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,280
- I must catch him as a surprise, right and tight. 
 - And you must align yourself.

366
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,550
- Bingo. 
 - What should we do about requesting backup support?

367
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,440
I didn't even report it, so how can I get backup support?

368
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm  totally all right, so you all get some rest.

369
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,300
Did someone give her money and is she going on some hot-springs vacation?

370
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,700
- You thought that too? 
 - No.

371
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:53,600
   

372
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,040
   

373
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,930
 This temper all came from grandma.  

374
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,490
 Why is she sulking over her granddaughter losing her temper?  

375
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,700
 The buses stop early. She left alone so fearlessly in the middle of the night.  

376
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,900
 Grandma! Grandma! 

377
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,950
 Grandma! 

378
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,280
 Hello? 

379
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,130
 I think my grandmother was in a hit-and-run accident. 

380
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,840
 Where are you? 

381
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,340
 Let me look. I'm near the Hanju factory. 

382
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,930
 All ambulances are at the Hanju factory fire site right now. 

383
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,020
 I'll search and send one to you as fast as possible. 

384
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,630
 Grandma. Grandma. 

385
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,680
 Help me! Help me! 

386
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,440
 Help! 

387
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,770
 Grandma. Grandma. 

388
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,960
   

389
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
There's not much time still left now, Grandma.

390
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,990
Stop it.

391
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,110
A little bit, just a little bit more.

392
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,640
Stop it now.

393
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,960
Stop watching! 
    

394
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,210
Why are you looking at your tabloid articles so diligently? 
    

395
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,180
You've only looked at your cell phone all day today.

396
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,260
The comments are so malicious.

397
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,170
Why must the tabloid say that sports star Ms. K

398
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,080
was humiliated by being eliminated in the qualifying round of an international competition?

399
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,600
Why do they finish it like this? I'm getting cursed more because they think it's because of me.

400
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,580
Stop paying attention and get out.

401
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,930
Why are you acting like that? Are you mad?

402
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,330
Where is there a girlfriend like me?

403
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,830
What's so pretty about you that I even drop you to your house garage.

404
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,070
That's right. You're an angel, darling.

405
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,200
- I'm going. 
 - Go.

406
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,690
Go safely.

407
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,790
Damn it.

408
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,670
Why are you standing there like that again? She's going to be startled.

409
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,990
Whose work is this tabloid article?

410
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,690
Is it Sister-in-law who bought the new airline, and did it for advertising purposes?

411
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,610
Or is it you trying to hide your real girlfriend?

412
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,660
Let's keep it polite.

413
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,750
You're like a voyeur, watching without making a sound.

414
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,260
Isn't it in bad taste?

415
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,440
You don't know shame.

416
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,270
Shame? I don't know who should be more embarrassed right now.

417
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,320
I never acted inappropriately toward you.

418
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,910
I always have him sleep at home.

419
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,980
I'm sorry. You must be tired. Go on home.

420
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,850
See you tomorrow.

421
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,650
Do you have any emotions?

422
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,290
At times, I get goosebumps looking at you.

423
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:11,820
   

424
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,370
So that's what you look like, Bong Sik.

425
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,890
He smuggled himself out of Seopyeong Port last time, and this time he returned through there.

426
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,630
And there's a high probability he will be at today's auction.

427
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,070
The style is very similar to the event last time.

428
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,890
They're mostly domestic artists and American works that have gotten attention recently.

429
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,820
Since it's being done in cooperation with large corporations, rather than people in the art world,

430
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,900
there are a lot of laypeople like celebrities and department-store VIPs.

431
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,050
It's a perfect setting to scam them.

432
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,120
But don't I need a VIP invitation to go to that kind of place?

433
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,910
This was at my house so I brought it in. It's a place my mom goes to.

434
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,560
You silver-spoon* punk. You pretty punk.
 (Born into luxury) 

435
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,550
Fine. Shall we go properly undercover today?

436
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,460
Don't worry about them being suspicious of my identity.

437
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,970
When I go undercover it's not acting but almost to the point of possession,

438
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,960
where I can express the mood.

439
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,320
When you went undercover for land speculation cases and such, did you dress like this?

440
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,160
That is right. The Pocheon land fraud case.

441
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,730
What other clothes do you have?

442
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,590
I chose something similar to what my cousins wear. It looks pretty good.

443
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,020
Obviously! Even though we went to the same university and passed the bar exam together, we aren't the same.

444
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,500
It's good to devote yourself to aligning yourself with the "right" side but there's no need to overdo it.

445
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,310
Hey, aligning yourself is a line, a rope.

446
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,880
When you're climbing that one skinny rope, how can you climb with just moderate effort?

447
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,100
You have to climb with all of your concentration in order not to fall to the ground.

448
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,630
Let's go.

449
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,250
- Yes. 
  - Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju? 

450
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,030
 This is No Hak Tae from Hanju. 

451
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,590
Oh, yes. Yes.

452
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,170
I heard a lot about you being the ace of the Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

453
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,070
Are there already rumors like that?

454
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,940
But I'm on vacation.

455
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,030
I also didn't want to just talk to you over the phone.

456
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,400
I called because I wanted to meet and speak to you privately.

457
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,180
- Yes, let's do that.
  - When is your vacation over? 

458
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,190
I'll call you again.

459
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,700
Call me anytime about the middle of next week.

460
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,560
Yes.

461
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,300
Who is it?

462
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,680
Do you know the head of the legal team at Hanju, No Hak Tae?

463
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,090
No Hak Tae? Oh, No Hak Tae.

464
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,270
I heard he's the deputy director's friend.

465
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,710
I remember he said the person was all right.

466
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,760
He's an all-right person? That's a little rough.

467
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,830
- Why, when they say he's all right? 
 - Haven't you ever been on a blind date?

468
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,990
When they say a person is "all right," there's always a trap.

469
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,410
Anyway, let's go.

470
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,600
Didn't I tell you to leave? Why are you just standing there?

471
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,880
You told me to have any clothes that you didn't choose for me checked.

472
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,730
I told her to go to the auction event today.

473
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,350
Then you're saying you'll wear that right now?

474
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,710
Didn't your family teach you to have a discerning eye?

475
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,060
Anyway, who would have thought to teach an abandoned child?

476
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,030
Sister-in-law, escort mom outside first.

477
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,330
Yes, Big Sister-in-law. Let's go, Seon Wu.

478
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,400
Mother.

479
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,140
- Thank you, Big Sister-in-law. 
 You don't need to thank me.

480
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,450
It's just that I didn't want to be entangled in this classless childishness.

481
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,790
Wouldn't it be better for you to go to the auction rather than sit there next to us?

482
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,220
Then on your way back, stop at the department store next door and pick up my shoes.

483
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,110
They say they arrived this morning from Milan.

484
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,990
Why are you asking Sister-in-law to do your work?

485
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,170
It's annoying.

486
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,320
If Mom asks you to earn your keep next time, tell her you're doing errands for me.

487
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,160
While you're out, get some fresh air and rest for a bit.

488
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,980
You suffered a lot. You need to rest too.

489
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,280
All right. Thank you, Big Sister-in-law.

490
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,890
 In case you saw the article saying that the whole family will get together at the Jeju Island event, 

491
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,450
 in case you were thinking to appear, give up. 

492
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,380
 Let's say you're feeling too poorly to participate. 

493
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,070
 There would be too much talk if I said ahead of time that you couldn't come. 

494
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:21,970
   

495
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,970
Should I try accepting a painting like this too?

496
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,240
 I only ever accept stuff from companies that make their money on real estate.  

497
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,430
  They only feed me sashimi all the time. There's no sense of elegance like this.  

498
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,150
 The auction will start shortly. 

499
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,370
  We ask that everyone make their way into the event hall.  

500
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,590
This event is sponsored by Hanju Group together with Haebyeol Gallery.

501
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,700
We will start the 2021 Haebyeol Gallery Public Auction.

502
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,630
All proceeds will be donated to domestic orphanages.

503
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,580
We request all of your interest.

504
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,980
This is the first piece.

505
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,100
It is an early, previously unseen, work by the late Kim Myeong Seong.

506
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,620
We will start the auction.

507
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,550
- Thirty million won  (≈$25,000) . 
 - Thirty million.

508
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,330
- Thirty-five million won  (≈$30,000) . 
 - Thirty-five million.

509
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,210
Yes, speak.

510
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,460
- Two hundred million won  (≈$170,000) .  
 - Yes, two hundred million.

511
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,960
The current bid is two hundred million.

512
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,310
- Two hundred million? 
 - Yes, the mood for this piece is very hot.

513
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,910
Is there perhaps anyone else?

514
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,040
You must bid more than 200 million won to have a chance.

515
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,950
Is there any higher bid?

516
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,180
- If there isn't, we will close here. 
 - J-J-Just a moment.

517
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,640
Yes, tell us the amount comfortably.

518
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,510
T-Two hundred million—

519
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,750
and 30,000 won  (≈$25) .

520
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,290
- She said thirty thousand won. 
 - Two hundred millions and thirty thousand.

521
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,190
There is two hundred millions and thirty thousand won on the table.

522
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,620
It's been raised to a very circumspect 200 million and thirty thousand.

523
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,500
Yes?

524
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,870
- Three hundred million won  (≈$255,000) . 
 - Yes, three hundred million.

525
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,630
Th-Three hundred million?

526
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,020
There's an enormous amount on the table.

527
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,780
It's currently three hundred million.

528
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,770
- Is there any higher? 
 - How can she look exactly the same as me?

529
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,900
If there isn't, I'll repeat it three times and close.

530
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,010
Three hundred million. 300 million. 300 million!

531
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,570
VIP Guest 1 has successfully won the bid. Congratulations.

532
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Then let us meet the next piece. The next is a work by artist Kim Jung Gi.

533
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,270
He is known for his use of color and his expressiveness.

534
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,170
Hey, Bong Sik.

535
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,510
You're Bong Sik, aren't you?

536
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,500
Hey, stop right there.

537
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,300
Hey! Stop there!

538
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,830
Man.

539
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,500
Hey! Stop right there!

540
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,310
Get out of my way!

541
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,760
Stop there!

542
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,650
Lee Bong Sik! Stop!

543
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,780
Hey, won't you stop there!

544
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,790
Hey! Lee Bong Sik!

545
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,260
Hey!

546
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,470
Where did he go?

547
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,350
Hyeong-nim,  I'll go that way first.

548
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,520
I thought you wouldn't be able to come due to your family event.

549
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,610
I'm so grateful you could come like this, Madam.

550
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,970
It's nothing.

551
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,670
It's an event that Hanju sponsored.

552
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,730
How shall I take care of the auction payment?

553
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,990
I want to see the painting first.

554
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,410
Of course. I made a mistake.

555
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,500
We will bring it right away.

556
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,830
There's another painting that our household requested. I'll take them together.

557
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,080
Yes, wait one moment, please.

558
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,160
Yes. I'm ready.

559
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,510
Me and the painting too.

560
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,730
You're coming in soon, right?

561
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,730
The information was correct.

562
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,900
   

563
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,220
 But how can she look so exactly like me? 

564
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,420
The stranger thing is that

565
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,690
she has such a luxurious vibe.

566
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,850
Can the same face as this

567
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,220
have such a different feeling?

568
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,900
Nothing seems to be missing. 
    

569
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,190
How many hours did you say it's been since she's out of contact?

570
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,960
It seems like more than five hours.

571
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,140
This is Director Kim of Seonbuk-dong.

572
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,100
Have you confirmed on the hotel side? 
    

573
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,820
They're checking through their CCTV right now. 
    

574
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,790
Her phone was turned off at the hotel.

575
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,790
To commemorate the memory of the Hanju Group founder Han Hyeong Mo, 
    

576
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,580
we are examining whether we are living the life of sharing and giving, which was emphasized by him,

577
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:35,510
so that we can again nourish our spirits and souls.

578
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,640
Today's Scripture was written when David's life

579
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,200
was falling down around him.

580
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,500
As we live our lives, there may be times we feel that everything is falling around us.

581
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,220
What's fallen?

582
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,060
Excuse me?

583
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,730
When our souls fall before money, or fall before sin—

584
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,180
What kind of nonsense is that?

585
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,260
 Yumin Group partnered with a world-class hotel chain to open  

586
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,550
 the nation's first six-star hotel on Jeju Island, the Yumin Hotel. 

587
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,780
 The private plane that departed for the Jeju Hotel's grand opening event 

588
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,690
 fell into the ocean around 4 p.m. today. 

589
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,520
 We have learned that in this accident, 

590
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,710
  Yumin Group's Chairman Kang Jang Su and his entire family are presumed to have perished, 

591
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:33,230
 which is creating quite a shock.  
 - That's Sister-in-law's household.

592
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,650
 Although the rescue operation is still on-going, 

593
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,990
 we have yet to hear of any survivors. 

594
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,110
 The Coast Guard is focused on finding survivors that were on the plane, 

595
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,280
 but they are also searching for debris from the crash and the black box, 

596
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,350
 so they can investigate the cause of the crash. 

597
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:21,370
 We will continue to update you as we hear news on the Yumin Group's accident. 

598
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,930
Where is she?

599
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:31,510
   

600
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,340
Currently, only the chairman's body has been found so we've hurried to prepare him first.

601
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,420
Well, what can we do? It's not like we can wait 
    

602
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,520
until we find them all.

603
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,000
What's happened?

604
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,840
Oppa! Oppa!

605
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,260
Oppa!

606
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,760
Oppa!

607
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,260
Oppa!

608
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,020
Oppa! Oppa!

609
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,150
Oppa! Oppa!

610
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,680
Madam! Madam! Madam!

611
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,470
Hurry, hurry.

612
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,850
Hurry up and call a doctor.

613
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,310
Madam. Madam.

614
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,060
Madam, are you all right?

615
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,490
Madam.

616
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,770
Find out what hospital she went to.

617
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,380
Yes.

618
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,810
Yes, this is Director Kim.

619
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,650
I checked the CCTV from the hotel.

620
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:00,190
The whole family passed away together, leaving that large fortune,

621
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,590
so I guess they won't be lonely on their path.

622
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,670
Then what's the order of succession when it comes to that large fortune?

623
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,920
There are no survivors or direct descendants.

624
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,550
Then it's the brothers and sisters.

625
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,330
Oh, Oppa. If I think like this, I'll be punished.

626
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,110
I'll be punished when my dead brother and nieces and nephews ...

627
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,730
   

628
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,390
Mi Na!

629
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,810
You were alive.

630
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,120
Do you know her?

631
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,670
Yes. It's my niece.

632
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,720
She's alive.

633
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,070
She's alive.

634
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,170
She was alive!

635
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,830
She was alive.

636
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,790
She was alive.

637
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,730
We're here from Hanju.

638
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,610
Hurry up and escort her.

639
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,310
   

640
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,860
   

641
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,460
 Further news on the Yumin Group's plane crash from the 2nd. 

642
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,690
 It is reported that all bodies of the passengers have been found. 

643
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,500
 However, it appears that the youngest daughter of Yumin Group, Kang Mi Na, 

644
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,800
 was not a passenger on the plane. 

645
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,600
 The police have stated that since no missing-persons report has been filed, 

646
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,170
 they cannot conduct a search nor look up call records for her. 

647
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:23,090
 On the subject of Ms. Kang, who is also well-known as the second daughter-in-law of Chairman Han Yeong Sik of Hanju Group, 

648
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,370
 no statement has been made by Hanju Group ... 

649
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:28,290
 The service is awful here! 

650
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:33,090
Construction is a good place to put a slush fund.

651
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:39,320
Hotels are the kind of business where it's easy to go into deficit unless the internal affiliates provide help.

652
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,300
Yumin Construction is stable and strong.

653
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,140
And it has a lot of internal affiliates.

654
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,400
The only bloodline left in that household

655
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,940
is an object of our household.

656
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,260
The heavenly blessing took too long.

657
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,190
Let's take care of the Yumin funeral.

658
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,110
I understand.

659
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:06,160
And watch out for how Yumin is calculating things.

660
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,310
Others fill your position with people from the Central District Prosecutors' Office

661
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,900
or with former judges.

662
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,810
You should show me the reason I put you in your position.

663
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,120
I will keep it in mind.

664
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,540
Showing off, are you?

665
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:33,230
As if everyone doesn't know that all the Central District Prosecutors turned down the offer.

666
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,260
Hey, lady, why are you giving me such a hard time when everyone else does it for me?

667
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:45,150
The seats and even special seats available for mileage upgrade are already booked.

668
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,490
Hey! I know, but

669
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,890
my body is like this. How can I sit in a regular seat?

670
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,990
There are the ones you always save.

671
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,460
Then will you be all right with paying the additional cost?

672
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,210
She is really not understanding.

673
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,860
Shall go through it again?

674
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,580
My wife's cousin's sister-in-law's brother-in-law is Songseong Group's chairman.

675
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,800
You know Songseong Group, right?

676
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,960
The in-law family of this Hanguk Airlines.

677
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,250
If you don't pay the additional cost, then the business seat upgrade will be difficult.

678
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,630
I'm getting mad, seriously.

679
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,230
You're just watching a counter at the airport. What do you take me for?

680
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,810
Why are you acting like that? Are you in a bad mood?

681
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,970
I'm sorry, Customer.

682
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,090
You don't have any manners.

683
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,360
Do you want to die?

684
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,720
What? What's going on?!

685
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,250
I'm an acquaintance of Hanguk Airlines.

686
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:42,100
According to your logic, don't we know everyone by six degrees of separation?

687
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,750
What is this? Hey.

688
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,110
Won't you let go? Don't you know who I am?

689
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,000
Should I call a prosecutor I know?

690
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,210
I want to get you the business seat you seem to really need.

691
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,420
What kind of bullshit is this?

692
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,830
I think you could get the seat if you become an emergency patient right before boarding.

693
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:02,900
What do you think? Should I make this arm the same—

694
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,330
Let go and talk. It hurts.

695
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,680
I was wrong.

696
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,780
Ajeossi*! 
  (familiar address for a middle-aged man) 

697
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,850
The head of the great Hanju Group's legal department should be busy. How did you come to meet me?

698
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:27,740
Your return ceremony is quite remarkable.

699
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:33,430
You should have called the airport police. Why do you involve yourself personally in other people's affairs?

700
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,470
I don't want to hold back anymore. I'm going to involve myself.

701
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,950
You seem to have changed from before.

702
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,700
I should change.

703
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,360
I restrained myself too much.

704
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,450
That man back there

705
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:49,220
seemed to be talking about contacting a prosecutor or whatnot.

706
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,190
It won't create a bothersome issue, will it?

707
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,460
We all know what level that kind of prosecutor would be at.

708
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,230
I'd rather see that prosecutor's face once.

709
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,720
What is this?

710
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,280
Why did you go there alone and get hit by a car?

711
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,590
Do you feel good in making us the idiots who didn't know

712
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,930
the whereabouts of our daughter-in-law?

713
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,540
Look at that glare.

714
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,810
How dare you glare at me like that?

715
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,620
What is this ajumma* about? 
  (familiar address for middle-aged women) 

716
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,070
Hey! Are you crazy? Have you gone mad?

717
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,200
Won't you let go of this?

718
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,100
I know, right? Have I gone crazy?

719
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,090
Why am I like this?

720
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:30,540
Who am I?

721
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,230
   

722
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,600
 God, Buddha,  

723
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,900
 Allah, Gods of the Universe, anyone, please save me. 

724
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,740
 If you only save me, I won't do bad things anymore 

725
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,040
 and I'll live diligently. 

726
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,930
 What's with this good-looking priest? 

727
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,790
 Why is the music so heart-warming? 

728
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,880
 Welcome, Sister.  

729
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,250
 I welcome you having come to the road to Heaven.  

730
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,800
 Did I die? Am I dead? 

731
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,240
 You died. You came here because you died. 

732
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,780
 Wait a moment. 

733
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,930
 I died so terribly because I took a little back-door money, cursed people, and hit some people? 

734
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,510
 Death is terrible to begin with. 

735
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,100
 I don't know why you died, but this is all God's will, so let's go. 

736
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,860
 - Come. Follow— 
 - No! 

737
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,840
 I can't die like this. 

738
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,340
 I think something has gone wrong here. 

739
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,320
 You look so familiar. 

740
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,310
 Michael. 

741
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,800
  There has never been a taste like this before. 

742
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,190
 Is this kalbi* or rotisserie chicken? 
 (Korean BBQ shortribs) 

743
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,480
 The person who ordered chicken? 

744
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,960
 You came here again? I told you no one ordered chicken. How could you come here when it's the road to Heaven?  

745
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,830
 Why are you like this every time I come? 

746
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:14,010
 - Because no one ordered. 
 - Just a moment. 

747
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,740
 Are you perhaps the Grim Reaper? 

748
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,010
 What nonsense are you talking about? 

749
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,690
 This is the road to Heaven and I'm a priest. How can the Grim Reaper come here? 

750
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,910
 Yes, I'm only the delivery department. Just a moment. 

751
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,680
 Is this correct? "ID: The Fiery Priest. Plenty of chicken radish." 

752
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,220
 It's always correct. Why are you acting like this? 

753
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,900
 It's correct that I'm the Fiery Priest. 

754
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,530
 I know, so why do you act like this each time I come? Give me the money for the chicken. 

755
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:37,480
 Just a moment! I really have something important to do, so I have to go.  

756
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,980
 Where are you going, when this is the road to Heaven? 

757
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,790
 Wait, just a moment. 

758
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:46,520
 Have we seen each other somewhere? 

759
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:53,140
 What is it? What's with the atmosphere? 

760
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,030
 This is the road to Heaven. 

761
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,640
 How strange. Hey, now! 

762
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,520
 What are you doing in this holy place? 

763
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,010
 So how can you act like this each time? 

764
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,140
 Because I've never ordered it before. 

765
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,600
 And why are there so many steps? Is this the Stairway to Heaven? 

766
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,340
 Just a moment! 

767
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,680
 I really have to go right now! 

768
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,070
 I told you this is the road to Heaven. 

769
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,710
 Seriously, you shouldn't touch the nose. 

770
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,150
 Is that why your nose is missing? 

771
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,570
 Wh-Wh-Where? 

772
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,170
 My nose. My nose. 

773
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,030
 My nose. 

774
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,060
 That woman must have taken it. 

775
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,580
 Wait here. I'll go and get it. 

776
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,810
 The money for the chicken! 

777
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:47,540


778
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,460
 I almost died. 

779
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,130
   

780
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,040
 I think she has retrograde amnesia. 
   

781
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,520
 I'm the Hanju Group daughter-in-law. 

782
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,890
 Yo! 

783
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,340
 - Are you all right?
- He's handsome. 

784
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,070
 How can the Hanju daughter-in-law have nothing but housework to do? 

785
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,520
 Are we living in the 19th century or what? 

786
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,440
 - Hey!  
  - You're the best! 

787
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,740
 As if I was tying Mother-in-law's arms behind her. 

788
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,760
 There no equal for her crudeness.  

789
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,730
 Hey, Ajumma. 

790
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,620
 That woman, do you think she's lost her identity and not just her memory? 

791
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,730
 Her memories are gone but the emotions will be left. 

792
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:26,060
 It's not as if you have lingering feelings left, do you? 

793
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,470
 Do you not know me?
