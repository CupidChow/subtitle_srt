1
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,800


2
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,460
What's going on here?

3
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,580
Why the hell did you go there alone and get hit by a car?

4
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,130
Do you feel good in making us look like idiots who didn't know the whereabouts of our daughter-in-law?

5
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,220
Look at that glare. How dare you glare at me like that?

6
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,580
What is this ajumma about?

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,240
Hey! Are you crazy! Let go of me!

8
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,260
Why did I...? Am I really crazy?

9
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,970
Why did I do that?

10
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,230
Who... Who am I?

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,530
   

12
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,080
Rabbit. Dog.

13
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,370
Cat. Pig. Chicken.

14
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,250
It's regrettable, but I think she has retrograde amnesia due to the large impact to her head.

15
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,180
You're causing all sorts of trouble.

16
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,260
All other functions are normal and, since there is no great difficulty in communicating or in the activities of daily life,

17
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,030
and only the memories before a certain point have disappeared due to the shock,

18
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,640
this can remain as a simple, psychologically mild case

19
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,740
or, as it happens sometimes, some other impact can make the memories return.

20
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,260
You're basically saying that you don't know either.

21
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,870
I'm sorry. Her memories are gone but the emotions will be left.

22
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,490
Spending time with people she was close to will help with her psychological stabilityâ€”

23
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,840
"Psychological stability," as if?

24
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,530
This was done to me by my daughter-in-law. Who is the one who seems to need psychological stability?

25
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,660
Get out!

26
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,730
Are you all right?

27
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,050
I pointlessly bent her arm.

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,290
Even if she were to be hurt, why did it have to be her head?

29
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,620
As Chairman Kang was still active, the succession proceedings hadn't even been initiated.

30
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,030
If nothing special happens, Seong Wun's wife will probably automatically inherit, right?

31
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,340
That's true for the stocks. Of course, for business management, she must receive approval from the stockholders.

32
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,880
The largest shareholder holding more than 30% of shares for Yumin

33
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,930
are two investors from the American Prix Fund.

34
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,580
They probably won't come in themselves.

35
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,680
It'll probably come down to the division among the remaining shareholders' opinions.

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,450
I think I'll be able to control most of them.

37
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,790
If, before that, the rumor gets out about Seong Wun's wife not being normal,

38
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,620
those shareholders won't so easily agree to give her management rights.

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,180
If her family members get greedy now, it could ruin our chance of getting the shares.

40
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,490
Don't worry. I'm not going to allow Sister-in-law to leave the house for the next little while, so rumors won't get out.

41
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,000
Except for Director Kim, I'll change all of the housemaids

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,450
to foreigners who don't understand Korean well.

43
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,760
There will be witnesses at the hospital too.

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,550
Only the director of the hospital has seen the test results,

45
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,260
and the rest of the witnesses have been checked.

46
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,660
So, I don't remember who I am right now.

47
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,980
I am the daughter-in-law of Hanju Group.

48
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,390
   

49
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,520
   

50
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,170
   

51
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,350
   

52
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,890
   

53
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,220
But wait, it was all mine anyway.

54
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,680
Why do I feel like I just won the lottery?

55
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,650
I feel even worse for hurting my mother-in-law earlier. Did she leave?

56
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,040
You scared me!

57
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,560
- Wow... 
 - Wh-What's wrong with you?

58
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,900
It's because you're so ... good-looking.

59
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,250
Are you all right, Honey?

60
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,640
Honey? Then are you ...?

61
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,140
They said you had amnesia.

62
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm your husband.

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,120
Wow ...

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,420
 Awesome. 

65
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,060
What are you doing, Honey?

66
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,850
What do you mean?

67
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,210
We have to go out for now,

68
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,760
so change into this. I heard your clothes got ruined, so Director Kim picked this out.

69
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,360
And this is a new cellphone.

70
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,760
Wow, awesome. What's this? It's the latest model. It's nice.

71
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,130
Settle down. I have something to tell you.

72
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,480
What more is there?

73
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,190
No one else outside of our family can know that you lost your memory.

74
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,410
You're not allowed to speak to people you don't know for the next little while.

75
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,720
You're not allowed to go outside by yourself.

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,550
Why do I have to do that?

77
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,260
   

78
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,190
 Why don't I feel anything? Is it because I don't remember anything? 

79
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,640
Someone really has good luck.

80
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,090
 Even my brother-in-law's wife is crying so sorrowfully. 

81
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,670
Oh my!

82
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,020
Your youngest aunt's daughter, your younger cousin Byeon Su Gyeong, the director of Yumin Group Life Sciences.

83
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,430
Su Gyeong.

84
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,820
- What's wrong with you, Eonni? 
 - What?

85
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,740
If you're my aunt's daughter, then you're a close relative. Thank you so much for coming.

86
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,990
Right. Right. Let's forget the past now.

87
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,990
Of course. I forgot about all of it.

88
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,030
Let's get a meal together sometime, yes? Thank you so much.

89
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,660
The shock must have been really big for you.

90
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm the grateful one.

91
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,590
- The most senior member of your family. 
 - Grandma.

92
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,120
- Aunt. 
 - Aunt Grandma.

93
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,170
- No, just Aunt. 
 - Aunt.

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,290
You look more and more like Grandma.

95
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,130
When have you ever seen your grandma?

96
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,790
In-law Han, she must have had a large shock.

97
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,240
Or did she just go crazy?

98
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,060
Sister-in-law, it may be difficult to meet and respond to guests after having your accident so recently.

99
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,210
I think it would be good if you take a break.

100
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,390
- I feel completely fine. 
 - No, you should take a break.

101
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,490
Even if you seem fine now, you can just suddenly faint.

102
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,250
You saw the VIP room outside earlier, right?

103
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,850
Then ... should I take a break?

104
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,030
That would be better. I'm more tired. I am.

105
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,280
That woman didn't only lose her memories, did she also lose her sense of identity?

106
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,170
Why does she keep going overboard?

107
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,240
Have you met with people who may help with our work?

108
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,560
Yes. There's someone I think will be all right, so I contacted her.

109
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,250
Is it someone we can handle?

110
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,860
- Do you also play janggi*? 
 - Janggi? 
  (Korean strategy board game like chess) 

111
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,850
I played it a lot with your father.

112
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
That's the way janggi is.

113
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,130
There are times when you can't win when you try to grab the general with a general.

114
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,780
You have to catch the chariot with your horse, and use the guards to catch the cannons.

115
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,610
And finally you use the soldiers to catch the general.

116
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,380
You're making an excuse because you could only find a soldier, are you?

117
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,490
Don't worry.

118
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,720
When you are around evil people for so long, it's easy to identify who the good people are.

119
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,760
The person is trustworthy.

120
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,960
However ... I understand Ms. Kang Mi Na has gone through a very sad event,

121
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,890
but do you have to go there?

122
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,070
There's no way you still have feelings for her, right?

123
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,660
You were just engaged to marry her once.

124
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,610
We were connected before that too.

125
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,340
 As soon as it was confirmed that my father, the successor of Hanju Group, was dead, 

126
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,810
   

127
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,010
 you were the only person who stayed. 

128
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,230
 All everyone talked about was ... 

129
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,900
 that my younger uncle would be the successor and take over the company. 

130
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,080
 That was when I first met her. 

131
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,460
 Just by chance, before we were arranged to be married. 

132
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,700
 I only found out later that she was in the hospital because of something unfortunate. 

133
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,930
Well, since the arranged marriage was later changed to be with Seong Wun,

134
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,330
you can't really say that we were engaged to be married.

135
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,240
Wasn't that going too far, though?

136
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,050
How could they do that to people who were already dating?

137
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,540
After my father died, I was pushed out of the line of succession.

138
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,660
So the Yumin side would rather have Seong Wun as a son-in-law, rather than me.

139
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,480
Anyway, this is just a humanitarian visit. I have to see her sometime anyway.

140
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,510
A humanitarian visit, my foot.  She was your first love.

141
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,320
- What? 
 - I have common sense too.

142
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,670
This is why first loves are a problem for men.

143
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,990
You don't still have feelings for her ... what bullshit!

144
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,190
Don't even talk to her, just pay your respects and leave right away.

145
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,840
Did you see? Yumin's daughter didn't even shed a single tear.

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,080
- It's probably because she's a mistress' daughter. 
 - Even still.

147
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,540
Yes, Mom. Kang Mi Na.

148
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,860
She was out of her mind and asked me to go to lunch with her.

149
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,460
I don't know. Maybe she's high.

150
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,370
Even after we humiliated her ... Anyway, I'll call you later.

151
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,700
   

152
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,630
   

153
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,980
   

154
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,440
Seriously?

155
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,820
So ... there were all sorts of rumors of me being an illegitimate child,

156
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,000
yet my in-laws were good to me acting as if they didn't know?

157
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,110
There's a weird scandal on the internet.

158
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,770
It can't be weirder than the scandal about you on the plane.

159
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,160
It's weirder than that.

160
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,820
It's a new rumor about her being an illegitimate child

161
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,780
and her in-laws being kind to her.

162
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,280
Was that you again, Nuna*? 
  ("older sister," said by a man) 

163
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,450
Do you think that would stay hidden,

164
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,340
when nowadays you can just do a few searches and find anything online? It's better to leak it.

165
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,820
I guess this is what you did with my past rumors.

166
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,420
Do you know where you need to hide the dead body after killing someone?

167
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,620
On the battlefield. You should be grateful too.

168
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,550
All those other scandals buried your real scandal. Isn't that a win-win situation?

169
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,790
But still, sometimes the scandals about me are over the top,

170
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,070
so get my approval on the ones regarding me.

171
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,010
This guy is asking to ask him for approval? What a joke.

172
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,460
Don't ruin what I've already set up and behave yourself.

173
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,990
Go and see what my sister-in-law's doing.

174
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,590
So to sum up, they hated me and mistreated me my whole life,

175
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,730
and now I'm a chaebol heiress about to inherit a huge fortune.

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,620
How lonely. I was a chaebol family daughter in name only, who spent her whole life being bullied.

177
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,330
I was hit by a car going full speed, flew into the air, and landed on my head first,

178
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,930
but no one's asked me if I'm all right.

179
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,110
Why am I so hungry in the middle of all this?

180
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,610
Why is he staring at me like that? Has he never seen someone eating peanuts before?

181
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,460
 I have an allergy to peanuts. I can't eat even one peanut. 

182
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,700
 Sometimes I break out in hives from just the smell. 

183
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,900
Get it together! How can you eat this?

184
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,670
You must be crazy. What's wrong with you?

185
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,480
No matter how shocked you are, you still shouldn't eat this.

186
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,720
Why are you taking them? What am I supposed to do?

187
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Give it to me!

188
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,370
That was rude of me. I was just thinking of the past.

189
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,080
 Is he someone I know? 

190
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,960
 Aish ... This is so embarrassing. Who is he? 

191
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh ...

192
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,070
I guess I must have changed a lot.

193
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,760
 I didn't expect him to talk to himself. Who the hell is he? 

194
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,650
 I need to carry on the conversation for now. 

195
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,420
How long has it ...

196
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,890
 What do I do? Do I drop the honorifics or not? 

197
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,690
- been?  (She maintains the honorific style)  
 - Has it been over ten years?

198
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,100
 He's talking to himself again. That also didn't work. 

199
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,170
 What do I do here? 

200
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,230
Hyeong*.
  ("elder brother", said by a male) 

201
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,850
 Hyeong? 

202
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,460
How have you been?

203
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,550
I've been doing well, not caring about what's going on over here.

204
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,570
Have you returned to  Korea?

205
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,450
No, I came back recently.

206
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,400
I have been keeping up with the articles about you, Nuna. You were impressive lately.

207
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Impressive? They pick apart everything I say because I'm a woman. It's not easy.

208
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,690
But you got to where you are on your own. No one handed it to you.

209
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,390
Keep doing your best ... As long as you can.

210
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,760
Thanks. Eat before you go.

211
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,210
But ...

212
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,750
are you all right?

213
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes, I'm fine.

214
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,730
What's wrong?

215
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,280
He's the first person to ask if I am all right.

216
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,550
This guy ...

217
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,590
Who is that? Wow, he's really good-looking.

218
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,390
He's my older cousin. When my eldest uncle died, Grandpa passed on the company to my dad.

219
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,250
- He was pushed out and went to the USA. 
 - Oh ...

220
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:56,430
No wonder. Even though he is good-looking, he has a gloomy energy around him.

221
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,960
But why did he come here without any hesitation?

222
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,780
Now that Sister-in-law might be better off than our family,

223
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,100
is he trying to see if he can get something out of it?

224
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,490
Oh my! Does he have a right, too?

225
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,290
If he is the eldest son of the eldest son, then he is in fact the rightful heir.

226
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,440
Is he married?

227
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,810
What's wrong? Did the mood suddenly

228
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,820
get awkward like a funeral, the moment you walked in?

229
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,710
Who cares, they were at a funeral anyway.

230
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,590
Something about Kang Mi Na

231
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,030
was a little strange.

232
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,250
When women run into their ex-boyfriends

233
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,160
they treat them like total strangers.

234
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't think it was that.

235
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,160
That's probably what you want to think.

236
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,020
Actually, the Group is keeping it quiet,

237
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,630
but Kang Mi Na was ...

238
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,820
in a car accident before the funeral.

239
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,150
"A car accident"?

240
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,520
I don't think it was a small car accident either.

241
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,870
She's probably not in her right mind. That could be why.

242
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,230
The company VIP team still takes care of the Hanju family member's treatment records, right?

243
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,540
- Yes, they still do. 
 - Could I see it?

244
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,830
You said you were going to the funeral as a humanitarian act, why do you even want to see that?

245
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,290
You know they could have put her in that position when she's not all right yet.

246
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,650
Why do you care if they did or not?

247
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,350
I can't give it to you right now, but I'll give it to you as soon as I can get it.

248
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,320
Welcome back, older Aunt, younger Uncle, and younger Aunt.

249
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,710
Mom.

250
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,040
Seon Ho. You have to greet your younger aunt too.

251
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,710
You said I didn't have to greet my younger aunt.

252
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,660
Why is he saying such weird things?

253
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,030
The funeral must have been hard on you.

254
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,510
Since now I am the only father you have in this world,

255
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,710
you have to treat me well.

256
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,700
Father, you should be saying that you are going to be good to her now. What's with this?

257
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,940
Well, is he wrong?

258
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,140
The shareholders only gave you the rights because they trusted us.

259
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,410
Who would trust a young woman like you?

260
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,870
- Hey, you need to treat us well. 
 - Mom.

261
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,720
Why do you keep interrupting me?

262
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,710
I'd have nothing to say to her if I had to watch everything I said.

263
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,560
Or you can just choose what you want to hear.

264
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:33,290
Since my mom's old-fashioned, even if I tell her she can't talk like that, she keeps doing it.

265
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,540
It's all right. The brain also ages when you get older, so she probably needs to get it all out.

266
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,570
No ... Well ... She's been saying things without thinking, ever since the accident.

267
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,610
Our family is used to that though, because of her.

268
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,290
We're going to turn in, we're tired.

269
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,920
Come on.

270
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,880
Has she gone crazy because her situation has changed now?

271
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,010
What did she say I am?

272
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,760
Hey. I'm not putting up with this. Will we die if she doesn't give us any money?

273
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,110
- Mom. 
 - You be quiet! Or I will tell the shareholders that she twisted my arm!

274
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,340
Goodness!

275
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,200
What's this about Seung Wuk being back?

276
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,590
I guess he must be back in Korea. He came to the funeral without saying a word beforehand.

277
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,820
If he keeps coming around, give him a restaurant chain or something.

278
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,660
We can do that much for him. Keep that in mind.

279
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,610
You know, since Sister-in-law forgot everything we did to her all this time, she's been reset,

280
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,600
and her dark energy must have disappeared.

281
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,410
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

282
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,040
I think it's a good thing.

283
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,230
- What? 
 - Now she seems like a human being.

284
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,340
Before, she used to let us trample all over her,

285
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,000
as if she had some hidden agenda. I didn't like her.

286
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,850
You saw that, right? She's worse than I am.

287
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,250
But I am the only one that gets told off.

288
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,530
They're psychos.

289
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,670
- Damn it! Can't I even talk in this house? 
 - Yes.

290
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,670
You can't. You can't talk back to my father, no matter what he says.

291
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,930
Wow. Why don't you just put a statue of him in the house?

292
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,470
So you can salute him and greet him every morning.

293
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,190
But, honey,

294
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,920
- why are you talking to me without honorifics? 
 - You aren't using honorifics either.

295
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,260
Forget it.

296
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,920
I have been waiting for you, Youngest Madam.

297
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,630
Turn around.

298
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,690
I'm Director Kim Gyeong Sin.

299
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,410
You can just casually call me Director Kim.

300
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,190
I've been in charge of the housekeeping in this house

301
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,460
since the previous Chairman was alive.

302
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,570
This is Trang. Come here.

303
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,180
She doesn't understand Korean and her job is to help you, the youngest madam.

304
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,190
The youngest madam?

305
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,550
The chairman's wife is called just "Madam."

306
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:50,240
The eldest son's wife is called the young madam. And then you are the youngest madam.

307
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,200
That's complicated.

308
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,720
Go ahead.

309
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,390
A weekly schedule? What is all of this?

310
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,730
This is the schedule you followed before.

311
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,800
How does a Hanju daughter-in-law

312
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,350
only do housework and not go to the hair salon, go shopping, get massages, or go golfing?

313
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:18,470
It was always your duty to do all the housework in this house.

314
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,420
You're saying I did all of this?

315
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,600
You had the help of others.

316
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,160
However ...

317
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,900
If we had people coming in and out of this house, the news about your amnesia might get out.

318
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,400
That's why everyone, except her and me, have been let go.

319
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:41,140
In other words, your injury is making my life difficult.

320
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,380
So, you have to take responsibility and help.

321
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,690
Otherwise how are the two of us going to take care of this huge house?

322
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,240
She can't even go grocery shopping, because she doesn't understand Korean.

323
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,050
If you have a conscience, you will help out.

324
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
I mean, there are other people who live here, why just me?

325
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,830
The Chairman's wife's arm was hurt by you.

326
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,760
The Chairman's eldest daughter is busy with work.

327
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,610
The young madam is too busy taking care of her son.

328
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,400
As for Han Seong Mi, I don't like her.

329
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,240
I have no time to spend money when I have to do all this housework.

330
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,140
Oh my, already?

331
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,610
What am I imagining?

332
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,410
What do you mean? It's a love scene.

333
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,780
I mean ... I barely know him, but is it all right

334
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,460
if we already share the same bed?

335
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,880
Of course, I can. He's my husband.

336
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,690
Also, I'm sure my body will remember.

337
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
Let's do this!

338
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,670
It looks like you finished washing up.

339
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,290
Oh, honey. I haven't washed up yet.

340
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,250
The wine is mine.

341
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,240
You don't drink.

342
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,050
What? I don't drink?

343
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,150
Why wouldn't I drink this, when it smells so good?

344
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,710
Your bedroom is out front.

345
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,150
Didn't Director Kim tell you?

346
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,820
My ... My room?

347
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,710
That's right. This is my room.

348
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,260
Yours is out front.

349
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,560
I guess I have to even tell you about this, since your memory is gone.

350
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,040
You don't have a sex drive.

351
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,700
Me?

352
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,380
Get out.

353
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,030
Why aren't you getting out?

354
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,520
How can that rude jerk talk to me like that? I almost lost all my confidence as a women.

355
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Of course, I don't have a sex drive, after being ordered to do all this housework.

356
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,900
What did I do for fun all this time?

357
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,940
This is my room?

358
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,260
Wow!

359
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,520
Wow, this is...

360
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,580
I can even play soccer in here!

361
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,440
Oh my.

362
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,300
Wow! This is a gym!

363
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,380
Wow. Seriously.

364
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,610
Wow.

365
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,010
Is this candy or what?

366
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,740
Look at these pajamas. How luxurious.

367
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,160
What's the point of having nice pajamas when you're sleeping alone?

368
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,780
   

369
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,640
I have so much clothing,

370
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,150
and I can only wear what I'm told to wear?

371
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,120
How was I living before?

372
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,350
I mean ... I can barely keep my eyes open.

373
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,640
How was I waking up at 4:00 a.m. every day? Does that make sense?

374
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Household chores start at 5:00 a.m.

375
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,990
You're already late. Come on.

376
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,270
Is this an agricultural commune?

377
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,360
How long is this family going to have such an old-fashioned mindset?

378
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,400
The chairman believes that the leader of a company

379
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,780
should be the first one to get to work,

380
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,290
so he leaves early. We must hurry.

381
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,690
That's nonsense.

382
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,990
Then who opens the door for him when he gets to work?

383
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,830
Then that means the security guard is the leader of the company.

384
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,610
What about the security guard?

385
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,240
You better watch what you sayâ€”

386
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,770
Director, for breakfast we should have a simple dumpling soup.

387
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,040
My goodness!

388
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,740
"A simple dumpling soup"?

389
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,010
"Simple"?

390
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,180
They are such a rich family!

391
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,760
And why do you have to make all these from early in the morning by hand?

392
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,310
Since you've forgotten everything, I'm telling you one thing at a time.

393
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,310
Madam can't eat dumplings from a store.

394
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,150
That's her problem. But she's not making them for herself.

395
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,410
Please don't put a lot of filling to finish it quickly, and care about the shape of the dumplings.

396
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,830
Wrap around both ends of the dumpling to the back nicely.

397
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes, as if I'm tying my mother-in-law's arms to her back.

398
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,120
If you press it roughly, it'll burst.

399
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
So fasten it tightly.

400
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,950
Yes. As if I'm pressing down my mother-in-law's throat.

401
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,930
Even fishes that'll be cut into sashimi soon are jumping and expressing themselves.

402
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,430
So why can't I hear anything from Yeon Ju at all?

403
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,870
Hyeong-nim, how can you compare our fishes being fresh

404
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,240
to Yeon Ju, who doesn't contact us until she feels like it?

405
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,570
Come on! You punk.

406
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,070
You missed Lee Bong Sik and Yeon Ju. And now you even let go of these fish?

407
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,470
This one is because the fish are too fresh!

408
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,020
Stay still!

409
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,870
Hyeong-nim, honestly, it's better not to catch Lee Bong Sik.

410
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,070
If we catch him and cannot contact Yeon Ju, it will be awkward to let him go.

411
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,430
What were you going to do anyway? The three of us sit around and play card games?

412
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,810
Still something's unusual.

413
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,170
When I call the prosecutor's office, they keep telling me that she's on vacation.

414
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,480
I wonder whether she's going to betray us.

415
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,080
We should've gotten a written promise beforehand.

416
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,970
"A written promise"?

417
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,680
   

418
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,400
 What do you think about this, uncles? 
   

419
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,270
 So you want us to be your errand boys? 

420
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,670
 How can you say it that way? 

421
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,740
 We're not some neighborhood punks! 

422
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,530
 We have our pride as gangsters! How can you ask us to be errand boys? 

423
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,380
 What? Pride as a gangster? 

424
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,300
 You guys are not gangsters anymore! 

425
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,280
 What do you think "gangsters" means? 

426
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,350
 It means a group of violent criminals. 

427
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,930
 So how can you consider yourself as a group when there's only two of you? 

428
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,110
 We're having a break right now, 

429
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,760
 but we can gather our kids in a secondâ€” 

430
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,830
 Wake up, will you? 

431
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,870
 The kids these days are all individualistic, 

432
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,100
 so they don't sacrifice themselves to be loyal to an organization. 

433
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,270
 Listen. Even if the prosecutor wins the court case, 

434
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,450
 it doesn't help the penniless victims. 

435
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,140
 So it might be better for them to get a lot of settlement money and not go to court. 

436
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,400
 However, it's too unfair for the offenders to get that benefit. 

437
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,910
 What are you doing? 

438
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,390
 Hurry up and put your hands on top here! 

439
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,480
 - Come on! 
 - Just do it quickly! 

440
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,720
 Hyeong, then you do it first. 

441
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,580
 Just do it! 

442
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,730
 Let's go! Let's go! 

443
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,420
 Let's go! 

444
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,280
Until now, while she was giving a cotton-ball-bat punishment,

445
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,340
we went out with a real bat and kicked all their asses.

446
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,980
We took care of Yeon Ju's back a lot!

447
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,330
But we didn't do that for free!

448
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,180
That's true.

449
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,980
But this time, we had to stake out and fight with them, so it was going to be a big deal!

450
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,720
I feel she caught Lee Bong Sik all by herself

451
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,490
and isn't going to pay us at all.

452
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:07,460
Remember? She's the one who abandoned her family roots to become a prosecutor!

453
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,340
My goodness!

454
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,850
These are the people who will make a fire out of the last apple tree on earth

455
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,130
to make a roast chicken when the world collapses tomorrow!

456
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,150
Why do they want to eat home-cooked food at every meal!

457
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,140
Trang. I'm saying this because you don't understand.

458
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,910
I really didn't have anywhere to talk about it, so I went online and wrote about my situation.

459
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,650
But then, people in the comments say they all live like this!

460
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,190
So I commented again that I'm a bit different, that I'm a daughter-in-law of a pretty wealthy family.

461
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,130
But then, a woman who graduated from the best university

462
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,960
and doctors and lawyers are all living like this!

463
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,320
That's how in-laws are.

464
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,080
I ran away because my mother-in-law was like that.

465
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,820
Trang, you know how to speak Korean?

466
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,270
Shh!

467
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,190
All the others were fired, but I barely was able to stay because I pretended not to understand Korean.

468
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,330
It's a secret.

469
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,170
All right. I'll be careful.

470
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,150
But it's good you lost your memory.

471
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,760
There's something like a preservative in in-law's words.

472
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,000
One can never forget them.

473
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,430
Is that so, Trang?

474
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,320
So stop talking and knead the bread.

475
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,740
I finished cutting everything.

476
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,770
All right.

477
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,910
How many times do we have to do the prayer services?

478
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,090
What timing she has.

479
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:45,990
But I think it's better, since more people will attend because of the incident.

480
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,940
Our Seon Wu will make his official appearance as the eldest grandson in front of everyone!

481
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,730
By the way, I overheard this when I went to the massage parlor.

482
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,990
That younger sister-in-lawâ€”

483
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,870
If you have anything to say, just say it in English. 
  (In English) 

484
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,260
There have been some rumors about her head injury. 
  (In English) 

485
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,000
Is that so? 
  (In English) 

486
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,890
I've been so careful to avoid rumors. 
  (In English) 

487
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,300
I've been shutting my mouth like a clam, at the hair salon lately. 
  (In English) 

488
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,450
Just a rumor is not enough. 
  (In English) 

489
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,860
We need to spread more, so she can be humiliated at the shareholders' meeting 
  (In English) 

490
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,130
and lose her company. 
  (In English) 

491
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,030
You two should talk about it more. 
  (In English) 

492
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,080
Shall we? Well, how can we stand her for being so arrogant?

493
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,820
Anyway, what time are we going to the hair salon? 
  (In English) 

494
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,890
Myeong Won* told me to wipe all the leaves in the living room today. 
  (Her mother-in-law's name, in English) 

495
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,760
So no one can go to the hair salon until it's over.
  (In English) 

496
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
You are going too? 
 (In English) 

497
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,240
Sister-in-law, I thought you studied in Korea!

498
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,070
I don't know if I studied in Korea or abroad.

499
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,540
But it looks like I can understand English.

500
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,300
Bon appÃ©tit.

501
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,450
What?

502
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:27,660
If we were a different household, we wouldn't keep such a broken daughter-in-law as you.

503
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,320
My Seong Wun is good-hearted.

504
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,170
I really don't know what's wrong with her. 
  (In Vietnamese) 

505
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,770
That's what I'm saying. 
  (In Vietnamese) 

506
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,520
What? You know how to speak Vietnamese? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

507
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,760
I guess so. How do I know Vietnamese? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

508
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,250
I can just understand it. It's just coming out too.
  (In Vietnamese) 

509
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,190
This is great, Trang. Try to keep talking.
  (In Vietnamese) 

510
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,100
I feel like I'm dying here. Did I really live like this before?
  (In Vietnamese) 

511
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,730
It was worse than this. You were monitored according to your schedule, 24 hours a day, 
  (In Vietnamese) 

512
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,780
Even your clothes. You only wore what was chosen for you. 
  (In Vietnamese) 

513
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,390
Right now, it's heaven. Everyone is being nice to you. 
  (In Vietnamese) 

514
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,560
What? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

515
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,420
Your mother-in-law stays home all day, right? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

516
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,450
Why do you think that is? You saw her temper, right? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

517
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,060
She can't be in social settings.
  (In Vietnamese) 

518
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,400
 Can't you keep your mouth shut! 

519
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,050
 Can you do that somewhere where I can't see it? 

520
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,680
 Your father-in-law tried to stop her.  
 (In Vietnamese) 

521
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,730
 Every time I see her, it feels like I dropped the axe on my own foot.  

522
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,940
 Don't take it too much to heart. It's something an elder can say. 

523
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,500
and your older sister-in-law is a spinster-loser.
  (In Vietnamese) 

524
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,240
 You're really something, Sister-in-law. 

525
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,640
 Your husband's brother's wife is just annoying.
 (In Vietnamese) 

526
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,230
 If I were you, I wouldn't have been able to live like that. 

527
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,210
 Mom's swing gets stronger by the day.  

528
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,500
 Your younger sister-in-law just says anything without thinking. 
(In Vietnamese) 

529
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,750
 Is it because she's learning tennis? 

530
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,010
So all these people are being nice to me now that I am 
  (In Vietnamese) 

531
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,730
inheriting all of my family's fortune? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

532
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:30,010
No wonder I wanted to break my mother-in-law's arm from the beginning.
  (In Vietnamese) 

533
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,010
I'm proud of my great instincts.
  (In Vietnamese) 

534
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,350
What's with those two? What are they talking about?

535
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,130
Hey, why are you making other people outcasts by leaving them out of the conversation?

536
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,970
So ill-mannered.

537
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,960
You hurt your head and Vietnamese is flowing out. Why is she acting like that?

538
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,090
   

539
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,590
 The customer's phone is turned off. You will be connected to voicemail at the sound of the beep. 

540
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,040
She's acting busy again.

541
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,520
She's not reading her KakaoTalk* either. 
  (Korean mobile messaging for smartphones) 

542
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,750
Nuna, I was investigating the Samgeori gang.

543
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,800
There are some Vietnamese kids among the organization members.

544
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,590
You know, the ones you had been digging into, those that Lee Bong Sik had smuggled in.

545
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,310
I think it's connected to their organization.

546
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,600
Call me back when you get this.

547
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,560
Mr. Dinh Quang Ryong, you were arrested at the site of mob violence.

548
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,490
You said you have never participated in any assault.

549
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,950
Mr. Dinh Quang Ryong.

550
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,200
Dinh Quang Ryong.

551
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,680
You were arrested at the scene of a gang assault, but you're saying you weren't a part of it? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

552
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,390
What? You speak Vietnamese? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

553
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,440
A prosecutor I was close to used to work here.  
  (In Vietnamese) 

554
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,230
She told me that if I want to properly interrogate I should learn it.
  (In Vietnamese) 

555
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,990
There are a lot of foreign workers in this neighborhood. 
  (In Vietnamese) 

556
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,200
So you learned Vietnamese? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

557
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,700
What are you surprised about? 
  (In Vietnamese) 

558
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,150
That seonbae even spoke French.
  (In Vietnamese) 

559
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:37,000
Because Vietnamese people would speak in French in front of her.
  (In Vietnamese) 

560
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,380
So because of the rumor that I have a head injury
   (In French) 

561
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,600
and the shareholders wanted to prevent me from running the company, 
   (In French) 

562
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,960
and hire a professional manager to do it instead?
   (In French) 

563
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,740
Why aren't you saying anything? 
   (In French) 

564
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,060
Yet, until just a moment ago, you were criticizing me in French as if you were locals. 
   (In French) 

565
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,190
   

566
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,150
Had I trusted in you?

567
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,860
First, I'm very thankful that I didn't have to cook dinner tonight.

568
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,560
Why did you give me the ability to speak four languages

569
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,530
and let me be able to understand the awful words of my in-law's?

570
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:40,910
Why did you give me the ability to speak four languages but also have such a hot temper?

571
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,080
If you truly exist, do I really have to suppress my temper?

572
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,930
Answer me.

573
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,690
My goodness. She even understands French.

574
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,280
Then, doesn't that mean she understood us all this time?

575
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,040
She cunningly stayed silent.

576
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,330
Since she hurt her head and lost it, she's forgotten that she pretended not to understand.

577
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,590
And now she's saying everything she wanted to say.

578
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:19,090
I won't be able to say anything because I'll have to watch out for her. My goodness.

579
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,060
How long do we need to walk on eggshells around Sister-in-law?

580
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,160
So why do you talk behind her back? What if she changes her mind?

581
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,850
You're aligning yourself properly, huh? With her, of all people!

582
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,870
Did I say you have to be nice to her?

583
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,810
Whether itâ€™s a curse or a blessing, they say she has amnesia.

584
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:42,790
Since she's forgotten how she was treated, you only need to treat her with common sense. Why are you allâ€”

585
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,520
Especially you.

586
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,400
Why can't you do it?

587
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,450
I was always secretly terrified of that woman.

588
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,430
I wish her memory never comes back.

589
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,940
What happens if, when her memory returns,  all that's left is her temper?

590
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,160
You foolish people.

591
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,230
What happened to all the people who said they'd declare her incompetent

592
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,490
and put her in a psychiatric hospital?

593
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,330
You can act like that but you can't act like this?

594
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,100
As it is, it's only until she receives the Yumin inheritance.

595
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,950
After that, what is there to be afraid of, when she's a child with no parents or siblings?

596
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,470
Would anyone care about what happens to her while she lives in our house?

597
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,040
You don't know

598
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,430
who I am?

599
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,790
When did you start eavesdropping?

600
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,960
Since, "My goodness. She even understood French."

601
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,210
You heard everything.

602
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,340
Well, it turned out that way.

603
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:55,720
But earlier, why did you ... do that to me?

604
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,020
Oh, that ... It was an urgent situation.

605
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,820
In that kind of situation, it's inevitable that contact is made.

606
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,670
Not that. Why did you help me hide?

607
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,890
You were hoping that I'd have to owe you one?

608
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,700
In the past, when I almost died because I was in agony, you saved me.

609
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,370
I did?

610
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,970
I guess you really can't remember.

611
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,690
It's a joke. It's my hobby to help people. I'm generous that way.

612
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,750
How can you say that was a joke right now?

613
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,520
- What? 
 - Do you know what it's like to lose your memory?

614
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,120
It's the feeling of floating alone on the open sea in the dark of night.

615
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,760
Not knowing who the person is in front of me, not knowing what happened between me and the people I live with,

616
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,510
not remembering anything, do you know how devastating and scaryâ€” ?

617
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:55,120
Those people hate me so much, who knows what they'll do to me from now on?

618
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,360
- That's not what I meantâ€” 
 - Forget it!

619
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,650
Could you understand how I feel living this kind of dramatic life?

620
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,140
She doesn't seem to know

621
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,410
that people who hate you don't have much power.

622
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,830
Who votes for someone they don't like? You vote for someone you like.

623
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,080
We are here again ...

624
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,790
for the memorial service for the late chairman,

625
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:26,860
which was unfortunately interrupted last time.

626
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,620
Today ...

627
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
We will read  the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 10,

628
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,500
from verse 34 to verse 42.

629
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,660
I will read aloud.

630
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,760
"Do not think that I have come..."

631
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,290
 Here is the medical record. 

632
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,480
"to bring peace to the earth."

633
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,700
"I come not with peace, but with sword."

634
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,400
"For I am come"

635
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,900
"to set a man at variance against his father,"

636
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,680
"and the daughter against her mother,"

637
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,670
 I wish her memory never comes back. 

638
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,080
 How long do we need to walk on eggshells around Sister-in-law? 

639
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,060
 I was always secretly terrified of that woman. 

640
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,690
 Did I say you have to be nice to her? 

641
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,890
 You only need to treat her with common sense. 

642
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,700
 She cunningly stayed silent. 

643
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,340
  Since she hurt her head and lost it ... 

644
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,530
  Would anyone care about what happens to her while she lives in our house? 

645
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,650
"and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

646
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:47,700
"And a man's foes shall be they of his own household."

647
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,220
 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. 
 (Matthew 10:36) 

648
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,040
  I finally got the answer today.  

649
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,190
 Hallelujah. 

650
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,730
Do you think I'm a joke? Why are you only throwing that at me? Why only at me?

651
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,200
Sister-in-law, the child was only messing aroundâ€”

652
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,600
So why is he only messing around with just me? Why just me?

653
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,960
Honey, he's only a kid, so try to understand and sit down! Damn it!

654
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,370
Let go of me!

655
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,270
Understand? Don't you just mean you want me to sit still and keep my mouth shut?

656
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,280
Won't you be quiet?

657
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,820
Is this a shouting match?

658
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,580
This is not a gambling house! Why are you shouting all of a sudden?

659
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,530
Aigoo, you surprised me!

660
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,630
You're so vulgar, just as expected!

661
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,040
Well, you're an illegitimate child.

662
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,990
Oh, God.

663
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,330
Wow. It's disgusting that someone still thinks like that in 2021.

664
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,860
Isn't it embarrassing to say that out loudly? Do you think we're still living in the Joseon era?

665
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,740
Why are you being like this over nothing? Can't you speak politely?

666
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,890
Politely? Okay, I'll speak politely.

667
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,140
You bastard, you're the worst thing. You are such a mama's boy, papa's boy.

668
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,560
Can you please shut your damn mouth? Is this how you want it? Happy now?

669
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,650
Who do you think you are?

670
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:17,660
What's this? Did you hit me in the past?

671
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,520
No.

672
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,490
- Sister-in-law. 
 - What?

673
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:29,420
You don't have to take it as an offense. What I said is something I could totally say as a subordinate.

674
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,440
- Eonni! 
 - Let go of me, Agassi*! 
 (husband's younger sister) 

675
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,080
- Wow. 
 - Sister-in-law.

676
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,410
You acting like this towards your husband's family is being disrespectful, like spitting on yourself, so stop it!

677
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,280
Exactly. I want to be disrespectful to myself, so why do you care?

678
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,300
I'm not disrespecting someone else!

679
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,380
Forget about it! Ptew!

680
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,950
Who do you think I am to disrespect me!

681
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,490
Who am I?

682
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,060
Who am I?

683
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,340
Are you sure these medical records are right? Could they be wrong?

684
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,500
  It's a medical record from the VIP team.  

685
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,110
 - Is there a problem?  
 - Is there really no record of her having scar removal surgery...

686
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,630
after she got married?

687
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,540
 If it's not there, then she didn't have one. 

688
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,340
 I never wear clothes that don't cover up my arms. 

689
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,890
 Why? 

690
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,850
 I got this scar when my mom was punishing me as a kid. 

691
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,020
 I'm only showing you. 

692
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,600
 If you ever lose me, this is how you can find me. 

693
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,430
 I have an allergy to peanuts, I can't even eat one. 

694
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:10,290
 Sometimes I break out in hives from just the smell. 

695
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,970
Let's go too.

696
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,080
Younger aunt, you're the best!

697
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,170
I'm going to take my mother and father home, so you find your own way home.

698
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,950
You cheap bastard.

699
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,660
I knew it when he wouldn't share the same bedroom.

700
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,730
All right, he doesn't want anything to do with me.

701
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,990
If you are human, this is how you have to live.

702
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:10,200
Money, fame, and a temper.

703
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,770
That's the best.

704
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,530
I'm sorry about today.

705
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,150
Do you have a particularly Confucian way of thinking?

706
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,970
Are you here to bicker with me like a kkondae*?
   (slang for "condescending older person") 

707
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,010
Sure! I lost my temper a bit.

708
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,930
But that can happen! You heard it all too, earlier.

709
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:47,750
- Also, when someone has experienced something shocking, emotions can become fierceâ€”  
 - You ...

710
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,610
Who are you?

711
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,220
What?

712
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,220
I asked, who are you?

713
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,310
What's your identity?

714
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,270
Where is the real Mi Na?

715
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:14,110


716
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,510
   

717
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,540
But ...

718
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:50,910
 Please. Please help her! Please help her! 
   

719
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,850
 Please, we've gone to many hospitals already. 

720
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,460
 Don't kick us out, please. 

721
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,510
 We don't have any beds available either. 

722
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,760
 Go and register first. 

723
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,540
 - What? 
 - Doctor, we don't have any beds, though. 

724
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,230
 There will be in a minute. 

725
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,200
 Grandma. 

726
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,700
  Are you swallowing drugs in the vacation house now, since I'm watching you at home?  

727
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:38,250
 Whenever you're admitted to the hospital, people start to gossip again about your blood type and whatnot.  

728
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,640
  Do you know how much inconvenience you cause?  

729
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,420
  Don't just die by a successful suicide attempt one day, after being useless like this.  

730
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,130
  Why don't you contribute to our family for once? 

731
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,220
â™«   It's glimmering   â™«

732
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,650
    
 â™«  The vision of you   â™«

733
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,140
â™«  Who holds the light of the setting sun  â™«

734
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,960
â™«  Every single day  â™«

735
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,020
    
 â™«  Your heart  â™«

736
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,550
â™«   That resembles longing  â™«

737
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,240
â™«  Reaches me,  â™«

738
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,260
â™«  It draws me to you  â™«

739
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:53,390
    
â™«  All the pain is healed now  â™«

740
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,280
â™«  I will hold you   â™«

741
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,550
    
 â™«  In my embrace  â™«

742
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:06,960
â™«  Like the warm breeze  â™«

743
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,260
â™«  I will run to you,   â™«

744
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,700
â™«  Like the sunlight   â™«

745
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,670
 Are you all right? 

746
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,790
â™«  Seeping through  â™«

747
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,090
â™«  I will hold you in my embrace  â™«

748
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,540
   
   

749
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,710
 Father-in-law! 

750
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,820
  - Why don't you have some deodeok before you leave? 
 - You better beat the deodeok more!  

751
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,990
  You two are having an affair, and I knew about it?  

752
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,910
  I thought I was just good at driving, but I also had a strong stomach.  

753
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,520
  - What are you going to do now? 
 - I need to find out whom this car was trying to hit.  

754
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,510
  - We'll see when I get the inheritance. 
 - Can you inherit it?  

755
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,630
  Did you hear that it was urgently decided to hold the shareholders meeting today?  

756
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,100
  What is it? Am I really screwed?  

757
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,420
  Don't you dare to think you can divide Hanju.  

758
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,550
  Something's slightly off.
