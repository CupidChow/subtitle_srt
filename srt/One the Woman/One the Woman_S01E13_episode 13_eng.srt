1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,520
It seems that the test revealed something very serious, which we cannot overlook. 
    

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,070
So we'll hear the Chairwoman explain herself in public and ask her to be accountable.

3
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,790
Later you might say that we switched results and whatnot. To prevent any of those suspicions,

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,930
I'll open the envelope right here.

5
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:05,650


6
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,980
   

7
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,820
You're all busy people, so I'll just read the crucial information.

8
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,660
"The genes of client Kang Jang Su and client Kang Mi Na,"

9
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,470
"were tested in 15 different items, and as a result,"

10
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,920
"there are 14 of the items showing that they share the same genes."

11
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,910
Give me a moment, please.

12
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,150
What are you doing? Hurry up and read on.
 - Yes, yes, yes ...

13
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,610
"Various genes display appropriate links, and they're biologically related"

14
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,800
"with 99.9999% certainty."

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,260
   

16
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,530
   

17
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,030
 I'm biologically related to Chairman Kang Jang Su? 

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,690
What do you mean? Why?

19
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,020
Why are you holding me accountable and asking for an explanation?

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,690
I suffered my whole life because of these kinds of rumors. How mean of you all.

21
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,450
No ... It's ... I ...

22
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,320
Without written consent, sample collection is a violation of privacy laws.

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,540
I also express deep disappointment in the Hanju Group who used my DNA sample, without my consent.

24
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,760
However, it's time for me to calm down,

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,470
because I have to present a very important agenda item as well.

26
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,880
I, Kang Mi Na, will now resign from the Yumin Group's position of Chairwoman.

27
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,610
There were many difficulties fulfilling a chairwoman’s duties without sufficient study.

28
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,630
I also believe that my lack of capability is why my name is constantly part of these rumors.

29
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,850
From now on, I'll entrust the group's management to a professional business manager,

30
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,000
and from this moment, all my stock holdings and authority

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,450
will be given to the Yumin Group's holding company's main shareholder,

32
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,660
Han Seong Wuk.

33
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,980
 I think it's about time for you to leave that house. 

34
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,820
 Are you suggesting that I quit acting as Kang Mi Na? 

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,120
 Don't you think seeing them will make it difficult? 

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,510
 If I knew this was going to happen, I should've snatched a bag at least. 

37
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,320
 What about the company? 

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,580
 She needs to quit that as well. 

39
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,870
 Anyway, the chairwoman position didn't fit Kang Mi Na either. 

40
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,650
 You can announce it at the general shareholders' meeting. 

41
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,260
To every shareholder who trusted in me,

42
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,450
I sincerely thank you.

43
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,800
   

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,720
I mean what in the world was that all about?

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,320
Why do I have a paternity match with Chairman Kang Jang Su?

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,610
I think someone has played their hand in advance.

47
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,830
Who's hand— ... Who's hand was it?

48
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,500
That sample, it must have been from Chairman Han's house.

49
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,990
Maybe they accidentally gave the real Kang Mi Na's sample also.

50
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,370
Would the world eagerly take my side like that?

51
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,630
If that's not it, how can the results say you're biologically related?

52
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,990
I know, right? Do you think they had some ulterior motive and made up the whole thing?

53
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,670
I don't think so, they looked way too shocked for that to be true.

54
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,120
Director Kang.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,520
I think that was quite strange.

56
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,560
- Anyway, for the group's stock, it's bett— 
 - Managing Director Han.

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,740
- Yes? 
 - By any chance, have you thought of me as your rival this whole time?

58
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,570
You made up this whole thing to get rid of me, didn't you?

59
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,930
- No, that's not true. 
 - Lies. I know I was played.

60
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,700
This whole thing was for me, Kang Eun Hwa,

61
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,250
in order to attack me in public.

62
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,030
If that was your plan, you succeeded.

63
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,550
The reporter you invited has already uploaded the news, so it's now going viral.

64
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,840
Look how bad I appear to the Yumin Group. You!

65
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,900
Were you so afraid of me? Were you?

66
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,160
That's why you gossiped with me, isn't that right?

67
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,380
Huh! It's because of me, the great Kang Eun Hwa! Don't touch my body!

68
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,520
   

69
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,270
What an embarrassment!

70
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,260
She's actually the biological daughter?

71
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,350
She also made an open comment about Hanju Group for giving her sample without her consent.

72
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,440
I can already see rumors spreading about her separation with you.

73
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,550
How dare she do this to her in-law family!

74
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,930
Hey! Who provided the hair sample?

75
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,070
Was it you?

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,730
What about you?

77
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,030
- What's with your expression? Was it you? 
 - Not me!

78
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,490
Then what was Seong Hye talking about?

79
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,000
It must have been Hyeong-nim! That's why she said something like that.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,400
By the way, Young Sister-in-law hurt her head, but why did her ovaries get healthier?

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,870
I wonder if the brain is related to infertility.

82
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,500
- She must have lied. 
 - What?

83
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Look at what she's doing. I wouldn't be surprised if she lied.

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,950
She didn't like talking to you, so she must have lied to shut you up.

85
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,800
What in the world?

86
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,590
Wait a minute, but Young Sister-in-law did step down,

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,630
so does that mean Hyeong-nim won?

88
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,230
She did win ... in a game of losing.

89
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,010
Both of you look like idiots now.

90
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,750
What were you planning with the Yumin Foundation?

91
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,230
I addressed this issue because I believed it was good for Hanju Group's sake as well.

92
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,620
For "Hanju Group's sake"?

93
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,920
You acted like a cat bringing a dead mouse to it's owner.

94
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,530
You fell for the fake news and made a ruckus.

95
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,180
What is all this nonsense!

96
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,270
Seong Wun was finally coming to his senses.

97
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,030
Don't do any more of these useless things.

98
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,080
You're also attacking my company!

99
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,940
Can we please have a chat?

100
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,510
Resigning? Now what was all that about?

101
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm deciding my own path as Chairwoman of Yumin Group,

102
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,690
I don't have a reason to consult with you.

103
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,430
What about the relationship between you and my family?

104
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,340
There's no reason for you to keep me at your house anymore.

105
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,230
I no longer have anything to do with Yumin Group.

106
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,940
All the planning you were going to do with me should now be done with Mr. Han Seung Wuk.

107
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,590
I don't want to make you into my enemy.

108
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,760
You have value.

109
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,900
"Value"?

110
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,570
I raised my children wrong.

111
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,420
Even if the world has changed, in a way, a daughter-in-law is also my child.

112
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,340
I was going to think of you as a new child of mine.

113
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,650
You can take back what you announced, and in a way, Seung Wuk is also a Hanju member.

114
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,120
You keep saying raising kids, raising kids.

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,510
Do you really see your children as mere cucumbers or pumpkins?

116
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,470
If the farming goes wrong, you just need to raise new ones next year? Is that what you're saying?

117
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,010
When you said you thought of me as your own, did you think I'd say, "Oh, father-in-law, thank you"?

118
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,990
I am really relieved that we don't have a father-daughter relationship.

119
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,210
For now, I will head off first.

120
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,030
Are you sure you brought the correct test result!?

121
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,810
- I delivered it the moment I got it. 
 - So, you're saying

122
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,520
you did nothing wrong?

123
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,780
Then whose fault is all of this?

124
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,700
Managing director, the business report related to the Apec Summit Inducement is ready.

125
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,440
- Reschedule it. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

126
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,580
Ah, you might misunderstand,

127
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,190
I'm just not in the best condition today.

128
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,030
Yes, you have a lot of stress in general, so I believe you need to release it.

129
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,360
I've met many people in similar positions.

130
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,110
There are many people who have things naturally,

131
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,630
but you've work so hard to get everything.

132
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,360
I imagine you have a lot of stress.

133
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,690
- You can go. 
 - Sorry for speaking out of term.

134
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,340
What just happened?

135
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,890
Tell me.

136
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,580
Yes, I will.

137
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,100
   

138
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,330
Now! As Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju, I can strike!

139
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,750
I'll set up an investigation headquarters, and investigate to my heart's content!

140
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,760
Why set up the headquarters here instead of your own place?

141
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,680
You said you didn't like men coming and going at my place, remember?

142
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,530
Then where? Should I set it up in the middle of the prosecutors' offices?

143
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,680
Look here.
    

144
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,690
What came of our effort with Chairman Han?

145
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,200
At that time, Director Kim and your father-in-law

146
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,220
were together.

147
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,110
"Director Kim"?

148
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,810
She hid my identity for me,

149
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,970
and she also verified Chairman Han's alibi?

150
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,460
I think that she's not taking sides.

151
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,780
I can't say! "Not taking sides" is not necessarily the moral thing to do.

152
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,580
That's just ...

153
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,370
like a bat of few words*? 
  (Aesop's fables: "The Bat, The Birds, and The Beasts") 

154
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,780
Even then, she's not someone who makes up things.

155
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,430
Anyway, even if she's not on their side, she's not on ours either.

156
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,720
Also you can't completely trust that alibi.

157
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,070
But still, a witness came forward.

158
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,220
There's a red light already, and you've just set up your investigation base.

159
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,430
It's no big deal. I can just turn left,

160
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,820
toward Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok.

161
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,780
Who is he?

162
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,620
Please introduce yourselves.

163
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,640
He is our Chief of Investigation and also

164
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,550
the news.com reporter, Paparazzi

165
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,360
P-P-Paparazzi.

166
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,450
 Most suspects don't just do one bad thing. 
   

167
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,990
 A person who beats someone up will lie as well, 

168
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,790
 and a person who lies will also scam money. 

169
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,780
 So if they didn't request an autopsy, 

170
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,790
 there's a high chance they also committed another crime. 

171
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,150
 Even with a traffic violation, 

172
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,410
 once you do it, you usually do it again, right? 

173
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,680
 - What are you saying? 
 - You know, people who drive like shit 

174
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,120
 commit traffic violations as a habit, 

175
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,850
 sometimes and sometimes not. 

176
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,500
 When following my car, though, they choose to commit a traffic violation. 

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,770
 Isn't it a little strange? 

178
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,180
 He's following us. 

179
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,030
 145 Wu 4728. Look up that license plate. 

180
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,360
 Got it. 145 Wu 4728. 

181
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,230
 Watch it! 

182
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,630
 I think there's another one. 

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,440
 Chief!? 

184
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,160
 What are you doing here? 

185
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,940
 About that ... 

186
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,130
 The Chief District Prosecutor told me to find out what you're doing today after calling in sick. 

187
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,900
 I kept giving you hints! 

188
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,310
 The higher-ups are keeping an eye on you for your poor work attitude. 

189
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,150
The Chief District Prosecutor was tailing you?

190
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,830
That's what I'm saying.

191
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,370
That's why this man, without even knowing I'm in the middle of a cognitive investigation,

192
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,460
is the paparazzi, aren't you?

193
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,000
About being paparazzi,

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,380
I really just told him when you came to work and left!

195
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,820
That is what paparazzi do.

196
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,910
This was the first time I followed you.

197
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,120
Out of the blue, I was told to figure out where you were,

198
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,040
so I called Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun. He said he was going to meet you.

199
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,090
- So I took just a few pictures, that's all! 
 - Anyway,

200
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,670
doing something like this cannot mend my broken heart, so—

201
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,990
All right? By the way, I also used a cognitive investigation last time

202
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,050
and caught Lee Bong Sik.

203
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,290
This time too, it's a big one.

204
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,710
Ah, I understand, Miss Prosecutor.

205
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,560
You only sent the pictures I approved to the Chief District Prosecutor, right?

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,900
Yes, I know.

207
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,650
You can go now.

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,610
The Chief District Prosecutor didn't get his position by playing some child's game or whatnot. How mean of him.

209
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,750
Then, who was in the car, following you?

210
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,340
 The address of the car following you belongs to ... 

211
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,870
 the Samgeori gang's night club. 

212
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,280
 From that, I am sure of one thing. 

213
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,500
 I'll look into the Samgeori gang side of things. 

214
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,840
 - No, you need to stop now. 
 - Why, all of a sudden? 

215
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,270
 From now on, the line between legal and illegal might not exist. 

216
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,630
 I'm the one who's been living an illegal life and violating the law, 

217
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,170
 so that's something I'll take care of myself. 

218
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,360
 But I won't ask you to do the same. 

219
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 Have you done anything illegal in your life ever? 

220
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,470
 What's wrong with you? This morning, I made a U-turn at a yellow light. 

221
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,250
 I believe Yeon Ju is right. 

222
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,400
 I would also feel bad if you had to suffer any disadvantage because of this. 

223
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,700
 "Disadvantage"? 

224
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,620
 I've never cared about losing or earning anything. 

225
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,240
 Especially if it was related to you. 

226
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,360
 I'll take care of calculating the advantage, 

227
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,190
 so you two don't need to be concerned. 

228
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,820
   

229
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,800
So ... are you saying that he went to do something illegal?

230
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,640
I heard that kids are fast-handed* these days. 
  (quick at improvising) 

231
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,240
 What's this? Isn't it you? 

232
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,890
 - I'm not sure. 
 - You bastard. Are you playing around with me now?! 

233
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,350
 You had better quickly come clean. 

234
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,690
 Prosecutor Jo! Wow. 

235
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,730
 Why did you do that? Did Jo Yeon Ju ask you to do it? 

236
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,640
 I don't accept requests like that. 

237
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,310
 Okay! I can send a message through this phone. 

238
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,870
   

239
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,940
 Seriously, you green-ass general prosecutor. 

240
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,980
 Do you think our organization is a joke? Do you think I'm your friend? 

241
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,640
 Do you want me to get your cousins, their near and far families, 

242
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,560
 and ruin all of them to the bone!? 

243
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,670
 Don't make your whole household a mess by acting like a headless chicken. 

244
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,420
 You should stop here. Got it? 

245
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,230
 Aren't you going to answer me? 

246
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,510
 My goodness, this bastard. 

247
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,280
 Don't you know who I am? 

248
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,020
 I'm Chief District Prosecutor, you bastard! 

249
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,830
 If I say "bury," everyone buries. Do you understand! 

250
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,280
 No matter what you're trying to find out, 

251
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,540
 do you think this will work? 

252
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,930
  
   

253
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,490
 Okay! 

254
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,170
 It's installed! 

255
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,030
 All of you are done for. Bastards ... 

256
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,380
 I can hear everything now! 

257
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,640
 I'm not doing it because it'll work. 

258
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,800
 Even if it doesn't work, that's fine. 

259
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,190
 So are you ... 

260
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,380
 going to keep playing this game? 

261
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,060
 You ... 

262
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,890
 When you summonsed Chairwoman Kang Mi Na for investigation, 

263
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,440
 who was the one who showed up? 

264
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,510
 Was it Kang Mi Na 

265
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,050
 or Jo Yeon Ju? 

266
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,040
 What do you mean? 

267
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,520
 Continue not talking. 

268
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,370
 Listen carefully. 

269
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,430
 Jo Yeon Ju ... 

270
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,190
 She's wearing the hat of Kang Mi Na as well. 

271
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,110
 What? Isn't that a photo? 

272
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,480
 I must prosecute her immediately! 

273
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,510
 Wait. 

274
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,290
 When did you learn about this? Why didn't you do anything after finding out? 

275
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,890
 I know about it, 

276
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,510
 but I only found out recently. 

277
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,170
 - All right then, I'm going to tell Han Seong Wun right away 
 - Just wait a second, wait a second. 

278
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,140
 - What are you going to do?
 - I'm almost there. 

279
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,190
 But, I don't have that decisive evidence. 

280
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,910
 You bastard, really. 

281
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,350
 Why do I need to report everything to you? 

282
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,160
 Don't you do anything. I will take care of it. 

283
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,650
 And ... 

284
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,050
 You had better keep quiet about everything. 

285
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,870
 Don't step out there. If you continue on like that, you won't be safe either. 

286
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,990
 My phone ... 

287
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
 You bastard. 

288
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,570
It's a prosecutor's habit. Don't make a single move until there's incriminatory evidence.

289
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,660
He won't make a single move until he's at the edge of the cliff.

290
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,970
I mean, if she's on sick leave,

291
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,270
she should be walking around as Kang Mi Na, the rich family's daughter-in-law.

292
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,740
Why is she still acting as a prosecutor?

293
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,060
And why get involved in a case that I'm in?

294
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,180
   

295
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,560
 - So, what happened?
 - Ahn Yu Jun, this guy, he's way too clean. 

296
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,860
 No tax evasions, and not a single fleck of dust. 

297
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,210
 Let me tell you about this family. His grandfather received a medal for being a good taxpayer. 

298
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,350
 What? Then what about the in-laws? 

299
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,390
 His in-laws paid 100 billion* tax on taxpayers' day, 
 (≈ $80 million) 

300
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,720
 - and they even received a trophy.  
- Okay.

301
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,350
This bastard, why does it seem like he is at home.

302
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,860
My uncle will keep an eye on him, and call me if it looks like he's making a move.

303
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,170
Now, we're done with the pre-setting of Chairman Han Yeong Sik's alibi.

304
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,990
- I also have something to say. 
 - What is it?

305
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,890
Since you're done playing two roles, I plan to leave Hanju.

306
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,500
You need a lawyer to re-open your father's case.

307
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,360
But all those you know are prosecutors.

308
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Team leader ...

309
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,700
Let it be. It is okay. My kids have all grown up now.

310
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,550
It's not that. I mean, you're someone who loses verbal fights against me! Can I trust you?

311
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,740
You— ... Lawyers go to trial for verbal fights in movies!

312
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,290
In real trials, all opinions are written up in documents!

313
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,240
Lawyers who talk a lot at trials are amateurs!

314
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,310
Besides, who knows Hanju better than I do?

315
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,500
You've worked at Hanju for a long time,

316
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,110
will you be okay with revealing Hanju's corruption?

317
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,680
As you probably know, there are legal penalties for revealing secrets not previously discussed with your consultant.

318
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,390
Well, there are. But people don't seem to go to jail for doing that.

319
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,650
Instead, I won't be able to work as a lawyer anymore due to this thing called professional integrity.

320
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,080
Once the case is over, I'll have to stop working as a lawyer as well.

321
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,500
Are you sure you'll be okay?

322
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,570
Of course!  I used to be Chairman Han Gang Sik's closest aide.

323
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,230
I've always felt indebted to you for not washing my hands of it sooner.

324
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,870
I'm struggling under all this interest. I need to pay him back now.

325
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,790
I heard you made up with Yeon Ju, so I came to talk to you.

326
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,770
Rather than say we reconciled, we're just starting to patch up our relationship.

327
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,940
Whatever.

328
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,600
I haven't mentioned this before in case you worried,

329
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
but I think this is quite serious.

330
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,660
What is it?

331
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,680
Jo Yeon Ju, this girl, she's a bit strange.

332
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,470
That one time we had a conversation, we got along so well.

333
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,190
But then, what, she couldn't even remember that at all.

334
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,190
I don't know what she's been doing this whole time.

335
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,230
And recently, she asked me to follow people around,

336
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,940
and she keeps doing things she hasn't done before!

337
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,450
Even now, Pil Gyu is stuck doing what we used to do as a gang in the mercantile agency!

338
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,140
Our business was going so well! And we've stopped it, for goodness' sake!

339
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,530
You kids, really!

340
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,600
How can you be so foolish to not even understand?

341
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,210
She's doing it to set me free!

342
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,410
She's trying to prove that I'm not guilty!

343
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,310
What? Then ... You didn't set the fire?

344
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,650
Didn't you realize that, even after visiting me for ten years?

345
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,350
Just do whatever Yeon Ju tells you to.

346
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,130
- But then that's not all! 
 - Right?

347
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,250
What's more serious is that she doesn't know how to judge people.

348
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,700
She's been dating some hooligan living in rented places!

349
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,120
A really tall guy with really big eyes, is that who you mean?

350
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,650
Oh! Do you know him too? Right, I heard he came here!

351
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,330
I mean, a person can be poor, I get that.

352
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,060
But he's full of meaningless pride, for someone so poor.

353
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,250
As her uncle, I can't stand that. That's what I'm saying!

354
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,960
You guys seriously don't know anything, do you?

355
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
Eh? What?

356
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,930
Seeing how he follows Yeon Ju day and night, it seems he doesn't have a job either.

357
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,690
Of course he doesn't have a job. He's a chaebol.

358
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,670
What, what? Impossible! He seems to fool around all day! He's unemployed. "Chaebol"?

359
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,210
Would you go and earn money if you were a chaebol?

360
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,310
Your wealth increases even if you do nothing.

361
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,940
Wait ...

362
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,830
Chae ... Chaebol?

363
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,910
Go. Do what Yeon Ju tells you to, properly.

364
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,320
See? She can't come home since she's guilty.

365
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Do you think I did that because of baseless rumors?

366
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,220
Is that still your biggest concern? Whether she's real or not?

367
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,820
Is there something more important than that?

368
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,860
Whether that girl is real or not, the bigger issue is that you didn't tell me when you realized it!

369
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,560
What else are you hiding from me? Tell me, before you cause another accident!

370
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,870
- What accidents have I caused and how many?
 - What?

371
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,590
You can't remember any successes I achieved without you knowing, can you?

372
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,660
You hound me because of a single mistake,

373
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,050
so how can I bring every single detail up with you?

374
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,630
So even in the future, are you going to report to me after you create the mess?

375
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,040
How can I entrust you with work?

376
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,170
How much more do I need to do for you to trust me?

377
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,230
How much more do I need to prove myself in order to do things?

378
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,160
Don't distort the facts. How about all the things I've given you so far?

379
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,540
A hotel ... You've given me the failing hand in a losing fight.

380
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,340
Before I took over, was Hanju Hotel even considered a proper subsidiary?

381
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,620
When have you ever given me a crucial subsidiary?

382
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,450
This whole time, I've been managing everything you've abandoned, alone.

383
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,410
And after I dragged it up all the way and made it into a success, I still remained unworthy of your trust.

384
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,100
If you know that, take your hands off the hotel for now.

385
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,600
I don't have to get off work just to start working at my in-laws' house.

386
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,630
I can do it from my home, in complete relaxation.

387
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,950
Sweet, very sweet.

388
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,860
Even for a glass of water, this place is more like heaven.

389
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,060
Wait, what, what, what? Did something happen?

390
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,660
- Nothing happened?
 - Nothing happened, so why? Why are you here at this time?

391
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,640
Aren't we close enough for visits even if nothing has happened?

392
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
You're right.

393
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,850
We don't have to be wary of each other now, do we?

394
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,920
We can meet anywhere when we want to, and it isn't cheating even if we kiss?

395
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,060
But still, I'm not saying we should kiss right now.

396
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,580
Here.

397
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh, it's jokbal*!
  (Braised pig's trotters) 

398
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,600
I thought you might have nothing to eat at home. And you said so before,

399
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,400
that you need to eat this kind of food when you hurt your muscles.

400
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,170
"Muscles"?

401
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,490
Someone said so. That the heart is a muscle too, and it must be trained

402
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,310
so that even if it's hurt, it can recover faster.

403
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:01,350
You must have been hurt by several things, even if you didn't mention it today. Right?

404
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,480
Let's eat!

405
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,580
Okay!

406
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,600
It looks so good.

407
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,780
- Open the door! 
 - What's that noise?

408
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,930
It doesn't seem to be this apartment.

409
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,270
Come out, damn it!

410
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,170
Come out! I know you're here. I know, so open the door!

411
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,370
Come out!

412
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:45,060
Why is that guy here— ... Oh, perhaps he's here to meet you?

413
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,140
Never mind, then. He'll probably leave once he realizes nobody is home.

414
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,840
Let's go back in.

415
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,090
Come out, will you?

416
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:08,080
Oh? I know you're in there, but since you're not coming out,

417
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,010
you must be hiding something in there!

418
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,780
I'm going to open this. I'll call 119! Open up!

419
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,670
That creature dares to bring up 119?

420
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:25,980
But what if he really pushes in? All of our investigation material is in there!

421
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,940
Ah, that's true. You should hide somewhere for now.

422
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,730
What are you doing?

423
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,980
What's this? Isn't it this place?

424
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,040
I'm pretty sure it was 1501 ...

425
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,650
I think you're mistaken. Go away.

426
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,830
Oh, damn it.

427
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,470
- Wait, wait.
 - Hey!

428
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,670
Dude, where do you think you're going?

429
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,670
Hey.

430
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,880
Is this how you live?

431
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,350
Why do you have such weird taste?

432
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,100
- You like this sort of thing?
 - What do you want?

433
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,660
Where is my woman? Are you hiding her in your place?

434
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,610
What kind of nonsense are you spewing? Should I report you for trespassing?

435
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:37,580
Hyeong, you're good at acting. I already know that you're hiding her.

436
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,210
How did you get past the DNA test?

437
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,300
You made her get plastic surgery to look just like Kang Mi Na and you snuck her in, right?

438
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,120
And you got all the Yumin assets from her.

439
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,580
Is this what you're after? Talking about a nonsense story you put together?

440
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,360
What I'm after?

441
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,140
Add me to your game, Hyeong.

442
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,070
- What?
 - I ...

443
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,800
already knew that she wasn't Kang Mi Na from the beginning. I know how to keep a secret.

444
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,990
While we're at it, let's work together, Hyeong.

445
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,650
I don't care if she doesn't come back to the house. Just help me stay married to her.

446
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,150
When you realized she wasn't your wife, didn't you think of looking for your wife?

447
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,370
- I did look for her.
 - Sure. So what did you want to do when you found her?

448
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,590
She wasn't too happy living with me anyway. If she doesn't resurface, isn't it a win-win for both of us?

449
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,740
Don't look at me like that. Do you know how things are at my house?

450
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,660
- Do you even know what you did to me today?
 - Do I have to know?

451
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,180
After today's events, our company stocks are falling.

452
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,190
Father fired Nuna, but I survived. Is it because of me?

453
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,430
No. It's because of that woman.

454
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,970
There's only one reason why Father keeps people by his side. Because they're useful to him.

455
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,090
He left me alone because Kang Mi Na hasn't officially cut me off and she still has company shares.

456
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,710
If I don't take her with me, I'll get kicked out soon, too.

457
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,010
That's all fine up to there. But if I remain at Hanju Hotel without her company shares,

458
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,220
do you think Nuna will leave me alone before Father kicks me out?

459
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,670
I need her. Work with me, Hyeong. Please?

460
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,170
In your house, are company shares more important than people?

461
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,760
I guess that's why your family does things for money that they shouldn't.

462
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,130
- You also came here for the money.
 - What?

463
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,510
You pretend not to, but do you think you're all that noble?

464
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,880
Would you have come this far if you had only lost a small corner store? Aren't we all the same?

465
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,920
People like us all live like this. Why do you pretend you're different? Why?

466
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,780
- You're envious, aren't you?
 - What?

467
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,590
I think you're envious of me. That's why you're yelling at me like that.

468
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,220
He's still acting all cool.

469
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,550
I'll leave it at this for tonight.

470
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,400
Think it over,

471
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,790
and let me live, too.

472
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,620
It'd be nice if I could get through to him with a single word and not ramble on.

473
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:59,710
- Did I get through to him?
 - He left right away. Of course, he ruined the mood.

474
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,730
But are brothers who have strong, older sisters all like that?

475
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,230
Why is he so afraid of Han Seong Hye?

476
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,900
There has been something scary about her since childhood.

477
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,640
Since he's close to her, he probably feels it more.

478
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,940
What's so scary about her?

479
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,020
Oh, Director Han Seong Hye had a dog she dearly loved.

480
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,080
But she developed an allergy and couldn't keep him any longer.

481
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,460
- And what happened?
 - That dog

482
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,740
was put down. Director Han Seong Hye did it herself.

483
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,410
 Seong Wun was finally coming to his senses. Don't do any more of these useless things. 

484
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,940
 You're also attacking my company! 

485
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,760
I shouldn't have chased him after that.

486
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,150
 I raised my children wrong. 

487
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,920
 I was going to think of you as a new child of mine. 

488
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,010
Why can't I have Hanju?

489
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:14,140
 Are you going to report to me after you create the mess? How can I entrust you with work? 

490
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,040
I've lived such an exhausting life.

491
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,420
I begged at the feet of people who had no intention of giving me anything.

492
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,970
 At the Yumin Electronics shareholders' meeting, this afternoon, at Hanju Hotel, 

493
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,940
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na announced her resignation. 

494
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,510
 Chairwoman Kang Mi Na was appointed as the Chairwoman after Chairman Kang Jang Su and his family died in an airplane crash. 

495
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,860
To acquire everything,

496
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,110
the easiest way is for everyone to be gone like that.

497
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:48,390
 But at the shareholders' meeting today, Chairwoman Kang Mi Na announced that she was stepping down due to personal reasons. 

498
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,370
Father looked exhausted.

499
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,960
I think it's time that he rests.

500
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,570
You know the prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office with whom Father has been working?

501
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,700
Set up an appointment with him.

502
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,780
Hey. Did you have a nice weekend?

503
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,690
Why am I getting so many calls from numbers I don't recognize?

504
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,290
Why am I getting so many texts?

505
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,230
What's this? Why is everyone canceling appointments?

506
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,410
   

507
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,720
What's this? 
    

508
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,070
   

509
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,250
I have more than enough cases of corruption involving him to pick from.

510
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,180
 Seonbae-nim, you're the best! 

511
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,320
 - The best ...
 - The best, the best ...  

512
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,310
 You left this behind last night. 

513
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,430
 These kind of things should not be exposed in the wrong places. I took very good care of it, sir. 

514
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,440
 He has received all sorts of entertainment receipts and money envelopes. 

515
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,220
 He kept pictures of all the checks. 

516
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,100
Our country's media wouldn't dare publish or air this.

517
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,670
A French Media company, bought by my father, recently opened a branch in Korea.

518
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,810
I'm sure that they haven't yet formed any relationships with this country's media companies.

519
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,500
This ...

520
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,290
Hey. What's this? Why are you doing this?

521
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,630
- What's going on?
 - Hey, this ...

522
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,760
You're spreading lies and defamation.

523
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,930
- Why are you telling me this?
 - You're the only one who knows about—

524
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,600
Knows what?

525
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,520
You just said this is "spreading lies and defamation."

526
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,220
Gosh, you jerk ...

527
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,920
You were desperate to work under me.

528
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,890
I had no idea where you came from, yet I took you in.

529
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,810
How ungrateful. How dare you stab me in the back?

530
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,470
Are you sure you raised  me?

531
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,060
I think you tried to use me.

532
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,160
A smart junior to use and abuse, and abandon when things go wrong since she has no money or connections. Smart move.

533
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,360
Hey.

534
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,580
Are you doing this because of your father?

535
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,480
Are you doing this to me, and even pulling off that double identity stunt, because of your father?

536
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,320
Hey! Your father confessed!

537
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,610
Of course, I admit that I didn't conduct a thorough investigation then. But still, he confessed!

538
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:23,170
What is it you want? Do you want to catch the real culprit? Then you shouldn't be doing this to me.

539
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,530
What is your real goal for doing this to me?

540
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,090
My goal is ...

541
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,460
realizing social justice.

542
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,000
What?

543
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,830
Hey, just because you're doing this to me,

544
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,710
do you think there will be social justice?

545
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,670
At the very least, before accepting money, people will think twice with the thought,

546
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,050
"That's what happens when you accept money."

547
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:11,250
 When someone is pushed to the edge of a cliff, there is only one way to survive. 

548
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,800
 That is to jump to the other side of the cliff. 

549
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,190
 You have to watch where he runs to. 

550
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,950
Damn it!

551
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,230
This means my advancement here is done. Right?

552
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,860
Relax ... Relax ...

553
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,070
Sure ... for this ...

554
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,380
I could just resign before I'm disciplined.

555
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,390
Someone like me could get into politics.

556
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,020
 I'm number six, Ryu Seung Deok. 

557
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,220
 I'm number six, Ryu Seung Deok. 

558
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,350
 I'm number six, Ryu Seung Deok. 

559
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,530
   

560
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,100
I've never had to bow to anyone before.

561
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,460
Should I open up a practice and rake in the cash?

562
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,530
No, no, that's temporary, too.

563
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,310
Then I have no choice but to beg at Hanju's feet.

564
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,470
   

565
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,450
If the Central District's Chief Prosecutor calls, don't answer.

566
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,440
 Yes, Chairman. 

567
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,790
 The number you are calling is unavailable at the moment ... 

568
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,900
Old man, aren't you going to pick up?

569
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,280
Yes. He's in a meeting right now. I'm afraid he can't receive your call.

570
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,040
 I know he's available. 

571
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,520
I'm sorry, but a call is impossible right now.

572
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,690
Excuse you?! You're about to leave the company in a car!

573
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,840
Hand the phone to him!

574
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,450
Chief Prosecutor, if you keep acting this way, we'll have no choice but to—

575
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:56,180
 Tell Chairman Han that he's more likely to go down with me if he keeps acting this way. 

576
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,240
Chief Prosecutor. As someone who's strung up here and there due to taking bribes,

577
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,760
why would you call me at this point in time?

578
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,660
Chairman. You need to know something.

579
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,740
Right now, your second daughter-in-law is a fake!

580
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,350
These days, it seems there are such rumors.

581
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,240
No, they're not rumors. It's the truth!

582
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,270
Besides, that person is my junior prosecutor!

583
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,230
I don't know what happened, but they look exactly the same!

584
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,010
 I'm certain she infiltrated your life with a purpose! 

585
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,960
Excuse me, Chief Prosecutor.

586
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,230
What kind of ridiculous story are you selling?

587
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,510
This might sound impossible, but it's true!

588
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,670
You know the Seopyeong Hanju factory incident 14 years ago?

589
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,990
She's the daughter of the arsonist!

590
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,280
So did the daughter of the arsonist from back then,

591
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,280
become a prosecutor and infiltrate my household?

592
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,960
Yes!

593
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,910
Then where is my real daughter-in-law?

594
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,300
Ah, that ... I don't know.

595
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,750
- Do you have any evidence?
  - "Evidence"? 

596
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,210
Yes, I was looking for evidence when this urgent issue came up—

597
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:13,010
How can a Chief Prosecutor be swayed by some X-files or rumors?

598
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,570
It seems that I was mistaken. Don't call me again.

599
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,420
Wait, Chairman. Wait!

600
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,480
You can't do this to me, right?

601
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,330
Your largest cover-ups are in my possession, Chairman.

602
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,700
They have never been revealed!

603
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,470
What are you talking about?

604
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:35,910
Lee Bong Sik ... Wasn't it you who eliminated him, Chairman?

605
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,480
 Are you trying to make me take the blame for something I didn't do? 

606
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,650
 You made that happen because you were over zealous, Chief Prosecutor! 

607
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,560
 Why are you trying to drag me into the mistakes 

608
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,250
 you've made in your life as if I'm a suicide bomber? 

609
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,100
Are you going to insist you don't know?

610
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,080
There's no point in insisting you're innocent.

611
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,370
From Lee Bong Sik's incident to the incidents of

612
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,880
14 years ago that were the foundation of today's Hanju Group,

613
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,040
everything will be revealed. That's what I'm saying.

614
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,120
Let's say you're right. Is there evidence for what happened back then?

615
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,580
If there's evidence ...

616
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,470
- What?
 - What if I have it?

617
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,140
Right!

618
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,960
You foolish man.

619
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,300
Why would you keep such a thing around? If it is known, everyone will be destroyed.

620
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,600
Yes, let's all go down together. Why not?

621
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:37,190
But, even if we do go down together, whose sin is greater?

622
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,320
 Who gets hurt more? 

623
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,640
Let's face it, I just need to open my own law firm.

624
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,990
But what about you, Chairman? What about your family? What about Hanju Group?

625
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,190
 You need to think well. 

626
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:55,280
That incident 14 years ago, it's my biggest insurance right now.

627
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,290
I mean, did you think I'd have held hands with you without that much insurance?

628
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,090
Ah, just in case ... If you're about to do something to me because of this evidence,

629
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,330
 you should give up. 

630
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,000
If something happens to me,

631
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,980
that evidence which I left with my most trusted person,

632
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,600
in the safest place,

633
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,010
will immediately be revealed to the world.

634
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,750
So you can anticipate it.

635
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,670
The chief prosecutor, whose favor Father worked so hard to gain, is standing at a cliff edge?

636
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,760
Yes. What will you do about today's appointment?

637
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,260
Father is the shrewdest businessman in our country, so he'll obviously try to break things off with him.

638
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,190
- Proceed as planned.
 - Understood. And ...

639
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:03,210
- What?
 - The name Jo Yeon Ju that you told me to look into.

640
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,740
 That Jo Yeon Ju! I knew I heard the name somewhere. 

641
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,000
 A while ago, a female prosecutor was ruthlessly digging into criminal gangs. 

642
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,180
 That prosecutor's name was Jo Yeon Ju! 

643
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,580
 I was just a lackey back then, so I never saw her myself. I only heard about her. 

644
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,560
What? A  prosecutor?

645
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,060
What kind of absurd ...

646
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,250
   

647
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,720
   

648
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,200
Jo Yeon Ju.

649
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:27,000
   

650
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,140
 If something happens to me, 

651
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,630
 that evidence which I left with my most trusted person, 

652
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:40,190
 in the safest place, 

653
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,570
 will immediately be revealed to the world. 

654
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,050
 Of course, of course. Yes. 

655
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,360
 I've finally entered the safest place for my protection. 

656
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,820
 Yes, yes, yes. 

657
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,090
 Oh, we should go golfing, of course! 

658
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:04,190
 I mean, your swing hits so far. How can I measure up? 

659
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:08,200
 Do you know what I learned from the suspicious-death cases? 

660
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,520
 That as long as you have someone's weakness, 

661
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,100
 you should put it in a place where it can be revealed as soon as something happens to you. Why? 

662
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,360
 Because you can't die alone! 

663
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,860
 As expected of you, sir! 

664
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:31,640
 Chairman Han Yeong Sik ... You're done for. 

665
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,130
 You did well coming all the way up here from Seopyeong. 

666
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,830
 Now that we're in the same line, 

667
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,760
 - I'll speak comfortably around you, all right?
 - Oh, of course. 

668
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,040
 - Do you play some golf?
 - "Golf"? 

669
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,440
 No, you're tall. I'm thinking the ball should go far if you land a good hit. 

670
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,930
 You need to be careful. You can't blatantly hit someone else's shot, you see. 

671
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,870
 You swipe it with your own card, then suck in everything with the bylaws. 

672
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,440
 I mean, what kind of madman tries to bribe prosecutors up-front these days? 

673
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:04,600
 That's why I'm saying, the golf club at Incheon I visited last time, 

674
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,060
 I mean, the fog had settled just right ... 

675
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:23,330
Why would he purposefully carry this around all the time?

676
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,910
   

677
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,390
Aigoo!

678
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,980
I didn't think you'd come.

679
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,860
Please, have a seat.

680
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,390
Does that make sense? How could you not be aware of her plan to step down

681
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,330
when you've been at Yumin Group for so long?

682
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:14,090
To be honest, I was aware.

683
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,520
What? Then why didn't you tell me? It's such important news.

684
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,860
I'm not a lawyer who retired from the higher court,

685
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:26,630
so my actions aren't that fast. I apologize for that.

686
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,220
So ...

687
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,410
This is my resignation.

688
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,770
I did write up a notice on the intranet,

689
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,370
but I thought it's more polite to give you this myself.

690
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,860
What are you doing, out of the blue?

691
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,760
It's said that if your views don't align with an organization,

692
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,240
it's right for you to leave the organization, although it's too late.

693
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,270
 Could it be that Kang Mi Na is hiding of her own free will? 

694
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,470
 What on earth are you talking about? 

695
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,840
 Hide? Who? Where? 

696
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,370
 Right now, your second daughter-in-law is a fake! 

697
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:14,600
 I'm certain she infiltrated your life with a purpose! 

698
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,540
 She can't come home since she's guilty. Do you think I did that because of baseless rumors? 

699
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,760
   

700
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,580
You seem to be in a pinch these days.

701
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,490
At times like this, people around you go through a selective process,

702
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,460
whether they're loyal or not.

703
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,230
I'm planning to use this opportunity, and stand on your side.

704
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,280
Our playing field ...

705
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,110
is a tough place on which to come by unexpected good will.

706
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:03,150
You've had deep connections with my father until now.

707
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:07,100
From what I've seen, you're someone who always holds insurance.

708
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:12,160
You have many resources pertaining to my father, don't you?

709
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,570
Since it's hard for you to hold an official position,

710
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,000
why don't you release everything related to my father?

711
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,990
You want to stab your father in the back?

712
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,620
Then what do I gain?

713
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,620
If you stay like this, you'll become a mediocre lawyer who quit being a mediocre prosecutor.

714
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:37,690
But when my father gets arrested, after things calm down,

715
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:42,720
you'll be Hanju Group's moderator. What do you think?

716
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:58,180
It seems like the daughter got rid of Lee Bong Sik, not the father.

717
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,860
What are you saying, out of the blue?

718
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,480
The dirt I have on Hanju Group,

719
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,370
you don't even know what that is, do you?

720
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:13,640
That's my father's problem. I don't care, whatever it is.

721
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,490
Fourteen years ago, your father asked me for a favor.

722
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,960
A favor related to you, not business.

723
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:28,160
Have you forgotten that  day you visited Seopyeong and caused an accident? A person died, remember?

724
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,880
You're bringing up a story that has nothing to do with our topic. It's not like there's evidence left either.

725
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,540
You know me, I'm the kind of guy who always has a few tricks up his sleeve.

726
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:49,440
Do you think I would've worked with Hanju without doing something like that?

727
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,080
Are you saying ... that the evidence is related to me?

728
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,980
If it wasn't, I wouldn't mention it.

729
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,120
There's a reason why your father is ignoring me, you know?

730
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,470
If I bring out that evidence, my dear Chairman Han might say,

731
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,090
"I'm sorry for raising my children wrong."

732
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:19,440
and avoid the situation by presenting his soft side.

733
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:27,410
It's not like people care about an accident where a random old person died.

734
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:32,950
Even if they don't care, there will be many who would be willing to use that.

735
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:38,260
If your father learns that you are trying to betray him, he won't sit back either.

736
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:45,250
There's also a prosecutor who has a vendetta against Hanju in our office.

737
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,950
- Like some random prosecutor matters.
 - I wouldn't say some random prosecutor.

738
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,840
She's the daughter of the Hanju factory arsonist.

739
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,320
Strangely, she looks very close to Hanju's daughter-in-law.

740
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Is it Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju?

741
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,620
Oh, you are aware of her.

742
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,430
Now, why don't we strike a deal?

743
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,880
I will take care of Chairman Han Yeong Sik,

744
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,070
so you take care of Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju.

745
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,040
- Are you keeping this as a trick up your sleeve as well? 
 - I don't need that in this case.

746
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,290
It's not a crime, just an industry custom.

747
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,220
You know well, don't you?

748
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,370
Let's sort the details out in a more formal setting.

749
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:20,310
Yes. Yeah, you couldn't reach me the whole morning, huh?

750
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,370
What? Oh, the news report?

751
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:25,270
Well, you know. In our country,

752
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:30,730
if someone is about to get ahead, there are people who try to pull them down.

753
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,910
Those damn losers.

754
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:38,890
Yeah, I plan to quit soon because I'm getting sick of being a public servant.

755
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,980
Of course! I have many places that want me to work for them.

756
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,770
Yeah. Okay, okay.

757
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,220
 It's not like people care about an accident where a random old person died. 

758
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,220
 Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! 

759
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:41,420
 Please help us! Someone help us! 

760
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,300
 Help! 

761
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,970
 So all along ... all of this was Han Seong Hye's fault? 

762
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,270
Damn it.

763
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:15,160
Damn it. Damn it.

764
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:29,490
These are some things that Ms. Kang Mi Na left behind.

765
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,070
I came to deliver them.

766
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,910
You are in touch with her, right?

767
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,850
That's right.

768
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:44,870
Ms. Kang Mi Na looked like a person trying to swallow a fish bone that's been in her throat for a long time.

769
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:48,120
I felt bad every time I saw her.

770
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,210
Anyway, I think everything turned out great.

771
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,610
I know you're aware that she's not Kang Mi Na.

772
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:02,080
Was it you who helped with the paternity test sample?

773
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,520
"Sample" ... I don't know what you are talking about.

774
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,910
Wasn't it you?

775
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:12,930
Whatever you are talking about, it wasn't me. Is that why you wanted to see me?

776
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:15,210
No, it's actually because ...

777
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,160
Don't side with anyone.

778
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,940
Don't get involved on any side either.

779
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,310
I asked you here to tell you that.

780
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,280
The reason my uncle is keeping you around is because you are useful.

781
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,920
The moment he was in trouble at the church, he instantly involved you.

782
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,840
That means that if you become useless, you will be abandoned.

783
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,810
I suggest you quit your job.

784
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,220
The two of you are embarrassing me.

785
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,770
"The two of us"?

786
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:48,920
Your father, Chairman Han Gang Sik,

787
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,810
also worried about me.

788
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:56,410
He told me not to run Chairman Han Yeong Sik's errands.

789
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:04,830
I handed in my resignation many times in the past. They were all denied.

790
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:09,620
It's probably because I was still useful, like you said.

791
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:14,570
A few times, I ran some errands for Han Yeong Sik.

792
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:18,760
When he left something in your grandfather's room,

793
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,950
I took it to the Chairman's office.

794
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:26,230
Sometimes it was a ballpoint pen and sometimes a wallet.

795
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:34,450
I learned much later that those were bugging devices.

796
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:41,300
That day, Chairman Han Yeong Sik

797
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:46,420
wasn't at the site where your father was harmed.

798
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:52,320
The person at the factory that day was Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

799
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:51,440
You must still be busy, even though you no longer have to wear two hats.

800
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,410
Why are you talking down to me as if you know me?

801
01:06:54,410 --> 01:07:00,340
That's funny. I will reveal what you've been doing until now.

802
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,320
I think that's my line.

803
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,800
Instead of just losing your memory, did you lose your mind as well?

804
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,980
Have you forgotten everything?

805
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:13,530
No. My mind is clearer than ever.

806
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:18,940
You ... what did you go around doing that night?

807
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,860
On your way out of the factory,

808
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:26,180
you hit my grandmother with your car and killed her.

809
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:38,280
I did feel something hit my car that day.

810
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,900
Was that a person?

811
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,560
What?

812
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,110
I'm going to kill you with my own hands.

813
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,930
I'm curious as to

814
01:07:54,930 --> 01:08:00,250
what some random general prosecutor can do against a chaebol.

815
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,840
What "some random general prosecutor" can do when she's hooked,

816
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,740
is something to look forward to.

817
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:12,020
A person like you must've done other dirty stuff, too.

818
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,690
Indiscriminate target investigation,

819
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:19,030
over investigation, entrapment, extensive search operation, announcement of suspected crime before prosecution!

820
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,820
I will use all of my judicial power,

821
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,740
and I will wreck you.

822
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,600
This is why we need to improve the prosecution system.

823
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,300
You don't know what a chaebol is, do you?

824
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,580
I've never lost to little bugs like you.

825
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,560
You've only fought when you can win.

826
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,440
You've never even started a losing fight, have you?

827
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:47,610
I've fought in both winning and losing fights.

828
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,380
When it's a fight I'll clearly lose,

829
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:53,100
I attack and attack until I win.

830
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:56,360
Try all you can with your money,

831
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,290
I will do all I can with the law.

832
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,710
   

833
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,540
 What did you go around doing that night? 

834
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:36,010
 On the way out of the factory, you hit my grandmother with your car 

835
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,110
 and killed her. 

836
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,270
 Yes. 

837
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,780
 Dad. 

838
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:08,050
 Yes, what is it? 

839
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:12,810
 I just ... hit someone right now. 

840
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,510
 I need your help. 

841
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,450
 Did you? Where? 

842
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,730
 I'm near the Hanju Fashion factory. 

843
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:31,910
 I was on my way there because I heard Older Uncle was going there regarding the ledgers. 

844
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:40,990
 But then ... a fire broke out at the factory. 

845
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,480
 Older Uncle is in there. 

846
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,310
 With the red flame, smoke rises in the sky. 
   

847
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:53,780
 Currently, the casualties have not been confirmed. 

848
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,890
 Are ... are they dead? 

849
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:01,070
 I don't know. She's not moving. 

850
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:05,790
 Well, No ... not ... that. 

851
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:08,230
 Your uncle, I mean. 

852
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,490
 That's what you wanted to know. 

853
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:32,170
 The fire is so big. 

854
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:38,260
 I don't think he can escape too easily. 

855
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:49,090


856
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:07,510
♫  Someday, I want to become the light  ♫

857
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:14,230
♫  Somewhere, I want to find myself  ♫

858
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:21,230
♫  One day, if the day comes when I confront my feelings  ♫

859
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:24,010
   

860
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,080
 Are you doing this to take me down with you? 

861
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,970
 Why would I go down with you? Hanju needs to save me. 

862
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:33,040
 Why are poor people always so aggressive? 

863
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,610
 You've been chosen for the Examination of Eligibility. You know that you're fired if you aren't eligible, right? 

864
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:42,540
 You didn't know this until just now, but now you know. I'm here on my father's behalf. 

865
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,640
 Do you think a chaebol will support a mere Chief Prosecutor until the end? 

866
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,500
 Don't you get it? You and that crazy prosecutor, you're both totally ruined. 

867
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,820
 Shouldn't we just find the one crucial answer? That is, find that woman, Kang Mi Na.
