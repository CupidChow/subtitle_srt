1
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,430
Director Kim. I'm sorry for the trouble I put you through because of my request yesterday.

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,020
It's something I do all the time. Don't worry about it.

3
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,360
How is my youngest sister-in-law doing?

4
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,560
- It was some time ago ...
 - Yes?

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,310
Your mother,  just as you did,

6
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,790
gave orders to serve the youngest madam a dish with peanuts in it.

7
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,830
I wasn't home at the time, so another employee gave it to her.

8
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,840
"I wonder how bad the nut allergy of hers is. Would she die? Or wouldn't she?"

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,610
I think that's what she wanted to find out.

10
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,830
At that time, the youngest madam still had her memory,

11
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,680
so she could've stopped if she felt something wrong,

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,080
but now that she has no memory, she'd still eat even if something felt wrong.

13
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,680
Would you have been all right if something happened to her?

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,890
What are you trying to say?

15
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,010
So,

16
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,830
when you told me to make the soybean soup with peanuts for the youngest madam,

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,790
I took out the nuts ingredients and used 100% beans.

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,630
I don't care whatever you do for work outside,

19
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,490
but don't drag that fight into the house.

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,630
However,

21
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,490
the youngest madam said

22
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,620
she felt ill from eating the noodles.

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,350
Strange, isn't it?

24
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,290


25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,470
Team leader, where are you?

26
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,910
I heard you're taking today off.

27
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,110
Why are you looking for me on a day off? I'm busy!

28
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,170
I so sick of just staying in my room.

29
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,970
By the way, what is Director Han Seung Wuk up to?

30
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,790
Why are you asking about that?

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,770
You said you were busy.

32
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,230
You two are the only people I know right now.

33
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,160
What is he doing? Where?

34
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,380
My job is originally a legal team leader, not a secretary.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,930
Take care of your own curiosity yourself,

36
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,470
and leave Director Han alone.

37
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,350
You're so on edge.

38
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,820
All right, then.

39
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,950
It's just that I have a habit of waking up, even mid-sleep, if I have something I want to find out.

40
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,130
But ... Why must I leave him alone?

41
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,490
Don't you understand when I say, "Take care of your own curiosity yourself"?

42
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,110
He has to go to many places today! Leave him alone!

43
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,400
Why? Where is he going? Huh? Huh? Huh?

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,210
   

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,970
   

46
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,050
 it looks like Seong Hye was planning to reveal your father's accounting fraud.  

47
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,290
 And so, he might have been trying to move the ledgers elsewhere.  

48
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,090
 Or maybe he was trying to burn them because he thought it was too late ... 

49
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,750
 The foolish man. 

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,940
 Because of those ledgers, he couldn't get out of the factory even when it was on fire. 

51
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,460
 Uncle, 

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,840
 you know that my father wasn't that kind of person. 

53
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,450
 Please look into it again.  

54
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,730
 All these years, my father has given so much of himself to Hanju Fashion and Nuna Seong Hye! 

55
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,860
 My father would never do that.  

56
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,300
 I see you don't know. That's how business is. 

57
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,240
 Just because you give something to someone, the recipient won't always pay you back.  

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,470
 However, if you know their weakness, 

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,750
 you might receive something. 

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,200
It seems that the chief district prosecutor will lose his position next personnel change.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,790
Ah, really?

62
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,790
I heard he'll be sent to somewhere without investigative powers.

63
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,800
There's a rumor already that you're next in line for the position.

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,260
Chief district prosecutor? Isn't that as high as a vice minister?

65
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,620
Wow, early congratulations Chief. I mean, Deputy.

66
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,380
It's nothing like vice minister. It's no big deal.

67
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,090
Of course! Being minister-level is not the important part.

68
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,020
Chief district prosecutor is like a step before prosecutor general.

69
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,550
You're almost there.

70
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,650
Calm down. Our superior is about to be demoted and you're saying such things?

71
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,520
Of course, we are grieving about it.

72
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,800
He was doing so well, with success after success,

73
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,530
but he got caught for bribery with a major company and that was his end.

74
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,240
Can you believe it?

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,220
Right?

76
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,410
What's going on with Jo Yeon Ju's missing-person report?

77
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,990
- The police are confused. 
 - Why?

78
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,530
She's a young prosecutor lady,

79
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,900
and a few days ago some people said they saw her at the office.

80
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,940
The police aren't sure if she's actually missing.

81
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,440
They're on the case and searching,

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,130
but they think maybe it's simply a case of running away.

83
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,470
You have her address, right?

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,830
What on earth? Why are you here?

85
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,090
Do you know me?

86
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,200
 She doesn't know me? 

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,760
You're Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, aren't you?

88
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,530
Ah, yes. I just came here for some business.

89
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,630
Do you not remember me? I was your driver before.

90
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,610
My name is Hwang Yong Sik.

91
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,260
Ah, yes. I recognize you. Nice to see you.

92
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,090
What's going on here?

93
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,510
- I'll come by sometime. 
 - Yes, sure.

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Who is that?

95
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,460
He said he used to be Kang Mi Na's driver.

96
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,720
Driver?

97
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,420
You couldn't wait for just a moment while I was on the phone,

98
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,630
and had to talk to some random person.

99
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,740
You were on the phone for so long!

100
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,500
I was talking to a police officer. How could I hang up?

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,740
The prosecutor I was supposed to meet is missing.

102
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,430
I wonder if I should get involved and look for her.

103
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,960
What, do you look for missing persons as a side-job?

104
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,090
You can't even find Kang Mi Na, and now you want to look for that woman.

105
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,790
Apparently, I'm the last person she spoke to on the phone.

106
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm wondering if she told someone that she talked with me and got into trouble because of that.

107
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,810
Legal team leader, you might not be as important as you think.

108
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,230
I don't have as little importance as you think either.

109
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,590
If you want to be a legal team leader for Hanju,

110
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,070
it's hard not to be seen everywhere you go.

111
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,340
You're right. You are seen, that's right.

112
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,890
But you're like that decoration stuff for sashimi. You know,

113
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,430
it's there, you can see it,

114
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,610
but you don't know its name nor do you eat it. What's the importance of that thing?

115
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,450
Why are you going around with someone so meaningless, then? You can just get your groceries delivered.

116
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,290
I'm so hungry, I can't wait for delivery.

117
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,090
What should I eat first?

118
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,320
So, she found someone who looks exactly like her and ran away?

119
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,300
Anyway, this woman is pretending she's Kang Mi Na. I see.

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,390
- Hello? 
 -  You asshole, 

121
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,360
 I told you to stay quiet abroad. Why are you here stirring things all over the place? 

122
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,990
Aigoo, how nice to hear from you.

123
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,670
I was coming to visit you some time soon,

124
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,450
but you called me instead.

125
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,660
- Congratulations! 
 - Happy birthday!

126
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,380
I heard it's your birthday today.

127
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,390
She kept bothering me so much.

128
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,720
Why are you hiding your birthday as if it's a state secret?

129
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
On birthdays, a party is in order. Come here.

130
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,700
At that house, I have no occasion to grill meat happily.

131
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,990
I'm grilling this because I want to eat it!

132
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,590
It's not because it's your birthday.

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,130
I mean, when you're cooking, you should cut chunky pieces

134
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,180
and put lots of ingredients like this to make it tasty,

135
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,470
but Director Kim tells me to slice it like thin threads

136
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,910
and make weird stuff like flowers with carrots, and then she seems to think I have crappy, unskilled hands.

137
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,400
What is it? Am I embarrassing you?

138
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,850
Please understand. I had a difficult day acting sick from that nut or bean powder allergy or whatever. I starved all day, seriously.

139
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,900
By the way, the refrigerator here is so empty.

140
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,490
- I agree, I always complain about it. 
 - Right?

141
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,660
I don't cook at home.

142
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,390
I don't even like strong flavors, anyway.

143
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,190
- Who made this soup? 
 - Who do you think? I did!

144
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,130
It's super delicious.

145
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,130
I'm this good at cooking but that family doesn't appreciate it! It's so unfair.

146
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,130
Don't worry about his reaction.

147
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,460
I know right? He said he doesn't like it but ate all of it.

148
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm eating just because you've already made it.

149
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,310
Maybe I was a restaurant owner or something.

150
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,380
I really hope I was.

151
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,000
Look here,

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,970
cook it more. I like it well done.

153
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,100
Aigoo, you don't know how to eat beef. This is perfectly cooked!

154
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,330
When you think about it, chaebols have a surprisingly unsophisticated taste.

155
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,330
I'll cook it all the way through and make it chewy for you, you'll see!

156
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,160
All the CCTV recordings inside the hotel have been erased.

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,600
What about my sister-in-law?

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,010
As you asked, I've searched emergency departments, nursing hospitals, and flight departure records,

159
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,450
but up until right now,  nothing particularly stands out.

160
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,950
But ... it looks as if someone already went through all that.

161
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,460
I think it's someone from the Yumin Group.

162
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,440
Is it someone from the board of directors?

163
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,290
I haven't figured that out yet.

164
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,630
I don't think it'll be easy to find her.

165
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,970
So how about reporting it to the police—

166
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,230
Do you want to reveal we have a fake Kang Mi Na, and turn all the companies over to Yumin?

167
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,410
First of all, don't let it get exposed,

168
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,940
and do everything you can to find her.

169
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,540
After that, we'll have to figure out who to work with next.

170
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,980
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,250
I am investigating the whereabouts of the paintings you are looking for through stolen-goods dealers.

172
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,780
This is the auction recording you mentioned.

173
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,550
You can leave.

174
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,930
What's this?

175
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,120
Lee Bong Sik?

176
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,400
The weather is nice, so why did we have to meet in a dark underground parking lot

177
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,770
instead of a nice cool café with a bay window?

178
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,740
You bastard. Whom did you meet here?

179
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,060
Why? Is there someone I should meet with?

180
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,320
- I'm asking if someone followed you around. 
 - Who would—

181
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,820
 Bong Sik. You're Bong Sik, aren't you? 

182
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,890
That's right ...

183
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,380
There was someone.

184
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,960
So? What happened?

185
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,840
- What do you mean? 
 - Did you

186
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,850
tell someone that I let you go on purpose?

187
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,900
Was I not supposed to tell anyone?

188
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,150
This bastard. Answer me straight!

189
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,450
Prosecutor, are you flustered?

190
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,360
Use that smart brain of yours and think about it.

191
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,060
Someone did come after me, but if they had caught me and I told them that, would I be here?

192
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,210
But who is that woman?

193
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,220
Is she an enemy or an ally?

194
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,040
You worthless thug.

195
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,980
Stop talking nonsense. Take this and get back out of the country.

196
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,230
Prosecutor, come on.

197
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,980
Are you mad?

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,790
It's money.

199
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,940
Prosecutor, three years ago,

200
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,740
during that Lee Bong Sik-gate ... You said this.

201
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,290
That if I hid, then me, you, and that lady

202
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,440
from the rich family, we would all be more relaxed.

203
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,590
So I hid, and everyone did become more relaxed,

204
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,570
but it seemed that ...

205
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,760
I wasn't included in that "everyone."

206
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,460
Besides, because of me, you, a prosecutor,

207
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,870
even brought an envelope of money, like this.

208
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,720
It seems like I have the upper hand nowadays.

209
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,630
You bastard. What are you thinking of doing?

210
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,610
This lady from the rich family seemed fishy in many ways.

211
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,190
Should I threaten her or get close to her?

212
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm currently thinking about it.

213
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,520
I'll think about it some more.

214
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,480
Doing this to be courteous is so useless.

215
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,110
Beer is best when you open it yourself.

216
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,220
Congratulations.

217
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,590
Why doesn't Kang Mi Na know how good this tastes, and I have to refrain from drinking it?

218
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,490
We gathered and ate together on my birthday ...

219
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,300
You're blessed.

220
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,030
Some people don't even know when their birthday is, so they can't even celebrate.

221
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,430
I heard you hate doing anything on your birthday,

222
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,290
so I didn't make you blow out candles on the cake.

223
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,760
You had better be thankful.

224
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,820
It's been a really long time since I've celebrated it.

225
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,500
Then what have you done on your birthday every year?

226
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,190
I would do things like go see the stars ...

227
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,080
Stars? I mean, why the stars?

228
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,890
Where?

229
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,370
Not like that.

230
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,520
If I go on the NASA website and enter my birth date,

231
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,260
it shows a picture of space taken that day.

232
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,700
Wow, awesome.

233
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,520
My birthday is the anniversary of my father's death.

234
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,490
Was he sick?

235
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,110
No, it was a fire accident.

236
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,460
At that time, I'd been very interested in my father's work for quite a while.

237
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,430
I heard from an accountant, who was a senior from my school,

238
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,460
that my father's company ledgers were a little strange.

239
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,520
So I told my father about that the next day,

240
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,500
and he went to check the ledgers

241
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,380
at the Hanju Fashion factory.

242
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,840
There was a fire there.

243
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,910
But people said it was my father who manipulated the ledgers.

244
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,840
I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't told him about it that day.

245
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,450
At least, he wouldn't have passed away there like that.

246
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,890
But that doesn't mean

247
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,830
that I can go back to that time now.

248
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,860
When I am suffering from those thoughts,

249
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,580
when I look at the big universe, it seems those thoughts are not a big deal,

250
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,920
and then I think I feel a little better.

251
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,960
My mother, Ajeossi,

252
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,540
and everyone close to me knew my birthday was the anniversary of my father's death,

253
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,430
so they were willing to quietly avoid celebrating it.

254
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,890
It's been a while since someone wished me happy birthday.

255
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,690
That's probably the best thing you've done since you lost your memory.

256
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,460
But you know,

257
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,090
I don't think that was 100% because of you.

258
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,590
I don't know for certain, but I'm sure your father wouldn't want his son

259
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,700
to be tormented for the rest of his life because of it, not being able to do anything.

260
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,420
The weather is nice.

261
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,690
 Are you all right? 

262
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,560
 What is it? 

263
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,810
 You're the first person 

264
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,740
 to ask me if I'm all right today. 

265
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,770
 It's because your face doesn't look so good. 

266
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,180
 Because of me, my father ... 

267
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,430
   

268
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,330
 His birthday is on the same day his father died. 

269
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,100
 Excuse me. 

270
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,620
 They say that somewhere in the universe, the sun rises and sets sixteen times a day. 

271
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,230
 If you think about it like that, dates and things like that, mean nothing. 

272
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,900
 When you think of a big universe like that, 

273
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,670
 then it doesn't matter what day today is, 

274
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,660
 and things like the date returning every year, 

275
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,920
 won't feel like anything. 

276
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,320
What?

277
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,830
What? Oh, it's nothing.

278
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,230
Isn't it time for you to go now?

279
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,200
Why do you keep trying to kick me out?

280
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,050
I'm a daughter-in-law living with my in-laws now, do you think I want to go home when it's time to go?

281
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,250
When I'm out, I'm treated as a chairwoman,

282
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,760
but when I go home, everyone else acts like a chairman toward me.

283
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,780
What is this? 
    

284
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,080
What? Is it another tabloid about my younger oppa?

285
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
Wow, it's a tabloid about my younger sister-in-law. 
    

286
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,630
She's really crazy.

287
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,920
How much has a married woman been hanging around with her cousin-in-law, who lives alone, for dirty tabloids to go around?

288
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
So what will you do?

289
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,450
What do you mean, what am I going to do?

290
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,590
Have you lost your mind because you want your youngest daughter-in-law's wealth?

291
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,400
It's not about that, I'm saying what can they do with this?

292
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,270
Hasn't he been caught up in tabloid rumors more often than not?

293
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,820
It's not the first time things like that happen.

294
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,340
Why are you making a fuss and gathering us around when we're busy?

295
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,790
Hey, hurry up and get her pregnant so she can take a step back, and use that excuse to run things on her behalf.

296
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,770
That's right. Older sister-in-law, you did all sorts of things to get pregnant after getting married.

297
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,800
You can teach them the secret method you used back then.

298
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Oh my, what are you saying?

299
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,250
I just became pregnant because of my kind heart.

300
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,340
- I gave birth to the eldest son of the eldest son— 
 - Be quiet!

301
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,470
What are you going to do?

302
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,200
When are you going to get her pregnant?

303
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,390
Are you going to screw it up because it's like work?

304
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,940
Mom, you can't make it happen whenever you want.

305
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,130
Hey. This is the only tabloid about her. How many do you have?

306
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,930
If she files for divorce, you'll be at a disadvantage. Are you going to stupidly stay put?

307
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,980
All right.

308
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,820
Why do you keep trying to send me off?

309
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,380
Fine, fine. Seriously, I'll leave after just one more beer.

310
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,880
But wow, you're quite uncultured.

311
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
Who puts something like this in the fridge?

312
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,330
This is magic powder, isn't it?

313
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,460
It elevates your mood.

314
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,060
 This is a magic powder. 

315
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,790
 If you take it when you are exhausted, it gives you energy. 

316
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,820
 I need this right now, too. 

317
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,230
What? What is it again?

318
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,980
Are you saving it? Is it a special sugar you're saving?

319
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,200
Who told you that?

320
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,620
Who told you it was a magic powder?

321
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,150
I don't know. Don't people say that?

322
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,280
You should go now.

323
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,240
Where were you that you're coming back now?

324
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Didn't you say you weren't feeling well?

325
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,510
I'm just so busy with work, you see.

326
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,110
Yeah right, "work."

327
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,840
You were hanging out with that cousin-in-law, weren't you?

328
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,810
What? Did I hit a sore spot?

329
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,450
It looks like the tabloid was right.

330
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,100
Instead of acting restlessly in public,

331
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,290
why don't you stay home and have a baby?

332
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,810
I haven't said anything up all this time because I didn't want our bloodlines to mix,

333
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,940
but things are different now.

334
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,700
In the past,

335
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,260
my son didn't even look at you, that's true.

336
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,060
But what about now?

337
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,520
Are you on birth control?

338
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,990
Oh ... My ...

339
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,760
Asking your daughter-in-law about your son's private life ...

340
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,940
Don't you feel embarrassed?

341
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,690
You're acting as if you were breeding pigs.

342
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,790
B-Breeding pigs!?

343
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,140
Hey! That's not a private matter in a family like ours!

344
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,810
Family like ours? What, are you like kings from the Joseon dynasty or something?

345
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,040
If you were born in the Joseon dynasty, you would just be rich middle class people.

346
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,350
Measly middle class!

347
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,230
At least it's great you didn't have a meeting of the whole family to discuss your son's sex life! Huh?

348
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,250
Everyone. Please refrain from discussing such private matters.

349
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,620
I'll head up to my room now.

350
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,510
We spoiled you too much and now you're crossing the line.

351
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,110
I tried to look at you in a good light, but don't you think you've changed too much?

352
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,320
By the way ... You always say you are trying to see me in a good light,

353
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,640
but you're always the one reminding me

354
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,810
what kind of person I was, to try to tie me down.

355
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,980
What?

356
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,910
Are you saying I'm two-faced?

357
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,010
Right, that.

358
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,770
The tablet that you used to carry around all the time.

359
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,110
Unlock that.

360
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,440
- This? 
 - Let's take a look.

361
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,010
You used to badmouth each of our family members on social media using that tablet.

362
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,300
I'm just wondering if you've quit that habit these days.

363
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,880
Let see who's the more two-faced here.

364
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,330
Your fingerprint was registered on it

365
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,780
so that no one could peek at it.

366
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,420
Unlock it. Right here.

367
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,360
 You should go now. 
      

368
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,060
 Why do you keep trying to kick me out? 

369
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,970
 Fine, fine. I'll leave right after I figure out this password. 

370
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,730
 Are you going to spend the whole night here? 

371
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,010
 People are actually pretty simple. 

372
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,980
 Passwords are things like birthdays, or other numbers easy to input. 

373
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,100
 If I do well, I could figure it out in a few tries. 

374
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,870
 When was Kang Mi Na's birthday again? 

375
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,810
 June 23, 1988. 

376
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,540
 What the heck ... 

377
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,600
 That's not it. 

378
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,310
 If it's not their own birthday, it's usually  

379
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,460
 the birthday of someone important or someone they care about. 

380
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,710
 How would you figure that out? 

381
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,260
 Did you say you were two years older than her? 

382
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,440
 I got it. 

383
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,120
 What? 

384
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,920
 It's unlocked. Using today's date. 

385
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
 It's your birthday. 

386
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,710
 I guess you two were close enough 

387
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,010
 to be each other's passwords? 

388
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,900
 There are no social media accounts or anything. 

389
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,910
 Heo Jae Hui. Chaebol private equity fund? 

390
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,520
 She knew about that?! 

391
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,290
 What is this? 

392
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,880
 The oldest daughter-in-law 

393
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,050
 seemed to have been scammed really badly. 

394
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,890
 Why do you think she had this written down here? 

395
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,820
 No idea. It's not as if she was going to threaten them with this information. 

396
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,690
 Han Seong Wun. Has been having an affair with announcer Park So Yi for a long time. 

397
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,440
 "Not just Park So Yi. From 2018 to 2019 he had an affair with the golf player, Jeong Bo Bae." 

398
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,680
 "From 2017 to 2018 with patissier Park Hye Na." 

399
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,380
 - "From 2016 to 2017..." 
 - This guy, really ... 

400
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,890
 He's the kind of guy who would hit on the nurse on his death bed. 

401
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,910
 "Han Seong Mi." 

402
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,700
   
 (methamphetamine narcotics) 

403
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,580
 "Until recently, she got high at clubs several times a month." 

404
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,170
 She's the one the prosecutors should be after! 

405
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,150
 Why did they take me? 

406
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,400
 - "Seo Myeong Won." 
 - Seo Myeong Won? 

407
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,420
 Who's that now? 

408
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,130
 Say that again. 

409
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,250
 What did you just say? 

410
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,140
 I told you to stop. 

411
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,240
 You and I ... We didn't ask 

412
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,970
 to be born or to live like this. 

413
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,600
 How dare you ... 

414
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,690
 How dare you! 

415
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,570
 "Because she was banned from her family's memorial services due to being a stepchild, " 

416
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,150
 "she assaulted the youngest daughter-in-law." 

417
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,040
 There are medical certificates proving the assault on the same day each year. 

418
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,810
 Heol! How could she do that when she's in the same situation? 

419
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,220
 When people are similar, they usually get close, but if they're exactly the same, 

420
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,420
 they might become enemies. 

421
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,640
 Mi Na must've reminded her of the things she wanted to hide. 

422
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,560
 Managing director Han Seong Hye and Chairman Han Yeong Sik on the other hand ... 

423
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,690
 Why is it only written "2007 accounting fraud," 
   

424
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,520
 and nothing else in detail? 

425
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,460
 "Accounting fraud" is related to my father. 

426
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,750
 This must be a crucial weakness to them. 

427
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,950
 If the truth comes out ... 

428
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,670
 then it becomes their weakness, is that it? 

429
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,990
 If that's it, I have a file full of these Hanju people's weaknesses 

430
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,580
 in my hands. 

431
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,310
 Here's the perpetrator's phone record. 

432
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,740
 Hello? Hello? 

433
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,110
 I don't think it's something to be happy about. 

434
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,620
 Maybe your accident happened because of this file full of weaknesses. 

435
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,120
 They're keeping you alive because you don't remember these notes. 

436
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,910
 You think? 

437
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,890
 My suspicion that they didn't just frame my father for accounting fraud, 

438
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,470
 but that they were also involved in his death, 

439
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,730
 has now become a certitude. 

440
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,790
 Is that why you came to Korea? 

441
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,600
 It happened a long time ago, 

442
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,560
 but I thought I could clear my father's name if I found a witness to the accident or evidence of the crimes. 

443
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,930
 The person who was going to give me a hint was Mi Na. 

444
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,900
 But as you know, Mi Na was switched with you. 

445
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,320
 After looking  at the tablet, 

446
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,470
 I am starting to think Mi Na could have gone somewhere to hide herself. 

447
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,570
 What are you going to do then? 

448
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,270
 Since she ran away by herself, aren't you going to look for her? 

449
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,140
 More important than that, 

450
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,870
 why are we walking so much? 

451
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,220
 What can I do? I was supposed to starve today, 

452
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,180
 but I ate a bunch of meat, and even drank ... 

453
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,820
 I can't go home like this. 

454
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,200
 The wind will take some of the smell off me before I go home. 

455
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,300
 You're overreacting. 

456
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,080
 I mean, do you really have to remove the smell here, with this method? 

457
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,010
 I didn't ask you to come with me! 

458
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,320
 You insisted on following me out. 

459
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,680
 And if a car goes by, 

460
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,650
 don't try to protect me by grabbing my waist and such. 

461
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,360
 I'm not like those other women who swoon at that kind of stuff. 

462
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,470
 I would grab you and toss you over my shoulder. 

463
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:45,020
♫  I will hold you in my embrace,   ♫

464
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,550
♫  Like the warm breeze  ♫

465
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,850
♫  I will run to you  ♫

466
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,440
♫  Like the sunlight  ♫

467
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,940
♫   seeping through  ♫

468
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:15,420
 Oh, come on. Seriously. 

469
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,590
 - Okay. 
 - Do you really have to do all this? 

470
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,350
 When I'm standing close to you, you smell like an ajeossi. 

471
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,430
 An a—? 

472
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,310
 I think you're freshened up enough to go home. 

473
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,260
 What are you going to do now? 

474
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,230
 I hinted at that old case to Seopyeong branch office prosecutor. 

475
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,820
 Seopyeong branch office? 

476
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,260
 Don't tell me it's that prosecutor who came to arrest me? 

477
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,520
 I thought he might be the sort of person who could go against the Hanju group. 

478
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,130
 What a joke. How on earth could you trust a prosecutor? 

479
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,030
 Don't you know what type of people prosecutors are? 

480
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,830
 They're experts at finding the next influential person whose boots they'll lick. 

481
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,510
 So many public prosecutors want to be backed by someone to gain wealth and fame. 

482
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,400
 - Hey, Prosecutor Cha, isn't that Prosecutor Jo? 
 - Prosecutor Jo? 

483
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,480
 How the heck do you trust prosecutors? You can never trust them. 

484
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,790
 And you said it's the Seopyeong branch, not even the central office? No way. 

485
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:08,450
 What's she on about? She went on vacation, so why is she trashing prosecutors near the main office? 

486
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,970
 Not all prosecutors are like that, I'm sure. 

487
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,130
 Of course they are! 

488
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,290
 And to be honest, I cannot go on living like this 

489
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,810
 Then what is she going to do? 

490
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,820
 You can still say this, even after looking at the tablet? 

491
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,230
 Who knows? Maybe they were roped into doing something to me by those people. 

492
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,910
 What? She's saying there's a tablet. 

493
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,400
 Be quiet. Let's listen. 

494
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,830
 Let's just tell the police already. 

495
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,800
 I really can't go on like this, with so many things on my mind. 

496
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,850
 - I'll just do my time in jail on the impersonation charge so I can sleep at night.
 - What's that? 

497
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,810
 Is she saying she'll go to jail? 

498
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,870
 When she says she will tell the police ... 

499
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,880
 Isn't she saying she'll flip the prosecution upside down? 

500
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,700
 If you really feel this way, I'll find out more about that prosecutor, 

501
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,440
 so see if you can buy some time until you are summonsed. 

502
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,620
 Erase all the notes in the tablet and change the fingerprint to yours as well. 

503
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,450
 Got it, right? Okay? 

504
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,320
 Let's go. 

505
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,800
 Spray this on you once more before you go home. 

506
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,540
 Ah, seriously! 

507
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,460
 Gosh. 

508
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,430
Unlock it.

509
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,910
What are you so curious about?

510
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,940
It's clean. There's no change to the social media accounts since we obliterated them last time.

511
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:13,280
Why does he keep telling me to "buy some time"? Does that mean it doesn't matter whether I live or die then?

512
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,060
Ah, that scared me!

513
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,200
Where does that man go this late at night?

514
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,400
Why bother asking? I'm sure he's out to have an affair.

515
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,230
Seriously. I can't stay in this household, it's a strain on my poor heart.

516
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,890
Let's relax. Relax. That's right.

517
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,540
The scent is nice, despite this situation.

518
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,840
Why did you suddenly ask to meet me outside?

519
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,540
Order your tea.

520
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,260
Please bring me a fresh juice of any kind.

521
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,770
The atmosphere at work is chaotic because of the restructuring.

522
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,700
I think there are going to be changes on a large scale.

523
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,130
You might be replaced as well.

524
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,340
What do you mean?

525
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,730
It's exactly as I said. I'm saying it might be difficult to help you out anymore.

526
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,200
Since we weren't in any financial relationship, there's nothing to settle regarding that.

527
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,370
We've been playing with fire since we were young, it's been going on for too long. Don't you think?

528
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,630
Are you asking me to break up?

529
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,640
Drink up.

530
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,710
Wow, Sweetie, you are amazing.

531
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,590
Do you think I'm maintaining my anchor position thanks to you?

532
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,940
What does this jerk take today's media for? Listen!

533
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,740
Maybe you've had a few drinks with some higher-up here and there,

534
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,170
but I was the one who passed the announcer exam and the audition to become an anchor.

535
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,380
How dare you make me into a woman who uses a man's backing to get a position?

536
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,010
Are you asking me to break up because of your wife?

537
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,180
To be precise, it's not because of my wife,

538
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,830
but because of you who's been pestering me about her all the time.

539
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,750
I'd also like to focus more on my family.

540
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,440
I believe it's more helpful for us to discuss this rationally, leaving no leeway for anything more.

541
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,520
- Since there was affection between us, I believe you'll understand— 
 - Shut up.

542
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,770
- Wh-What? 
 - Why? What's wrong with "shut up"?

543
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,500
Shut up is standard vocabulary, not an expletive.

544
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,110
Wh-Why are you acting like this?

545
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,040
Since I put my life in the hands of the likes of you,

546
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,250
I should suffer this kind of thing in order to wake up.

547
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,150
 What are you going to do then? 

548
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,830
 Since she ran away by herself, aren't you going to look for her? 

549
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,270
This is Alex Chiang.

550
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,100
The person we are looking for might have hidden herself overseas.

551
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,920
From now on, please search the whole world to find her.

552
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,050
ASAP. 
 (as soon as possible). 

553
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,510
Director! Why are you up so early?

554
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,390
I'm the one who should say that.

555
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,770
This is the hour I usually wake up, but isn't it too early to be going out?

556
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,760
I'm going to the office early.

557
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,320
It seems you haven't slept a wink.

558
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,160
Do you have worries?

559
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,580
Goodness. Of course not.

560
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,520
You said you were sick after eating the soybean noodles?

561
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,590
Yes. I don't know why on earth I have such an allergy.

562
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,390
It's all right. Anyone can forget.

563
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,280
At that time,

564
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,200
I was out of the peanuts I usually add, so I made the soup with just the beans.

565
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,740
Managing Director Han Seong Hye told me to feed you the soybean noodles.

566
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,100
Now I get it! That's why I was somehow not that sick!

567
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,160
That's right. Since there weren't any nuts, I wasn't sick.

568
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,630
Since you only used the soybean powder. So, well,

569
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,500
I wasn't supposed to be sick, right?

570
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,450
Who let you know you have a nut allergy?

571
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,810
What, Director? Are you doubting me?

572
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,320
I told the Managing Director Han Seong Hye the same.

573
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:11,390
That I made the noodles without the peanut powder. I'm only telling both sides fairly.

574
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,290
In the past, the youngest madam

575
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,390
didn't mingle with household members, but at least she didn't clash either,

576
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,300
as she grew up in a similar environment.

577
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,620
But the youngest madam of now ...

578
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,180
Soon, many people will catch on.

579
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,700
But why are you telling me this?

580
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,680
That's what I'm wondering.

581
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,110
A person who works for someone else should keep her  mouth shut.

582
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,600
Who knows? Maybe the time of my death is imminent.

583
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,460
That's why Managing Director Han Seong Hye told me

584
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,050
to unlock the tablet in front of others.

585
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,380
I'm saying she is surely suspecting that I'm a fake.

586
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,190
You are so unconcerned, seriously.

587
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,620
All sort of people are tightening their net around me

588
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,330
and my identity might be revealed anytime. How can you yawn in this situation?

589
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,400
If I were unconcerned,

590
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,060
would I have run over so early in the morning?

591
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,460
It's because I treat it as if it were my own issue that one word from you about wanting to leave this household right away

592
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,440
spurs me on to come over and drive you away.

593
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,570
-  You didn't hear yet, though?
 - What about?

594
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:31,640
The Hanju group sent a directive telling me to return to my post as the legal team leader.

595
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,590
If you think about it,

596
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,010
- the duty of the private secretary should fall on Yumin group.
 - But why, all of a sudden?

597
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,910
To be frank, the legal team side

598
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,210
has been seriously affected by my absence for a while now,

599
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,410
so it's not exactly a strange directive.

600
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,150
But one thing I'm worried about

601
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,630
is that perhaps Managing Director Han Seong Hye

602
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,220
is trying to tie up Chairwoman Kang Mi Na

603
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,980
and cut her out from her supporters,

604
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,530
- which is why she is trying to remove me from your side.
 - Ah, I see.

605
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,000
You are not that important, so don't worry.

606
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,590
Actually, perhaps she realized that you are a double agent.

607
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,890
That's what I'm worried about.

608
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,260
- Hello?
 -  Chairwoman Kang Mi Na? 

609
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,730
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Ahn Yu Jun, public prosecutor at the Seopyeong branch office.

610
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,070
I'm calling regarding the summons notice.

611
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:52,590
What kind of prosecutor calls the chairwoman's direct phone number?

612
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,790
How did you find my number?

613
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,390
Thanks to my network of people,

614
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,100
I was able to get it from Yumin Foundation's Director Kang Eun Hwa.

615
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,020
Ah, that ajumma, really!

616
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,920
What would be the reason you are personally calling me?

617
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,300
It's because there are people who deny they were notified

618
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,470
if the subpoena is delivered via mail.

619
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,170
 So, at the risk of being rude, I called in person. 

620
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,320
So the summons date would be ... three days from now at 10 a.m. How does that work for you?

621
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,610
I mean, Mr. Prosecutor ... Three days from now is just too tight.

622
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,520
Can you push it back a little?

623
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,310
The week after would be the end of the month.

624
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,150
That's when we wrap up cases here at the prosecution office.

625
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,190
I can't do that because I have too much work to do.

626
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,520
You say it's not possible because you have too much work?

627
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
That's right.

628
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,660
Then ...  then ... well,  10 a.m. is too early,

629
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,150
so can you possibly push back the time of the day?
 - These days, inspectors don't work late hours.

630
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,280
We can't do this too late because then they'll have to work overtime.

631
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,450
Ours is a small branch, so there aren't that many workers.

632
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,410
If yours is a small branch, why do you go through such lengths—

633
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,680
If you are thinking of going to the Central Prosecution Office in order to lessen our load,

634
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,420
please know that this case was passed to me from Central Prosecution,

635
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,250
so I think it may be a bit tough for you to run like the last time.

636
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:06,620
What I'm saying is that I suffered an accident recently so I'm not feeling all that well.

637
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,300
Then we will get right to the CCTV analysis.

638
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,580
Unless you are physically unable to move, you must come in immediately.

639
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,820
- I have to travel abroad— 
 - Where are you headed, in your condition?

640
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,360
I'll place you under travel restriction, so you must come in first.

641
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,390
You are an unusual guy.

642
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,900
People who work like me aren't necessarily rare.

643
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,200
It's just that we only focus on working, not climbing upwards,

644
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,580
therefore people like you don't really meet us, that's all.

645
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,480
Do you have an illness where you believe you're some Robin Hood prosecutor who fights chaebols?

646
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,160
Not at all.

647
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,040
- I don't have any symptoms. 
 - They could be unbeknown to you.

648
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,000
 What's this? This smooth tit for tat? 

649
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Why does this seem so familiar? 

650
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,280
At any rate, I'll take it as the summons date and time have been served

651
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,650
and will be hanging up.

652
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,450
Hey, h-hello?

653
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,290
What a lunatic!

654
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,260
Whom did you speak with?

655
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,110
With Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

656
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,780
You called her yourself?

657
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,950
She totally barricaded herself against us.

658
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,960
Are you fully determined not to let anyone else

659
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,640
- intercept the case like last time? 
 - What determination?

660
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,060
I only told her to comply because that was the only available time on our schedule.

661
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,540
Based on how he talks, that prosecutor is not to be taken lightly.

662
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,800
If he decides to cause us trouble, there's no freakin' answer.

663
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,130
Why do you come here to tell me that, though?

664
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,460
Then what am I supposed to do? I don't even have the team leader near me.

665
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,360
Then should I whine to the new secretary who could have been placed there by anyone?

666
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,290
There wasn't much of a problem the last time you went to the prosecution office.

667
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,410
I was innocent back then.

668
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:44,050
There wasn't a drop of drug in my hair, urine or blood. I was as clear as a sea anemone, so it went smoothly.

669
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,080
But this time, I know that Kang Mi Na did that weird painting transaction.

670
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,300
Now I have to keep my testimony consistent, but without the memory of the event.

671
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,220
It's just a witness investigation. They probably won't probe far.

672
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,050
Have you ever been interrogated by a prosecutor?

673
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,380
Have you no idea what kind of people these prosecutors are?

674
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,780
The bar exam's first-phase test has eight choices for each multiple-choice question.

675
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,570
With that, you cannot even guess and pick.

676
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,210
Those determined people who passed that difficult test will be interrogating and doubting me.

677
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,120
Do you think I'll be able to give a consistent statement?

678
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,910
How come you speak as if you have taken that bar exam?

679
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,060
Is that what you should focus on?

680
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,920
I'm trying to tell you why I can't be summonsed,

681
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,370
so why aren't you notifying the police to find Kang Mi Na?

682
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,320
It's not that I haven't thought of notifying them.

683
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,860
But if it's known that this Kang Mi Na is not the real one,

684
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,180
I fear that the Hanju group will find Mi Na by any means necessary,

685
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,950
and harm her.

686
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,240
Then what about me?

687
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,010
Finding Kang Mi Na is important but whatever happens to me isn't?

688
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,810
It may be a bit difficult,

689
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,370
but let's delay the summons and wait a bit.

690
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,830
I'm telling you that prosecutor isn't the type to delay.

691
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,980
I get the feeling that he'll find something immediately if he starts to investigate.

692
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,080
God, never mind!

693
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,420
Gosh, why does she act like that?

694
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,760
It must be real love between the two of them, huh?

695
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,700
That's right. Whom should I trust?

696
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,140
I need to protect myself.

697
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,570
   

698
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,010
If you have any additional necessity, then I could go ...

699
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,120
I'd like to rest quietly alone,

700
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,030
so lock down the entire second floor,

701
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,130
and don't let anyone in.

702
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,120
Yes, ma'am.

703
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,780
   

704
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,740
Posted so quickly.

705
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,580
I'm always the center of interest, no matter what I do.

706
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,710
 Someone saw Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju of the Third Division badmouthing the prosecution right in front of the office,  

707
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,300
 saying the prosecution is rotten and needs to wake up. 

708
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,340
 She gets bad when she's drunk. 

709
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,920
 But they said she appeared to be completely sober.  

710
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,610
 - What is it then? Is she planning an insider attack? 
 - I heard from someone who knows someone who knows ... 

711
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,440
 She's taken an extended leave and hasn't shown up for a while. 

712
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,840
 - People like her usually go on leave right before causing trouble. 
 - I heard something about a tablet too. 

713
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,560
 I guess there's something to it then. 

714
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,380
-  I wonder who'll be the next to be axed.  
 - Why the heck would you post that here?

715
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,390
It's mayhem here all day today.

716
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,850
It's not as if I made up a story out of nothing.

717
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:35,150
And how would they find out who was the source of the rumor, anyway?

718
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,000
Eat up. Eat up.

719
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,610
What's this I hear about someone seeing Prosecutor Jo near the office yesterday?

720
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,680
I've also only heard the rumor.

721
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,240
Among the public prosecutors,

722
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,240
there's a rampant rumor that Prosecutor Jo is planning a rebellion using some documents

723
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,320
that she found in a tablet linked to a large corporation.

724
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,030
- A tablet? 
 - Yes.

725
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,620
It's also because of that corporation's lobbying affair that the chief prosecutor

726
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,980
was demoted last time.

727
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,130
Seriously ...

728
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,210
You can leave.

729
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,230
 Deputy Chief, sir! 

730
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,470
 You left this behind yesterday, sir. 

731
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,380
 - Where did you get this?
 - Well, last night you were overjoyed on the third round of our outing. 

732
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,140
 You took this out to look something up. 

733
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,760
 This kind of things should not be exposed in the wrong places. 

734
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,170
 I took very good care of it, sir. 

735
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,190
 Well, what could possibly in here that is worth anything? 

736
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,810
 - Get on with it.
 - Yes, sir. 

737
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,430
There was definitely something.

738
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,990
Was it back then?

739
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,470
Lee Dong Sik, you punk, did you leave the country or not?

740
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,570
Should I not have shown him the taste of money?

741
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,810
- She was admitted to the hospital?
 - Yes, ma'am.

742
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:29,040
What a shame! She would be even more in the bind if her lie is discovered and she gets summonsed.

743
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,960
- Notify the reporters.
 - Bring it over here. I said I would pay for it!

744
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,150
You can't be unruly here, sir.

745
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,930
- Bring two more of these tomato juices.
 - Please come inside with—

746
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,240
I told you I'd pay!

747
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,400
What are you doing?

748
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,490
Hey! Go and bring them to me.

749
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,310
Did I ask for an alcoholic drink? Huh?

750
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,070
I'm sorry, Managing Director.

751
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,340
He's been carrying on like this since this morning.

752
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,880
- He keeps saying he has someone to meet. 
 - All right.

753
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,540
You can go.

754
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,940
I will call him up to the office.

755
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,090
At times, people are dumber than animals.

756
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,530
Pardon?

757
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,990
They sometimes set the trap for themselves

758
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,340
with their own hands.

759
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,300
Why would someone who promised to stay abroad come here?

760
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,030
A promise? Nah ...

761
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,400
What we did back then was a deal, not a promise, I believe.

762
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,990
I've been thinking lately that it was an unfair deal.

763
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,900
A chaebol family daughter, born with a silver spoon

764
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,340
and who grew up like a flower in a greenhouse wouldn't know.

765
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,060
But for a commoner like me,

766
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,440
who is expected to live to a hundred years old,

767
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,160
but has no retirement plan or anything,

768
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,750
life is pretty frustrating.

769
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,500
You really have a lot to say.

770
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,130
What did you say?

771
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,450
It's usually the ones with nothing who have the most to say.

772
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,260
Dogs that are going to bite do not bark, you know.

773
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,560
For a conman, you're bad at judging people.

774
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,810
 The noodles must have soaked in all the soup. 

775
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,050
- I'm hungry. 
   - The noodle color is just so... 

776
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:40,250
Team Leader. Can you come over for just a moment?

777
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,400
What is it, please?

778
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,450
I am really hungry.

779
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,050
Come to think on it, I haven't been able to eat a single morsel since early this morning.

780
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,340
I am hungry too, you know.

781
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,040
Due to all the postponed lawsuits,

782
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,350
I am working even though I haven't eaten. Don't they feed you at the hospital?

783
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,780
Since I've been admitted for acute stomach cramps, they're only feeding me gruel.

784
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,960
It's called gruel but really it's just water. Water!

785
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,250
Be a little patient.

786
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,620
What will you do if people get suspicious because I visit you during work hours?

787
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,400
I got it. I'm hanging up.

788
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,920
- Hello?
 - Um, the thing is ...

789
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,740
I'm saying this out of real hunger,

790
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,090
would it be possible for you to buy me a jok-baengyi set?

791
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,440
Wh-What is that you want me to buy for you?

792
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,800
A jok-baengyi set, I said.

793
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,490
Jokbal  (sliced pigs feet)  plus golbaengyi  (sea snails) . Don't you know?

794
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,770
It wasn't but a moment ago that you stormed out, but now you call out of the blue and ask for Jok—

795
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,080
- I am busy now.
 - W-W-Wait a minute.

796
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,050
Come on, please!

797
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,860
I'm as good as locked up here, and the team leader says he can't come.

798
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,590
They are giving me only water because I supposedly have acute stomach cramps.

799
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,260
Just why then, of all the diseases available, did you pick acute stomach cramps?

800
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,770
Then what was I supposed to do?

801
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:11,920
Prosecutors these days would search CCTV recordings if I say I have a herniated disk or a broken limb.

802
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,290
But since I was completely fine when I left this morning, it had to be "acute,"

803
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,760
and if it's something serious, the stock prices plummet, so it had to be a minor illness

804
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,210
due to stress. So I went with the stomach-related issue any modern person can suffer from—

805
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,610
Ah, talking about it makes me hungrier.

806
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,800
Forget the whole damned thing if you aren't going to come. Goodbye.

807
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,150
She was cursing me for allegedly ordering her around the other time.

808
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,010
But now I should go to the hospital to ask around

809
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,880
and buy jok-baengyi for her when she asks me to?

810
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,880
Does she think I'm some sort of a private secretary?

811
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,440
Jok-baengiy...

812
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,640
Jok-bae...

813
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,550
Jok-baengyi!

814
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,530
Eh?

815
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,000
How did you get in here?

816
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,510
I told them not to let anyone in.

817
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,500
Have you any idea how much I donate annually to this hospital foundation?

818
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,670
Of course I have a way.

819
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,430
Here you go.

820
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,850
Why bring inedible flowers?

821
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,180
You didn't bring anything for me to eat?

822
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,080
Want to sprout a rumor you are feigning illness?

823
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,470
That dish would smell.

824
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,890
- You are right. You are meticulous.
 - I'm off.

825
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,780
W-Wait! Are you just going to leave?

826
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,700
I already brought you something. What else do I have to do?

827
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,030
I don't like staying in hospitals.

828
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,690
Thanks to my strong mind, I have an appetite in any circumstance.

829
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,820
I am truly strong. Right?

830
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:03,260
I don't think it's your strong mind, but rather your strong stomach.

831
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,800
Sushi is really appreciated,

832
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,020
but being in hospital makes me wish I could chew on tender jokbal

833
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,810
and take a bite of sweet-spicy golbaengyi,

834
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,080
and down a glass of soju. Kahhh!

835
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,660
- Didn't you eat those in your dreams?
 - How did you know?

836
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,220
If someone were to stay near you while you slept, they would clearly know that you are not Kang Mi Na.

837
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,270
How can I pretend to be Kang Mi Na in my sleep too?

838
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:31,890
I guess Ms. Kang Mi Na was a graceful lady even in her sleeping habits.

839
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:34,250
Well ...

840
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,060
What's this? What's that shyness?

841
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:41,390
Just what kind of person was she?

842
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,200
Shouldn't you be more worried about who you are?

843
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,690
To be honest, right now I am uncertain as to

844
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,610
what kind of person Kang Mi Na was.

845
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,540
At times,

846
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:00,820
you seem more like Kang Mi Na.

847
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,330
This means that even though I'm doing well

848
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:10,370
at pretending to be Kang Mi Na, I am clearly different from her.

849
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,510
People usually compliment a fake by saying they are very like the real thing.

850
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,790
They say a doll is like a person, and a painting is like a photograph.

851
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:19,130
And that a dream is vivid like reality.

852
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,660
You are saying I'm like Kang Mi Na.

853
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,540
- What do you usually do when you're by yourself?
 - Why do you ask?

854
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,060
Judging from the way you speak and act,

855
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,200
I don't believe you were an ordinary person.

856
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,210
Usually, the things people do when they are alone give a good idea of who they are.

857
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,420
Why the sudden interest in who I am?

858
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:47,580
I'm curious where you'll be going when you go back.

859
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:53,480
Also, I'm wondering if you were close with dangerous people.

860
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,730
What? Are you worried that I might be a dangerous person?

861
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:01,040
I'm wondering if you might find yourself in danger.

862
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,160
I am searching the entire world,

863
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,310
using all means available to me.

864
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,690
You will be able to return soon.

865
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,120
By the way, why do you dislike being in hospitals?

866
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,010
I mean, if it's not that you absolutely hate it, I was hoping you would

867
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,820
- airlift food for me while I'm here.
 - Why would I do that?

868
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:32,400
I mean, I have to be stuck here for days and Team Leader says he can't come.

869
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,100
Do you hate being in hospitals that much?

870
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,750
When I go to a hospital, it brings up bad memories linked to this place.

871
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,300
Though they are all in the past.

872
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:47,180
It's not all in the past then, if you hate it every time you are reminded of it.

873
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,880
Fine, then. If there really is nothing to eat,

874
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:54,550
I'll wear a mask and go downstairs to the emergency room and make myself some instant coffee.

875
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,190
Do you know this?

876
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,590
At night, the warmest place in the hospital is in front of the ER.

877
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,650
They also have instant coffee there.

878
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,690
Because people visit there around the clock.

879
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:15,270
 This is a magic powder. 

880
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:18,010
 If you take it when you are exhausted, it gives you energy. 

881
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,320
 I need this right now too. 

882
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,030
 I only have two here. 

883
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,590
 There are many more if you go in front of the ER. 

884
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,220
 Do you know this? 

885
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,490
 The warmest spot in the hospital at night is in front of ER. 

886
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,940
 That's because people visit there around the clock. 

887
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,050
♫  Reaches me   ♫

888
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:59,060
♫   It draws me to you  ♫

889
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:05,220
♫  All the pain is healed now   ♫

890
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:12,360
♫  I will hold you in my embrace  ♫

891
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,710
♫  Like the warm breeze  ♫

892
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:23,170
♫  I will run to you  ♫

893
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,790
♫  Like the sunlight seeping through  ♫

894
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:33,420
   

895
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:48,260
   

896
01:05:53,500 --> 01:06:03,500


897
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,420
   

898
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:14,420
 To think that she is alone on a day like this makes me cry. 

899
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,760
 And is that brat not even going to come here on a day like today? 

900
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,830
 The son is in prison. 

901
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:28,250
 And the granddaughter doesn't show her face on her grandmother's death anniversary. 

902
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,960
Oh, this house is vacant, though.

903
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,600
I guess they had a flower delivery booked in advance.

904
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,480
I wonder if someone will come to pick it up.

905
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,850
   

906
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,720
 You've all always treated me this badly  

907
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,800
 but I guess you're not afraid of getting me summonsed by the prosecutors? 

908
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,020
 That Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, 

909
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,930
 - isn't she a little strange?
 - A woman I'd never seen before, 

910
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,690
 who appeared frail yet so determined at the same time. 

911
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,360
 You know that when a prosecutor disappears, it often isn't anything good. 

912
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,150
 I guess there weren't any family members to look for me when I disappeared. 

913
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,310
 I already have that information myself.  

914
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,650
 - What I need is evidence.
 - Can you tell me, where is the car that chairwoman Kang Mi Na took today? 

915
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,950
 Shall I give you a chance? 

916
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:18,540
♫  Let’s ride a guitar as a motorcycle  ♫

917
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,299
♫  Let’s ride a guitar   ♫
