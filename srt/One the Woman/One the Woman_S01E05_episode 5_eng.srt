1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,930
   

2
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,470
Her slap was way too confident.

3
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,560
 Oh, my gosh! 

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,420
 You said your mouth gets all thorny 

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,590
 if you don't eat gamjatang every three days, 

6
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,450
 so I was wondering. 

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,290
If what that ajumma says is correct,

8
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,920
I loved gamjatang,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,500
and ate on credit all the time.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,130
 Your Lordship! I'm here! 

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,220
Someone else called me "your ladyship", too.

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,810
 Aigoo, Your Ladyship. I can't believe I'm running into you here. 

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,340
 Wasn't that tip really great? Did you already make a killing thanks to it? 

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,920
That's right! That conman!

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,930
Then ... that means that by "Your Ladyship"...

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,640
he was calling me a prosecutor?

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,870
Wait a minute. I'm extremely intelligent ...

18
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,620
I adapt to any circumstance, and know all kinds of legal matters.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,300
Someone in the Prosecutors' Office recognized me

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,040
and someone even called me "your ladyship."

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,630
Could I have been ...

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,870
   

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,270
After the news about being supported by Hanju group got out,

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,470
people think I earned a ton of money or something.

25
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,850
Why did he even go there ...

26
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,810
Maybe he had to meet someone there.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,440
By any chance,

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,630
have you looked through your husband's cellphone?

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,970
It was destroyed in the car.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,520
Then, may I have the phone number at least?

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,620


32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,830
Has his condition worsened recently?

33
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,380
No.

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,210
I think it's been 14 or 15 years since he got worse.

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,050
It was after a fire at the factory where he used to work.

36
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,530
Now that I think about it,

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,050
that factory also belonged to Hanju Group.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,510
Hanju Fashion.

39
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,850
H-Hanju Fashion?

40
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,420
   

41
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,890
   

42
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,890
 When the factory fire happened, 

43
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,090
 he was sleeping in the dormitory. 

44
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,180
 Luckily someone woke everyone up by knocking on each room. 

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,940
 Thanks to that, he wasn't trapped. 

46
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,730
 However, it took some time until he got rescued 

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,850
 and maybe that caused him trauma. 

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,800
 His seizures got worse back then. 

49
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,300
Wait a minute. I'm extremely intelligent ...

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,220
I adapt to any circumstance, and know all kinds of legal matters.

51
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,270
Someone in the Prosecutors' Office recognized me

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,850
and someone even called me "your ladyship."

53
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,400
Could I have been ...

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,190
going around impersonating a prosecutor?

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,230
I was not just a gangster but a swindler too?

56
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,600
No wonder ...

57
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,040
Honey!

58
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,470
Why did you get a ride from Seung Wuk?

59
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,250
I don't know. Why do you think I did?

60
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,410
 See. This "quick on my feet" reaction that doesn't let the other person think. 

61
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,690
 This is totally the specialty of a swindler. 

62
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,550
What?

63
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,480
Of course, it was the legal team leader who came to get me,

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,810
but suddenly he had a stomachache and had to go home.

65
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,830
And my cousin-in-law, as the largest shareholder of Yumin holding company,

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,350
was worried for the leader he supported, so he was waiting there as well.

67
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,450
And I thought it was a chance to make a good impression and get close,

68
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,230
so I said, "Would you please take me home?"

69
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,660
 Look at how easily this comes to me. 

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,990
 Undeniably, I'm a swindler. 

71
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,810
You could've called me.

72
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,920
Honey, maybe it's because I'm so used to losing to my nuna,

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,310
but I have no inferiority complex towards my wife either.

74
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,870
I really wish you to be successful.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,450
You became the new owner of Yumin

76
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,910
and I didn't have time to congratulate you.

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,620
Congratulations. Sincerely.

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,160
Thank you.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
However, Honey ...

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,020
Go ahead.

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,030
It's just that I can't remember ...

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,500
Is there a good friend of mine or someone like that

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,530
whom I would meet on my own sometimes?

84
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,650
I can't find out because my phone is destroyed.

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,790
I mean ... Now, at this time,

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,110
do you really need to focus on your friends?

87
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,830
You have so much on your shoulders right now.

88
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,540
You don't know, do you? You didn't even ask once, did you?

89
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,210
- Get out. 
 - What?

90
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,130
Get out, I said. I'm the idiot for asking you.

91
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,120
Rest well.

92
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,060
How long do I have to live lying like this?

93
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,240
 I'll put you back in your original position without any trouble, as long as Mi Na returns safely. 

94
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,740
Where I belong?

95
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,090
As a gangster and a swindler?

96
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,360
Everyone is just wondering where Kang Mi Na is.

97
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,760
They don't even care who I am?

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,240
Even if I'm a gangster and a fraud, I must have family.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,220
Someone must be looking for me.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
- What's going on? 
 - 3452,

101
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,050
you have a visitor.

102
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,010
It's you two.

103
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,570
Is there anyone else who would visit you here, Hyeong-nim?

104
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,330
You visit me maybe once a year

105
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,600
and act as if you come here often.

106
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,050
Hyeong-nim, there's something we have to tell you.

107
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,580
There's a group called Samgeori in Seopyeong.

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,260
Just recently, we had an incident where they destroyed us miserably.

109
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,080
- The truth is— 
 - I told you

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,070
not to come here if you are going to talk about the gang.

111
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,010
- It's not that— 
 - If you really have no way to make a living,

112
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,960
use your Nammun gang background and do Youtube or something.

113
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,870
I'll allow it.

114
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,770
I won't post malicious comments on your channel.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,210
I won't create any more disadvantages

116
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,790
for Yeon Ju

117
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,020
who's doing great things as a Korean public prosecutor.

118
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,110
She's doing well, right?

119
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,000
She cut ties with this side,

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,070
and is an admirable public prosecutor, right?

121
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,800
I don't know if I should tell—

122
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,000
Of course. She is doing great.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,290
Eats well, works hard.

124
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,080
Yes. Of course.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,150
She's doing well.

126
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,750
God damn it.

127
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,370
We came all the way here and you won't let me speak!

128
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,000
His eyes were sparkling when we started talking about his daughter.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,140
The prosecutor daughter he is so proud of has been taking bribes and using violence

130
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,520
and now she's being chased by the Samgeori gang and is hiding from us. How do we tell him all that?

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,770
We shouldn't have come. What's the use of knowing about his daughter

132
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,900
who has cut ties with him, when he's in there?

133
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,760
What if he gets out on parole?

134
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,900
- He'll be so disappointed. 
 - He got a life sentence.

135
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,870
There is no hope of parole before he serves at least 20 years.

136
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,100
He has a long time left.

137
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,370
Good morning.

138
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,290
Team leader, what are you doing here?

139
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,180
I told you I'm in charge of everything related to you.

140
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,030
Rather than getting a bunch of people involved,

141
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,540
it's more cost effective for the one who signed the contract

142
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,750
to work for you.

143
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,140
Chaebols are the worse.

144
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,270
Anyway, let's work well together,

145
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,960
Mr. Double Agent Team Leader.

146
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,490
Why are they acting like this? It's too much.

147
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,050
It's courtesy toward the new owner.

148
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,190
Your father, Chairman Kang Jang Su,

149
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,350
said he would not give inheritance while he was alive even if his heirs had to pay all the inheritance tax.

150
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,350
That's why you as his daughter, Chairwoman Kang Mi Na,

151
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,390
got his wealth and authority in their entirety.

152
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,370
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

153
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,620
I removed everything I could, the inauguration and whatnot,

154
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,370
but to also skip the briefings

155
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,980
on the new businesses of our core subsidiaries would seem a bit strange.

156
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,680
So we have to proceed with these, with the minimum amount of staff.

157
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,280
But will they talk to me as well?

158
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,780
- What do I say? 
 - You don't need to say much.

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,320
Just okay everything for now.

160
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,060
You're a stand-in anyway.

161
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,720
You just need to maintain the situation as it is now.

162
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,720
The real chairwoman can decide whether to keep going once she returns.

163
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,200
Okay.

164
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,960
But this is ...

165
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,640
Is there something wrong?

166
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,470
I mean, this "aggressive marketing" ...

167
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,540
this means you will just use a ton of money.

168
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,800
"One plus one" events, coupons,

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,930
and  rebates on the margin if the distributor sells more of our stuff.

170
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,160
It's one way to run a business.

171
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,080
And I'm saying that I don't like that way.

172
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,910
You're a new business. Stop trying to bluff your way through it.

173
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,950
Lower the marketing cost and invest more into product development.

174
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,070
Bluetooth earphones?

175
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,590
Even a small business goes bankrupt if it doesn't recover the initial investment in five years.

176
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,030
This business hasn't made a profit in years, but you want to do it again just by changing the name?

177
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,210
Is there any point in doing that?

178
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,560
A mobile healthcare platform construction plan?

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,190
How will you figure out the legalities for this?

180
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,300
You might not know, but a law was passed recently.

181
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,750
The law that passed recently is the Third Data Law.

182
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,270
There would still be several restrictions for things like this because of the medical data laws ...

183
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,810
There are too many restrictions on this. Do you realize how much of a headache it'll cause if we get sued?

184
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,250
Submit this report again once you've included the solution plan.

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,510
   

186
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,810
I've removed everything I could,

187
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,500
but since the furniture business has been our main focus this year,

188
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,820
I thought it wouldn't be right to cancel an encouragement visit by the new chairwoman.

189
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,610
A higher-up coming to look around. How is that encouragement?

190
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,620
Ah, I'll sit here for a moment and then leave,

191
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,350
so give the employees a small bonus. That's what's called encouragement.

192
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,710
Well, go! I'm not going to wander around all corners of this store

193
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,090
looking at each tiny detail and making a fuss over everything, so just work comfortably.

194
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,270
- What's this?
 - I've managed to remove as many appointments and visits as I could.

195
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,280
But since Yumin Group's motto has been global management,

196
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,310
I think you'll have to attend the video conference with the Australian branch.

197
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,820
I mean, apparently you just need to show your face.

198
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,660
What exactly have you removed?

199
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,820
- Oh, how comfortable.
 - You shouldn't be so ...

200
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,390
It's perfect. What. Do you think Koreans buy sofas to sit on? They buy them to lie on.

201
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,150
   

202
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,130
Oh. Hi!

203
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,890
We're very pleased to meet you, new Yumin president.

204
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,490
As you can see, we're in the middle of a meeting right now ...

205
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,560
What's this doing?

206
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,740
Hello? 
    

207
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,410
Hello?

208
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,360
What the heck are these people ...

209
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,480
Are they doing this on purpose?

210
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,000
They said I just need to show my face and now they plan to make their own decisions?

211
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,040
They must be looking down on me since I'm a young woman.

212
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,160
Tell them I will schedule a new meeting with them so I can attend it properly from my office.

213
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,300
What?

214
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,690
Ah ... I don't know what your previous profession was,

215
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,090
but I think you passed the board meeting for a reason.

216
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,130
I feel I was worried for nothing this morning.

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,890
Do you even understand English, too?

218
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,740
Ah, well, I think so.

219
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,320
But, wait, I suffered all day yesterday being interrogated at the prosecutor's. Aren't you giving me too much work?

220
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,330
No one's giving you work,

221
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,250
you've been pushing yourself to do it!

222
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,170
It's almost lunch time, so please wait a bit.

223
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,990
I'll be able to eat comfortably at least, right?

224
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,560
Father-in-law, if you had something to say to me, you didn't have to take me to a restaurant.

225
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,110
You could have just said it at home.

226
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,510
Does this look like a simple meal to you?

227
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,160
Sharing the newly appointed leader of Yumin's first lunch has an important meaning.

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,030
Ah, yes.

229
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,210
Regarding the hotel you launched in Jeju ...

230
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:21,460
Do you think you can just have that lackadaisical opening, without even a launching show?

231
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,400
The entire family dying in a plane crash on the day of the opening sheds a poor light on the hotel's image.

232
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,080
Since that has already happened anyway, since we run a  hotel business too,

233
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,760
what do you think of merging, and starting anew?

234
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,030
Father ... canceled his lunch plans with me?

235
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,700
Yes. I was told he made a last-minute dining appointment with the new Yumin chairwoman.

236
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,390
The new ... Yumin chairwoman ...

237
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,630
Are you going to go into politics?

238
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,420
Me? No.

239
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,190
Then what kind of gall made you do this?

240
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,290
You barged in to arrest a major company's leader with just a tip-off that she did drugs?

241
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:24,220
The tip-off was certain and after all, there was a risk of destruction of evidence and flight. Which actually happened.

242
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,790
What nonsense is that? She went home after her test came back negative.

243
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,890
And ... You know how strict the prosecution's structure is.

244
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,250
How can you rush in without a plan, ignoring the hierarchy?

245
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,090
I did it because it's illegal.

246
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,810
If it's illegal, prosecutors should investigate and indict. Isn't that their job?

247
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,290
Since when did everything illegal become the prosecutors' subject of investigation, damn it?

248
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,100
I don't understand what you're saying.

249
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,050
You, you, you. What am I going to do with you?

250
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,450
Have you given up on being promoted?

251
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,660
It's not giving up. I'm not interested.

252
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,000
Really? Well, I guess you could think that way, if you've gotten used to a countryside division like Seopyeong.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,650
Then, you should try to take interest in it.

254
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,480
What ... do you mean?

255
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,690
You see ...

256
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,900
You know the Hanju Tax lobbying case that was taken by Second Division?

257
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,930
I have re-assigned it back to your division.

258
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,960
You re-assigned a case that had already been re-assigned? And to a different office?

259
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,830
Surprising, isn't it? Think about the amount of effort I must have put into making this surprising thing happen.

260
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,640
But my friend in your department, who played a critical role in this re-assignment, told me,

261
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,820
"My department's so small"

262
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,640
"that there's only one person who can undertake such a major  case."

263
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,890
And that had to be you.

264
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,500
That's why I'm telling you ...

265
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,900
Cover it up.

266
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,190
I learned a bit more about you today.

267
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,930
And I see you're neither interested in politics

268
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,270
nor in climbing the ladder.

269
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,450
You seem to work your butt off without consideration for anything.

270
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,670
If you cover this up well,

271
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,590
I'll make sure you gain an interest in climbing the ladder.

272
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,930
You said you're close to Jo Yeon Ju. Then you know, don't you?

273
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,530
Look at her. She started to get her act together.

274
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,310
That's how she returned to the Central Prosecutor's Department.

275
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,040
Then what becomes of you?

276
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,020
How long are you going to patrol the countryside?

277
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,150
Are your lungs in poor health? Do they need fresh air or something?

278
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,560
Stop wasting time on that Lee Bong Sik or whatever his name,

279
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,360
and think of this as destiny. It's an opportunity for you.

280
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,560
Investigate well, yes?

281
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,880
Make sure you refer to the existing precedents for chaebol lobbying cases

282
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,810
when you work on it. Okay?

283
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,170
Precedents are just precedents. The law is different.

284
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,450
I'll do it my way.

285
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,710
You're going to do it according to the law?

286
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,110
Wow, Father-in-law, you have amazing charisma.

287
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,230
- I couldn't find a moment to raise my spoon while you were talking. 
 - What?

288
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,420
However ... How could you request a merge,

289
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,960
when you referred to the death of the entire Yumin family as a simple, unfortunate accident,

290
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,890
at the first dinner with the new chairwoman of Yumin?

291
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,110
As you may know, I used to be no more than a speck of dust to my family.

292
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,870
But that memory has disappeared, for good or for bad.

293
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,880
Let me say it plainly, as I have no particular feelings toward them.

294
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,570
Don't try to take over someone else's hotel effortlessly with that kind of mindset.

295
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,560
The size of the Hanju and the Yumin hotel is glaringly different.

296
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,550
It's said that whatever abilities you keep inside you are bound to overflow.

297
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,590
Why was I unable to see what you were capable of?

298
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,900
Then, I'll leave before you can look any further.

299
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Enjoy the meal.

300
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,560
No matter how independent a prosecutor's office is,

301
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,590
do you really think they will approve everything you want to do?

302
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,890
If I had Prosecutor Jo, I wouldn't have called you here!

303
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,170
I mean, what happened to her? I even filed a missing person's report.

304
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,530
The police aren't even looking into it properly.

305
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,370
You filed a missing person's report?

306
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,730
Then, how long did you expect me to wait? She's not appearing.

307
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,720
All right, I understand. If you've nothing more to say, I'll take my leave.

308
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,790
- Have a nice meal!
 - Hey. Hey!

309
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,820
What is that dude?

310
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,320
Why did you have to storm out like this?

311
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,750
I lost it for a bit because I'm hungry.

312
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,130
I felt I had to leave quickly in order to eat at least a triangle kimbap before lunch ends.

313
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,390
Thanks for the meal.

314
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,750
Oh? He's leaving without eating.

315
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,820
- Team Leader. Let's go in. 
 - Where?

316
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,400
That food was for the chairman. Think about how expensive it must be! Let's go eat.

317
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,520
Hurry! Hurry, I'm so hungry!

318
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,610
Hurry!

319
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,040
Hey! Hey!

320
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,350
Chairman.

321
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,160
Fancy meeting you here.

322
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,130
Yes, are you here for a meal?

323
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,990
Our new business opening is on hold because of the summons we received.

324
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,490
But here you are, having lunch outside of the office ...

325
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,400
I suppose you have a lot of time on your hands.

326
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,620
Yes. Well ...

327
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,030
Please don't worry.

328
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,150
It's a method people use often,

329
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,620
but I've had the office in charge switched to a branch office where several of my friends work.

330
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,930
Well. You should work that out yourself.

331
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,360
Chair— um.

332
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,320
Why didn't you have lunch until now?

333
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,960
I went to eat but came here because something foul happened.

334
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,030
Ah, the soup's amazing.

335
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,540
Wait. You didn't bring that female colleague you cherished?

336
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,020
I met her yesterday while delivering night runs, so I thought she'd be here.

337
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,130
- Who? Jo Yeon Ju? 
 - Yes.

338
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,310
What nonsense is that? You must have been mistaken.

339
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,360
Do you think I wouldn't recognise someone I've seen since their newbie years?

340
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,370
The only thing I've gained from 30 years of business is these eyes of mine.

341
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,440
Who do you think you're talking to?

342
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,730
I also saw prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju yesterday.

343
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,610
 Then you should have told me earlier! 

344
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,460
What? Where?

345
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,590
In the corridor of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

346
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,860
She was walking with some man.

347
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,810
Are you certain? You're not mistaken?

348
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,200
Oh, I'm certain!

349
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,640
She was even angry!

350
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,850
I sent a message that I canceled our appointment. So why are you waiting here?

351
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,480
You should have called me if you were going to have a meal with my sister-in-law.

352
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,420
It was regarding the hotel, so I wanted a private conversation.

353
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,800
You're going to merge with Yumin already?

354
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,210
If it's about the hotel, don't I need to know too?

355
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm not trying to help your business,

356
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,490
but trying to expand my company.

357
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,460
I've received a summons from the Seopyeong prosecutors' office.

358
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,240
That small bribe to the National Tax Service is still persistently dragging my feet.

359
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
They don't have that list from three years ago with your name on it,

360
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,990
so Seong Wun's wife, who is solely responsible for paintings' transactions,

361
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,620
has been called in as a witness.

362
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,870
You should talk with the gallery and take care of anything that could be problematic beforehand.

363
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,990
Yes.

364
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,790
Let's see how Seong Wun's wife handles the situation this time.

365
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,730
Whether I'll be helping your business,

366
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,030
or expanding my company,

367
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,450
we'll have to talk about that after this.

368
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,110
My strength just left me after talking to Father-in-law.

369
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,560
Can't I drop by some hospital for an IV shot?

370
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Don't you want to work?

371
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:36,220
Who do you think I am! I'm tired, all right?

372
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,520
By rule, the chairwoman cannot be treated by anyone other than her personal physician.

373
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,260
But your physician is currently in Singapore to attend a conference.

374
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,070
Sing, Sing, Singapore ...

375
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,870
I'll buy you some energy tonic from the pharmacy,

376
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,760
so drink that, and try to hold on!

377
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,290
What kind of chairwoman is unable to go to the hospital in the absence of her doctor? Does that make sense?

378
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,040
Our stocks are falling right now.

379
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,860
If rumors spread regarding you going to the hospital, the stocks will crash.

380
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,420
Wait, why are you here? Why aren't you looking for the real—

381
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,100
For the real Kang Mi Na?

382
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,930
You need to give me some information to find her. I couldn't even reach you.

383
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,120
Well, I didn't have time to contact you! Do you have any idea how busy I've been?

384
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,220
Did you even look into it? Friendships, routine,

385
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,110
- and anything particular on the day she went missing?
 - No.

386
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,610
You talked big, but what have you done all this time?

387
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,620
It's not that I couldn't look into it, it's that no one knew anything about her personal life.

388
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,360
 Friends? 

389
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,530
 I've never heard of any friends. 

390
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,970
 You only went out to go to the gallery or to do charity events, 

391
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,890
 and since you had to report back everything anyway, whenever you did step out, 

392
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,390
 well, I would have preferred to stay in too. 

393
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,080
She was like a speck of dust to her own family,

394
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,080
her husband wasn't interested in her and her friends were all checked.

395
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,740
It seems she never talked about herself to anyone.

396
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,430
What a sensitive man you are.

397
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,980
I can tell everything from your expression.

398
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,080
What? Who is sensitive?

399
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,140
Now that I think about it,

400
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,180
right now, I'm the head of this group.

401
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes?

402
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,550
Then let's push back the approval meetings, since my decisions may be overturned anyway.

403
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,890
What?

404
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,540
It's not that I don't want to work.

405
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,500
Look at that face. Oh dear, oh dear. I should find Kang Mi Na for you first.

406
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,400
Let's go to the gallery first. The gallery director was the last person to see Kang Mi Na that day.

407
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,320
Let's go!

408
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,010
Will you be all right on your own?

409
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,840
If I won't, are you going to come along?

410
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,730
The hotel accident and the drugs, we still don't know who is behind all that.

411
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,230
It might be better to be careful, no?

412
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,650
Why are you staring at me like that?

413
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,270
Don't be too thankful.

414
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,380
 I'm someone who used to break three to six men on my own ... 

415
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,200
 ... this guy's going to be a burden. 

416
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,330
Yes. I won't be too grateful.

417
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,240
It seems like I keep thinking of you as Mi Na.

418
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,680
I'll try my best not to attract people's attention.

419
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,540
But ... will you really be all right going to the gallery?

420
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,690
You might have to lie to people you don't even recognise.

421
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,820
It's fine.

422
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,660
 I'm a con artist, after all. 

423
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,810
Where does all that confidence come from?

424
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,320
- She didn't come?
 - No, she didn't.

425
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,130
But I heard she came by yesterday.

426
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,760
She's not picking up her phone either, it's still the same.

427
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,400
What is she up to?

428
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,250
It's always the kids who are off to make trouble who drop off the face of this earth just before.

429
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,130
What if she really appears with Lee Bong Sik?

430
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,740
Hey! Are you really unable to reach Jo Yeon Ju?

431
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,230
I said I'll tell you if she contacts me!

432
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,260
No, apparently she was here yesterday, but now they're saying she's unreachable again!

433
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,890
What's up with her? Is she planning to make me look for her?

434
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,190
If she was here yesterday, she should come to work soon.

435
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm busy, I'll hang up.

436
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,050
Hey, wait— Hey!

437
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,200
   

438
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,050
Why did you take so many bribes, Nuna,

439
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,660
to make me come running here before the police arrive?

440
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,950
But what is going on with her, really?

441
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,050
 Nuna, there are weird rumors about you recently. 

442
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,000
 - What?
 - They call you the vacuum cleaner of Seopyeong or something. 

443
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,760
 A crazy prosecutor who sucks small change like dust. 

444
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,420
 I've succeeded. 

445
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,440
 What success? 

446
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,150
 Dude. I've thought about something after getting assigned here, after rolling around Seoul. 

447
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,710
 Is it easier for a prosecutor like me with no money nor connections to meet those high-placed old men up there, 

448
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,650
 or for those high-placed old men to come and meet me? 

449
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,800
 The latter's easier, unexpectedly. 

450
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,530
 Oh, really? 

451
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,590
 If an ordinary person wants to stand on higher ground, there's no choice but to stand out. 

452
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,970
 That's why I'm acting like a madwoman to the best of my abilities. 

453
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,540
 So you should stop looking for me, and stop eating with me. 

454
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,600
 You're going to be treated like a crazy kid too, if you hang around me. 

455
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,460
What kind of crazy stunt is she pulling now?

456
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,960
   

457
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,290
   

458
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,320
Who are you?

459
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm not a weird person! I just wanted to meet the chairwoman ...!

460
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,980
Then what's this?

461
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,390
Bluetooth earphones.

462
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,190
  Bluetooth earphones? This business hasn't made a profit in years,  

463
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,750
 but you want to do it again just by changing the name? Is there any point in doing that? 

464
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,660
I was notified all of a sudden this morning!

465
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,270
We were told to cancel all deliveries because the business deal wasn't going to proceed!

466
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,660
I came because we're on the brink of having to get rid of all the products already made!

467
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,760
This ... This has a new technology, it's completely different from the ones before!

468
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,400
I just wanted to hand this to you.

469
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,290
Still, you can't spring out at someone like this. You should go through the procedures—

470
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,140
The moment he starts the procedures, the contract would have been terminated.

471
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,720
Fine. Is it easier for a normal person to visit a rich chairwoman,

472
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,260
or for a chairwoman to go meet a normal person?

473
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,590
Unexpectedly, the latter's easier.

474
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,950
There are times when people who have nothing need to make a scene like this and to stand on higher ground.

475
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,740
Sir. I'll seek you out later.

476
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,300
Thank you! Thank you.

477
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,180
Still, you do need to go over procedures, so come along to the security team.

478
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,590
Are you all right? I think you collapse whenever you get a shock.

479
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,800
I did feel dizzy just then. I'm fine now.

480
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,630
But ... I've come to think of something, since these kinds of events keep happening.

481
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,460
Do you think that car accident was a first for Kang Mi Na?

482
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,650
I mean, if she was continually put through such events,

483
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,780
and if you think about how I can't find her despite using everything I have at my disposal,

484
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:47,130
it's either that she was kidnapped, or something worse happened. But ...

485
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,070
But?

486
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,170
Could it be that Kang Mi Na is hiding of her own free will?

487
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,300
What on earth are you talking about?

488
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:59,535
F-Father-in-law!

489
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:11,055
Hide? Who? Where?

490
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,210
   

491
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,260
You see, Father-in-law, I had so many things happen to me today.

492
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,430
A sub-contractor, who felt unfairly treated after I made  a level-headed decision

493
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,850
to reject a business plan, well, attacked me earlier!

494
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,160
Fortunately, I managed to avoid the situation, but in consideration of Yumin group's image

495
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,230
and Hanju Group's image as the group's daughter-in-law,

496
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,130
I was thinking about how to deal with this sub-contractor company, when suddenly,

497
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,940
I thought of our major shareholder Alex Chiang, who's spearheading social business establishments!

498
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,530
If it's a sub-contractor company, then it must be a for-profit enterprise.

499
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,690
So what does that have to do with social businesses?

500
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,740
That's it! I've been conversing with him, and it turns out there's nothing in common at all.

501
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,550
Ever since I hurt my head, he thinks maybe I'm too level-headed and working too much, unlike the past Kang Mi Na,

502
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,380
so he's been asking, out of concern for me, whether I should find the kind Kang Mi Na hidden deep inside me.

503
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,650
That's what he was saying.

504
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,010
There is talk about documents you've been sending back,

505
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,700
which were usually processed with just a signature from Chairman Kang.

506
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,890
Why are the rumors so fast?

507
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,770
Well, I don't necessarily have to do things like my father used to, do I?

508
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,090
Just because the chairwoman has the final decision,

509
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,400
doesn't mean everything should be done to your will.

510
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,080
It's true you've been injured, but don't you think you're going too far?

511
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,950
Why do you think this rumor spread?

512
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,380
Do you know how many people everywhere are talking about how weird you've gotten?

513
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,170
Father-in-law, how much do you know about me?

514
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,060
Humans are complex, multi-faceted beings.

515
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,410
Doesn't everyone say someone has changed if that person isn't like what they know?

516
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,980
Can't you just treat me for me? The present me?

517
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,050
And you, do you come running whenever Seong Wun's wife calls?

518
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,850
Let's finish the rest of our conversation upstairs.

519
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,680
Upstairs?

520
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,340
The stocks are going to plummet again,

521
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,940
since there are rumors of the new chairwoman being crazy.

522
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,580
Ah, stop it! Stop scaring me!

523
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,130
I don't know what discussion he wants, but go and have it.

524
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,810
It's always at times like these that you tell me to deal with it alone.

525
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,230
Earlier you were saying you think of me as Kang Mi Na and that we should go together!

526
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,560
No. You're different from Mi Na.

527
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,710
What. What. What is it now?

528
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,010
You're cooler than Mi Na.

529
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,350
Not that you would know that.

530
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,350
How am I cool?

531
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,240
What is he about to say?

532
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,960
You know I was investigated

533
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,120
regarding the National Tax Service lobbying case?

534
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,490
Yes.

535
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,440
Annoying things keep happening

536
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,110
despite the effort I'm putting in.

537
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,460
It's nothing much, but the Seopyeong prosecutors' office

538
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
has sent a summons for you.

539
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,100
It's because you were in charge

540
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,050
of the deals for our family's paintings.

541
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,540
Anyway, you'll have to make an appearance.

542
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,370
Father-in-law, it's hasn't even been ten minutes since you said I'm being thoughtless because of my head injury.

543
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,550
And you're telling me to go to the prosecutors' office?

544
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,510
I don't know anything! What am I supposed to do there?

545
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,630
You will pretend not to know anyway, so say you don't remember.

546
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,710
Even if they use a lie detector, you really don't remember,

547
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,220
so it might be an advantage now.

548
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,110
Here is the phone history of the perpetrator.

549
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,040
I can't tell if I'm the team leader of a legal team or

550
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,430
a private investigator's employee.

551
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,540
Why did you go there alone anyway?

552
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,800
It's not too great to just order people around.

553
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,790
Oh, so you know that?

554
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,660
Then ... Is my fashion sense not so great too?

555
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,190
Why? Did someone comment on it?

556
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,810
Is it the same person who said that ordering people around

557
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,940
isn't so great?

558
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,810
Yes.

559
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,040
Well, I don't know who it is, but you should get close to them.

560
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,010
I think they'll be a big help

561
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,030
to your style and your character.

562
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,070
Did you meet with that prosecutor you said you'd meet?

563
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,360
I couldn't get in touch with prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju.

564
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,410
So I'm asking around.

565
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,430
But I'm feeling uneasy.

566
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,570
I think she suddenly went under the radar.

567
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,260
Are you sure she's someone we can trust?

568
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,670
I heard a lot about her from juniors who were with her when she first started

569
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,850
at the Central Prosecutors' Office.

570
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,090
She was top of the class at the Training Institute and is notorious for her bad temper,

571
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,130
and she grew up dirt-poor and has no connections whatsoever.

572
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,450
Well, I heard she does well in court, though ...

573
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,350
But do you think that maybe Hanju did something ...

574
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,010
No way, right?

575
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,110
No way, they wouldn't go that far!

576
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,230
Anyway, it seems we need to seek out a different prosecutor.

577
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,260
How about that prosecutor who barged into Yumin chairwoman's room?

578
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,580
If he's that reckless, he must not be one to walk on eggshells.

579
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,450
It could be the other way around.

580
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,090
You think he could be one of the people who are after Kang Mi Na?

581
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,750
For now, I'll look into him.

582
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,080
Actually, let me go meet him.

583
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,060
- Young sister-in-law took the paintings? 
 - Yes.

584
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,820
She asked them to be sent to her room.

585
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,410
It didn't seem she had the paintings when the accident happened,

586
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,750
so we thought someone else took them.

587
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,780
You didn't know about this?

588
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,690
Why are  you reporting this to me this late?

589
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,520
- Did you use to work this way before, as well? 
 - No!

590
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,130
We reported everything about Madam Kang Mi Na before this.

591
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,550
We were just a bit distracted due to the accident and all.

592
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,450
I'm sorry, ma'am.

593
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,710
It seems that Sister-in-law will get a summons from the Seopyeon prosecutors' office because of those paintings.

594
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,780
It seems you will have to deal with a lot this time as well.

595
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,780
It was bothersome enough to answer all over the place a few years ago, thanks to that Lee Bong Sik ...

596
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,490
But what can I do?

597
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,480
I'll have to work hard so you can get some brownie points with the chairman.

598
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,240
Don't worry about me. If I am interrogated by the prosecution, I will do what I did last time,

599
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,170
and keep my mouth tightly shut for you.

600
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,330
As for Madam Kang Mi Na ... wait, no ...

601
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,770
Now it's Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

602
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,280
I know you'll have to watch your steps with her as well.

603
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,830
You monitoring her, and all such things,

604
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,500
I'll keep it a secret from Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

605
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,720
I wasn't talking about that.

606
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,660
Excuse me?

607
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,230
You've been working so hard for our family all this time.

608
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,910
Why don't you take a vacation while this is going on?

609
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,450
You know, before the prosecutors' office starts bothering you.

610
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,650
I'll clean up after you.

611
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,770
Is that what you meant?

612
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,130
Honestly, it really isn't easy to answer everyone.

613
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,740
Then go ahead. You deserve a rest.

614
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,380
Go get some fresh air ... while you're out there.

615
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,120
Thank you, ma'am.

616
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,510
He's telling me, who's not sound of mind, to go to Seopyeong?

617
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,780
Even if I'm a lion's cub, isn't it a bit much to kick me off a cliff like this?

618
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,240
Did Kang Mi Na actually deal in paintings?

619
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,110
Until three years ago, Managing Director Han Seong Hye was in charge of the deal to raise slush funds,

620
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,610
but after he got scammed by a swindler named Lee Bong Sik,

621
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,280
Ms Kang Mi Na was put in charge of it.

622
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,840
Damn it. What if I go to jail by saying something wrong?

623
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,850
Why do I have to clean up after Kang Mi Na's crap? Goddammit.

624
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,200
She might not have done the cr— ... that, because she wanted to.

625
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,170
And you are busy siding with her in the middle of all this.

626
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,000
You know what? If you can't find Kang Mi Na, find out who I am,  at least.

627
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,530
You said you're an American chaebol. You know, contact the FBI and get my fingerprints scanned.

628
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,650
- You can find out that way! 
 - FBI? Cut the nonsense.

629
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,390
Why would they scan a Korean citizen's fingerprints?

630
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,300
If you're so curious, go to a Korean police station and get them scanned.

631
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,020
Police station?

632
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,460
Oh, here we are. Let me out here.

633
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,820
Stay well hidden, all right?

634
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,690
If it's Seopyeong, could it be the prosecutor that I said I would meet before?

635
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,970
The office is pretty small, so there's a good chance it is.

636
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,390
We have to go meet that prosecutor quickly before she goes there for interrogation.

637
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,130
If that woman says something wrong, it won't be good for her.

638
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,200
Who are you worrying about?

639
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,740
For Kang Mi Na or ...?

640
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,670
What are you doing here, Sister-in-law?

641
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,480
Did Father tell you something?

642
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,520
Is it about the summons?

643
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,060
Yes, well, yes.

644
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,780
Too bad, you're a bit late.

645
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,850
I came to see if I could be of any help to you,

646
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,280
but the director must've smelled something was wrong,

647
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,090
so she went on a business trip to the U.S. this morning.

648
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,120
Really?

649
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,960
By the way,

650
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,770
I heard something weird.

651
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,760
The day you were in that accident,

652
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,910
you had bought paintings at the auction.

653
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,780
There was  a painting worth five billion won  (≈$4,200,000)  that we bought, and one worth 300 million won  (≈$250,000) 

654
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,660
that you bought yourself. They told me you took both of them with you.

655
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,510
What?

656
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,630
You didn't have the paintings when you had the accident, and didn't pass them to anyone else before either.

657
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,850
Apparently you told the director

658
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,780
to bring the paintings to you.

659
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,740
Before you lost your memory,

660
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,430
what do you think you did with those paintings?

661
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,670
What were you planning to do before the accident?

662
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,490
I would like to know that more than anybody else.

663
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,030
You should find your memory as soon as possible.

664
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,370
There must have been a mistake,

665
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,900
or you must've put them somewhere safe.

666
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,130
I made an excuse for you. You don't need to go in to fix anything.

667
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,240
Goodbye.

668
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,110
   

669
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,730
   

670
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,270
Yes?

671
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,640
Hello? Hello?

672
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,420
Hello?

673
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,360
 When he left the Hanju factory 

674
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,820
 he got a huge severance pay. 

675
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,240
 The morning of the accident, he said not to worry because there was money coming in soon. 

676
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,840
Hello?

677
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,460
What is it?

678
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,790
Did that guy answer the phone?

679
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,850
There's a problem.

680
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:36,500
Apparently I disappeared with two paintings, one worth 5 billion won and the other worth 300 million.

681
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,070
Apparently, Kang Mi Na said there was someone coming get the paintings that day.

682
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,270
What's up with this woman? What do I do?!

683
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,880
That's not the biggest issue right now.

684
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
There's no way there's a bigger issue!

685
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,440
It's not the time to talk about that.

686
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,450
What am I supposed to talk about? They said I fled with 5.3 billion won!

687
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,170
Just fill the measly 5.3 billion won with Kang Mi Na's money, or I can give it to you, too!

688
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,580
Unbelievable! The culture shock is no joke.

689
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,870
That's right. This is the chaebol world.

690
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,890
No wonder Managing Director Han Seong Hye didn't even ask for the money—

691
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,270
I think the accident you were in is related to Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

692
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,150
What?

693
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,090
The accident's perpetrator seems to be related to the Hanju group.

694
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,770
There's a phone call history with Managing Director Han Seong Hye.

695
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,480
They were aiming for Kang Mi Na.

696
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,200
But why?

697
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,740
She wasn't a chairwoman or anything back then, she probably just stayed at home.

698
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,520
Wait, so you're saying we're going to the person who tried to hit me with a car and kill me,

699
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,050
and to act normal and eat and sleep there?

700
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,440
I don't want to. I'm just going to run away.

701
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,790
- To where? 
 - Huh?

702
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:44,690
Hanju didn't look for Kang Mi Na because they didn't know she was gone. If you leave, they will find you no matter what.

703
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,790
Be careful, and let's keep an eye on the situation.

704
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,780
 It seems that Youngest Madam Kang Mi Na volunteered at a prison 

705
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,550
 and heard what the inmates were saying among themselves. 

706
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:13,960
 Since then, she had been looking into the fire incident 

707
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,030
 that happened 14 years ago at Hanju Fashion factory. 

708
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,220
 When did this start? 

709
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,680
 It seems it's been a while since she started researching. 

710
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,340
 Then how come she's been so quiet until now? 

711
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,880
 Is she planning to use it as a wild card one day? 

712
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,740
 Maybe she was planning on giving our weakness to her family in exchange for a divorce.  

713
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,750
 Sister-in-law doesn't understand the game well. 

714
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:41,230
 There are games you lose if you keep the wild card until the end. 

715
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,260
 Did she try to run away with the paintings because she knew things wouldn't go the way she wanted? 

716
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,370
 Who in the world has the paintings? 

717
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,770
- Managing Director, what about dinner? 
 - I don't feel like eating.

718
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,870
I thought you'd say that, so I bought some pastries.

719
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,100
I'm high maintenance, aren't I?

720
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,770
Not at all.

721
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,390
But this is me, fundamentally difficult.

722
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,570
Even if a person changes, the fundamentals aren't easy to change.

723
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,660
What do you think?

724
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,150
I don't understand.

725
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,780
There's this person I used to strongly dislike

726
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,670
because I couldn't tell what they were thinking at all.

727
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,780
But ...

728
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,160
 - Sister-in-law. 
 - You don't have to take it as an offense.  

729
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,010
 What I said is something I could totally say as a subordinate.  

730
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:36,550
  Who am I? Who am I? 

731
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,830
She changed that much?

732
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,630
You definitely said you checked the drug  test again, didn't you?

733
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,560
Yes. They said there was nothing detected.

734
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,180
Director Kim, it's me. Seong Hye.

735
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,210
What's for dinner?

736
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,420
Is it a good idea to knowingly crawl into the lion's den like this?

737
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,440
I don't think this is a good idea. I should go back and talk to them.

738
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,940
You're here.

739
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,730
Did you hear what I said?

740
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,480
I just came out. What would I have heard?

741
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,200
Do you think a rich person's house walls are so thin?

742
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,540
Did you eat dinner yet?

743
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,970
I'm all right.

744
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,590
Did you eat?

745
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,810
Regardless of whether I ate or not, I think the table should be set only once a day.

746
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:55,200
I was the one who did it before and I know how annoying it is to prepare food every time someone comes in.

747
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,890
- Come on in. 
 - All right!

748
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:08,590
It must be hard for Big Sister-in-law to do house work, when she's not used to it.

749
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,030
How does it taste?

750
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,910
Did she spit in this?

751
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,040
I made it. And I didn't spit in it.

752
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,760
It's delicious. Director Kim, you're the best as always.

753
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,770
Young Madam used to take cooking classes

754
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,630
before getting married, so working in the kitchen

755
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,340
isn't too strange for her.

756
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,410
As expected of a chaebol's daughter. It seems they're educated in everything before getting married.

757
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,850
Of course, I must've learned it too.

758
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:46,580
I must've forgot the cooking classes when I lost my memory.

759
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:50,470
It was hard starting house work at four in the morning,

760
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,070
but stamping approvals for documents at work is no joke either.

761
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,060
There seems to be no easy task in life.

762
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,060
You can just do what people tell you to do.

763
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,330
Sorry?

764
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,930
When someone prepares you a meal, you just have to eat it.

765
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,690
but you try to do the dishes too, so it's making you suffer.

766
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,150
Eat and leave it in the sink.

767
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,300
What the heck!

768
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,290
Why are you hiding here?

769
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,050
I wasn't hiding, I just came in.

770
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:48,050
I thought you'd be tired from your first day of work so I asked the hotel and brought some tarts.

771
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,610
I don't need them!

772
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,290
Don't worry, it's not walnuts. It's cheese.

773
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,220
I don't like pastries.

774
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,580
Really? You used to like them.

775
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,130
I don't like them anymore.

776
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:07,020
Then, what do you like now?

777
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,070
What ... do you mean?

778
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,700
I mean, I'll bring that next time.

779
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,000
- Hey! 
 - It's "Honey"!

780
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,810
Stop the silly game. Why are you suddenly acting all friendly?

781
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,250
Weren't we business partners in the first place?

782
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,440
Our  terms of contract changed, so I am adapting of course.

783
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,870
Don't be like that.

784
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,130
Good night, Honey.

785
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,980
Oh, gosh!

786
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,010
Eat this.

787
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,370
The whole family is a CCTV and now he's being all clingy.

788
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,590
Wait a minute.

789
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,380
 Don't worry, it's not walnuts, it's cheese. 

790
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,590
 Get it together! How can you eat this? 

791
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,510
Don't tell me ...

792
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,290
Hello?

793
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:13,630
It's me. Does Kang Mi Na have a nut allergy?

794
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,770
Yes. Even smelling them made her shiver.

795
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,210
But Director Kim gave me soybean noodles.

796
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,060
She's someone who would know Kang Mi Na has allergies.

797
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,320
Tomorrow tell her that you are sick from the noodles.

798
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,460
Avoid running into the other family members for the time being. I'm hanging up now.

799
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,350
All right.

800
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,340
You used to just appear like Superman when I didn't even call for you,

801
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,820
and now you just hang up as soon as you're done?

802
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,320
That's what I should have said, considering my character.

803
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,230
But instead I said "all right" and let him hang up.

804
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,930
 You're different from Mi Na. 

805
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,710
 You're cooler than Mi Na. 

806
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,930
 Not that you would know that. 

807
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,640
Don't. What are you remembering?

808
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,660
 She was like a speck of dust to her own family, her husband wasn't interested in her, and her friends were all checked. 

809
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,380
 It seems she never talked about herself to anyone. 

810
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,320
No!

811
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,890
When he seems cool, a double slap to my face will make me snap out of it.

812
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:35,400
But if he seems pitiful, it's game over.

813
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:42,370
What is this? Am I ... innocent?

814
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,610
A swindler who's innocent?

815
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,440
 What the heck! 

816
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,020
 Why are you hiding here!? 

817
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,200
See, that was almost like a "never been on a date before" kind of reaction.

818
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,220
This swindler is an innocent woman who's never dated anyone.

819
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:04,050
But who the heck and what kind of person is this chaebol's daughter-in-law?

820
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,710
It would've been better if we met outside.

821
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:21,290
A public prosecutor has no time to meet someone outside.

822
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,970
I have to see the data,  do research, do reports,

823
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,060
and write up decisions, and work on the statistics ...

824
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:32,890
I made time in the middle of my overtime work because you said it was information on Hanju Group.

825
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,320
So, what is it?

826
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,220
Remember there was a tip about the Hanju youngest madam, relating to drugs?

827
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,620
Yes, and ...?

828
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,570
Can you share who tipped you?

829
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:47,730
That incident has already been sent to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

830
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,890
You're not here to tip us, but get the tip?

831
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:55,430
I suspect there aren't many prosecutors who can charge in like that just based on a tip.

832
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:59,230
And also I heard you sent a warrant to the same person.

833
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,790
I wondered if you have some motive toward the Hanju Group.

834
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,990
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

835
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,790
I only went there about the drugs because of the tip,

836
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:15,490
and the warrant was sent to her as an important witness to the Tax Service Commissioner bribery case.

837
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,700
I'm just a common prosecutor.

838
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,940
There are not many "common" prosecutors these days, are there?

839
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,170
The person I want is also a "common" employee.

840
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:32,110
I don't know what you think a common prosecutor is, but we also consider performance, like with any other job.

841
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:36,240
So the common prosecutors spend all their time catching small thieves.

842
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,270
I guess you can take some time to catch a big thief once.

843
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:43,900
You would increase your performance greatly, and you might also imprison the thief.

844
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,520
I brought you this because I had a feeling you might have an interest in Hanju Group.

845
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,610
You seem busy, so I'll show myself out.

846
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,880
By the way, have we met somewhere?

847
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,790
I did some background check on you before you came.

848
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:12,950
Whether it's school, blood, or geographic proximity,

849
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:16,010
we have nothing in common.

850
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,810
Well, then.

851
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,250
He's the man who barged into the room and made a scene

852
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:33,150
saying it's an illegal arrest or whatnot, when we went to arrest Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

853
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,970
Oh, really?

854
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,990
What is it?

855
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:45,940
It's an old  case. It's a case related to the Hanju factory arson incident.

856
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,770
Hanju's eldest son died at that time, if I remember well.

857
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,770
It's that man's father.

858
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,960
Someone committed arson because they were fired and he died unluckily.

859
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:02,030
But then, this man is a family member of Hanju. Why would he bring this and say something like that?

860
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,050
Maybe he's like a Schrödinger's* person. 
  (famous quantum physicist) 

861
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,860
Shu ... shure what?

862
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,940
Schrödinger's Cat. Do you know it?

863
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,730
 Don't you know Schrödinger's cat? 

864
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:25,460
 Until you open the box, you can't tell if the cat in the box is alive or dead. 

865
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,970
 That world-wide famous cat. 

866
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,760
 I'm someone like that. 

867
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,010
 You can say I'm a Schrödinger's person. 

868
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,430
 You think that answers my question? 

869
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:41,050
 Do you really have to climb your way up by doing to someone else the same thing that your grandmother had to suffer? 

870
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,560
 It does answer your question. 

871
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:49,620
 Whoever this person is, we won't know if they are bad or good until we reach the end of the story. 

872
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,910
 Right before Grandmother passed away, 

873
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,740
 I cried next to her, saying I'm the reason she's dying. Guess what she said. 

874
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,730
   

875
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,940
 What did she say? 

876
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,300
 There is nothing that is 100% someone's fault in this world. 

877
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,890
 So, she said she didn't want me tormenting myself my whole life, doing nothing, just because of what happened that day. 

878
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,490
 There's nothing my memories of Grandmother will stop me from doing. 

879
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:22,750
 Therefore, you too, until the lid opens, you shouldn't judge 

880
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,120
 whether I'm a good or a bad person. 

881
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,890
I'm planning on leaving for a while.

882
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,210
You won't be able to reach me easily.

883
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:38,490
Of course! I'm going to have a good rest while I'm away.

884
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,370
All right, bye.

885
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,610
What's going on?

886
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,800
It's scaring me.

887
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,020
My goodness.

888
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,060
I took care of the director,

889
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:07,520
and the gallery will be sold to a suitable buyer once we find one.

890
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,260
People are so foolish.

891
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,660
They keep crossing the line, thinking I'm not angry just because I'm not expressing it.

892
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,570
Lowly people like her are not worthy of my anger.

893
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:24,770
I have plenty of lowly assistants I can replace them with anytime I need to.

894
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,620
Don't you think?

895
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,100
But they feel cocky, when they are just small fish.

896
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,500
They think "I am somebody."

897
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,660
Well, if that kind of thought starts to enter their minds,

898
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,340
they have to dig deeper and think harder.

899
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,780
So that they aren't engulfed by that thought.

900
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:09,200
Oh, Ms. Kang Mi Na!

901
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,320
I'm about to forget what you look like.

902
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,020
I mean ... If that's the case, you must have a memory problem.

903
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,320
Should I put up a photo on the wall or something?

904
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,890
How dare you treat me as if I'm crazy like you?

905
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,510
I'm asking why we don't get a glimpse of you, when you don't even go to work!

906
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:32,560
I just haven't been feeling too good after eating the soybean noodle yesterday.

907
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,810
Are you crazy?

908
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:39,710
Why did you feed her soybean noodles!?

909
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,590
Mother!

910
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,220
Are you all right, Hyeong-nim*?
 (address for an elder sister-in-law) 

911
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:58,370
I've seen this happen to you numerous times. I expected it.

912
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:02,850
Will you take responsibility if something happens to her, without her even dying, and the stocks drop?

913
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,750
You blocked my son's future and caused his death. Your family makes the exact same business plans every time

914
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:11,140
and blocks our family's future. So frustrating!

915
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:19,220
Mother! Even if you are taking it out on her instead of me, isn't that a bit too far?

916
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,630
Hey, I didn't even say it to you. Why are you butting in?

917
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,800
And all that temper ... Now I'm starting to think you're faking your sickness too.

918
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,970
 Fake? 

919
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:33,180
You just come at me whenever I speak. What, are you a gangster?

920
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,910
 Gangster! 

921
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,580
Why aren't you responding? Huh?

922
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,500
I'm sorry, ma'am.

923
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,270
I'm the one who gave her the soybean noodles. Not the young madam.

924
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,840
I think I forgot because of my old brain.

925
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:54,140
Ajumma, you'll be misunderstood as an Alzheimer's patient if you make mistakes because of your age.

926
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,990
- Please be careful. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

927
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,910
Youngest Madam. I think it'd be best if you don't eat today.

928
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,170
- Go upstairs. 
 - Huh?

929
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:11,360
Right. You said you had to go in to the prosecutor's office too.

930
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,240
A person like you who has so much energy should go there looking like skin and bones.

931
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,750
It turned out well.

932
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:30,820
Director Kim. I'm sorry for the trouble I put you through because of my request yesterday.

933
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,270
It's something I do all the time. Don't worry about it.

934
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,530
How is my youngest sister-in-law doing?

935
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,580
It was some time ago ...

936
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,630
Yes?

937
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:49,250
Your mother,  just as you did,

938
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,820
gave orders to serve the youngest madam a dish with peanuts in it.

939
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,850
I wasn't home at the time, so another employee gave it to her.

940
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:01,380
"I wonder how bad the nut allergy of hers is. Would she die?"

941
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,880
"Or wouldn't she?"

942
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,640
I think that's what she wanted to find out.

943
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,790
At that time, Youngest Madam still had her memory,

944
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:13,670
so she could've stopped if she felt something wrong,

945
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:19,200
but now that she has no memory, she'd still eat even if something felt wrong.

946
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:25,760
Would you have been all right if something happened to her?

947
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,160
What are you trying to say?

948
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:38,780
So, when you told me to make the soybean soup with peanuts for the youngest madam,

949
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:44,000
I took out the nuts ingredients and used 100% beans.

950
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,550
I don't care whatever you do for work outside,

951
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,510
but don't drag that fight into the house.

952
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:05,750
However, the youngest madam said she felt ill from eating the noodles.

953
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,850
Strange, isn't it?

954
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,050
Even though she was such a witch and told me to starve,

955
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:25,670
I couldn't even respond because I really am a gangster and a fraud.

956
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:26,690
I'm bursting with anger, damn it.

957
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,390
Sister-in-law.

958
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,920
Yes, Hyeong-nim?

959
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,250
I didn't know you thought of me so much.

960
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,590
It's not really that ... I just have a bad temper.

961
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:41,540
Even then, you are the only one in this house who openly sided with me,

962
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,710
who suddenly became a kitchen maid.

963
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:50,130
Now that Seon Wu gets the picture, he checks his grandma's mood first.

964
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,500
- Hyeong-nim! 
 - What?

965
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,810
To be honest,  you're not my type of person,

966
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,700
but I still see your tenacity to endure this household ...

967
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:04,330
It's not like you are completely devoid of capability. Do you have to live here?

968
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:08,270
You could ask your own family for a subsidiary. They are big as well.

969
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:10,680
You heard Mother-in-law yourself earlier.

970
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,680
Between my own family's and Hanju's business,

971
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,940
the size, and the agendas of both businesses overlap too much.

972
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,280
Because of that, I'm considered like a spy over there as well.

973
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,120
I have my own reasons.

974
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,030
I see.

975
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:31,750
By the way, I was closely watching your every move ...

976
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:36,680
- Yes? 
 - I think this is the best time to ask you.

977
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,280
A few years ago, I found this investment opportunity

978
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,760
so I can prepare for my future on my own.

979
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,700
It's called a Chaebol Business Fund.

980
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,530
Only a few qualified people can invest in it.

981
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,750
It's always better to have more money to invest.

982
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:01,390
Can you invest in me?

983
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,370
- Hyeong-nim! 
 - What?

984
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,700
When you are listening to a description and it sounds too good to be true,

985
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,860
it's definitely a scam.

986
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,640
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?

987
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,890
So, when you tried to get your money back,

988
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:18,290
they said they'll move you up in priority if you put more money in, isn't that right?

989
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,410
Those sorts of tricks are coming to mind.

990
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,590
N-N-No, it's not!

991
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,360
It's a small private thing among people who know each other.

992
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:31,820
Privately, among people who know each other. That's exactly what an in-law family feels like.

993
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,990
What are you talking about?

994
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,500
I guess it could be all right.

995
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,340
But in most cases it's not. Get out of there now, Hyeong-nim.

996
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:44,450
It-It's not like you scammed someone before. How would you know?

997
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,350
You're right.

998
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,610
You can just say you don't want to invest. Why speak ill of it?

999
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:57,020
If I do it ... What are you going to do for me?

1000
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,440
Well, I won't just sit by.

1001
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,720
In that case, tell them I'll invest.

1002
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,400
and use that as bait and get yourself to the front line!

1003
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,590
And leave as soon as you get your money back.

1004
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,490
Leave?

1005
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,910
It's a scam! I'm telling you!

1006
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:18,660
If something is really profitable, people do it alone. That's just the way it is.

1007
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,340
If you don't want Mother-in-law to take out her anger on you, what do you have to do?

1008
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,640
You can get even angrier than her!

1009
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,370
In that vein, to not get scammed, you have to scam them harder.

1010
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,550
All right.

1011
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:34,590
Also, promise me, this is just between the two of us. A secret.

1012
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,880
Why am I so knowledgeable in this?

1013
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,830
Did I really scam people with such lowly methods?

1014
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,470
Damn it ...

1015
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:10,990


1016
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,800
   

1017
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,940
   

1018
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,500
   

1019
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,640
   

1020
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,350
 - Say something. 
 - What do you have to say? 
- Why did you do it?  

1021
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,080
   

1022
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,040
 - Congratulations! 
 - Happy birthday! 

1023
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,530
 Getting together and having dinner for my birthday ...  Isn't it about time for you to go now? 

1024
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,340
 Why do you keep trying to kick me out? 

1025
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,430
 How much has a married woman been hanging around with her cousin-in-law, who lives alone, for dirty tabloids to go around? 

1026
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,600
 Who is in charge of keeping track of Chairwoman Kang Mi Na? 

1027
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,250
 Why are you here? 

1028
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,170
 Do you know me? 

1029
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:31,240
 It was always Hyeong-nim who tried to tie me down. 

1030
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,200
 I tried to look at you in a good light, but don't you think you've changed too much? 

1031
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,680
 This is a magic powder. 

1032
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,470
 Who told you it was a magic powder? 

1033
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:42,590
 You had your fingerprint registered on the tablet that you carry around. 

1034
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,240
 Unlock it. Right here.

 ♫ as a motorcycle  ♫ 

1036

1037
