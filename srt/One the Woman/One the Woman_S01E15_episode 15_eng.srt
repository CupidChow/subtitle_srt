1
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,800
I think there's some sort of misunderstanding.

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,810
Then eat.

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm telling you to eat that.

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,810


5
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,560
This is no fun. Shall we stop?

6
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,200
This is the genetics test that I ran with your hair.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,820
Are you here to get revenge or something?

8
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,740
Do you still think I'm bad?

9
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,990
Who's the one who has been tricking me?!

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,180
 This horrible life is over now. 

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,450
 Say that again. What did you just say?  

12
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,830
 Do you have emotions?  

13
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,610
 At times, I get goosebumps looking at you. 

14
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,250
 Sister-in-law, what will you do if his actions create a child outside somewhere? 

15
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,390
 Did I know they'd push a child born illegitimately into our house? 

16
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,220
 My face just needs to be completely different. 

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,090
 A face that nobody will recognize as mine ... a completely new face. 

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,820
 Starting today, she will assist you in my absence. 

19
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,510
 I'm Kim Eun Jeong. 

20
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,700
 Give both that and this sample to my assistant, Jeong Do Wu, outside. 

21
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,870
 "... they're biologically related" 

22
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,650
 "with 99.9999% certainty." 

23
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,340
She just left. Catch her.

24
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,310
Where are you going?

25
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,360
What's wrong? Oh, you're not well it seems.

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,210
What are you doing? You should help her.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,940
Where are you hurt?

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,990
Run away, quickly!

29
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,020
Ah, really ...

30
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,530
Get in, Ms. Kang Mi Na!

31
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,490
What's happening?

32
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,860
For now, we need to confirm something.

33
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,900
What is that thing which Director Kim hides in the ceiling of the Chairman's kitchen

34
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,720
and forbids everyone to touch?

35
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,950
The Myeongdong Taeyang-cho pepper powder?

36
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,010
You really are Kang Mi Na!

37
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,650
- You're the one who sent Han Seung Wuk the USB, right?
 - Yes.

38
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,260
After that, you should have fled! It's the basics of all espionage. Why did you stay?

39
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,260
There's something people don't know about Han Seong Hye yet. I need to reveal that too—

40
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,100
Damn it, those bastards.

41
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,930
Let's wait a moment. Han Seung Wuk said he's coming.

42
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,820
How did you know enough to come here?

43
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,070
 That woman is nearby Han Seong Hye. 

44
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,110
 Right after the accident, is there someone new who showed up around Han Seong Hye? 

45
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,530
 What is it. 

46
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,270
 I think there's a new female secretary? 

47
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,220
 - Secretary?
 - Yes. 

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,470
 Yeah, Yu Jun? 

49
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,740
 I had someone tailing the Samgeori gang, 

50
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,160
 and apparently a few of them are heading to Hanju with weapons. 

51
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,690
 What? Yes, all right. 

52
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,480
 Han Seong Hye's gang is heading toward Hanju's company. 

53
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,160
 Maybe something happened after we left? 

54
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,330
 - Let's head over first.
- I call my uncles, too. 

55
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,360
I should have gone in, but he insisted that he knew the building's layout better.

56
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,230
- It will be okay. 
 - Pardon?

57
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,540
Oppa is different from what he seems.

58
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,580
O-Oppa?

59
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,860
Was it you who disrupted things?

60
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,330
Turn yourself in. Please.

61
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,640
My dad, Yeon Ju, her grandma, Lee Bong Sik, Jang Seok Ho,

62
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,620
how much further are you going to go?

63
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,880
Don't you feel anything even after hearing those names?

64
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,460
What comes next could be names that you recognize.

65
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,430
- I'm not going to be fooled twice. 
- Like your father?

66
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,570
You're not my family. The law is wasted on something like you.

67
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,730
That "family" you keep bringing up.

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,220
Let me warn you as your "family" then. Stop interfering and stay put.

69
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,100
Han Seong Hye. Han Seong Hye!

70
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,070
Even if he fights well, people who don't know what fighting is, tend to forget

71
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,760
that a person can't fight at full strength for more than five minutes.

72
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,570
Why do you think there's a timer in boxing matches?

73
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,820
No. I think I should check inside.

74
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,550
Don't come out at any time. All right?

75
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,600
Hello! We'll soon start liking each other because of how often we see one another!

76
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,430
But you're alone. Where's that wench you were with?

77
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,770
Run away!

78
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,190
- We've got you. 
- Stop running off!

79
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,850
Where do you think you're going?!

80
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,220
Mi Na!

81
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,350
That's a perfect handle to grab.

82
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,490
Kang Mi Na.

83
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,540
Mi Na ... Come to your senses!

84
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,130
Mi Na ... Kang Mi Na!

85
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,810
Yeah, welcome. I'm Prosecutor Jo Yeong Ju, Central District. Grab them all.

86
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,380
Get those who are escaping! Quickly!

87
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
What are you doing?

88
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,800
   

89
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,850
   

90
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,250
- What happened? 
- Her arrest warrant was issued, so we can't get her out.

91
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,600
- Even though Kang Mi Na appeared? 
- It's because she's in such a state!

92
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,340
Han Seong Hye claims that she was protecting Kang Mi Na, and that Jo Yeon Ju kidnapped her.

93
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,730
So this is now getting more complicated.

94
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,610
How is she?

95
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,360
She still isn't regaining consciousness.

96
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,490
Fortunately, Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun was heading that way,

97
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,330
so the entire Samgeori gang was taken to Seopyeong. But ...

98
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,400
 That's what I'm saying, Prosecutor! When we were with Prosecutor Jo Yeong Ju at Seopyeong, 

99
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,540
 we held a huge grudge! That's why we took revenge, even though it's long overdue. 

100
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,500
 What grudge do you guys hold? 

101
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,360
 Why shouldn't we have grudges? We're all Seopyeong gang members, aren't we? 

102
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,710
 They bribed her, so she looked after the Nammun gang. 

103
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,950
 But we didn't bribe her, so she always overlooked our Samgeori gang! 

104
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,810
 Would people hold a grudge for that or not? Of course they would! 

105
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,800
 I'm still very upset ... very upset. 

106
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,580
So Managing Director Han Seong Hye managed to escape again,

107
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,400
and Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju is left hanging out with gang members again!

108
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,540
Don't you think you should flee to the States?

109
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,490
No, I can't. That woman, Han Seong Hye, is completely mad.

110
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,220
As well as all those she has already killed, I think she'll continue to remove anyone in her way!

111
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,790
She can't be left alone.

112
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,300
I'm going to be driven to madness.

113
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,210
Who is that woman? Why did Yeon Ju tell us to stand guard?

114
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,860
Who is she? Even the chaebol-guy rushed to save her

115
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,720
when Yeon Ju was being arrested.

116
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,560
We're Yeon Ju's uncles. Should we be staying still?

117
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,700
Oh, that damn "chaebol," "chaebol"!

118
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,120
Stop interfering with the kids' problems! They'll figure it out on their own!

119
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,390
But Yeon Ju was dragged to the police station, and apparently she's suspended too!

120
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,150
No matter how bad we treated him, should he be treating Yeon Ju that way? What kind of a person—

121
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,790
You've come out here.

122
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,390
Excuse me ...

123
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes, Uncle? What is ...

124
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,210
That's ... I never had the chance to talk to you about it before,

125
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,160
but I feel like I've made a lot of mistakes in the past.

126
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,820
If you felt offended, I sincerely apolo—... I mean, I'm sorry.

127
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,010
Not at all! I don't think that way.

128
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,170
That's such a relief, si—... I mean, that's nice.

129
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,800
My hyeong-nim also has something to—

130
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,030
What are you doing?

131
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,440
Go on ...

132
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,960
 There's something people don't know about Han Seong Hye yet. 

133
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,350
  I need to reveal that too— 

134
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,680
Yes, good work.

135
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,060
All right, then ...

136
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,590
In this present situation, where the probability that Kang Mi Na fled overseas is the highest,

137
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,390
Yumin suddenly announced a DNA test.

138
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,370
Gosh, can we stop now?

139
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,370
It was already announced that she's the biological daughter, why are they being weird?

140
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,860
They said they're that trying to calm the controversy.

141
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,240
But, that real one, was found to be fake.

142
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,860
This is either because Yumin already knew that the fake was a fake,

143
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,870
or that the results were actually about

144
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,430
the fake one hiding the real one.

145
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:04,390
Then, the culprit who was hiding the real Kang Mi Na

146
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,190
is ...

147
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,480
Look here, President Kang Eun Hwa. What are you plotting?

148
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,640
Your niece, Second Daughter-in-law. Where is she?

149
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,260
What are you talking about?

150
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,720
Did you think that I wouldn't know if you pretended?

151
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,690
Where is Kang Mi Na?

152
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,260
Why are you yelling so vulgarly?

153
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,210
Also, why are you suddenly fussing about something that's one step behind?

154
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,490
I'm "one step behind"? How so?

155
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,720
Don't you even watch the news? I'm on my way there after hearing it.

156
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,360
 Regarding the case of a prosecutor posing as a chaebol, Yumin Group's Kang Mi Na 

157
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,170
 has since shown up after being missing. 

158
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:01,120
 It has been revealed that Kang Mi Na underwent plastic surgery and has been protected by President Han Seong Hye. 

159
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,090
 Through fingerprints and biometric tests, Chairwoman Kang Mi Na's identity has been confirmed. 

160
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,130
Oh my god ... that ...

161
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,300
Isn't that Eonni's secretary?

162
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,460
Han Seong Hye's secretary?

163
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,520
Are you saying that's Han Seong Hye's secretary? Since when did she take her in?

164
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,050
It has been ... a while.

165
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,190
Then Han Seong Hye had Kang Mi Na with her,

166
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,830
but screwed me over? She planned it with Han Seung Wuk?

167
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,550
Look over here! Your eldest is a psycho.

168
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,620
She completely played me!

169
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,270
Oh my. Why are you yelling?

170
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,660
- What are you saying? 
 - So vulgar.

171
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,520
Why suddenly make a fuss after you've already been screwed over?

172
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,560
How are things even running right now?

173
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,200
Are you a gangster or something?

174
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,660
You magically created a crime I didn't commit and put me in jail.

175
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,900
You say you're a Prosecutor, but you're more like a magician.

176
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,230
Just hurry and send me to the Central Office.

177
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,160
Don't leave me to be tossed around at the police station.

178
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,010
What should I do about this?

179
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,750
Since you are no longer a Grade 4 Civil Servant,

180
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,950
you'll be investigated in jail.

181
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,590
What?

182
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,360
Have you given her anything?

183
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,900
Individual rights are all the rage right now.

184
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,040
Order some sundae gukbap* for her. 
  (Sausage and rice soup) 

185
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,040
What is this?

186
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,060
   

187
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,070
   

188
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,790
What do you think it is? It's an official note for a change in personnel.

189
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,910
Ah ... I should've filtered those with problematic backgrounds.

190
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,710
Finally, things are now in order at the prosecution office.

191
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,860
So are you saying that I'm fired as a prosecutor?

192
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,460
And I got fired with just an official notice?

193
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,430
What kind of **** bullshit is this?

194
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,190
What's so bad about my origins?

195
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,560
How long do I have to live with people asking,

196
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,860
"What does your father do?"

197
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,760
What gives you the right to be yelling?

198
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,420
Hey! A suspended prosecutor who is dragged to the police station because of violence, should know to have some shame!

199
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,870
What did I do wrong?

200
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,300
It was 17-to-1, yet I beat all the gangsters threatening the nation's lives and property.

201
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,900
I subdued them all without getting hurt in any way.

202
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,450
The least you could do is to record me in prosecution history as the one who caught gangsters. Instead, you fire me!

203
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,510
You punk, your conduct is stirring up trouble!

204
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,040
In the Republic of Korea, a good prosecutor stirs up trouble. Do some people still not know that?

205
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,140
Don't you know? Is there anyone who doesn't know?

206
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,280
But why was I the only one fired?

207
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,730
The prosecutor who committed sexual harassment is living well. He was even promoted the fastest.

208
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,540
You were also featured on the newspaper's front page.

209
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,760
But was I the only one fired? Why just me?

210
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,500
Why? Was your father some great person?

211
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,170
You know the prosecutors' personnel information well.

212
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,170
Sure you're right. We aren't the important ones.

213
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,570
It's important who is on which side.

214
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,430
So, if you wanted life to be comfortable, you should have aligned with a chaebol too.

215
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,400
Let me give you some advice as someone who has lived life longer than you.

216
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
Don't act up anymore.

217
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,960
Forget it so just leave, Mister.

218
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,130
Wh-What? M-Mister?

219
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,220
When I was a prosecutor, I always replied with "Yes, I'll do it" whenever you spoke.

220
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,230
Now that I've been fired ...

221
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,170
Now, you're just a "mister" I know.

222
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,190
Your life and my life are on different levels.

223
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,240
Just because you lived a bit longer doesn't mean you're wiser, so just leave.

224
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,130
M...is...ter.

225
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,740
Hey! Once you get out, those a lot younger than you will call you Oppa.

226
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,180
Cancel the sundae gukbap order.

227
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,310
What nonsense.

228
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,640
Get back safe, Mister!

229
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,430
I won't walk you out too far, Mister! Mister!

230
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,150
Damn this ...

231
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,460
I was thinking of dragging her here,

232
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,210
but suddenly the police barged in and some guys got involved.

233
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,040
The situation has been twisted.

234
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,120
Yes, once the hospital dies down, we'll take care of it.

235
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,140
  Got it.  

236
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,970
What is this rude wench?

237
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,840
It's only times like this that I miss Do Wu ... so degrading.

238
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,380
 Hanju Group has called an emergency board meeting 

239
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,010
 and Hanju Hotel's Han Seong Hye has been appointed President. 

240
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,970
 Chairman Han Yeong Sik, who is currently in prison, has stepped down as Honorary Chairman. 

241
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:28,670
 To normalize the situation, it seems that Hanju Group has officially begun its third-generation management system. 

242
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,730
Is there absolutely no way of getting Yeon Ju out?

243
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:39,310
We were going to claim that it was a one-sided gang assault on their part.

244
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,470
We thought that saying gangsters had assaulted a prosecutor would provide extenuating factors.

245
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,870
- But? 
 - It didn't work.

246
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,610
Why?

247
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,210
 Prosecutor Jo's defense is claiming 

248
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,150
 that it was a one-sided assault by gangsters. 

249
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,380
 It was 17-to-1, yet I beat all the gangsters threatening the nation's lives and property. 

250
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,780
 I subdued them all without getting hurt in any way. 

251
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,650
 Unlike what her defense claimed, Prosecutor Jo herself said 

252
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,180
 that she beat the gangsters in a 17-to-1 fight by herself, 

253
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,750
 and that she wasn't hurt at all. After the video of her strong claim was made public, 

254
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,250
 she began stirring up trouble again. 

255
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,320
It will be hard for her to just get out. We'll have to use a backdoor.

256
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,280
She's a target of public hate right now.

257
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,010
Will using connections to get her out be all right?

258
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,650
If everyone in the country is cursing you, at least there won't be more people joining the party.

259
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,620
I don't know. I didn't see it.

260
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,020
- You saw it! 
 - You saw it as well!

261
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,340
An "Honorary Chairman"? How dare you say that!

262
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,990
What were you doing while the Board of Directors' meeting was happening?

263
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,510
There's a way for me to get out of here soon, so you have to work hard until then.

264
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,120
Me? What can I do?

265
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,680
It's hard for me to get out of here quickly since people's eyes are watching.

266
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,990
So until then, I'm going to gather my people and manage the business from prison.

267
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,520
As long as you stay sharp, it's possible.

268
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,220
You will have to deliver my opinions to here and there instead of me.

269
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,730
Managing a business from prison ...

270
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,630
 Is it something like a prince regent? 

271
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,050
 By selling less-performing businesses, 

272
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,310
 we'll merge and abolish poor-performing divisions ... 

273
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,130
 - And let's downsize the organization— 
 - Wait! 

274
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,690
 There's a reason why I didn't downsize the organization. 

275
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,850
 But if you say something like that, then what should I do? 

276
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,990
 I didn't know you were thinking that way ... 

277
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,380
 The head of the group shouldn't give an excuse, 

278
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,870
 - but should say to everything, "It's all my responsibility!" 
 - Yes, sir. 

279
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,970
 Everything is my father's responsibility. 

280
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,340
 I'm not saying it's my responsibility, but yours. 

281
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,020
 It's my responsibility. 

282
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,680
  If I keep doing this, the end result will be ...  

283
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,280
 Bring the rice chest! 

284
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,000
 Father, Your Majesty! Please reconsider this! 

285
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,520
Please reconsider this, Your Majesty!

286
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,120
Father, I don't think I'm capable of this.

287
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,970
What? You're such a fool!

288
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,650
- Also, we don't know how long you're here, so let's avoid any hasty decision—
 - Why?

289
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,490
Do you think that I can't get out of here?

290
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,820
Seong Hye's life is in my hands, and she's the only one who doesn't know about it.

291
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,410
Aigoo, aigoo!

292
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,640
Why are you refusing when everything just rolled into your hands?

293
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,700
Managing a business from prison just means doing what your father says!

294
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,870
I hate that! I don't want to do it!

295
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,210
This is not just about your life!

296
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,840
What about the rest of your family and me? Why don't you want to do it?

297
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,510
Mom, stop it! Do you think it's easy to do what someone tells you to do 24/7?

298
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,410
Since we're on this topic, you should stop carting me around as if I'm your maid.

299
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,020
That's right! It's already hard to do what you're told to do.

300
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,810
But Father says he has something that will drag Seong Hye down.

301
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,920
Shouldn't he do that on his own? Why does he want to put me in the middle?

302
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
I don't want to take anybody's side.

303
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,420
You're such a fool.

304
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,300
- Don't you have any ambition? Don't you have your own thoughts? 
 - No.

305
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,700
I don't. I just want to live quietly.

306
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,680
I don't want to end up like Hyeong.

307
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,100
What did he say?

308
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,770
What does that mean?

309
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,370
  Do you remember this?  

310
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,750
 Do you believe this could only happen to your Hyeong Seong Chan? 

311
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,480
Oh, you're home.

312
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,800
Aren't you coming into the hotel at all?

313
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,920
Can I come to the hotel?

314
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,510
If people hear you say that, they will think I'm a bad person.

315
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,480
Do you think I have time to manage every little thing?

316
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,410
What's wrong with you?

317
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,110
Don't just go around saving yourself, you should also help your father!

318
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,390
What can I do?

319
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,540
Do you think I don't know that you're choosing not to do anything?

320
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,210
Your father has something up his sleeve.

321
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,260
I don't think he's just saying it to scare you.

322
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,420
Does he?

323
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,540
Avoid getting punished later and pretend to help him, at least for now.

324
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,330
What are you going to do?

325
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,710
Father was never on my side for my entire life.

326
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,820
- But why are you asking me to be generous now? 
 - "Generous"?

327
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,790
What kind of attitude is this!

328
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,860
Well, I don't know.

329
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,580
Why don't you think about it, Mom?

330
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,470
I spent my whole life figuring out what was on my father's mind.

331
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,670
Is it hard for you to guess my thinking this once?

332
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,930
How dare she ...

333
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,800
     

334
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,830
I revealed the real Kang Mi Na on purpose.

335
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,600
The reporters are all at the hospital, so nobody will do something to her that easily.

336
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,160
But when I drove Kang Mi Na in the car that time,

337
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,570
she said that there's something more about Han Seong Hye that all of us don't know.

338
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,460
- Are you saying there are additional crimes? 
 - I think so.

339
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,060
But what can I do while I'm in here?

340
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,450
You'll be out soon before you're sent to the prosecution.

341
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,140
How?

342
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,610
 Did she cut her jawline? 

343
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,170
 Where did she do it? 

344
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,170
 She's neither alive nor dead. 

345
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,350
 - It's nothing different from being a zombie. 
 - I have a favor to ask you. 

346
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,250
 "A favor to ask"? Excuse me. 

347
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:04,290
 Why would I listen to a favor from you when you were going to take our Yumin Group with a fake? 

348
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:10,110
 I will give you all my authority that was delegated by the last shareholders' meeting. 

349
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,520
 If it's that much of a favor, I'll do it for you. 

350
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,810
 Now there's no damage to you, right? 

351
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,520
 Then please drop the charges against Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju. 

352
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,380
 If you want a settlement, I'll do whatever you want. 

353
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,810
 Please make sure to set Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju free. 

354
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,670
 Sure! 

355
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,560
Did you give all of your authority to that woman?

356
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,190
That's not important right now. Han Seong Hye is out of control.

357
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,930
You have to come out soon and stop her. You have to put her in jail!

358
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,990
But ...

359
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,210
I was fired from being a prosecutor.

360
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,680
What?

361
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,260
About Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju,

362
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,070
we had to release her since the Yumin Group withdrew the charges against her.

363
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,330
We couldn't help it since Yumin put more pressure on us about it.

364
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,460
It might be easier for me to take action when she's out in the world.

365
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,420
But the police barged in with bad timing.

366
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,910
N-No, but ...

367
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,960
if we hadn't caught her at that time, it might have been different.

368
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,790
Jo Yeon Ju has the power of many people,

369
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,890
so had the police not arrived, she might have gotten out of control.

370
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,880
I think that it was perfectly timed when the police went in.

371
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,050
- I guess you are bewildered since the evidence from 14 years ago is now useless. 
 - Excuse me?

372
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,350
An outside executive position at Hanju Group ...

373
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,550
How can I give it to someone with such ability?

374
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:07,130
I think an appreciation plaque will do, since you've worked hard until now.

375
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,070
My goodness ...

376
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,680
- Is it this Monday? I heard about personnel changes in the senior prosecutors.
 - So suddenly?

377
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,940
I guess there's going to be another storm. I heard the majority of them will be demoted.

378
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,600
Hey, Mister! Where have you been?

379
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,660
What's wrong with your face? Are you coming from the Hanju Group? What did they say?

380
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,150
They're not making you an executive anymore, are they?

381
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,830
It was you, wasn't it?

382
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,470
You're the one who sneaked in like a mouse and stole the USB.

383
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,950
Do you have any evidence?

384
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,400
Stop bluffing.

385
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,760
Who do you think will be screwed more?

386
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,830
Do you think something will immediately happen to me because of that USB?

387
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,040
You know this scene well. A blink of an eye can overturn the mainstream power.

388
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,350
We don't even know what will happen to chaebols as that depends on the government. But, me?

389
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,460
I can get back up quickly if I make the right connections again.

390
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,040
Have you ever seen a high-ranking prosecutor getting screwed over?

391
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,030
Do you think that I'll go down like this now?

392
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,030
If you don't go down now, you'll go down later.

393
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,710
I'll keep attacking you until you go down.

394
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,440
Why are you doing this to me?

395
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,350
I said this before, but your father turned himself in—

396
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:38,670
Do you think I'm doing this just because of that fire incident?

397
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,400
The accident that Han Seong Hye had that day, the car accident,

398
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,180
my grandmother passed away from that accident you overlooked.

399
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,120
What?

400
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,280
Why? Did I say this too calmly?

401
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,770
Then did you think I'd say it while my eyes glaring, hands shaking, and crying out loud?

402
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,260
Those days passed a long time ago.

403
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,640
For years, I was looking at your face day and night

404
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,870
and thinking, "When will I take off that mask?"

405
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,010
For one thousand—... One million times,

406
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,340
I thought about it over and over again.

407
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:27,550
Who do you think fights the best in this world?

408
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,870
It's the one who takes off their badges to fight.

409
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,850
There's nothing for me to be embarrassed about or nothing for me to lose!

410
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:39,020
But you took off my prosecutor's badge, Mister.

411
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,460
You haven't paid for anything yet, so be prepared.

412
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,200
I'll make you pay for what you did. I'll file administrative litigation and come back here,

413
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,750
so you just stay right there and wait,

414
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,980
M...is...ter.

415
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm leaving!

416
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,460
How dare she keep calling me Mister?

417
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,940
You'll be an old woman if you take off your makeup!

418
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,670
This administrative litigation loses 100%!

419
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,280
I should've said that after reading a book. I shouldn't have said it first.

420
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,160
What is it?

421
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,070
I'm sorry. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be cornered like this.

422
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,770
No, it's fine! It's not a big deal to lose the prosecutor's position.

423
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,390
It has no impact on me! You can tell just by looking at me.

424
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:48,280
I guess you can't tell. But it's really okay! I can work as a lawyer.

425
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,160
It doesn't suit me, I guess. I can't defend those criminals.

426
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,940
It suits me better to call them in and yell at them.

427
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,090
But seriously, you don't have to be sorry.

428
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,870
I chose to keep pretending that I was Kang Mi Na.

429
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:06,190
And there were my feelings for you. So if you say it like that, I'm sad.

430
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,560
I think you should rest for a couple of days.

431
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,950
You must be exhausted from staying in the detention center.

432
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,720
I'll bring you some hot tea.

433
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:24,090
How can I rest? These guys must be excited now that I was fired as a prosecutor.

434
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,160
But there's something they don't know.

435
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,370
When it comes to fighting, the unemployed have many advantages.

436
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:34,260
I have so much time, and there's nothing to do!

437
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,560
I was playing two people, and I dealt with them like that.

438
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,030
Now I have sufficient time and energy!

439
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,520
Damn it.

440
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,340
That feels nice.

441
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,700
Let me rest for a bit.

442
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,070
Who do you think I am ...

443
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,660
And you said you have sufficient energy.

444
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,730
Speed up the restructuring we couldn't do when the hotels merged.

445
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,690
Let's get rid of all the Hanju hotels.

446
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,700
But the number of people you mentioned before is too large.

447
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,070
It's about 1,000 people.

448
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,350
Is that so? Then 1,000 people will be gone with my one signature...

449
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,180
Vice president Koo Jae Hak, you did a great job.

450
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,010
Hanju was having trouble buying that Pyeongtaek land.

451
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,760
It's all thanks to our Chairwoman, Han Seong Hye.

452
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,570
I've watched you since you were a baby, and now you are our Chairwoman.

453
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,670
I'm happy to see you showing your ability.

454
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,140
I compliment you many times!

455
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,980
- Didn't you graduate from college? 
 - Pardon?

456
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,060
"I'm complimenting you," "I'm happy for you."

457
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,760
Those phrases are usually said by a superior to a subordinate.

458
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,180
I apologize.

459
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,040
Wet wipes.

460
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,060
Regarding your inauguration ceremony,

461
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,940
since the Chairman is in prison, some people in the company say we should skip it.

462
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,890
That's why we should have it.

463
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,180
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,370
What brings you here?

465
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,480
Ace Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun from Seopyeong Branch!

466
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,620
I have good news for you.

467
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,270
- What is it?  
 - There will be personnel changes among senior prosecutors next Monday.

468
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,460
My aunt is Chief Manager at the Ministry of Justice.

469
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,930
And she told me that at that time, I'll be demoted as well.

470
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,980
What?

471
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,270
I'm saying that I don't have much time left working at the Seopyeong Branch Office.

472
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,100
Excuse me?

473
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,740
Why is that good news?

474
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,120
When she's not in her sane mind, this works best.

475
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,430
She always gets energy when unfair things happen to someone else.

476
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,630
But are you okay?

477
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm fine. I'm getting demoted anyway.

478
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,460
So it's good as long as I'm being useful.

479
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,320
Then what happens to the retrial?

480
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,770
First, there will be a hearing about whether Jeong Do Wu did it.

481
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:18,610
And if there's a conviction, since Kang Myeong Guk was not the culprit, he'll be acquitted.

482
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,020
After that, Jeong Do Wu will stand trial.

483
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,480
If he's not there, they will process that trial quickly.

484
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,800
"You turned yourself in, so you're the criminal!" Like that.

485
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Can't they overturn the judgment using the opinions and physical evidence we have?

486
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,830
Legal evidence that works for the trial is important, and it's a fact that we're lacking in that.

487
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,680
Also, that surveillance camera was bait to start a re-investigation.

488
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:49,160
Why is Jeong Do Wu so loyal to Han Seong Hye?

489
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,720
According to the bank statement from Kang Mi Na, Seong Hye sent him money regularly.

490
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,490
She has sent it for a long time.

491
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,950
If their relationship is that long, it won't be easy to flip his testimony.

492
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,860
But sometimes there are people who are closest to the criminal

493
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,750
who come out and testify to something important.

494
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,770
At times like that, they don't testify because of justice.

495
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,750
Then why do they do it?

496
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,660
It is usually because they find out they've been fooled.

497
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,820
Anyway, they want to testify when they are in unfair situations.

498
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,640
If Jeong Do Wu figures out who Han Seong Hye really is, then he would leave her as well.

499
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,060
I can't help it. Now is not the time to sit around.

500
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,290
Han Seung Wuk, why don't you go see Kang Mi Na?

501
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,710
See her doctor as well about  her condition.

502
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,930
Yu Jun, you should go see Jeong Do Wu and keep asking him.

503
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,780
I have a place to go as well.

504
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,650
Anyway, let's gather later and talk about it again.

505
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,140
Thank you. She seemed to be lost, not knowing what to do since yesterday.

506
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,980
You know Yeon Ju well.

507
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,810
It's nothing.

508
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:03,050
The less you know about the other person, the more impact you have.

509
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,990
I had a call from the company.

510
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:18,590
They said if I want to visit you, I also need to get permission from above.

511
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:23,250
- "Above"? 
 - It's Seong Hye. She's saying she's now above me.

512
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,170
Do you know what she said?

513
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,290
She said she couldn't be generous to you.

514
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,850
She wants to be on top of our heads now.

515
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,470
It's not going to be easy for you to get out of here.

516
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,100
What's wrong with her?

517
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,870
Why were you so bad to her until now—

518
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,450
 In the end, it's your fault that all this happened, Father. 

519
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,730
 Be it back then, or now. 

520
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,530
  Be prepared for it.  

521
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,690
  It all happened because of you, Father.  

522
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,450
  It's so like you, Father.  

523
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,920
  Whenever there's a chance, you only think about yourself.  

524
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,400
I treated her like that because she knows what's on my mind.

525
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,190
She's very similar to me.

526
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,280
It's like what you did to Seong Wun's wife.

527
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,150
I need to call in Seung Wuk.

528
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,630
None of my children will save me.

529
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,600
 Your father has something up his sleeve. 

530
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,820
 I don't think he's just saying it to scare you. 

531
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,500
What does he have on me?

532
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,020
Who were the people visiting my father?

533
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,970
Hey, Ajumma! Excuse me!

534
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,110
Ajumma, stop there.

535
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,060
I have driven since the Ford Deuce*. 
  (Very early model Ford car) 

536
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,740
I've had a driver's license for a long time!

537
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,210
     

538
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,150
Excuse me, who are you?

539
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,540
Get out of my way, please!

540
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,640
When a person gets older, she shouldn't beg for help.

541
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,660
But I have no choice now.

542
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,310
Please help me.

543
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,430
Did she go to the hospital right away?

544
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,380
Okay.

545
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,330
I knew this was going to happen, but what will my father do now?

546
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,620
- Connect with me to Lawyer No Hak Tae. 
   - Yes, Chairwoman.  

547
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,270
Aren't you a prosecutor or anything anymore?

548
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,640
Is that why I'm seeing you in the regular visiting room?

549
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,750
Is that the issue right now?

550
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,390
The real culprit is about to get away.

551
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,010
So when Jeong Do Wu's hearing happens, we have to do our best with the testimony.

552
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,820
You have to say, "It's not me, but I don't think it's him either."

553
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:26,600
So you're saying that someone higher in Hanju is blaming their crime on him.

554
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,340
Back in the days when I went around collecting debts.

555
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,860
Do you know what you do when a person seems unable to pay back a debt?

556
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,330
You say that you'll lend them more money.

557
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,070
Then when the debt is large, it gets overdue faster, so you can collect the collateral faster.

558
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,640
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

559
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,760
This is how the mind of the one above works.

560
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:59,300
Bad people tend to act more recklessly when they seem to be doing well.

561
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:04,130
It looks like it's going well, right? Then that means it will end soon.

562
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:08,040
Are you trying to console me?

563
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,070
These days, you can't be expected to be treated as a parent without doing anything.

564
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:19,830
But even as a bad parent, I'm thinking about my child.

565
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:25,870
But how can you comfort me by talking about when you were collecting debts?

566
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,650
There's no experience that's completely useless.

567
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,280
What's important is how you can use that experience from now on.

568
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,290
You're so good at forgiving your own past.

569
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,350
How can you idealize the time when you were a gangster?

570
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:50,200
I guess because my learning is short, my thinking is short.

571
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,100
I lied to you without knowing that I shouldn't do that.

572
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:05,660
But can you consider that I hoped so much that my daughter could live well without me,

573
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,650
that I made such a mistake?

574
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,490
You know, there's something similar to that.

575
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,530
Fathers say those kinds of lies to their daughters.

576
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,980
Like when he teaches his daughter to ride a bicycle,

577
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,710
he lets go,

578
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,910
but keeps saying that he is still holding on.

579
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:36,800
And the father follows her, but he stops and watches

580
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:42,090
as his daughter travels far away on the bicycle.

581
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:54,270
Can you think that's how I felt?

582
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,760
Why does he keep making you worry and come in all the time?

583
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,820
I guess he keeps changing his words.

584
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:27,290
It's his nature. Thank you for working hard to deal with criminals.

585
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,530
He's my father.

586
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,310
I'm sorry?

587
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,680
I said, Mr. Kang Myeong Guk in there is my father.

588
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,370
Ah, yes.

589
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,620
Let's not touch someone's family.

590
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,020
I'm sorry.

591
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,800
This is what Chairman Han used to use as a recorder.

592
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,370
It wasn't only at the former Chairman's house.

593
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:14,900
I think it was secretly put in Han Seong Hye's belongings on the day of the accident.

594
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,000
What did you say?

595
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,850
He couldn't even trust his own daughter.

596
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,260
He asked me to get this to him since he thought it was time to use it.

597
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:34,980
I thought it was right for me to remain neutral, but I don't think so anymore.

598
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,860
I did it because it was beneficial to me and comfortable. It was cowardly behavior.

599
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,260
Now that I almost died, I've come to my senses.

600
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,670
I wasn't remaining neutral,

601
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,700
but I agreed to something wrong.

602
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:58,250
If you listen to that, you'll understand.

603
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,490
 Don't you know that taking these away without permission 

604
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,750
 could be a problem? 

605
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,890
 Do you think that by hiding it from me like this, you can hide it forever?  

606
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,850
 Nothing will change, even if you wait one or two days more. 

607
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,990
  Uncle ...  

608
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,150
 Ah ... 

609
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:46,170
  Father, I just hit a person with my car.  

610
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,630
 I need your help. 

611
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,440
 I'm near the Hanju Fashion factory. Older Uncle went there 

612
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,550
 regarding the ledgers— 

613
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,340
     

614
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:50,760
  If you want to leave a message, please press the star or pound button.  

615
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,740
There was a recording of the accident from that day, 14 years ago.

616
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,390
Hurry and come here. I think we can catch Han Seong Hye again.

617
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,970
  Your message has been recorded.  

618
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:14,120
Do you remember the order for you to return to headquarters when you were Kang Mi Na's secretary?

619
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,640
That was my order.

620
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,940
But when I saw you going back to being her secretary, I realized you were not on my side.

621
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,300
I assumed that.

622
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,310
But does Seung Wuk know about this?

623
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,360
That you betrayed Chairman Han Gang Sik before.

624
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,950
  I heard that you know economics well, 
    

625
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:48,280
  and also that you're close to President Han Gang Sik, so I'm discussing this with you first.  

626
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,730
  - What is it? 
 - With Hanju Fashion's accounting,  

627
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,310
  there are some issues. 
    

628
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,370
  What should we do?  

629
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,620
  Just leave it for now.  

630
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,960
  If you get into the company-owners fight, people will get hurt for no reason.  

631
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,460
I couldn't do anything about it at that time.

632
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,980
I also had a father who was sick in bed.

633
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,560
You needed a lot of money.

634
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,670
But I know you need more now.

635
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,400
You have a lot of family members who make trouble.

636
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,570
You're already regretting resigning from Hanju, aren't you?

637
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:01,070
When I took over Hanju Group, I started on the wrong foot.

638
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,370
I shouldn't have been so harsh to you.

639
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:08,280
I'm having a lot of regrets these days.

640
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,040
I didn't grow Hanju to this extent just to hand it over to Seong Hye.

641
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,710
That child, I should have sorted her out a long time ago.

642
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:26,770
I have a weapon which can break Seong Hye in a blow, as long as I can leave this place.

643
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,310
Can you get me out by collaborating with Yumin?

644
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:36,150
Is that weapon perhaps a recorder in the shape of a pen?

645
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,580
You have been silent all this time despite listening to everything on that recorder,

646
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:48,400
but now you're going to use it because you don't want to hand Hanju over to your daughter?

647
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,550
That emotion isn't called "regret."

648
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,210
It's greed.

649
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,030
I don't think I can help you.

650
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:00,250
That ... did you hear everything?

651
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:07,120
Then ... you're going to put Seong Hye in prison, aren't you?

652
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,510
Do that, Seung Wuk.

653
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,390
If your father were alive, he wouldn't abandon me like this!

654
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:22,240
You've never lowered yourself to the level of Seong Hye's actions!

655
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,170
I don't know whether this is such a "level,"

656
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:29,230
but I'm sure you've passed your expiration date.

657
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,820
What are you thinking about?

658
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,790
Someone's house is cooking fish.

659
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,070
It smells delicious.

660
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,110
Something like that?

661
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,900
Is your appetite still robust despite today's events?

662
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,430
Of course!

663
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,510
If I was the kind of person who holds onto unjust deeds,

664
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,260
and devastated and angry for days on end, I wouldn't have made it this far.

665
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:25,010
Let's do ... what we can.

666
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:43,160
It's been some time since our investigation team gathered!

667
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,880
But there are some new faces, right?

668
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,720
I'll introduce you quickly.

669
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,110
This is Director Kim! She's staying at my place because of conditions out of her control.

670
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,370
She's someone who knows much more than we can imagine.

671
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,410
By any chance, do you know the mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle?

672
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,500
"Mystery"?

673
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:09,590
It's nothing but a natural occurrence caused by bubbles which release

674
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,750
massive amounts of methane gas. That's my vote.

675
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,390
Truly ... there's nothing that you don't know.

676
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:22,160
This is Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun, who's been promised a refreshing demotion from Seopyeong District.

677
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,870
When it gets rid of traitors, the prosecution is as scary as the mafia

678
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:30,120
We need to wrap this up this week. I'll be sent out next week.

679
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,530
And this here, is our professional double-agent—

680
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,380
Can you stop saying that!

681
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,860
He's prickly, as you can see.

682
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,590
And everyone should know Mr. Han Seung Wuk.

683
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,850
For now, as we don't know when the real Kang Mi Na will wake up,

684
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:49,320
we'll have to act using the recorder you gave us, and the illegal activities found by Kang Mi Na

685
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,710
that pushed Han Seong Hye into a corner.

686
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,850
What do you think about me holding a press conference?

687
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,610
You?

688
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:01,210
Well, sending the recording somewhere isn't to be trusted either

689
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:06,340
Opening it in a public space seems much better.

690
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:12,180
And then there are corrupt Hanju activities that I found during my time as head of Hanju's legal team too.

691
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,280
Then, is it something like this?

692
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,200
You know, it happens in dramas and movies!

693
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,000
Like at inauguration ceremonies, or conferences for political candidates!

694
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,830
Oh!

695
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,530
   

696
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,540
 When people gather, 

697
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,440
 and the moment Han Seong Hye appears to begin her speech— 

698
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,870
 What's the point, dude? 

699
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:47,420
 The microphone is turned off, and suddenly though the speakers... 

700
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,780
 this recording is heard ... 

701
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,120
 "Uncle ..." 

702
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,920
 And the moment when people go, "Huh, what's happening," 

703
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,150
 our team manager will burst onto stage. 

704
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,110
 "I report Hanju from this moment onward." 

705
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:03,850
 "I begin the relevant press conference." 

706
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,760
 People will start taking pictures, flash, flash, flash! 

707
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,380
 And the moment Han Seong Hye tries to leave in a panic, 

708
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,940
 Yu Jun, who was waiting all this while, will march up 

709
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,090
 and stand right before Han Seong Hye saying ... 

710
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,540
 "Chairwoman Han Seong Hye," 

711
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:21,190
 "You're under immediate arrest for planned murder and attempted murder, and other charges such as hit-and-run," 

712
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:25,490
 "You have the right to remain silent, and call an attorney." 

713
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:30,510
 "And all speech from this moment onward, and anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law." 

714
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,590
That's how you catch her!

715
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,830
Okay!

716
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:46,470
I'll stay here, and give you a signal as soon as Han Seong Hye appears.

717
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,180
But, why is our team leader so late?

718
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,980
   

719
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,420
Oh, she's coming!

720
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,350
Are you still unable to reach the team leader?

721
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,070
He's not picking up his phone. I'll keep calling him for now.

722
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,890
 This number is currently unavailable ... 

723
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,220
Damn it, why is the password not working, it's making me nervous!

724
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,820
Dude, Dae Chi.

725
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,890
What?

726
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,210
Dude, Dae Chi!

727
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,290
What is it, I'm busy—

728
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,910
Damn it.

729
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,100
   

730
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,880
   

731
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,620
Why is he so late?

732
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,220
 This number is currently unavailable... 

733
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,470
I'm not done.

734
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:17,260
   

735
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,050
Anyway, take care of yourself.

736
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:24,100
Han Seong Hye, that woman, she's acting however she wants now.

737
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,900
It's not like prison is a safe place, either.

738
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,200
Look,

739
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:34,030
You prosecutors say that you're no different from gangs.

740
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,580
But from what I see, the same goes for chaebols.

741
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,980
Especially those who fight for positions, whether they're brothers or not.

742
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,300
Those chaebols who fight their way to the top, and get rid of everything around them in the process,

743
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,730
they're no different from us gang members.

744
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,170
You have no idea how scary it is

745
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:55,830
to pretend to act tough and threaten other people, do you?

746
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,650
Do you know how to attack those kind of chaebols?

747
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:05,530


748
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:09,520
♫  You're still in my heart  ♫

749
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,070
♫  Please listen to me  ♫

750
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:16,140
♫  You're the one I love  ♫

751
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,100
♫  Remember  ♫

752
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:24,290
♫  The words spoken through dry lips  ♫

753
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,800
   

754
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,400
 So all the things she's doing will end in just a few days. 

755
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,350
 Is that woman, Jo Yeon Ju, going to disappear in a few days or something? 

756
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,100
 If that was his plan, wasn't he fooling us from the start? 

757
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,270
 A public humiliation ... 

758
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,280
 I'm against it. I can't gamble with your life. 

759
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,390
 It's also my share of revenge. 

760
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:49,440
 As long as we make her join the gambling, I can get her to confess for sure. 

761
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,820
 I told him I have to kill you in front of my eyes, so he must've used just enough to keep you alive. 

762
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,360
 I said so, didn't I? That I won't be fooled twice. 

763
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,340
♫  Through dry lips  ♫

764
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,500
♫  Tell me  ♫
