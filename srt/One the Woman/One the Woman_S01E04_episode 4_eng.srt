1
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,540
     

2
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,780
Hello?

3
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,980
It's your aunt.

4
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,000
Auntie!

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,290
What's going on, Auntie!

6
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,100
I have something to talk about with you and wanted to see you someday—

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,210
What's that? I should come right now?

8
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,910
Of course! If you're asking me to come out right now, then dinner is not important.

9
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,220
What's going on with her?

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,230
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

11
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,170
Yes, yes! Come to our hotel. I'll leave right now and wait for you.

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,950
What?

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,980
R-Right now? No, no. Wait a second. Wait.

14
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,820
Take your time! Of course!

15
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,050
I have cockles to wash, but what can I do?

16
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,130
Yes, yes! Oh, yes.

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,290
There are extra dishes to wash tonight,

18
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,830
so I'll kill time outside until the dishes are done.

19
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,320
I mean, she's my family.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,240
I bet time will fly when we start chatting.

21
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,390
Aunt!

22
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,980
You're very excited. That's not like you.

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm usually very quiet. Have a seat, please.

24
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,910
I know you'll hear it from somewhere eventually.

25
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,870
Some people are talking about how you injured your head,

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,270
so I brought that up in the general shareholders' meeting.

27
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,680
I hope you don't take that as an offense.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,860
Did you?

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,230
But the largest shareholder appeared and sided with you, so it went smoothly.

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,820
How did you talk him into doing that?

31
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,980
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,540
Is he your cousin-in-law?

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,610
Who are you talking about?

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,410
The one who came from the US, the largest shareholder of Yumin Electronics. Your cousin-in-law!

35
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,610
The largest shareholder who came from the US is my cousin-in-law?

36
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,540
That's right! Yes, that's right.

37
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,890
And the one who owes him is—

38
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,510
- Is you! He is your savior. 
 - Incredible.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,260
Anyway, what I want to say is about the meaning of family.

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,830
To people like us, family relations are determined by real estate,

41
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,780
shares, and financial accounts. You know that, don't you?

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,830
What has your family done for you until now?

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,370
Well ... I mean ...

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,620
Right, you have nothing to say since they did nothing!

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,590
That is where you stand.

46
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,180
Honestly, you were just like a speck of dust in your family.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,260
I hope you don't forget your position in Yumin from now on as well.

48
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,720
You understand what I mean, right?

49
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,770
     

50
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,680


51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,270
  Why did you hide me?  

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,630
  - Did you think you'll get something from me if you take my side? 
 - It's not like that--  

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,320
 In case you're following me around to get something from me, then forget about it. 

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,990
Huh?

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,990
Cousin-in-law!

56
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,120
I heard that you hold a lot of my family company's shares.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,610
I must have surprised you earlier today.

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,780
You know I hurt my head! My mind goes out-and-in, then in-and-out, like this.

59
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry! Yes ...

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,090
There were some misunderstandings, so I made some mistakes.

61
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,690
I mean, you should've told me before!

62
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,730
I'm not good at showing off, you see.

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,570
Also, you didn't give me a chance to tell you.

64
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,730
Then, can I talk to you for a second now?

65
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,860
Actually, I also came to your house to hand you this.

66
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,290
What is this?

67
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,830
It's the official history of the woman called Kang Mi Na.

68
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,700
There's also personal information on Yumin Electronics' directors, the holding company of Yumin Group.

69
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,790
Additionally, there are details on Yumin Group that you, Kang Mi Na, would know.

70
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,100
You should do your best to memorize this, so that you can prove there was no memory loss,

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,020
and all those rumors were just because of transient symptoms from shock.

72
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,490
You have to make the board of directors believe that.

73
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,510
- Why? 
 - Because they won't listen to you just because you have management rights.

74
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,820
You could take everything of value and sell the rest, since you now have the power to do that.

75
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,750
And you could change the entire board of directors.

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,490
So they will keep bothering you.

77
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,890
No, I'm asking why you're giving me this information.

78
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,960
You said this family is not protecting you.

79
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,920
Aren't you a member of this family?

80
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,660
- Am I? 
 - Ah.

81
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,100
I heard that family relationships are determined by real estate, shares, and financial accounts.

82
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,530
Since you don't have any of this family's property,

83
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,650
you're not part of it, uh?

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,580
Instead, you temporarily shared property with me,

85
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,030
so we might be family.

86
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,020
It sounds like it.

87
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,820
Then, I'll gratefully take it.

88
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,370
Wait, there's something important I haven't said yet.

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,750
You treated me like someone who wanted to get something from you.

90
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,790
But I came here today because my uncle forced me.

91
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,990
I said it was a misunderstanding. I guess you do hold grudges.

92
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,860
Also, as you can see, this style suits me very well.

93
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,100
But I prefer feeling free, that's why I dress casually most of the time.

94
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,520
Also, those weren't just any clothes. It's the vintage-futurism style

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,590
that was very popular at the London Fashion Week last season.

96
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,070
I get it. I understand.

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,480
Since childhood, modesty has been second nature to me. I don't show off my status as the son of a wealthy family.

98
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,360
That's probably why you keep misunderstanding me.

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,380
I also chose the place I'm living in now with the mindset of not showing off my wealth.

100
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,160
Even though it's the only officetel* of that size in the building.
 (apartment for living and office use) 

101
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,060
- Also, I don't drive often because it's tiring ... 
 - What modesty is he talking about?

102
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,020
If you've said everything, I'll get going.

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,850
   

104
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,790
What is this summons?

105
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:52,590
It's ridiculous enough that I got this again about something that's been discussed already. Why is it still not resolved?

106
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,420
It's because ... the prosecutor in charge of this went on vacation.

107
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,700
So what does that mean? Are you saying you haven't even figured out what's going on?

108
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,920
     

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,290
Of course that's not what I mean.

110
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,170
But that prosecutor has a problem that I can't share with you.

111
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,630
Didn't you tell me that this prosecutor is the best of Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office?

112
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,860
You have received everything you could from me and now you betray me like this,

113
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,690
so how should I take it?

114
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,100
How can you say it's a betrayal? Can you please calm down a bit first?

115
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,220
I told you that there is a problem.

116
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,170
What problem?

117
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,650
Did she go missing after going on vacation?

118
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,570
That wouldn't happen.

119
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,210
If you give me some more time, I'll do my best to resolve it.

120
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,190
This old man and his temper ...

121
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,520
What happened to you? Jo Yeon Ju ... Jo Yeon Ju ...

122
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,340
  The power is off, you can leave your message after the—  

123
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,330
Has she really gone missing or something?

124
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,380
Your mother "willingly decided to shoulder it herself."

125
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,060
What do you think that means?

126
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,400
He must have said that to cover up his fault.

127
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,950
I'm just saying this last thing, out of concern.

128
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,510
Are you really going to be all right if you dig up old histories?

129
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,040
Of course, I can imagine how you've lived until now with that in mind.

130
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,110
Can you really imagine it?

131
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,540
How do you think I lived?

132
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,030
   

133
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,370
 What you're seeing is the great ... 

134
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,120
 Mother and I went to the US as if we were runaways,  

135
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,970
 and lived like dead people. 

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,330
 You can see the bright part in the middle of it. 

137
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,810
 This part is called trapezium cluster. 

138
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:20,890
 I found out that Grandfather had been sick and died after reading it in the paper. 

139
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,820
   

140
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,410
 There's something you need to know, Oppa. 

141
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,860
 It's about what happened in 2007. 

142
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,570
 I heard about Mi Na and Seong Wun's engagement after leaving Korea. 

143
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,010
 I thought that what she had to tell me would be excuses about that, so I ignored her.  

144
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,380
 It was the day of my mother's funeral. 

145
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,650
 There's a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens.  

146
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,530
 A time to be born and a time to die. 

147
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,890
 These are the items that your mother wanted to be buried with.  

148
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,210
 Please take a look. 

149
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,240
 A time to tear down and a time to build. 

150
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,570
 A time to weep and a time to laugh. 

151
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,690
 A time to mourn and a time to dance. 

152
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,280
   

153
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,040
 I thank you for everything you've done for us until now. 

154
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,060
 We will never return to Korea. 

155
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,760
 It's clear that President Han Yeong Sik will do to Seung Wuk 

156
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,340
 exactly what he did to his father. 

157
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,400
 He'll manipulate everything and drive him toward death. 

158
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,410
 But after seeing that message, I realized  

159
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,260
 that Mother knew that Father had been framed  

160
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,230
 and that she went to the US for my sake. 

161
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,610
 The matter from 2007 that Mi Na mentioned... 

162
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,620
 - ...could be related to Father. 
 - Oh, Holy Father— 

163
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,370
 I made up my mind 

164
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,590
 to go back 

165
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,230
 and return everything to its original place. 

166
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,420
 Lord, bestow your mercy ... 

167
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,790
I need to find Mi Na and hear what happened at that time.

168
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,800
Then, why not report that Kang Mi Na is missing?

169
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,550
And return Kang Mi Na's replacement to her original place.

170
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,520
To where?

171
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,750
That's a problem, too.

172
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,270
Also, that woman could become a weakness for Hanju.

173
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,940
She's a weapon for us.

174
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm saying we should hold onto her and use her as needed.

175
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,960
Then for now, I'll go ahead and schedule that meeting

176
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,020
with the central prosecutor, Jo Yeon Ju, whom I contacted last time.

177
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,650
She said that she'd be back from vacation this week.

178
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,630
- She must have taken a really long vacation, though.
  - The phone is turned off. 

179
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,360
- She's still not answering. 
 -  You may leave a message after the—  

180
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,690
Being a gangster, and pretending to be Kang Mi Na ...

181
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,830
Will I be arrested for impersonation?

182
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,690
No, they can't punish me for just impersonation.

183
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,970
But the moment I become the head of this group,

184
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,210
I'll be committing property-gains fraud.

185
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,000
Then I'll be subject to ten years prison for the crime of fraud

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,120
and subject to a 20 million won  (≈ $17,000)   fine. Why does that roll off my tongue so naturally?

187
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,770
Did I frequent jail on a daily basis while being a gangster?

188
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,090
No, Kang Mi Na could be a chaebol

189
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,600
and a gangster at the same time.

190
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,970
That's it!

191
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,330
   

192
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,700
   

193
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,030
   

194
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,290
   

195
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,500
Damn it, this is irrefutable proof.

196
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,410
If I'm not Kang Mi Na, where is the real Kang Mi Na right now?

197
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,490
That surprised me. What was he doing that he's only just getting in now?

198
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,710
 So, you two are having an affair and I'm aware of it?  

199
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,530
 I've always made sure he sleeps at home. 

200
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,480
 That's why I'm so mad. All he does at home is sleep. 

201
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,930
 He's useless! This isn't some kind of hotel! 

202
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Why am I going overboard

203
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,680
over another woman's husband cheating?

204
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,190
 Honestly, you were just like a speck of dust in our family. 

205
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,160
 That is where you stand. 

206
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,540
   

207
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,100
Even if it's someone else's life, I should live it properly.

208
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,050
I will quietly go through it and return this position back to you,

209
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,160
only upgraded.

210
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,070
What on earth are you saying?

211
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,060
If you're the investigator in charge, you should have the prosecutor's emergency contact details.

212
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,210
She's never before taken one day's leave nor been uncontactable.

213
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,110
Even so, how can you return a case when the prosecutor herself isn't here?

214
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,610
Because the Deputy Head Prosecutor Lee in person came to speak to us ...

215
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,030
Where has she gone?

216
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,250
Can you think of anywhere she might have gone?

217
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm not sure, but she said she received a report that Lee Bong Sik, from three years ago, had reappeared.

218
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,960
She said she might go undercover while on vacation.

219
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,610
What?

220
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,830
Who was that guy who's close to Prosecutor Jo?

221
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,390
Tell him to go to her house at once!

222
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,760
What? Go into her house?

223
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,600
You little ... Is there anywhere in this country where a prosecutor can't go?

224
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
I'll get you a warrant, so tell him to go now.

225
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,930
You people!

226
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,630
Aren't you worried when we can't reach a person for several days?

227
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,590
Why are you getting your salaries?

228
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,320
   

229
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,200
- Prosecutor, the Samgeori gang ... 
 - Yes?

230
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,510
I think they don't only smuggle people from Vietnam.

231
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,690
- Why? 
 - There's talk of drugs.

232
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,120
They're suddenly saying that they'll give us a big tip and to let them go in exchange.

233
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,990
But listening carefully,

234
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,820
it seems like the matter will get very big.

235
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,730
Whose name did they give?

236
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,550
Just a moment.

237
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,930
Hello? Yes, just a moment.

238
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,320
Prosecutor, they say it's the central prosecutor's office.

239
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,230
Since when have these been accumulating like this?

240
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,370
Who are you?

241
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,680
I live here. Do you live in this house?

242
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,530
I know the home owner.

243
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,990
That ...

244
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,670
Oh, this is ... I was checking to see how many days have passed.

245
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,310
Just drink it. As it is, it won't be drinkable if it's left here.

246
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,160
Hey, I'm not that type of person.

247
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,780
Yes, Deputy Prosecutor.

248
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,170
I've arrived in front of the house. Yes.

249
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,120
- You're not leaving? 
 - I am.

250
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,060
Yes.

251
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,150
Yes.

252
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,260
Yes, I understand. Yes.

253
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,290
The house is clean.

254
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,330
Her prosecutor identification and her phone were left there.

255
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,590
Her car is still in the garage, and the CCTV at the entrance

256
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,930
is such bad quality it's impossible to confirm the recording.

257
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,450
How many days has she been away from her home?

258
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,820
Because of privacy reasons there's no CCTV in the hallways.

259
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,970
Milk cartons have been collecting,

260
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,370
and it seems the neighbor opposite takes them.

261
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,070
They're not even beggars. Why take milk from someone else's house?

262
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,850
Where is prosecutor Jo's family house?

263
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,090
She has no family, so there isn't a separate family home as far as I know.

264
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,980
She did say, before submitting her vacation request, that she was going to do a recognition investigation.

265
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,500
- Lee Bong Sik? 
 - Did you know?

266
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,020
Hey, who else knows about that?

267
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,140
I don't think anyone knows besides me. She repeatedly asked me to keep it a secret.

268
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,590
- Thank you. Have a nice day. 
 - Thank you.

269
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,480
- Hey, Yeong Cheol, watch the counter! 
 - All right.

270
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,630
Ah, seriously!

271
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,490
Look, Hyeong-nim. We've been totally betrayed.

272
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,220
It's not that she's not answering her phone. She's changed it! And her house?

273
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,680
And it's not that she's not coming home. She moved!

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,730
There's something strange about it, isn't there?

275
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,960
What?

276
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,920
Think about the time when you were stabbed by a knife.

277
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,410
When you stab someone you know, something is perceptible, even just for a second.

278
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,440
What is it?

279
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,080
A moment of hesitation you can't help as a human being. A moment's thought, or something visible in your eyes.

280
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,090
But when Yeon Ju came at us with her fists,

281
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,760
there was definitely no hesitation.

282
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
  Yeon Ju! 

283
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,790
  Are you okay? 

284
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,070
Then ... are you saying she doesn't even see us as fellow humans?

285
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,830
Do you think ... that might be it?

286
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,350
That can't be allowed.

287
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,810
After everything we did for her.

288
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,930
  Wow, Uncles. You're hiding all the way out here? 

289
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,430
 We're not hiding. We've been released. 

290
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,510
 While in jail, we heard you failed the bar exam a couple of times. 

291
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,030
 We couldn't sit still so we came here. 

292
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,810
 How would you two help me with my bar exam studies? Don't be ridiculous. 

293
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,290
 Yeon Ju, in our cell this time, there was a guy doing three years for hiding spy cameras in a study dorm in Noryangjin. 

294
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,590
 Man, he was really disgusting. 

295
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,480
 Anyway, that guy said 

296
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,840
 the key to studying for the second round of the bar exam is to know 

297
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,490
 and correctly apply judicial precedents. 

298
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,570
 And so ... 

299
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,340
 I was ordered to sell a stolen Goryeo dynasty celadon vase, 

300
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,590
 but instead of selling it, I used it as collateral, so I went to jail. 

301
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,830
 Crime of negligence for storing stolen goods? 

302
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,190
 Or is it embezzlement? 

303
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,810
 I committed murder. To avoid the body being found, I left it where it was and fled. 

304
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,680
 Wait a second. Were you convicted of concealing a corpse or not? 

305
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,860
 I grew a field of chives and sold the entire field to those people. 

306
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,930
 And then they just dug up the whole field! 

307
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,890
 Those chive-like bastards. 

308
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,300
After the big boss left and our organization was in tatters, your ploy was to make us

309
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,540
a fiercely powerful group backed by  a prosecutor.

310
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,210
You punk. It was the big picture, not a ploy.

311
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,420
There was a bigger picture,

312
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,700
but still, we helped her so much.

313
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,260
Still, we shouldn't have buried her, huh?

314
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,040
 What does my bar exam have to do with you, uncles? 

315
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,990
 You're so damn loud. Look there! 

316
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,380
 You can't come out of here until you memorize all this. 

317
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,250
 When am I supposed to memorize all this? Get me out! 

318
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,130
Still, she shouldn't betray us, even if she took that to heart.

319
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,450
She did frantically memorize it and pass her next exam.

320
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,460
It's strange, no matter how I think about it.

321
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,480
Hyeong-nim, stop thinking about it and do your deliveries. Orders keep coming in.

322
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you going to keep pretending not to hear them?

323
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,110
I am indeed here to get something from you today, and I won't deny it if you accuse me of following you.

324
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,860
As the largest shareholder, is there any bigger issue for me than the appointment of the new head?

325
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,990
I understand.

326
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,450
You can't have memorized yesterday's file in one night, so let's go with not speaking much, if possible.

327
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,870
The guy with glasses at the elevator is President Hwang Man Geun of Yumin Electronics.

328
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,200
He's climbed the ranks since joining via the 1988 Olympics special recruitment program

329
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,260
but was demoted because he made the wrong predictions on the growth of smartphones.

330
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,140
He persevered and was the last among his colleagues to become an executive.

331
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,060
That annex was completed two years ago.

332
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,550
If you go through the overpass on the 14th floor, it takes you directly to the chairman's office.

333
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,960
I memorized the building's layout. Do you want to know where the cafeteria is?

334
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,070
Anything else? Should I also give you the affiliate companies' capital structure?

335
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,490
You memorized all this?

336
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,650
Well, memorizing things feels familiar to me.

337
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,730
And ... I feel something stuffy stuck around my throat if I don't memorize something.

338
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,110
I get the desperate feeling of needing to memorize information or else!

339
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,340
That's a relief.

340
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,750
However, don't ever use strong expressions during the board meeting.

341
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,860
Be ambiguous, so that you can always get out of any situation.

342
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,660
- And especially with your uncontrollable anger— 
 - Excuse me, Cousin-in-law

343
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,150
I've lived a few days without my memory, haven't I?

344
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,340
And during this time, it's felt like I was born with good intuition

345
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,460
and a good brain.

346
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,690
The doctor said so.

347
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,060
That there's no problem with the knowledge in my head, but a problem with recalling it.

348
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,870
Even now, I am sure that I'm much smarter than you think, Cousin-in-law.

349
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,430
What is it?

350
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,870
Who are you? Do you know me?

351
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,300
Are you disappointed I'm not a kind of dim-witted, memory-loss patient?

352
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,430
Stop scolding me. It's just a problem with my memory, not my intelligence.

353
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,910
I won't mess things up like an idiot who can't grasp a situation.

354
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,450
I'll do my best to pretend I'm Kang Mi Na—

355
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,090
Kang Mi Na before the memory loss. Yes.

356
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,080
All right.

357
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,070
Good luck!

358
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,540
Good luck ...?

359
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,390
I didn't say to leave. I said I'll do well.

360
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,520
I'll be honest since you said you're close to Prosecutor Jo.

361
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,850
The lobby case between Hanju and the Tax Service Commissioner switched from Division 2 to Prosecutor Jo.

362
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,000
But Division 2 got it back because she took leave without prior notice.

363
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,420
However ... that case would have been beneficial in many ways had Prosecutor Jo been on it.

364
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,890
Prosecutor Jo, absent without a word? When it's such a big case?

365
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,020
That's suspicious!

366
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,620
It is suspicious.

367
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,800
I mean ... Frankly, Prosecutor Jo is like a dog for those in power.

368
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,910
She's not the kind of person to miss such an opportunity!

369
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,940
Something must have happened to her.

370
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,520
 A dog of those in power? No. Nuna isn't a dog. 

371
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,320
 If she must be compared to an animal ... 

372
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,530
 Don't worry. 

373
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,210
 I ... am the meerkat of power. 

374
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,290
 Meerkat? 

375
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,950
 I always look at the boss, you see. 

376
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,070
 I look in all directions and then I stick to the one 

377
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,350
 who is most influential and will be most profitable to me. 

378
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,100
 Must you be so desperate? 

379
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,550
 If I'm not, is all that money returned to society? 

380
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,060
 I mean, someone's going to take the money anyway. What's the point of leaving it be? 

381
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,490
 A gold-spoon kid like you will never understand. 

382
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,990
 These days, your nuna wants to eat millions and billions  

383
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,700
 in cash, not food. 

384
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,920
 This nuna ... She might have found another influential person to stick to. 

385
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,970
I mean, she's someone who's loyal to the higher-ups no matter what. Something must have happened.

386
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,040
I ... Should I look further into Lee Bong Sik?

387
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,120
Don't!

388
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,850
Don't stick your nose into a closed case.

389
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,230
Look into Prosecutor Jo's surroundings.

390
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,080
If she contacts you, report to me immediately. Understood?

391
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,240
Ah, yes. I understand.

392
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,690
Why did she need to dig into Lee Bong Sik? Now I can't report her missing!

393
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,030
 There's another thing the deputy head doesn't know. 

394
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,210
 This domestic violence case ... 

395
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,910
 Someone experienced in these kind of cases should take it. 

396
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,170
 - You take care of it.
 - Me? 

397
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,790
 What? Is that a problem? 

398
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,230
 Director, how long will I be assigned to domestic-violence and sexual-assault cases? 

399
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,420
 Can't I help you with the real-estate case? 

400
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,050
 Hey! 

401
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,980
 These cases are more important than real-estate fraud.  

402
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,470
 They're the "Korean, English, Math" of our criminal investigation department. 

403
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,660
 What's "Korean, English, Math"? The basics! 

404
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,990
 You need to support us on the basics! You're a specialist, too.  

405
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,000
 I believe in you! 

406
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,530
 Where's he gone now ...? 

407
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,560
   

408
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,950
 Leave the menial chores to the kid who does the basics. 

409
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,260
 You need good cases to get into the special division, right? 

410
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,050
 Thank you! 

411
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,700
 What ... What's up? 

412
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,450
 You're unfair, Director. 

413
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,060
 What. What? 

414
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,740
 I mean, you're unfair overall, I can't place a finger on it. 

415
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,210
 The most unfair thing of all, though, is that I'm not Pushover 1, 

416
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,350
 nor Pushover 2, but Pushover 3! 

417
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,620
 So it seems I'm not Pushovers 1 nor 2, 

418
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,390
 but Pushover 3. However I try, Pushover 3! 

419
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,020
 So is that how I'm going to be treated, rolled up in the dust? 

420
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,090
   

421
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,770
 That was when Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju decided to escape the title of Pushover. 

422
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,110
 The world mocked her for having neither money nor a powerful backer, 

423
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,140
 so Nuna became a rooster full of anger 

424
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,030
 and became determined to climb to the top. 

425
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,080
 Nuna isn't someone who's loyal to the higher-ups. 

426
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,910
 She's someone trying to climb above them. 

427
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,520
Shall we begin? 
      

428
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,260
As you all know, today's main agenda concerns the appointment of Yumin Group's leader.

429
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,690
At the previous general shareholders' meeting, there were scary rumors

430
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,340
that Ms. Kang Mi Na hurt her head in an accident,

431
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,520
and she's now sometimes irrational.

432
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,450
The health of the leader is directly linked to the stock price.

433
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,010
So is she going to be able to manage the Group properly?

434
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,010
After the accident, I was poorly for a while from shock,

435
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,890
but I'm fine now.

436
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,440
But even if you didn't injure your head, what difference does it make?

437
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,370
Right after graduating from a 4-year college in Korea, you got married and stayed at home!

438
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:39,550
It reminds me of a company that gave a president position to their daughter, a housewife taking care of a baby,

439
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,070
and almost went bankrupt.

440
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,510
Someone like her can destroy a company in the blink of an eye!

441
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,410
You haven't studied abroad, nor majored in Business Management.

442
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,300
There has to be a limit to how lucky you can get.

443
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,200
Honestly, she's not a legitimate successor of our Yumin Group.

444
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,830
According to your family and educational background,

445
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,330
it would be perfect for you to bring in a foreign bakery and run it!

446
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,190
Talking about that ...

447
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,270
Honestly, she's not related to you at all, Sister-in-law!

448
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:14,270
So a relation of hers can pop up later, or  some other messy problem of that sort.

449
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,960
Stop scaring her! I think she must have understood it well enough.

450
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,070
If we run board-based management from now on,

451
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,870
there'll be no big problem, whoever the CEO might be.

452
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,990
Isn't that right?

453
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,610
  This feels very familiar somehow.  

454
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,950
  No matter how hard I try,   

455
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,370
  it seems I'm not Pushovers 1 nor 2, but Pushover 3! 
    

456
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,250
  An illegitimate child survived and became the heir by a stroke of luck.  

457
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,050
  No matter how hard I try,   

458
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,310
  they have no intention of accepting me in the first place.  

459
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,720
So, you're saying I should be the pushover of Yumin Group,

460
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,580
do the hard work, and take all the insults.

461
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,860
It's really hard to suppress my temper ...

462
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,630
Excuse me! My younger aunt's eldest son, Executive director of Yumin Chemicals, Oh Gi Yeong!

463
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,540
You said the stock price is doing whatever because I injured my head.

464
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:20,290
Then how did you manage the company to make the  stock price drop by 27% from the previous quarter when your head wasn't even hurt?

465
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,780
Hey ..! T-The sales have a surplus.

466
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,750
Are you saying you're proud earning 10,000 won  (≈$8.40)  from 10 million won  (≈$8,400) ?

467
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,100
Next! My mother's youngest brother, Seo Hyeon Gu, CEO of Yumin Insurance.

468
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,110
You begged Mother to give you Yumin  Chemicals,

469
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,650
but you were pushed into Insurance because of gambling scandals.

470
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,640
Are you selling insurance here?

471
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,710
Don't try to provoke anxiety.

472
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,300
That company went bankrupt, not because the CEO is a housewife,

473
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,650
but because it's a nepotistic, family-run business where they gave seats to whoever begged for them!

474
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,830
Next, Aunt! Yumin Pharmaceutical is the one that got lucky.

475
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,870
That arteriosclerosis treatment you failed to develop ...

476
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,220
somehow became famous for treating erectile dysfunction and was a hit.

477
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,660
You know best that luck can happen in life.

478
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,960
But I guess you don't like someone else getting lucky?

479
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,320
Next! The first husband of my deceased eldest aunt, Chairman Choi Tae Seok of Yumin Foods.

480
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,590
Are you related by blood to my mother at all?

481
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,260
Next! The second husband of my deceased eldest aunt, Chairman Heo Nam Guk of Yumin Distribution.

482
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,650
I'll just pass.

483
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,040
If you state your shameful bias in front of anybody,

484
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,500
no one will want to talk to you anymore,

485
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,080
so you'll get weeded out naturally.

486
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,000
Weeded out..!

487
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,490
Hey! Stop right there!

488
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,440
That position is yours only because you're the owner's family.

489
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,750
You should be thankful we're this considerate!

490
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,820
Being considerate is not our duty!

491
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,860
You got that right.

492
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,630
Saying things nicely is not my duty either.

493
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,130
So, appoint me now while I'm speaking nicely.

494
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:57,460
All of you here have no capability and live in houses bought for you by my father, Chairman Kang Jang Su.

495
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,930
My father took you out of jail!

496
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,210
He gave you company president positions. So think wisely.

497
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,670
There's only one chance.

498
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,000
Will you trust a bunch of people who can't do anything without my father,

499
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,840
or will you trust me who actually has my father's blood?

500
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,500
  A speck of dust? Ha!  

501
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,930
  I'll show you how scary dust is  

502
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,610
  by stepping on top of you and climbing up!  

503
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,700
     

504
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,160
Director! What brings you here today?

505
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,570
Oh, you came early to prepare.

506
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,730
Of course.

507
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,030
By the way ... I heard you're having an audition soon for the current affairs debate program.

508
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,860
How do you know that. It's a secret.

509
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,790
I'm sorry?

510
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,230
Well, I should know about it as well. I heard it in the anchors' room.

511
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,250
My goodness. People have such big mouths.

512
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,380
I was trying to do it with new people.

513
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,320
Good luck with your work.

514
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,040
It's breaking news. Please, check it first.

515
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,470
Did you also play golf?

516
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,910
How many times do you go to the office in a week?

517
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,160
If you go to the office too often, there's no time to spend money.

518
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,100
Why do we hire people who graduate from good schools?

519
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,250
We hire them to work instead of us.

520
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,630
Oppa, you should try harder and go to work less.

521
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,740
I bet the company will do way better than it does now!

522
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,800
It doesn't have to do way better.

523
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,640
My dream is very humble in the first place.

524
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,040
I might not be able to make what I received multiply three-fold,

525
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,540
but at least let's not reduce it to one-third.

526
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,870
But what can you do?

527
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,220
I think it can be 13 times more now!

528
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,240
What do you mean?

529
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,410
 Yumin Group, still in shock from the owner's family dying in a recent plane crash, 

530
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:01,960
  appointed Ms. Kang Mi Na as their new leader today with unanimous agreement by the board of directors.  

531
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,870
  - She is now the youngest leader of the nation's top 20 groups.   
 - Hey ...

532
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,840
Do you think Nuna will keep me in check from now on?

533
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,080
Why would she keep you in check?

534
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,240
The younger sister-in-law's weakness right now is that she's married to you.

535
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,660
I bet some people are devastated right now.

536
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,410
  After Chairman Kang Jang Su's abrupt demise, an emergency board of directors' meeting was convened  

537
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,060
  and voted for Ms. Kang Mi Na's leader appointment— 

538
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,790
What are you wearing right now?

539
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,990
There was a donation marathon for a children's hospital at the Han River today.

540
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,390
The Hanju Foundation sponsored it.

541
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,990
For every 1 km, 100,000 won  (≈$85)  gets donated .

542
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,760
You forced us to create a foundation to increase your stake, and now you forcefully made an event?

543
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,310
If you want to build a hospital, ask your parents. Why have this miserable scene?

544
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,360
Do you think I went because I didn't have money?

545
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,590
The mayor came, and the TV cameras came,

546
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,240
so I went to make an impression.

547
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,000
If I don't do these kinds of things, since my husband has passed on,

548
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,680
nobody will know whose daughter-in-law I am!

549
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,670
I'm doing all this so my Seon Wu doesn't get overlooked.

550
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,490
Sure, get noticed and work as much as you can,

551
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,540
so you don't fall behind Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

552
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,990
  The Yumin Group seems to have overcome the acute crisis for the group's succession.  

553
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:37,590
  It is predicted that the ranking of Chairwoman Kang Mi Na, daughter-in-law of Hanju, will rise sharply within the group.  

554
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,230
 - Chairwoman Kang Mi Na ...  
- Look at her ...

555
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,020
I can bear for me to be pushed back,

556
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,010
but I can't take it if my Seon Wu gets pushed back.

557
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,750
     

558
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,060
     

559
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,980
 Yes, I'm ready. 

560
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,260
 Both me and the painting. 

561
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,510
 Are you coming in soon? 

562
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,250
 I'm here! 

563
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,940
 Somebody sniffed the scent and followed me, so it took some time. 

564
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,020
 What? But there's no problem with me going out, is there? 

565
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,220
 Don't worry about it. 

566
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,110
 The person who was chasing after me was hit by a car and died. 

567
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,560
She definitely got on a boat and left the country ...

568
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,340
What the heck is going on?

569
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:14,110
Why did she climb all the way up there just to make me drag her down?

570
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,730
How did it go?

571
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,750
They'll barge in soon.

572
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,490
I didn't mean I was leaving, but I guess it didn't mean I was waiting either.

573
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,670
I'm Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun from Seopyeong Branch Office.

574
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,030
All right, wait one second, please. You can't go in.

575
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,410
I have to go inside.

576
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,860
There's a risk that the suspect might flee. So let me just check first.

577
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,780
Ah, you don't understand what I'm saying.

578
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,740
We have to call our legal team first.

579
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,130
I get that. Put me on the phone with your legal team.

580
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,230
What are you doing? You know how things work. Don't go too far.

581
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,230
If you barge in like this, then you might get in trouble later.

582
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,420
Also, even if you go upstairs, you will come out like this.

583
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,710
But we should still go upstairs.

584
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,760
Thank you for your concern, but I'll have to go "too far."

585
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,080
Go upstairs first. I'll follow after talking to their legal team.

586
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,290
  - I said, you can't go inside! 
 - Get them! Stop them!  

587
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,540
I don't know anymore. Well, I became the chairwoman, right?

588
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,540
It's good for Kang Mi Na.

589
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,220
  I said, you can't go inside! My goodness!  

590
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,520
Ms. Kang Mi Na, I'm an investigator from the Seopyeong Branch Office.

591
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,080
There was a report that you took drugs. Please follow me.

592
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,730
Drugs? Me?

593
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,660
Isn't it true?

594
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,020
- I don't know about that. 
 - Ah, right.

595
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,730
- Please, come with us. 
 - Wait a second!

596
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,630
Article 199 of Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act!

597
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,870
What did I just say?

598
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,490
  Regarding drugs, nobody would bring a warrant unless you're caught in action.  

599
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,810
  According to Article 199, 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act, following the principle of voluntary investigation, an investigator must receive the verbal consent of the person ...  

600
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,860
What is it? Let's talk at the office.

601
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,910
Wait, wait!

602
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,810
Warrant ... Do you have a warrant?

603
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:37,740
I can't go. It's only legitimate voluntary accompaniment ...

604
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,150
when it is clearly proven that accompaniment was made by the voluntary will ...

605
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,180
of the suspect ...

606
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,200
What's going on? Ms. Kang Mi Na? Are you all right?

607
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,910
  I'm not ... I'm not Kang Mi Na.  

608
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,300
Where are you from?

609
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,760
If you forcibly take her now, then it's an illegal arrest!

610
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,360
- Who are you? 
 - Let me talk to her for a second.

611
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,060
Why is the prosecutor not coming upstairs?

612
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,010
Are you all right?

613
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,450
Don't worry and go. If it's a trap for Kang Mi Na, then you won't get caught.

614
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,800
I know. Because I'm not Kang Mi Na.

615
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,380
Did you know about that?

616
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,390
Did you also know about that?

617
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,530
Ms. Kang Mi Na!

618
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,310
I'm from Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. Please follow me.

619
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,730
Excuse me. How many times do I have to say the same thing?

620
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,500
Hello? Hello!

621
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,260
Why do they hang up all of a sudden?

622
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,560
What happened?

623
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,030
While their legal team stalled for time with you, they called the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

624
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,200
It out of our hands now.

625
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,610
The deputy general director and the department chief all went to dinner

626
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,200
and contacted me saying we should cover up things as much as possible.

627
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,130
If she gave her hair without hesitation, it means she's not feeling guilty of anything.

628
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,480
Since we'll be letting her go anyway, let's just kill time until the test result comes out.

629
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,810
Hey, why don't you go in there?

630
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,360
M-Me?

631
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,800
Yes.

632
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,380
My head was splitting before.

633
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,350
I thought she was a housewife. What has she been doing?

634
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,270
Illegal drugs?

635
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,740
Where did she even get those?

636
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,640
Oh, you're here!

637
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,710
Have a seat.

638
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,570
That's my seat, and you should sit on the other side.

639
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,030
I'm sorry.

640
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,620
You're here today because Seopyeong Branch Office received a report about you taking illegal drugs.

641
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,260
We're running a simple urine test,

642
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,460
and your hair was sent to the National Forensic Service. We need to get the test result, but—

643
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,200
So am I only suspected of taking drugs, not supplying them?

644
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,810
I'm sorry? That's what I know.

645
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,150
Usually, the supplier gets a harsher sentence than the drug user,

646
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,780
so if my urine test is negative, there won't be an issue.

647
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,890
I feel that the drug dealer gave you my name in order to get away from it.

648
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,980
Actually, that's the weird part.

649
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,010
The Seopyeong Branch Office arrested some petty gangsters who suddenly stated

650
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:01,800
that there was a daughter-in-law of the Hanju Group at the meeting where they supplied drugs.

651
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,390
Are you saying that you guys barged into the chairwoman's office based on just that statement?

652
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,990
I believe there was confidence that you took the drugs. But that's not the important part.

653
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,960
They stated that when they supply 0.5 g of methamphetamine in a plastic bag,

654
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,680
celebrities and chaebol children

655
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,800
put it in three disposable syringes, in triplicate,

656
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,070
dilute it in drinking water, and shoot it in their arms.

657
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,910
That is a detailed explanation.

658
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,220
Why is he reporting to her?

659
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,240
These are the gangsters. Do you recognize anyone?

660
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,830
I wouldn't remember them.

661
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,840
- Ah, is that so. 
 - "Ah, is that so"?

662
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,380
You just say this, and that's all?

663
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,620
If I say I don't remember something, then you should bring some evidence!

664
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,850
They haven't submitted any evidence yet.

665
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,000
Won't you take it if they don't submit it?

666
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,150
You should yell at them to give it to you! So, will you seize my tablet or cell phone?

667
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,620
These days, human rights' violation is a big issue! You don't have any charges yet, so I can't do that.

668
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,910
My goodness. Listen, the basics in suspect investigation

669
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:08,850
involves stabbing them in the back. But if you follow the book step by step, when will you surprise me?

670
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,720
It looks as if you plan to just let me go!

671
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,620
That's why the prosecution gets criticized for letting people off easily!

672
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,840
Look again, carefully!

673
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,500
If you do it this way, you'll get arrested.

674
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,200
Yumin's new chairwoman is not an easy person.

675
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,570
But why do I feel like I've seen her a lot somewhere?

676
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,180
Look again, carefully!

677
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,850
Where would you have met the daughter-in-law of Hanju?

678
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,330
All these government workers, working half-heartedly. They don't have the will to do it right.

679
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,340
If they use forensics methods, Kang Mi Na's tablet will unlock as well.

680
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,600
This place doesn't even have instant coffee—

681
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,710
They do have it. It's right here.

682
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,770
Right, it looked as if the instant coffee would be in here.

683
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,070
- Hey! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

684
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,440
You haven't been in for a while. I was worried. Now I see you here!

685
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,940
- M-Me? 
 - Did you think I wouldn't recognize you just because you put on some make up?

686
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,840
You'll pay your tab, right?

687
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,830
You said your mouth gets all thorny if you don't eat gamjatang* every three days, so I was wondering.
  (spicy pork bone soup)  .

688
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,850
Come and eat soon.

689
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,270
Your Lordship! I'm here!

690
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,510
Isn't it too much for me to deliver all the way in here?

691
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,850
It's on the house, only for today!

692
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,720
I think I'm meeting you for the first time. I'm Hanju's legal team leader.

693
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,450
The chairman made a call to Yumin's legal team, and arranged for me to come instead of them.

694
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,880
From now on, madam, everything related to you

695
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,960
will be taken care of by Hanju's legal team.

696
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,350
How come the Yumin side agreed so easily to that?

697
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,850
Nobody talks back when Hanju's chairman gets personally involved.

698
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,360
- They just do what he says. Well, why don't we go? 
 - Go where?

699
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,190
The urine test came out negative, so you can go home.

700
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,540
The National Forensics Service's thorough test will come out in about three weeks.

701
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,450
But the simple test was very clean, so they say the risk of a different result is next to zero.

702
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,900
All right, then. Let's go.

703
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,400
Did she leave without a problem?

704
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,720
The test result came out negative.

705
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,280
But the drug can be detected for up to six months through the hair.

706
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,960
Did Yumin make some arrangement with them?

707
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,140
I mean, we can't change the test result.

708
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,060
Are you saying the woman got switched or what?

709
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,680
What were you mixing into the painkiller until now?

710
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,600
Thankfully, before she was taken to Seopyeong, I cut in and had her taken to the Central District's Prosecutors' Office instead. 
      

711
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,100
Also, the test result had no issue, so it got resolved well.

712
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,510
But I don't understand why you're so angry!

713
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,790
What if there were an issue? Do you think it would've been still resolved well?

714
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,980
The Central District's Prosecutors' Office sent me a summons,

715
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,290
and the rural district's office barged into the company's office and took my daughter-in-law away!

716
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,710
When did we become such a punching bag?

717
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,750
I promised you that I'd resolve it all well,

718
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,690
so please have some faith in me.

719
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,400
Are you asking me to trust the promise or the one who made that promise?

720
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,290
I don't trust anybody! I only trust the promise!

721
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,170
  We've had a connection for a long time.   

722
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,710
But if it doesn't get resolved again as you promised, I won't take it anymore.

723
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,310
Connection, what a joke.

724
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,500
He's more like a snare now.

725
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,080
The chairman did rush it slightly.

726
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,000
He can't let Yumin know about your condition, even if he's fighting against them.

727
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,540
Wait, what "condition"?

728
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,370
I'm in a perfectly normal condition. I breezed through that drug test as if it were nothing.

729
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,000
You can relax around me.

730
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,260
I signed six pages of contract stating I will never talk

731
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,660
about your slight memory loss.

732
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,300
Then you should have told me earlier!

733
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,660
I mean, why six pages of contract?

734
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,840
Ah, well, I'm nothing but an employee.

735
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,750
If this gets known, Hanju has more to lose.

736
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,630
One page is for the case where I say something about your condition.

737
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,630
Another one is for the case it is found out because of me, even though I don't reveal it myself.

738
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,110
Or again, if I do reveal it, and it's advantageous to the group!

739
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,550
Or the case where I don't say it but it gets revealed, and it still benefits the group.

740
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,360
Well, there were several possible cases.

741
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,520
Whatever the case, I have to pay enormous compensation.

742
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:30,140
So don't worry at all about your memory loss being revealed by me.

743
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,500
Have you been waiting this whole time?

744
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,700
What happened?

745
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,670
They must have gotten Kang Mi Na's name from the drug supplier,

746
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,450
but this woman, she must have been born with heaven's luck.

747
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,600
I made her the head of the group without her lifting a finger,

748
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,130
and passed the drug check. Now I just have to pass the bar exam for her.

749
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,330
What is it?

750
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,640
How did you know you're not Kang Mi Na?

751
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,710
- Ah, is that—?
 - Since when did you know?

752
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,750
Is it since the accident?

753
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,920
I seriously didn't know!

754
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,660
I, I just thought something was strange since the shareholders' meeting.

755
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,420
Isn't it you who made me successfully pass through the shareholders' meeting?

756
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,990
Wait. Then you, when did you know I wasn't Kang Mi Na?

757
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,880
Did you help me with the shareholders' meeting despite knowing that?

758
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,270
So what's happening is

759
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,910
she knew she's not Kang Mi Na,

760
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:38,210
and you basically admitted that you know she's not Kang Mi Na, which let her know you know!

761
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,280
What? You knew too, Team Leader?

762
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:49,490
Six pages of contract? Your acting astounds me.

763
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,940
So? What are you going to do? It's not as if you can quietly hide her someplace else now.

764
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,280
Listen to this ajeossi! Who do you think I am to hide me somewhere?

765
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,760
- Who are you?
 - Me?

766
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,420
I ...

767
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,490
I might be a secret daughter of that Yumin Group chairman!

768
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,600
I look so much like his real daughter after all!

769
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,750
No, that's not the case.

770
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,980
We looked at that theory in every possible way.

771
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,000
Are you certain?

772
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,040
You must have had that 1% of hope that you were actually a chaebol's daughter.

773
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,290
Who had hope?

774
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,040
Then what on earth are you guys thinking?

775
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,460
You are useful for us to watch the situation

776
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,000
while we're searching for the real Mi Na.

777
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,030
But this kind of person,

778
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:37,440
can she actually keep her identity a secret until we find the real Kang Mi Na?

779
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,280
Look here.

780
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,810
I've done amazingly well hiding this secret on my own until now.

781
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,500
But ...

782
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,180
Why can't you guys reveal the fact I'm not Kang Mi Na?

783
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,960
Oh? You must be planning something.

784
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,820
You put me in that leader seat despite knowing I'm a fake,

785
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,240
and you signed six pages of contract

786
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,940
pledging you won't reveal Kang Mi Na's amnesia ... So what are the reasons behind all this?

787
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,770
The accident you had ...

788
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,500
We're starting to think it wasn't an accident but an attack planned by someone.

789
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,990
Wha ... Then whom were they trying to hit? Me, or Kang Mi Na?

790
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:26,540
We don't know. But given that someone's going after Kang Mi Na by accusing her of drugs, it was probably her.

791
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,160
Woah. You people are a scary bunch, huh?

792
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,930
Why are you telling me this now? What's the point of me living as Kang Mi Na then?

793
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,650
That's why we're asking you to keep the façade until we find her.

794
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,740
Do you think I'm mad and that I'll risk my life? I'd rather reveal it!

795
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,230
Do you want to be jailed for impersonation?

796
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,090
You think Hanju's going to stay still?

797
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:48,100
Mister who signed the compensation contract! This isn't the time to talk as though it's someone else's business.

798
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,690
You think I'll stay still?

799
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,540
I'll say we're joint offenders and planned it all!

800
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,530
You've heard these terms from somewhere, haven't you?

801
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:58,300
You might not get away safely before you even start accusing us!

802
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,120
Then hurry up and find this woman!

803
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,860
Whether it's accidents or drugs, I don't want this kind of trouble anymore!

804
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,910
How can she be so different, despite having the same face?

805
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,990
Let's go, Ajeossi.

806
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,710
I think you'll have to drive yourself.

807
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,430
I'll drop by Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju's office, since I'm here.

808
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,240
   

809
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,050
The prosecutors' office is full of hard-working people, isn't it?

810
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,990
How could they have gotten off this early?

811
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,370
How can I help you?

812
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:55,230
I'm here to meet prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju.

813
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,020
Oh, well ...

814
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,810
   

815
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,760
You haven't heard back from Ahn Yu Jun?

816
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,470
No. Not yet.

817
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,690
 I don't think anyone knows besides me.  

818
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,270
 She repeatedly asked me to keep it a secret. 

819
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:16,030
 Should I look into Lee Bong Sik? 

820
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,510
Gosh ... what's up with this guy?

821
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,340
You. Report Prosecutor Jo as missing, now.

822
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,700
- I'm sorry? 
 - I think I'll personally have to find out

823
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,400
what she's doing and where.

824
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,970
Then, did Ms Kang Mi Na really do drugs?

825
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,860
I mean, don't you think the same? She's head of the group.

826
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,820
It would be a crazy move for the prosecution

827
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:50,230
to barge into the chairwoman's office with only a tip and no material proof nor solid evidence.

828
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,560
Where the heck is this woman?

829
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,450
There must be traces of her whereabouts on the day of the accident somewhere.

830
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,590
Were any tablets connected to Mi Na's phone?

831
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:05,730
There is one, but there's a fingerprint lock and a six-digit passcode. How am I meant to break through that?

832
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,250
There is one?

833
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,880
You should have unlocked it somehow! What were you doing until now?

834
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,220
What was I—?! I was waking up at dawn to do house chores, memorizing

835
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,810
background information of people I just met, and was investigated by the prosecution!

836
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,080
And what have you done, then?

837
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,280
You've been ordering me around all this while. I really don't like you!

838
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,560
I've been doing things here and there!

839
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,180
"Here and there". What here and there?

840
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,930
Embroidering this jacket here and here?

841
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:37,170
I mean, if you knew someone hit me on purpose, you should have looked into why they attacked an innocent person!

842
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,010
I was going to look into it after the board meeting!

843
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,920
The assailant's unconscious anyway!

844
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,670
You weren't even present at the board meeting, so why wait until it's over?

845
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,100
You could have asked around ages ago!

846
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,190
See? You're always trying to put in the least effort possible.

847
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:53,560
So why do I need to sit and try every possible passcode from 000000 on the tablet?

848
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,960
I'd rather use that energy to live brainwashing myself into believing I'm Kang Mi Na!

849
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,570
How long do you think you can act as Kang Mi Na, when you can't even unlock a tablet?

850
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,540
And do you think I'll stay put if you live that way?

851
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,780
If you don't stay still, you think I'll stay still?

852
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,800
I'll drag you guys down with me like a water ghost

853
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,760
and say you schemed with a fake Kang Mi Na! Aish!

854
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,420
Sure, go ahead and do that if you want to ruin us all.

855
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,970
I seriously have the worst luck.

856
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,650
I should be saying that.

857
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,840
Anyway, cooperating is the best deal for you too.

858
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,820
I'll put you back in your original position without any trouble, as long as Mi Na returns safely.

859
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,630
How am I supposed to believe you?

860
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,710
You must have forgotten, since I was driving,

861
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,250
but I'm the largest shareholder of your company, got it?

862
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,100
You think I can't do that for one person?

863
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,050
Ah, right. That was so, wasn't it?

864
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:56,440
I mean, I hurt my head, remember? Try to understand.

865
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,300
I do forget.

866
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,940
You say you hurt your head whenever you feel at a disadvantage.

867
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:09,450
The reporter at the prosecutors' office told everyone in the newsroom about a woman who was summonsed

868
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:12,290
and who yelled at them for not doing their jobs properly!

869
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:16,070
What's with your wife? How can she have changed so suddenly?

870
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,060
Something happened, right?

871
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,330
That woman ...

872
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,620
But she ...

873
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,280
Excuse me, you're with me right now.

874
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:37,210
She is ... smiling?

875
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,710
She's a married woman, damn it..!

876
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,980
Hey!

877
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,220
I mean, honey!

878
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,600
You're doing amazingly well. Ha.

879
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,920
Your wife was falsely accused and dragged to the prosecutor's, and barely managed to escape by fighting on her own,

880
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,630
and you still shamelessly get out of that car on such a day?

881
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,850
No ... She just came over again—

882
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,950
Forget it!

883
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,490
Then what are you ... I'm talking ...!

884
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,770
Hyeong. Why are you suddenly appearing around that woman?

885
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,790
You need to discern things.

886
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:27,710
Whether you really want her, or you are bitter about losing her to someone else.

887
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,890
Watch your words.

888
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,770
Me? Why should I be careful around you?

889
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,170
I've nothing to be scared of, all right?

890
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:42,890
Isn't that something only people who don't need to suck up to others can say?

891
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,850
Like me.

892
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,630
- What?
 - That's not your case.

893
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,530
Sister-in-law, the man who just dropped you off ...

894
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,510
Isn't he our cousin-in-law?

895
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:15,180
The one who sided with you. The largest shareholder of the company.

896
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:19,490
The people in this family are all such human CCTVs.

897
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,410
After I got married,

898
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:26,190
I felt a little uncomfortable meeting a man alone, whoever he may be.

899
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,090
I'm not trying to criticize you.

900
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,220
People say being a loose woman is also a talent, these days.

901
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,110
What?

902
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:37,320
Go inside. Father and Mother are waiting for you.

903
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,910
Oh, all right.

904
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,660
Good going!

905
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,530
I can't believe you were summonsed to the Prosecutors' Office over some trashy scandal ...

906
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,650
Be quiet!

907
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,400
I heard that ...

908
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,330
you sure showed your spirit at the Prosecutors' Office.

909
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,930
Based on how you've dealt with things until now, you passed the test.

910
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:12,890
Be sure to stay alert going forward. Got it?

911
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:16,290
Father, it's not as if I submitted an application to you or something.

912
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,710
Why do you decide whether I've passed or not?

913
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,870
Why not decide to do breakfast meetings at the hotel every day going forward?

914
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,770
So I won't have to prepare breakfast.

915
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,870
Fine. You have to go to work starting tomorrow.

916
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,400
So don't worry about house chores for now.

917
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,050
Go upstairs and get some rest.

918
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,190
Come again? I just threw it out there ...

919
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:37,680
Father! Thank you!

920
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,960
Then who's going to do the housework? You said not to hire any help.

921
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,710
The eldest daughter-in-law could handle the housework.

922
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:52,680
Father, I have no time due to my work at the foundation and volunteer work.

923
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,310
That work doesn't earn money, it only spends it!

924
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,260
He's fallen

925
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,500
head over heels for his second daughter-in-law.

926
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,720
The pecking order keeps changing by the minute.

927
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,450
All this time, you should've scored some points with Mi Na.

928
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,080
You weren't that nice to her, either, Agassi!

929
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,790
I tend to be difficult with people I like.

930
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,010
That girl!

931
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:42,620
 I mean, if you knew someone hit me on purpose, you should have looked into why they attacked an innocent person! 

932
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,310
 Or at least ask around for information. 

933
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,130
Ask around?

934
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,600
Ask around!

935
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,580
Who orders whom around now?

936
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,510
Do I look like I'll do anything she tells me to?

937
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:04,490
   

938
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,620
She has some interesting skills.

939
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,940
- How is the patient?
 - He's all right.

940
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,080
Are you with Mr. Jang Seok Ho?

941
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,110
How can I help you?

942
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:33,610
I'm here to ask about the accident at the Hanju Hotel.

943
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:37,530
Are you a reporter? We have nothing to say.

944
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:42,140
If you have questions, contact the PR office at Hanju Hotel.

945
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,550
Did the Hanju people pay you a visit?

946
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,540
Please leave.

947
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,910
   

948
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,560
Which company's reporter are you?

949
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,960
I'm a reporter from Power Point.

950
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,420
That ajumma is unyielding.

951
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:08,440
Honestly, it's thanks to the reporters who badmouthed Managing Director Han Seong Hye

952
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,000
that she doesn't have to pay any compensation to the hotel, and got money on top of it.

953
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,580
But ever since the Hanju people came by, her lips are sealed.

954
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,270
What did you ask her?

955
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,700
About the Hanju daughter-in-law.

956
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,380
She's never been exposed to the media, so we have no source to go by.

957
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,020
Imagine how desperate I am to have come all the way here?

958
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,080
What sort of information could that ajumma have?

959
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,500
As for that, just a word is enough for a reporter

960
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,650
to elaborate on.

961
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:38,160
I wonder, how much did she get from Hanju that she won't even open her mouth?

962
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,580
Anyway, I feel sorry for her husband. She's definitely got a good life ahead of her now.

963
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,830
People in our country seem to always badmouth chaebol families. But they love stories about them.

964
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:50,290
But since there are so many articles on them about their power trips and whatnot...

965
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,260
small meaningless stories don't catch the public's attention.

966
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,480
So which news media do you work for? Did you find out anything?

967
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,950
Let's help each other.

968
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,360
   

969
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,980
Is it an English paper? You write in English?

970
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,200
   

971
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,730
Ask me if you have any questions.

972
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:19,580
You said people like to talk about chaebol families.

973
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,830
I mean, well ...

974
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,650
When you report, mind your manners.

975
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,620
Don't you know that an individual's right to his image and body comes before the media's right to report?

976
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,320
But what brings you here...?

977
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,990
Go ahead if you want to elaborate and make up any story.

978
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,640
But if you publish what happens in this hospital without the source's consent,

979
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,200
I'll take civil action right away.

980
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,840
Go on.

981
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,450
Oh, all right.

982
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,370
Her slap was way too confident.

983
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,480
 Oh, my gosh! 

984
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,450
 You said your mouth gets all thorny if you don't eat gamjatang every three days,  

985
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,230
 so I was wondering where you'd been! 

986
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:18,790
If what she says is correct, I loved gamjatang

987
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,260
and ate on credit all the time.

988
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,940
 Your Lordship! I'm here! 

989
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,850
Someone else called me "your ladyship", too.

990
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:32,670
 Aigoo, Your Ladyship. I can't believe I'm running into you here. 

991
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:36,220
 Wasn't that tip really great? Did you already make a killing with it? 

992
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,760
That's right! That conman!

993
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,000
Then ... that means that by "Your Ladyship"...

994
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,460
he was calling me a prosecutor?

995
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,700
Wait a minute. I'm extremely intelligent ...

996
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,530
I adapt to any circumstance, and know all kinds of legal matters.

997
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:54,150
Someone in the Prosecutors' Office recognized me

998
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,920
and someone even called me "your ladyship."

999
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,550
Could I have been ...

1000
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:17,600


1001
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,610
   

1002
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:33,790
   

1003
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,800
   

1004
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,970
 Damn it, this is irrefutable proof. 

1005
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:50,860
 If I'm not Kang Mi Na, where is the real Kang Mi Na right now? 

1006

1012
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:43,210
 Anyway, let's work well together, Mr. Double Agent Team Leader. 

1013
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,500
 You really can't get in touch with Jo Yeon Ju? 

1014
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,690
 I also saw Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju yesterday. 

1015
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,280
 What kind of crazy nonsense is she up to? 

1016
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,750
 No one knows anything about her personal life. 

1017
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,080
 Could it be that Kang Mi Na is choosing to hide? 

1018
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,510
 Let's see how she deals with the situation this time too. 

1019
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:58,510
 They must be looking down on me since I'm a young woman. 

1020
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,420
 Wow, Father, you have amazing charisma. 

1021
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,390
 Why do I have to clean up after this Kang Mi Na's crap? 

1022
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,500
 I must keep thinking you're Mi Na. 

1023
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,770
 Since it's come to that, how about you start all over?
