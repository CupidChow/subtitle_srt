1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,730
Chairwoman Kang Mi Na has given me her proxy.

2
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,440
You can speak with me going forward.

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,800
Isn't it cheating to suddenly jump in like this? 
    

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,550
I didn't know this fight had rules.

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,590
Don't be so prickly with me.

6
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,180
Let's try to get to a win-win for both of us.

7
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,450
This thing called "Business" doesn't always go well

8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,370
just because you try your hardest on your own.

9
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,380
I know.

10
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,940
Like Hanju Fashion in the past.

11
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,850


12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,230
This is a report by the American Prix Fund.

13
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,580
It states that the due diligence* done by Hanju Hotel was insufficient, 
 (voluntary investigation to establish a business' assets and liabilities in view of a sale or merger) 

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,680
and the evaluation* favors Hanju. 
 (determination of the current worth of a business) 

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,180
I'll request a re-evaluation

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,080
from an outside auditor of my choice.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,960
You're going too far.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,920
Are you suggesting we committed fraud while preparing due diligence?

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,580
Am I ...

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,180
going too far?

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,810
I'm just following your example.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,470
Just like when you revealed my father's accounting fraud.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,630
But I didn't make it an external issue so as to safeguard the honor of your deceased father.

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,820
Oh, you were being considerate toward my father?

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,280
But you're well aware that in "Business,"

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,420
just because you give something to someone, the recipient may not always pay you back.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,700
However, if you know their weakness,

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,260
then you might get something back from them.

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,140
 I'm sure you've heard, 

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,290
 It looks like Seong Hye was planning  

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,500
 to reveal your father's accounting fraud. 

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,720
 So he might have been trying to move the ledgers elsewhere. 

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,520
 Or maybe he was trying to burn them because he thought it was too late... 

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,110
 The foolish man... 

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,570
 Because of those ledgers, he couldn't get out of the factory even though it was on fire.  

36
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,790
 Uncle, 

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,280
 you know my father wasn't like that. 

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,890
 Please look into it again. All these years, my father  

39
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,120
 has given so much of himself to Hanju Fashion and Nuna Seong Hye! 

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,500
 My father would never do that.  

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,720
 I see you don't know. 

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,980
 That's how business is.  

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,870
 Just because you give something to someone, the recipient won't always pay you back.  

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,970
 However, if you know their weakness, 

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,660
 you might receive something. 

46
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,210
Seung Wuk,

47
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,160
I almost thought we were fighting just now.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,640
We're not going to work together trying to find each other's weaknesses, so why are you saying such things?

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,820
I hope you're right.

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,210
When the re-evaluation is complete, let's talk again.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,730
He's too similar to his father.

52
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,090
If only his father had stayed out of it back then,

53
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,420
it wouldn't have been such an inconvenience to so many people.

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,470
The prosecutor who wanted to meet with me

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,140
was you?

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,140
I heard that you refused all interviews,

57
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,940
so I used my role as prosecutor to request one.

58
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,680
I heard that you had become

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,220
a prosecutor.

60
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,760
As for me,

61
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,000
there's not much going on.

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm eating

63
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,460
and exercising regularly,

64
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,500
and watching TV,

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,600
and doing the work I'm told to do.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,420
My prison funds are meager,

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,280
but I can still

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,420
buy what I want to eat,

69
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,540
and write letters.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,340
Why did you do it?

71
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,310
 Ajeossi! 

72
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,100
 No other car passes there apart from the factory workers' cars going in and out. 

73
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,810
 It's not like there's a witness! There's nothing we can do. 

74
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,720
 There must be a speed camera on a nearby road somewhere! 

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,820
 The cameras in that area don't work, 

76
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,640
  they're just there for show! 

77
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,390
 We don't have the manpower right now either! 

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,710
 Just go home and wait!  

79
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,740
 We'll call you if we find something! 

80
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,010
 Whose fault is it that we're low on manpower? 

81
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,320
 In any case, the whole family is a problem. 

82
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,460
 Like father like daughter. 

83
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,360
 Hey, go. What are you doing making a scene at the police station? 

84
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,390
 Gangster bastard. You just got out and you already committed arson? 

85
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,040
 If everyone set fire to their company after being fired, 

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,600
 there would be no companies left. 

87
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,860
I endured being looked down on all my life as the daughter of a gangster.

88
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,210
Were you that upset about being fired

89
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,300
because you were a gangster?

90
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,820
Why did you say you were going to set a fire,

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,250
making Grandma run out of the house that night and get hit by a car?

92
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,670
Why did you actually set the fire,

93
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,140
so all the ambulances that should have come to Grandma went to that site instead? Why?

94
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,160
I really didn't know that

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,350
- she would come running like that. 
 - What?

96
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,310
- Yeon Ju. 
 - Don't say my name.

97
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,900
She went running to you,

98
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,350
saying that despite it all, you were still her son.

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,790
And even with what happened,

100
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,230
as she closed her eyes in her last moments,

101
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,880
she told me not to blame anyone.

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,040
But no.

103
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,950
It was because of you.

104
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,280
Because of you,

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,560
Grandma died.

106
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,920
Do you know how we lived because of you?

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,830
How could you let her pass away when she lived like that because of you?!

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,820
N-No matter how long

109
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm in here, it'll never be enough

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,910
to pay for what I did to her.

111
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,650
I know it's not enough.

112
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm saying I know.

113
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,900
And what about causing the death of a completely innocent person?

114
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,710
As if it wasn't enough to do all that to us,

115
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,730
how could you cause so much pain to so many others?

116
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,660
But what were you saying?

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,250
Eating?

118
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,290
Exercising?

119
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,270
Are you even a human being?

120
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,510
No matter how I try to escape,

121
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,670
why do you keep blowing up my life like land mines are hidden here and there?

122
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,930
Why? Why?!

123
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,170
After becoming a prosecutor,

124
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,720
my senior colleagues told me the definition of organized crime gangs.

125
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,490
They're a social evil,

126
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,520
that will use violence

127
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,640
to attain its purpose, no matter what.

128
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,480
I think I was wrong to expect to hear anything sensible

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,900
from someone like that.

130
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,110
We'll never see each other again.

131
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,000
It's me.

132
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,890
Can we meet?

133
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,130
She and I have decided to discuss it again after the re-evaluation.

134
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,740
It puts her in an unfavorable position if she tries to do a merger in this state,

135
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,090
so I'm sure she'll make some requests soon.

136
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,550
I think you should tell that to Kang Mi Na, not me.

137
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm telling you because I want to, not because Kang Mi Na needs to hear it.

138
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,000
But where are we headed?

139
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,620
You seem like a different person since your memory has returned.

140
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,380
It feels like when you get close to someone while drunk one night, then meet them the next morning and it's awkward.

141
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,020
You once told me

142
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,300
that I could do so much because I don't remember my past.

143
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,490
It really was like that. Once my memory returned and I remembered the past,

144
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,830
I realized there are things I shouldn't do.

145
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,760
Like what?

146
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,310
Why are we here?

147
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,580
It's my grandmother.

148
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,280
The day she passed away is the same as your birthday, right?

149
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,080
   

150
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:30,940
That day, my grandmother was very alarmed when her son said he was going to set fire to his factory because he was sacked.

151
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,570
She was the victim of a hit-and-run on the way to the factory her son used to work at.

152
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,610
And maybe because my grandmother didn't show up to stop him,

153
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,140
that son really did set fire to the factory.

154
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,990
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,490
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,310
That factory ... was the Hanju factory.

157
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,180
And I am the daughter of the arsonist who set the fire

158
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,050
that killed your father, Han Gang Sik.

159
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm Kang Myeong Guk's daughter.

160
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,580
I am truly sorry ...

161
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,370
for what he did.

162
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,340
l mean it.

163
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,890
l will go ahead.

164
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,540
W— W-Wait.

165
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,980
That doesn't make sense. How is he your father when your surnames are different?

166
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,330
l changed my surname

167
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,230
because l couldn't stand being his daughter anymore.

168
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,100
I came here with you to tell you this.

169
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,200
I thought it would be too difficult for me to mention it without this context.

170
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,120
My grandma was super scary, you see.

171
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
l can't lie in front of her.

172
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
I'll get going.

173
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,360
How can you just leave like this?

174
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,140
Then what? Is there something else you want to tell me?

175
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,380
Should I tell you what you are about to say to me?

176
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,780
Everyone has the same reaction when they learn I am the daughter of a gangster who killed a man.

177
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,770
At first, they act like they are unaffected, only saying "Oh, l see."

178
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,990
Then they say this: "Are you still going to keep living here?"

179
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,760
"You weren't thinking of still hanging out with us, were you?"

180
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,890
And in the end, we drift apart from each other.

181
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,230
Won't you be the same, too?

182
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,390
Besides, the man who died is your—

183
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,940
That has nothing to do with you.

184
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,230
l don't know what other people say, but l don't think

185
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,360
you are responsible in any way for what your father did.

186
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,520
Come to think of it, l brought you here,

187
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,240
so I'm wondering how you will get home now, without a car.

188
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Even if we have to cut ties, let me drive you home one last time.

189
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,020
Why would I cut ties with you?

190
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,960
And what are you saying, you'll drive me home "one last time"?

191
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,710
All right.

192
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,950
What is your relationship with Yeon Ju?

193
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,940
- Who might you be? 
 - Answer the question first, you—

194
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,300
Isn't it proper manners to tell me who you are before asking questions?

195
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,370
What is your relationship with Ms. Jo Yeon Ju?

196
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,770
We— Well, w-we are Yeon Ju's father's young brothers.

197
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,500
Wh-Which means we're her uncles. Right.

198
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,130
That's right.

199
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,050
l'm sorry. l didn't know you were her uncles.

200
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,800
There's no need to be so polite, though—

201
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,700
We're really her uncles, so what? It's normal.

202
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,570
Of course. That's right. We're her uncles.

203
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,940
The date that Yumin has set for our re-evaluation is near.

204
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,740
Should I request that they defer it?

205
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,310
Wait. No news about Lee Bong Sik?

206
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,510
It seems the prosecutor in charge is putting off the investigation.

207
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,450
They were so quick to dig up an old case in order to catch him,

208
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,070
I thought they'd be frantic trying to disclose the list.

209
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,920
- Who's the prosecutor in charge of the case? 
 - l will find out right away.

210
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,840
Contact that prosecutor directly to take care of it.

211
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,100
It will be bad for us if Lee Bong Sik says stupid stuff and a scandal breaks out before the merger.

212
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,430
About Director Alex Chiang, who was put as delegate for the merger ...

213
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,870
You are members of the same family, after all.

214
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,010
Wouldn't it be faster to appeal to that aspect instead?

215
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,760
"Same family"? What are you talking about?

216
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,390
He'd hate to admit that he is my father's nephew.

217
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,020
So you're saying you're just Yeon Ju's neighbor?

218
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,720
Yes, that's correct.

219
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,430
Is it usual to pay a visit to your neighbor's grandmother's funeral urn these days?

220
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,750
From what I've seen earlier, it looked like a lovers' quarrel.

221
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,720
Why do you interfere in someone else's love life, like some old geezer? This is not important right now.

222
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,730
Then what? Wh-What is important now?

223
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,050
Are you the owner of your apartment?

224
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,460
Pardon?

225
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
Well, actually, I pay a monthly rent, but—

226
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,850
You're on a monthly rent? Goodness. Our Yeon Ju is on a long-term lease.

227
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,720
The monthly rent for that place must be quite high.

228
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,020
A young man like you should be thinking of saving money, not spending so much on rent every month ...

229
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,220
People don't care about managing their finances when they're bachelors.

230
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,540
And they wise up once they get married.

231
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,800
Gosh.

232
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,720
Yeon Ju hasn't told you about her father, has she?

233
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,460
I'm not sure what she's told you, but he particularly loves his daughter.

234
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,430
It seemed so.

235
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,160
Have you met him?

236
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,050
Yes.

237
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,140
Wow. So your relationship with Yeon Ju must be that serious.

238
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,070
No, it's not that.

239
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,320
How is it not?  You've met her father,

240
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,810
and even visited the columbarium* with her. That makes it clear enough. 
  (a place for funerary urns) 

241
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,750
Hyeongnim ll Yong has nothing more to wish for.

242
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,610
- "ll Yong"? lsn't his name Kang Myeong Guk? 
 - My gosh!

243
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,350
You even know his name?

244
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,090
ll Yong is his nickname, you see.

245
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,660
When he was young, a big fire broke out in his home.

246
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,820
He got a burn on his arm because of it.

247
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,170
So the dragon tattoo he had on his forearm became distorted.

248
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,980
That's where he got the nickname "Il Yong" from, as in "distorted dragon".

249
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,720
From then on, he hated anything to do with fire. He has an ill connection with it.

250
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,470
Stop talking nonsense now.

251
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,220
Where should we drop you off in Seopyeong, again?

252
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,290
I need to go to Seopyeong District Prosecutor's Office.

253
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,130
Let's hurry, then.

254
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,850
No matter how many times I asked,

255
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,830
he wouldn't tell me why he did it.

256
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,720
Whenever l was left out or blamed

257
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,610
by the people from our town,

258
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,390
or fired from my part-time jobs because of him,

259
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,520
l thought l'd feel less wronged

260
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,510
if l at least knew the reason why he did such a thing.

261
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,750
I asked him now because I felt it would still be better to know.

262
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,850
You're not the type to just take it, though.

263
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,440
Right.

264
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,400
l was poor, but not just poor.

265
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,450
l was super-confidently poor.

266
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,790
Since being poor isn't a crime.

267
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,090
But being a gangster, an arsonist, or a murderer ...

268
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,180
Those are crimes.

269
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,640
I couldn't feel confident about any of that.

270
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,140
Jeez, drop it. There's nothing I can do about it.

271
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,990
My grandma said

272
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,920
the fact that a criminal's family suffered that way

273
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,520
was also a punishment for the criminal himself.

274
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,720
How can a prosecutor say that?

275
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,920
Have you forgotten about the principle of legality?

276
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,580
Only the law can stipulate the punishment for a crime.

277
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,010
According to the Korean Constitution, article 13, section 3,

278
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,740
no citizen of this nation shall be penalized for an act committed by a relative and not by themselves.

279
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,470
Gosh, people who have never experienced hardships are so naive.

280
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,660
Hey. For people like us, flying in the sky and stuff like that aren't what we call miracles.

281
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,220
Becoming a civil servant although I'm the daughter of a convict ...

282
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,430
people hanging out and even sharing meals with me,

283
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,250
and becoming friends with a silver-spoon like you ...

284
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,420
Those things are miracles for me.

285
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,340
What did Han Seung Wuk say?

286
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,730
About what?

287
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,550
What did he say when you told him?

288
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,210
Why are you so curious about that?

289
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,650
Would he say he has to kill me since I'm his enemy's daughter?

290
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,320
He'll come over here later, anyway.

291
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,310
He will ask to see the case files from back then,

292
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,970
so please take care of it when he comes.

293
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,880
Are you okay?

294
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,800
I was fine with you finding out, even though we're so close. So what if he knows?

295
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,080
We were already uncomfortable with each other, unlike how it is with you and me.

296
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,990
l'm off.

297
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,780
You're comfortable with me

298
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,720
and uncomfortable with him?

299
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,850
Being uncomfortable

300
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,070
is very dangerous, though.

301
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,890
How did he get here so quickly?

302
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,680
Excuse me.

303
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,260
When she's like that you have let her be.

304
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,030
She's very proud and won't easily let others comfort her.

305
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,200
l'm not in a good mood today, you know.

306
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,930
So why don't you tell me where the original list is, then you can go?

307
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,820
- This is not what you promised! You said you'd let me go if I testified! 
 - Hey.

308
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,440
You've been making a living out of conning people.

309
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,760
Who would trust your words? We need evidence.

310
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,500
You say you don't believe my words.

311
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,300
Why must l believe you and be the first to show you my cards?

312
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,910
You should get me a boat and stow me away, or transfer some money into a Swiss account.

313
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,860
As you say, don't you think I need some tangible evidence

314
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,870
- to decide whether to give that to you? 
 - What?

315
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,600
Are you mistaking this place for a gambling house?

316
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,330
How dare you make bets?

317
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,900
I think you're the one making bets right now.

318
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,120
The only thing you have over me is that you've caught me.

319
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,060
I am the one with the upper hand.

320
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,050
You need me to provide the real list

321
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,800
so you'll have less trouble trying to live a double life

322
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,820
as Hanju Group's daughter-in-law.

323
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,930
If I change my mind, you'll be the one in a pickle

324
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,840
both as Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju

325
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,210
and Chairwoman Kang Mi Na!

326
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,530
Look at this punk.

327
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,800
Being a pot that calls the kettle black comes so naturally to you.

328
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,210
Hey! You make it sound

329
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,350
as if you've done absolutely nothing wrong and I had you locked up unfairly.

330
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,740
Are you aware of how many years you'll rot in prison for attacking a prosecutor?

331
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,390
You should be remorseful!

332
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,220
Anyway! You should bring me a surefire plan to get me out

333
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,200
- so I can decide whether I hand over the list— 
 - Hey, Bong Sik!

334
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,230
A plan?

335
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,030
You must think you're some big shot,

336
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,810
but you're just a knight on a chessboard.

337
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,200
If I don't move you, you can't do anything on your own.

338
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,240
So what if you change your mind? Do you think I'll just sit here and do nothing?!

339
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,250
Do you really think I didn't plan for that?

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,900
I don't have a plan, though.

341
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,940
This jerk. He's not on to me, is he?

342
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,680
Maybe I should just strike a deal with the chief?

343
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,220
No ... I need the original list to make this blow up

344
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,880
so I can entrap the chief with it.

345
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,280
It's me. So?

346
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,470
Can I trust you?

347
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,600
Of course, of course.

348
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,530
All our kids who are strong and good at fighting

349
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,640
are either in prisons or detention centers.

350
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,030
Our organization is in a mess,

351
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,360
but you're in luck.

352
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,710
He's seriously a weasel, so you can't let your guard down.

353
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,870
Don't just keep him safe from others,

354
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,540
tell them to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

355
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,670
 Fraud, threatening, assault ... 

356
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,280
We've got a variety of guys in there,

357
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,990
so don't worry at all.

358
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,760
   

359
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,730
 Don't worry about it even if you land in the detention center.  

360
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,440
 The place is full of my people. 

361
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
 Y-Y-You're telling me to t-trust the guards? 

362
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,580
 Not the guards. I'm saying my people are everywhere among the prisoners. 

363
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,540
 I won't let you get stabbed. Stay put in there. 

364
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,820
Is she protecting me or is she keeping me under surveillance?

365
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,800
- Go inside! 
 - Let's go.

366
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,700
- Prosecutor? 
 - Yes?

367
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,980
Someone called Han Seong Hye, of Hanju Hotel, is asking for you.

368
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,790
Who?

369
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,350
- Why?  
 - I'm not sure.

370
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,100
- She said she would speak directly to you— 
 - Tell her I'm not here!

371
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,140
Don't give me the phone!

372
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,580
She may try to reach me another way,

373
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,280
so for now don't accept

374
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,720
any outside calls.

375
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,200
- You can't reach her? 
 - Yes.

376
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,540
I tried to reach her through other prosecutors' offices,

377
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,950
but I can't get through at all.

378
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,360
What is she trying to do?

379
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,770
You have a new cellmate.

380
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,630
   

381
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,440
 Once you leave, know that you're not coming back to this country 

382
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,250
-  and live a quiet life. 
 - Sure, no problem. 

383
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,580
 This is a fascinating world. 

384
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,010
 These high-and-mighty business tycoons 

385
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,320
 mix with you Seopyeong-thug types. 

386
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,080
 Cut the useless chatter. 

387
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,030
Thank you for letting me see these.

388
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,980
All the testimonies from the witnesses

389
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,790
are perfectly consistent.

390
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,260
Every single one points to Kang Myeong Guk as the culprit.

391
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,680
Who put these records together at the time?

392
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,810
The police at Seopyeong Police Station at that time.

393
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,470
None of them is currently still there.

394
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,440
- And the prosecutor who investigated this case? 
 - The current Chief District Prosecutor of the central office.

395
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,890
You've already looked into this?

396
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,450
Yes. I did.

397
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,620
Last time I was here, you said you were busy trying to reach performance quotas,

398
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,180
so I thought you weren't interested in this.

399
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,710
By any chance,

400
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,650
do you know who Kang Myeong Guk is?

401
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,910
Yes, I found out.

402
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,610
Then I guess it was for Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju.

403
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,050
What's your relationship with Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju?

404
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,430
I don't think I need to answer questions of a private nature.

405
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,800
It seems like you have some particular feelings for her.

406
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,860
"Feelings"?

407
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,740
Not exactly.

408
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,760
I don't have feelings for her.

409
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,960
We can call it a habit.

410
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,010
It's more like a habit.

411
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,770
The habit of a prosecutor?

412
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,770
Oh, are you going out to eat, Chief?

413
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,770
Yeah right, "out."

414
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,070
Now I'm Chief, so many people watch me, I can't even dine with anyone.

415
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,360
Of course. Well, you can call on me whenever you need to.

416
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,280
I will wait for your call.

417
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,790
You don't exactly have time to eat with me now, do you?

418
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,280
Why don't you quickly investigate Lee Bong Sik and throw him in prison?

419
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,430
You know, guys like that will rack their brains

420
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,170
about how to reduce their sentences.

421
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,320
They'd happily provide lists or whatever before you even ask. Why are you waiting?

422
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
Don't worry, sir.

423
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm just waiting for the perfect opportunity

424
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,460
to shove every one of the bad guys into jail.

425
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,540
Do well.

426
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,310
There are strange rumors about you circulating the office, Prosecutor Jo.

427
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,760
It's hard to believe you're working earnestly.

428
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,050
Oh you mean the whistleblowing or whatever?

429
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,110
But Chief, you know me. Whistleblowing isn't my style.

430
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,260
You never know who else you'll hurt

431
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,830
if you shoot blindly.

432
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,290
Please don't worry yourself.

433
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,220
Fine, be on your way.

434
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,890
Me? Oh.

435
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,120
You first.

436
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,450
I'm so freaking terrified.

437
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,730
Excuse me!

438
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,990
- What is it? 
 - Let me speak to the chief.

439
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,160
What is it?

440
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,730
Please allow me to go out for questioning. I need to speak to the prosecutor.

441
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you think this is a hotel?

442
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,870
You can only leave if the Prosecutor calls for you. You can't just leave because you feel like it.

443
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,370
Then please contact her. Tell her I have something to say.

444
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,600
- Yes? 
 - This is the Central Detention Center.

445
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,450
Inmate 3678, Lee Bong Sik, says he has something to say to the prosecutor.

446
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,910
Oh yes, one moment.

447
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,880
It's the detention center. They're looking for the prosecutor.

448
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,830
The detention center? The prosecutor said not to transfer any outside calls to her for now.

449
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,690
The prosecutor must be busy.

450
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,350
You'll have to go for questioning again soon anyway, so just speak with her then.

451
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,680
Feeling he was unjustly dismissed from his factory position, he set fire to the factory.

452
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,640
They had plenty of evidence of his motivation and the circumstances of the incident.

453
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
They even had his confession, so they wrapped up the case without any doubts.

454
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
You're saying this seems suspicious?

455
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,110
I was thinking that if Hanju faked the death,

456
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,560
then they could have faked the culprit in the first place.

457
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,730
And when I met him, something didn't seem right.

458
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,960
And this man is Prosecutor Jo's father?

459
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,330
- It must've been a surprise. 
 - Yes.

460
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,090
Someone like her, who usually retorts with a hundred words for each word of mine,

461
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,530
simply apologized and said nothing else.

462
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,910
It felt like seeing a different person.

463
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,990
You should try to be understanding.

464
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,420
I'm sure Ms. Jo has her reasons.

465
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,020
Are you saying I should cut off contact with her?

466
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,590
Wouldn't it be better for you both? Especially if you're going to continue to look into this.

467
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,070
- Again? 
 - I'm sorry?

468
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,200
If someone says to cut ties, I just cut ties? Do I have to keep giving in every time?

469
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,160
I've never thought even once in my life that Hanju Group was mine.

470
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,310
But everyone said I was the heir to that group.

471
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,360
And as the heir, I had to hold myself back from doing anything I wanted.

472
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,950
And then suddenly, one day,

473
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:35,180
they told me Hanju Group was my uncle's and l shouldn't even dare to covet it.

474
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,170
The same happened with Mi Na, too.

475
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,420
I was supposed to get married to her.

476
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,810
And when I finally began to like her, suddenly they told me I couldn't.

477
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,390
Am I supposed to do that again?

478
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,800
If I am told to cut ties,

479
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,940
should I just quietly accept it this time too?

480
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,000
By the way,

481
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,570
there's someone else who needs to hear this. Why are you saying it to me?

482
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,630
Rest please,  I need to drive Chairwoman Kang Mi Na home.

483
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,870
Is there any news on Kang Min Na?

484
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,240
Lee Bong Sik said he put her on a boat to China,

485
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,570
so we're using that lead to look for her. But something is quite strange.

486
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,830
From a certain point, there is no trace of her.

487
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:56,110
It's as if she vanished into thin air. So I'm wondering

488
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,790
if maybe Lee Bong Sik

489
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,460
lied to us, don't you think?

490
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,550
This is what I was asked to tell you,

491
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,420
by Mr. Han Seung Wuk.

492
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,560
When he stowed himself away, Lee Bong Sik had the help of some gangsters in Seopyeog.

493
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,310
So I'm thinking he used a similar method this time.

494
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,450
I'll ask the Seopyeong Branch Office if they can help look into it.

495
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,210
- You want me to tell that to Mr. Han Seung Wuk? 
 - Yes.

496
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,090
You two could talk about it directly.

497
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,900
What are you both doing?

498
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,380
Why are you being so timid?

499
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,030
You must have heard. I'm not in a position to show myself right now.

500
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,190
Why can't you?

501
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,450
I'm actually like that. Being confident and outspoken isn't reserved for outstanding people.

502
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,760
What did you do so wrong? It's not your sin being born to such parents.

503
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,370
My father drank and hit people. He was a messed up guy.

504
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,400
But look at me now. l passed the bar exam

505
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,120
and even became head of the legal team at Hanju Group.

506
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,610
Once you're over thirty,

507
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,450
there is no reason to benefit from or to blame your parents anymore.

508
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,230
Don't feel so small because of your father.

509
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,290
Are you going back to Chairman Han's house like that?

510
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,770
- Team Leader ... 
 - What is it?

511
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,770
You've got quite a presence.

512
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,490
I said as much last time.

513
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,900
That's right. Who am I trying to please by keeping a low profile like this?

514
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,390
I can't even begin to imagine the sort of things that might happen in that house.

515
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,590
See? Look over there.

516
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,220
You haven't even entered the house yet, and already ...

517
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,970
What is it? You just turn up whenever you want, now? How brazen.

518
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,660
I'm not sure who's the more brazen here.

519
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,080
Who do you think has been most interested in the person named Kang Mi Na, all this time?

520
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,420
lt's me, Han Seong Wun's lover.

521
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,040
During the past decade, there has never been an instant

522
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,910
when I didn't take an interest in your every movement.

523
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,690
I have been an announcer for over ten years, so I am an expert

524
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,180
in vocalization, pronunciation and intonation.

525
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,550
I get that people with similar physiques can have similar voices.

526
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,630
But when speaking, people have their own unique intonation or habits.

527
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,420
You can never fake that.

528
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,620
I've thought about this over and over, and the woman I talked to in the garage

529
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,850
was not Kang Mi Na.

530
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,090
Let's see. If you have a clear conscience, say something.

531
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,290
What are you doing? You should know better.

532
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,010
So which is it, for you? Are you being deceived,

533
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,750
or are you deceiving the others together with her?

534
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,960
Won't you stop it now?

535
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,840
Good thing you came. You're the biggest victim in this fraud.

536
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,720
You need to get better at judging people.

537
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,230
You're right.

538
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,080
It looks like I've been completely wrong about you.

539
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:30,160
Would there be a man who doesn't know if his wife is fake, when they sleep in the same bed and eat together everyday?

540
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,620
It looks like you can't stop deluding yourself.

541
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,890
But don't go around blabbering nonsense when you don't have any evidence.

542
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,190
Hey. I am the evidence!

543
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,830
In that case, the evidence of your improper private life these past ten years is me.

544
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,490
If I cause a scandal to break out, who would suffer from it?

545
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,840
Go inside, Honey. You can leave too, Team Leader.

546
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,030
I'll go in once I see this woman leave.

547
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,810
This guy ...

548
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,350
He doesn't even know whether his wife is fake, when he eats and sleeps with her everyday.

549
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,880
And now he takes my side.

550
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,640
This darn thing called "business" is really something.

551
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,520
You should be careful if you want to stay being a news anchor.

552
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
If you interfere with my wife anymore,

553
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,640
I'll bury you with a scandal.

554
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,580
 I think you might be tired. Are you going to work early tomorrow as well? 

555
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,240
 - Yes, I am.
 - Really? What time? 

556
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,450
 Right now. I'm off. 

557
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,300
 That rude little ... 

558
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,480
   

559
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,800
   

560
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,170
 Jo Yeon Ju 

561
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,060
That stupid wench. How dare she attempt to hinder me.

562
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,160
ls our younger sister-in-law not home yet?

563
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,280
These days she's always busy. She'll definitely come in quite late.

564
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,780
Seeing that you check every five minutes,

565
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,040
you must be really desperate.

566
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,180
- What are you talking about?
 - Even if I'm home all the time,

567
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,110
I'm not ignorant about what's going on.

568
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,290
That's true, Eonni. People who just spend but don't earn a cent

569
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,590
are usually more aware of what's happening.

570
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,690
Stop picking on Mi Na for no reason, Hyeong-nim.

571
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,720
Are you saying that l unfairly criticized her?

572
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,500
Don't you agree with me, Director Kim?

573
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,310
Do you think there really isn't anything wrong with Mi Na?

574
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,530
I don't know.

575
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,350
Director Kim, I know that you have seniority over all of us,

576
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,220
but it seems to have slipped your mind that you're just an employee.

577
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,680
- Madam. 
 - What is it?

578
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Back in 2001 ... on that day when it was pouring with rain outside,

579
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,610
you overdosed on sleeping pills and collapsed in the bathroom. What happened then?

580
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,770
No one cared about me and they were unaware I had fainted,

581
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,320
but you opened the door by force and took me to hospital.

582
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,380
It's because of you I'm still alive.

583
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,580
Miss Han Seong Mi. Surely you remember the World Cup in 2006.

584
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,790
The time when I lied and went out?

585
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,710
Because you followed me, l wasn't kidnapped by some strange thugs.

586
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,330
And Young Madam, do you recall what happened in the summer of 2014?

587
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,900
Do you still have that underwear I got from the Louil Group family's daughter-in-law?

588
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,870
Yes, of course, Director Kim.

589
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,170
She had four sons. Because of her underwear,

590
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,810
l conceived Seon Wu.

591
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,980
Ever since, though, it's been useless.

592
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,620
Managing Director Han Seong Hye,

593
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,990
should I also mention you?

594
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,460
If everyone is done eating,

595
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,750
please get out.

596
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,530
Sister-in-law!

597
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,960
Sister-in-law.

598
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,960
Why is it so hard to see you nowadays?

599
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,890
Why have you been asking for me since earlier?

600
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,800
Earlier? When?

601
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,160
Didn't you ask for me earlier?

602
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,420
Anyway, why are you looking for me?

603
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,530
You've given Seung Wuk full authority to  handle the merger,

604
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,220
and now he's asking me for a re-evaluation.

605
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,530
That's correct. He's more expert at that than l am.

606
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,980
And I'm too busy right now.

607
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,690
Because of past events, he's being overly excessive.

608
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,000
Can you talk to him about it and make him hold back?

609
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,030
No, I can't.

610
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,560
What?

611
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,590
I don't believe the rumors.

612
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,620
I'm just asking you to tell him when you meet regarding work.

613
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,040
I have no reason to see him anymore.

614
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,240
Mi Na, is this really how you're going to play it?

615
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,300
What are you two doing?

616
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,180
- See me for a minute. 
 - Yes.

617
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,240
Not you.

618
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,130
You.

619
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,690
What on earth have you done that's made Yumin want a re-evaluation?

620
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:15,500
What about you, Father? Have you definitely talked to the chief prosecutor?

621
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,680
It's because he's not interfering that we may have to do this useless re-evaluation.

622
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,730
What? I've already spoken with the chief prosecutor.

623
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,720
Do you expect that I beg for help from a mere public prosecutor?

624
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,820
You spoke as if Yumin Hotel would be yours without delay.

625
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,090
You're the one who gave them something to nitpick about

626
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,770
with this evaluation.

627
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,020
Can't you do a better job of things?

628
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,860
You've been systematically coming home lately.

629
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,810
What are you playing at this time?

630
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,600
Do you think I'm the same as you?

631
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,820
There isn't always some purpose behind every one of my actions.

632
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,240
Nuna ...

633
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,340
Usually,

634
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,630
people who are in my position would try to compete with their sister

635
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,790
and take her place as the heir.

636
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,630
But until now, I haven't done that.

637
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,900
That's because I am very objective about myself.

638
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,640
Why don't you also try it for once?

639
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,530
Honestly, it's thanks to me that others tend to overestimate you.

640
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,200
Isn't it true?

641
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,510
You're showing your true intention, now that you can be carried by Sister-in-law.

642
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,180
Isn't that a kind of skill, too?

643
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,500
You can't do that anyway.

644
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,120
So now ...

645
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,580
stop looking down on me

646
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,970
whenever you see me, all right?

647
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,260
They are all behaving this way just because of one hotel? I see.

648
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,020
 I'm just waiting for the perfect opportunity to shove every one  

649
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,520
-  of the bad guys into jail.  
 - Who does she mean

650
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,350
by "all of the bad guys"?

651
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,050
 But Chief, you know me.  

652
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,490
 Whistleblowing isn't my style. 

653
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,640
 You never know who else you'll hurt 

654
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,270
  if you shoot blindly. 

655
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,410
Does she mean she will stab a knife in my back?

656
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,050
Now that she caught Lee Bong Sik, she should disclose everything right away. Why is it staying quiet?

657
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,360
Is it really okay for me to not do anything?

658
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,170
My children just make up an excuse

659
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,920
whenever something happens.

660
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,920
And the prosecutors become more arrogant by the day

661
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,840
when I make an effort for them.

662
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,540
Yes, sir.

663
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,330
Yes, I understand.

664
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,770
It's not like detention centers are graves.

665
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:53,460
Why are they all trying to bury their crimes in there, dammit?

666
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,650
   

667
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,550
   

668
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,330
Errand boy. Errand boy.

669
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,520
I have a stomach ache.

670
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,330
Can you bring me some purgative medicine?

671
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,990
- Everything you have. 
 - All of it?

672
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,310
My belly hurts too much, so I want to go to the hospital. That's why.

673
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,810
They generally tell us to take some medicine and cope with it.

674
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,170
But my belly really hurts.

675
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,700
So I want to get proper treatment.

676
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,400
All right.

677
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,370
I'm counting on you.

678
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:35,750
I've taken so many pills already, but there's no goddam sign.

679
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:40,410
It should be a waterfall by now.

680
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,540
- Hey. 
 - Stop it.

681
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,370
Help! Save me!

682
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,760
Help!

683
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,370
- What the hell did you eat? 
 - Help...

684
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,540
- It looks like he ate something wrong. 
 - Hey! Hey!

685
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,400
3678! Wake up!

686
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,320
- Wake up! 
 - What happened?

687
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,470
Wake him up!

688
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,300
Hey!

689
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,560
Hey ...

690
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,600
I think I ate something wrong—

691
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,690
Help!

692
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,330
Help me!

693
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,040
Hel—

694
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,670
Today is the date we agreed on.

695
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,760
Are the documents for re-valuation not fully ready yet?

696
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,450
If you wait a little while, someone will bring them to you any minute.

697
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,120
Hurry up and contact the higher-ups.

698
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,250
 Lee Bong Sik, who dealt fake rare paintings and ran away three years ago  

699
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,360
  was apprehended recently. 

700
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,250
 However, Mr. Lee, who was imprisoned in the detention center  
     

701
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,640
 attempted suicide and passed away.  

702
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,860
 A list was discovered in Mr. Lee's pocket that appears 

703
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,690
  to be his paintings' clients from three years ago.  

704
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:38,740
 It has been revealed that this list features the names of wealthy figures  

705
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,940
  including Chairwoman K, who has recently been summonsed by the prosecution.  

706
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,220
 - Some are asking why this list was not disclosed sooner on his arrest ...    
 - Oh dear.

707
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,460
Isn't this about Yumin's Chairwoman Kang Mi Na?

708
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,300
I don't think this is the time for you to be discussing the merger with us—

709
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,070
Does this make any sense?

710
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,610
When I questioned him the other day, he gave no sign of planning suicide!

711
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,980
You— When you caught Lee Bong Sik,

712
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,400
what happened with him in the interrogation room?

713
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,780
- Sorry? 
 - What did you do after turning off the surveillance camera?!

714
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,820
Did you interrogate him under duress? Huh?

715
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:29,210
Why did you have to call him in for interrogation and not leave any records? What did you talk about?

716
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,030
Isn't that the reason why that rascal died?!

717
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,650
- Chief! 
 - What?

718
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,490
Can't I scream, too?

719
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,010
Everyone is watching! What do you think you're doing?!

720
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,930
I apologize.

721
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:52,790
I mean, he wrote a suicide note and hanged himself. What more do you want?

722
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,860
Frankly, he doesn't even leave any family behind.

723
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,650
That rascal wanted to pay for his crime

724
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,150
and decided to kill himself.

725
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,110
I am telling you that the suicide note is strange.

726
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:07,080
It's also strange that he died as soon as he was put in solitary confinement. Anyone can tell it's not a suicide.

727
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,110
- We need to do an autopsy first. 
 - Hey.

728
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:17,250
Do you not understand what I say? What will you do if it's not a suicide?

729
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,900
Don't make the issue worse. Bury it quietly.

730
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,870
All right.

731
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,760
Is Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju not in?

732
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,830
Did you have an appointment with her?

733
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,330
No.

734
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,120
I doubt she will be coming in today.

735
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,200
I knew you'd be here.

736
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,470
You always come here when you're in a fix.

737
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:22,650
What an unbelievably smart boy. You know everything.

738
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,870
You're the one who made me like this.

739
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:29,310
You've never called anyone when you need support, so I became unbelievably good at finding you.

740
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:34,310
Yu Jun. Until yesterday, I kept thinking

741
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:39,040
that the universe helped me with catching Lee Bong Sik.

742
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,050
I was imagining myself going to the Chief Prosecutor,

743
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:46,560
and telling him "Hey! You colluded with Hanju three years ago and let Lee Bong Sik go!"

744
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
I would confront him like this, then ask ...

745
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,870
"Where is the culprit of the hit-and-run that killed my grandma and that you let go as well?"

746
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,300
I was feeling so excited, dreaming about investigating all that.

747
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:06,310
How can things turn out this way in just a day?

748
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:12,480
Was that why you were after Lee Bong Sik?

749
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,620
Is it the time to drink?

750
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,510
With the list being disclosed, you are on the verge of having to summons Kang Mi Na for investigation.

751
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,690
What will you do?

752
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,580
What do you think? I can ask the questions, and reply as well.

753
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,700
It's so easy!

754
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,360
Come on, stop drinking. Don't you have to go back to that house?

755
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,920
What if you make a mistake in the middle of all this mess?

756
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,250
"A mistake"?

757
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,620
Hey. Do you think a mere mistake like that would be a problem?

758
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,430
I became a prosecutor by working till I almost pooped blood,

759
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,630
I played the lackey for ages at the Seopyeong branch,

760
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,180
and did everything I could to finally reach the Central Prosecutors' Office ...

761
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,260
And while looking into the chief's bribery case,

762
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,040
I finally caught Lee Bong Sik, that huge piece in the puzzle.

763
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,010
So where and how should I start now?

764
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,640
Do you know how I feel now?

765
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,640
I have to start again from the very beginning. Do you know how that feels?

766
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,870
How would you know? You obviously don't.

767
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:14,300
I think I might know how that feels.

768
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,480
I always do that with you, don't I?

769
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,680
Hey. You're starting again?

770
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,670
Stop it now, you too.

771
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,640
 This rascal! 
  

772
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,950
 Seeing that you have an eye for women, you're a really smart guy.  

773
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:48,510
 You. Never drink with me ever again. 

774
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,740
 For the rest of your life, we'll only ever be drinking—... I mean, working together.   

775
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,940
 Okay? 

776
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,070
 Okay! 

777
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,840
 Bottoms up. 

778
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,730
 Cheers. 

779
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,580
   

780
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:14,480
 I said I wouldn't drink with you, so now you come and find me where I'm drinking?   

781
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,820
 I guess you're bored at the Central Office. This kid has too much time, so he comes this far 

782
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,970
 to speak nonsense here.  

783
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,310
 I have to make a suggestion. 

784
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,120
 Hello? Is this the Central Prosecutors' Office?  

785
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,910
 Give the goddam phone to the Chief Prosecutor! 

786
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,440
 Why are prosecutors so free these days?  

787
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,660
Do you still have those feelings for me?

788
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,650
Auntie. Another glass here, please.

789
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,760
- What's he going "Auntie" about? 
  - Your call cannot be connected... 

790
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:40,090
I don't have any feelings for you.

791
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:45,230
People's hearts can change in no time. And sometimes feelings even disappear.

792
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:52,870
So I abandoned all feelings for you long ago.

793
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:01,600
Now you're just ... a habit.

794
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,410
Something like a habit.

795
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:09,130
♫  A new me everyday  ♫

796
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:13,300
Habits ... are like a part of your body.  
♫  I'm probably not the person  ♫

797
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,070
They stay with you all your life.

798
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:18,050
♫   Everyone wished for  ♫

799
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:25,960
♫  My green heart that sprouted in late spring  ♫

800
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,240
♫  Couldn’t leave room   ♫

801
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,350
If you understand how I feel, can you grab my hand?  
 ♫  For anyone to stop and rest  ♫

802
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,220
♫  I know  ♫

803
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:40,420
♫  The shiny things on the other side of the window  ♫

804
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,940
♫  Are not mine yet  ♫

805
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:55,100
♫   Someday I want to become the light  ♫

806
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:01,720
♫  Somewhere I want to find myself  ♫

807
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:09,730
♫  One day, if I ever hear my name  ♫

808
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:16,270
♫  I will be able to live through the next day, with an agitated heart  ♫

809
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,890
♫  Someday  ♫

810
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:28,200
I'm really unbelievably sharp. 
 ♫  On my way back home  ♫

811
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:34,280
I see your expression, and I know right away that I've been rejected again. 
 ♫  My heart is empty of feelings that have subsided  ♫

812
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,990
Still, you're gradually becoming more reasonable.

813
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:43,700
Back then, you used to ask me for a hug if I was going to reject you.

814
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,900
I thought you'd agree to holding my hand.

815
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,960
When I asked you to hug me, I got slapped in the face.

816
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,480
Hey. Be glad that I used my left hand to slap you.

817
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,490
♫  I believe  ♫

818
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:59,870
♫  That beautifully embroidered days  ♫

819
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,670
Making someone uncomfortable with my confession ...

820
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,570
♫  Can also come to me  ♫

821
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,010
isn't a good method.

822
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,480
♫  One day  ♫

823
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,670
So I just waited. 
♫  If the day comes when I confront my feelings  ♫

824
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,980
But when I saw you with Han Seung Wuk at the Seopyeong branch office, 
♫  I will surely cry  ♫

825
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,380
I realized something. 
 ♫  Hugging myself in my own embrace  ♫

826
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,280
♫  Someday  ♫

827
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,980
That I could lose you forever.

828
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,720
Yu Jun.

829
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,680
Go home for today.

830
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:41,280
The one who was rejected, and the one who rejected drinking together and lamenting on their misfortune,

831
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,050
doesn't feel right. We aren't in Hollywood.

832
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,940
You won't even leave me a chance, will you?

833
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,250
Don't overdo it with the drinking, and go home.

834
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,290
I'm off.

835
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,070
Bye.

836
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,180
Seriously ...

837
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,840
I really don't have anyone to call now.

838
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,700
This is why we drink alone.

839
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,520
No matter what happens tonight,

840
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,510
I just have to forget about it, and it'll be like nothing ever happened!

841
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,770
♪  Let’s play a motorcycle as a guitar  ♪

842
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:57,330
♪  Let’s play a motorcycle as a guitar. Let's ride.  ♪

843
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,670

844
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,690
♪  Let’s ride a guitar as a motorcycle  ♪

845
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,430
Is it here?

846
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,000
Or here?

847
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,670
It's here!

848
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,610
I have to go home.

849
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,700
But the damn door won't open.

850
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,220
Is it not my place?

851
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,870
Right. I have to go to Kang Mi Na's house!

852
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,720
Father-in-law! Mother-in-law!

853
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,070
Husband! Sisters-in-law!

854
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,840
Open the door for me!

855
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,150
Open the door!

856
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,050
Why aren't they opening the door for me?

857
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:05,180
I have two houses. I have two phones.

858
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,430
I even have two jobs.

859
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,700
Where on earth am I supposed to go? Huh?

860
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,980
   

861
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:23,470
 If something were to happen, I'll run to you somehow. 

862
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,260
   

863
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,810
   

864
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,580
   

865
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,470
Yeon Ju!

866
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:04,270
Yeon Ju ...

867
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,290
Aaah, you reek of alcohol.

868
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,710
Oh, what's this? What brings you here?

869
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:15,630
Come for a second round with me. Let's drink.

870
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,020
A drink.

871
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,400
- W-Wait! Get up. 
 - Let's go!

872
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,990
This is your place.

873
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,190
Right, of course. That's my place.

874
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,710
Don't look! Don't you dare look!

875
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:33,890
I won't look. Hurry and enter your passcode.

876
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,980
Di-di-ding.

877
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,110
What's wrong with my hand?

878
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:45,450
Hey. Come to your senses.

879
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,060
Right.

880
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,800
I'll do your code for you. You have to go in.

881
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,510
No! How dare you ...

882
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,440
ask me for the code to my house?

883
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,360
Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun just enters the code without hesitation! What's the big deal?

884
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,510
That's kind of true.

885
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,890
All right. Fine.

886
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,040
Try to guess it! Guess my passcode.

887
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,180
My code.

888
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,020
All right. Let's see how many times I'll have to try.

889
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,910
Is it your birthday?

890
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,860
My birthday?

891
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,910
My birthday isn't anything special.

892
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:38,770
It's not like anyone ever celebrated my birthday.

893
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,270
 Happy birthday! 

894
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,000
  Happy birthday! 

895
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,040
  On birthdays, a party is in order. Come here. 

896
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,110
Then ... your ex-boyfriend's birthday?

897
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:56,950
Wrong. An ex-boyfriend? Nonsense.

898
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:02,750
Do you think someone like me, who's poorer than poor, could pass the bar exam while dating?

899
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:07,790
How could I get revenge while dating someone? Seriously.

900
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,270
You did well.

901
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,190
I'm sure you can't guess it right.

902
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:20,370
It's the day I am never allowed to forget.

903
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,710
It's in here ...

904
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:28,250
Something I am absolutely not allowed to forget.

905
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,450
 It's my grandmother. 

906
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,670
 The day she passed away is the same as your birthday, right? 

907
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,670
   

908
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:24,190
How did we get in?

909
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,540
I entered the passcode and opened the door.

910
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,940
I didn't tell you my code, so how did you guess it?

911
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,410
I've got my ways.

912
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,930
- I'm seriously dumbfounded. 
 - Be careful.

913
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,020
Sit down here.

914
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,860
You shouldn't have been able to guess—

915
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:12,190
What the? Why are you here?

916
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,180
Get out.

917
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,140
Where did Prosecutor Ahn Yu Jun go? Why are you alone?

918
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,880
Yu Jun?

919
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,030
Why would Yu Jun be here? I sent him home.

920
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,830
You sent him home?

921
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:34,570
Obviously. He came without me even asking and kept blabbering nonsense.

922
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:39,440
I'm someone who draws the line very clearly, you see.

923
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,860
You should go too.

924
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,930
Don't show up in front of me. Hurry up and leave.

925
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:53,220
I'm not leaving.

926
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,880
What?

927
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,730
I said I won't go. I'm here because you called me for help.

928
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,350
So why are you telling me to leave?

929
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:09,130
I won't leave when told to, or let others take what's mine.

930
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:12,420
I came to Korea after deciding to stop doing that.

931
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:21,850
No matter whose daughter you are, or whom you resemble ... Or who has feelings for you ...

932
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,170
Those things don't matter to me.

933
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:31,850
I won't watch anyone take from me what I desire, or the things I want to do anymore.

934
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:54,220
♫  I will hold you in my embrace  ♫

935
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,320

♫  Just the way you are  ♫

942
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:50,330


943
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:54,380
   

944
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:58,280
   

945

946
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,270
Please remove your sunglasses.

947
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,200
 A rumor circulating in the business circle states that the list of clients  

948
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:30,530
 found on the deceased fraudster, Lee Bong Sik, contains the name of Yumin Group's chairwoman, Kang Mi Na,  

949
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,840
  who recently attracted criticism for dangerous driving.  

950
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,880
 At the time, the public opinion was quite unfavorable toward Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.  

951
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,130
 It is still the case, but Chairwoman Kang Mi Na is remaining silent when asked about it.  

952
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,210
 What is your opinion regarding these suspicions? 

953
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:47,460
 This issue made the headlines three years ago, 

954
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,680
 when Lee Bong Sik was apprehended ... 

955
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,100
   

956
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,620
 I must be crazy! Crazy. 

957
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:59,770
 It's fine! So what if I don't remember? I'm used to it. 

958
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,810
 I can absolutely handle it. 

959
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,490
 Maybe she's still very shocked from Bong Sik's death yesterday? 

960
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:04,380
 What's with her? 

961
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,790
 In the end, all of this happened as your fault, Father. 

962
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:10,900
 I'm not asking for your approval, here. I'm just letting you know.  

963
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:15,260
 We'll close Lee Bong Sik's case with Kang Mi Na and call it even. Deal? 

964
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,800
 Don't tell me anything. 

965
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,300
 I'd have to relay whatever you say. 

966
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,070
 I heard that you were capable of holding my hand instead of Managing Director Han Seong Hye's.  

967
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,440
 Should I tell you why you both can't manage   

968
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,020
 to make Chairwoman Kang Mi Na come in?
