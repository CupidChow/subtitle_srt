1
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,520
    

2
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,900
 If I say it's not my fault now, 

3
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,700
 no one would believe me. Even my daughter doesn't believe me. 

4
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:00,410


5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,910
   

6
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,160
   

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,280
Why do I have to request my leave in this way? I have to know something to guess my password.

8
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,320
Here we are. They have arrived.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,360
Oh my gosh. What's all this?

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,230
They are your assigned cases for this week.

11
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,420
While your vacation was extended, other prosecutors shared the load,

12
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,720
but now you're back, they're returning many of those.

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,890
Heol! It will take all day just to read them all.

14
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,240
How the heck could I finish all these by the end of the week? Aish! What's this?

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,630
A five-year prison sentence for rape? If the prosecution asks for five years, then the actual sentence will be down to three.

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,930
Are they encouraging people to commit rape or what?

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,570
Why would you just give a fine to such a wealthy person? What negative impact could it possibly leave?

18
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,580
I'm sure they would regret their actions with this penalty.

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,740
The perpetrator in that case seems to be an in-law with SongSong Group.

20
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,620
SongSong group? So?

21
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,300
You know, the one you know very well ...

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,810
I know the SongSong that builds apartment buildings. So what? What about it?

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,110
They don't even rank that high in the financial circle. What is special about that company?

24
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,190
I think the rumor that's all around the office must be correct.

25
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,360
Yes. It's strange to question the usual sentences always given as customary prosecution practice.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,230
And to act as if she's never heard of the SongSong Group. Is she trying to cause a bloodbath?

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,480
It's caused quite a lot of mayhem in Open Talk too.

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,250
"Prosecutor Jo should blow the whistle after her upcoming leave of absence" versus

29
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,210
"No, she should do it right away." It's pandemonium in the forum ...

30
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,010
What are you talking about? What's this about Open Talk?

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,530
  
   

32
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,670
    

33
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,450
   
   

34
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,580
   
   

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,040
Why the heck are they voting on things they have misunderstood in the first place?

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,550
I am at risk of dying every day, so why are they even asking me to save the prosecution from its corruption?

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,080
- What's all this? 
 - Like the fish that isn't aware of being wet,

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
the prosecutor who has become a puppet of power isn't aware of what's wrong.

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
- Sorry?
 - It's a pleasure.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,560
In the Central Prosecutors Office, we're the ones who have only been handling minor cases such as family violence and sexual violence.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,810
Prosecutors Guk! Yeong! Su!

42
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,960
If you say there is light and shadow in the Central Office, then we are in charge of the "shadow."

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,230
We heard the rumor that you plan to blow the whistle on the rotten prosecution, and came to quietly cheer you on.

44
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,460
We're all from poor backgrounds, and became prosecutors without the support of backing or money.

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,680
My father ran an electrical shop all his life. That guy lost his parents at an early age.

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,320
This guy's parents are still farming on other people's land.

47
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,330
Cheer up. We have your back. We will be your support.

48
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,180
However,

49
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,890
we'll be like shadows.

50
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,510
Ah, yes, I see.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,090
I will call on you should I ... need you.

52
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,290
Let's go.

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,510
I shouldn't even show myself in public.

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,080
   

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,030
Until now, prosecutors Park and Cha covered her work for her.

56
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,390
But Prosecutor Jo says she's going on a leave of absence,

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,380
so you two will have to manage it for a little longer.

58
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,150
Hey. We worked so hard to cover for you when you extended your holiday break without consulting anyone. But you're taking another leave?

59
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,100
In this case, you should have applied for leave from the start.

60
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,730
Isn't it selfish to use all your holidays and off-days,

61
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,910
and now even apply for a leave of absence?

62
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,020
That's what I'm saying. No one wants to hire female prosecutors because they aren't combative enough,

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,050
but our division went the extra mile to take you in.

64
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,440
And yet you're going to stab us in the back like this?

65
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,870
I have to take leave for an unavoidable reason, so I can't say anything.

66
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,630
But why do you need to say those things about female prosecutors?

67
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,950
Then don't take leave of absence.

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,830
Before you make a fuss about justice and all that, you shouldn't have left your workload to others.

69
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,180
Don't you agree? Don't live your life like this.

70
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,650
I think you are a bit harsh.

71
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,170
Aren't I your seonbae?

72
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,790
How did I live so far? Just how did I live? I'm curious.

73
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,210
I mean ... I admit you were my seonbae at school, but ...

74
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,370
To be honest, I passed the exam first!

75
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,020
Enough already! What a sight.

76
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,380
Look here. Thanks to you all tossing your workload to one another and causing delays in cases,

77
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,210
our division is dead last in the performance rankings.

78
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,370
The one who will get heat from above is me! Should I ask for a leave of absence too?

79
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,140
That's right. Let's all go on leave, then!

80
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,160
Why do you all have so much to say about my leave?

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,920
Just how behind are we because of me?

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,020
If I handle all the work beforehand, then will you let me take leave? Will that work?!

83
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,770
 So weren't you able to apply for leave? 

84
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,130
Listen, prosecutors in our country are swamped with a huge workload.

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,890
It's quite an issue.

86
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,020
You said I ranked #1 at the training institute, so why did I choose to become a prosecutor?

87
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,470
The salary is barely more than the minimum cost of living. Just what's so great about being a prosecutor?

88
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:47,300
I don't know. Maybe it's because people don't look down on you and you can get an easy loan?

89
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,110
I became one for those measly reasons?

90
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,890
I guess you must have had someone you wanted to indict. 
    

91
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,360
Don't worry too much. After I leave the office, I'll help you figure out your work.

92
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,110
All right. Thanks.

93
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,730
Gosh, I shouldn't have lost my temper.

94
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,250
How the heck will I run two jobs, when I'm the center of attention like this.

95
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,290
It's me. Is everything all right?

96
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,380
I guess not. What is it this time?

97
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,660
It's a long story to tell over the phone. I'll tell you in person later.

98
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,980
Did you call to check if anything was up?

99
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,350
I did have something to ask of you as well.

100
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,120
Today, I met the arsonist involved in my father's criminal case.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,850
What? Are you saying the fire was intentional?

102
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,220
- Yes.
  - What in the world! 

103
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,000
What did he say? Is he repenting? Showing remorse?

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,680
-  No.  
 - What a nasty jerk!

105
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,870
Yes. But I got this weird feeling.

106
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,320
He talks about what he did as if it's someone else's deed.

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,390
Then isn't he an even worse scoundrel? Something like a psychopath?

108
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,830
At any rate, I want to dig deeper, so I'd like to review the case file from back then.

109
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,360
I hear that only prosecutors can access those files.

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,250
- Ah. Where did you say the location of the fire was?
 - Seopyeong.

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,230
That's good then. I can ask Yu Jun. We are meeting at my place later anyway.

112
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,020
Why do you keep meeting him at home?

113
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,570
Team Leader and the car are at that place so I have to go there anyway.

114
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,120
So why did you tell the team leader to wait for you there?

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,790
Then what? Should I ask to meet at the prosecution office? Should I advertise I'm wearing two different hats?

116
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,550
I have a lot of internal turmoil and don't need you to start arguing too. I'm hanging up.

117
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,420
Hel-hello. Hello?

118
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,740
   

119
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,450
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

120
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,400
Hurry up and use your influence to send me overseas!

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,880
I've gotten myself in deep shit with those Hanju jerks! I really messed up this time.

122
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
Wait. You went to Hanju?

123
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,120
You moron, you're completely insane!

124
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,150
- Who did you seek out in Hanju? 
 - Let's meet up first, okay? I'll tell you when we meet.

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
Fine. I'll see you there later.

126
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,080
Why are there so many— Oh!

127
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,400
- Ah, really!
 - I'm sorry.

128
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,550
 Bong Sik. You're Bong Sik, aren't you? 

129
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,790
Are you all right?

130
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,350
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

131
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,640
Isn't that Kang Mi Na's copy?

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,030
 

133
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,010
These two ... look exactly the same?

134
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,940
 I'm asking if someone followed you around! 

135
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,590
 There's no problem with me going out, is there? 

136
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,760
 Don't worry about it. 

137
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,080
 The person who was chasing after me was hit by a car and died. 

138
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,360
So, her head is not right because of that accident ...

139
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,130
She was at that place because she doesn't even know who she is.

140
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,090
 Kang Mi Na might not be Kang Mi Na. Is that what you're talking about? 

141
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,360
 Should I give you a chance? If you bring me evidence, I'll let you live. 

142
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,080
Okay.

143
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,190
Ajeossi!

144
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,130
You are here.

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,840
Aren't you supposed to be at the Central Prosecution Office?

146
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,020
She told me not to come.

147
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,780
Saying something about how it'll be too noticeable if I wait there with the car.

148
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,680
She says she's the center of attention these days.

149
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,210
I mean, she could get herself into some dangerous situation.

150
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,780
Even if you don't give her a ride, you could find other ways. Like following behind her.

151
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,740
- Director, you really are too much.
 - Pardon?

152
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,410
As the leader of the Hanju legal team, I normally have my own driver.

153
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,340
After the last incident, I went back to acting as a secretary and following her around.

154
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,860
Don't you feel even a little sorry for me who's napping from fatigue?

155
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,130
What if people see me while I follow her with the car like a little puppy? Aren't you worried for me at all?

156
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,090
Of course I'm also worried about you, Ajeossi.

157
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,560
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,660
I will see myself out, as it's almost the time for her to arrive.

159
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,570
Ah, is it about time she is done?

160
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,480
She is usually almost finished around now.

161
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,660
Ouch, my shoulders hurt from all that driving.

162
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,500
Over here. Massage this spot firmly.

163
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,540
Right here I said. Ouch.

164
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,330
Ouch. Gosh.

165
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,350
This punk, what's taking him so long?

166
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,900
Where did he run off to this time?

167
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,490
Who are you?

168
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,960
I asked, who are you? You rascal.

169
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,400
Dang it. I wasn't going to go this far. You're making me into a bad guy.

170
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,870
What are you about? Who sent you?

171
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,490
Damn.

172
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,790
Are you all right? I told you not to use your arm. Seriously.

173
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,070
Did you think I'd fall for it a second time?

174
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,510
It was you, wasn't it? The rascal with no creativity who messed with the brakes.

175
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,920
 Whose side are you on? 

176
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,500
 There's more in the world than my side and other people's sides. 

177
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,360
 I'm sorry if I was talking out of line. 

178
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,060
 By the way, there's an old-style CCTV here  

179
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,140
 from before the garage was renovated.  

180
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,230
 The people here won't even know that it is a CCTV. 

181
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,590
 The resolution isn't that great, but it's still running. 

182
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,120
 There are many times when the one who helps is neither on your side nor the other side. 

183
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,630
 More than things like money or power, 

184
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,820
 I value human life. And what's more, 

185
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,660
 I don't want these kind of incidents happening in this house anymore. 

186
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
 Not anymore, you say? 

187
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,170
 What era is this CCTV from? There's nowhere to even connect a cable. 

188
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,450
 Can't we see the clips then? 

189
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,760
 Don't worry, my junior colleague. I told you I am the son of an electrician. 

190
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,360
 Fortunately, it appears I can connect it to a TV via the AV* port. 
 (audio visual output) 

191
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,640
 Oh! 

192
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,010
 Are you all right? 

193
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,610
Who ordered you to do it? Who are you?

194
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,730
You don't know me?

195
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,490
You don't know who I am, do you?

196
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,130
What's going on?

197
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,670
She is a prosecutor from the central office.

198
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,180
Thank you for your hard work. I just arrested this culprit during an investigation.

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,370
- Are you all right?
 - Of course I'm all right.

200
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,270
When apprehending a culprit, this kind of combat is typical ...

201
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,380
That's not what I mean. Here, you are ...

202
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,700
Huh?

203
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,290
 Our Prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok, who lost the suspect just before the arrest. 

204
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,180
 You were investigating Lee Bong Sik-gate, asking for my cooperation ...
    

205
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,550
 I must catch him as a surprise, right and tight. 

206
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,870
 What is this ajumma about? 

207
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,400
 Who the heck am I? 

208
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,720
 Let see who's more two-faced here. 

209
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,730
 It's only until she receives the Yumin inheritance. 

210
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,530
 I will return this position back to you, only upgraded. 

211
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,690
  ... or will you trust me, who actually has my father's blood? 

212
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:43,200
 My father went to check the ledger at the Hanju Fashion factory. There was a fire there. 

213
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,300
 Grandma! Grandma!  

214
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,700
   

215
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,160
 There's not much time still left now, Grandma. 

216
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,690
Are you all right?

217
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,140
What? What is it?

218
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,430
Who are you?

219
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't worry, that's not what's happening.

220
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,950
You scared me!

221
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,410
You aren't seriously hurt, right?

222
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,540
Why overreact over a small prank?

223
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,510
Do you think it's time for a prank right now?

224
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't pretend to be Kang Mi Na anymore. I don't think it should continue.

225
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,640
- But where is Lee Bong Sik?
 - Who?

226
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,690
I'm talking about that punk from earlier. That's the dude I had been chasing.

227
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,100
That accident also happened while I was chasing him.

228
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,480
Your memory ... is back?

229
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,110
Where is that punk anyway?

230
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,840
Where are you going, in your condition?

231
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,170
Don't you worry. I'm completely fine with getting beaten up this much, it's no big deal—

232
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,690
It is to me. Stop getting hurt.

233
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,630
I get it, so at least wait till the check-up result comes out.

234
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,030
I'm saying you can go if they say you aren't seriously hurt. Please.

235
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,000
You've got a temper.

236
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,640
Are you happy now?

237
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,830
I knew this would happen. They said there isn't even one tiny crack on my head.

238
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,830
That's a relief. You didn't get hurt, and your memory came back.

239
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,990
What about your family? Are there people you need to contact?

240
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,620
There's none.

241
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,760
Even if it's not your family ...

242
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,170
aren't there other people close to you?

243
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,110
Ah, there's no one, I said!

244
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,550
I'm sorry if I offended you.

245
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,980
Uhm, is your arm all right?

246
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,450
Have you ever punched someone with that arm?

247
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,640
I exercise a lot! I even have abs!

248
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,740
Can you hit someone with your abs? What's the point of them?

249
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,500
People without fat die more easily when they're stabbed.

250
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,860
- Why did you appear out of nowhere?
 - Then why do you wander around alone?

251
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,790
You didn't ever care whether I walked around alone or not. Why're you acting weird now?

252
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,700
- Are you the kind of person to stop doing it just because I ask?
 - Who knows?

253
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,110
If you'd said it, I might have stopped wandering around alone.

254
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,940
- Uh-huh. I won't say I got hurt because of you, so stop worrying.
 - Yes, sir!

255
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,710
I say that and you drop the matter right away?

256
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,450
But where is Lee Bong Sik, seriously?

257
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,110
Ah, he's at the Central Office.

258
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,680
Why would you take him there?

259
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,560
You'll be in trouble if he says something wrong at the police station.

260
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,320
Why are you in such a rush?

261
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,290
I mean, whoever he is, he'll be left alone until the prosecutor in charge is there.

262
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,150
No. Someone will fly over the moment word of his arrest is out.

263
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,750
Who?

264
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,370
The person I was really chasing after.

265
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,220
Jo Yeon Ju, this woman, is she an ally or a foe?

266
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,690
It was amazing, I'm serious!

267
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,600
So that bastard, he picked up a brick

268
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,460
and slammed it down, bang! On our prosecutor's head!

269
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,990
But our prosecutor, even as she bled,

270
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,300
she shot up, ran, and flew, and jumped off the wall!

271
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,980
And landed a flying kick on the bastard's chest with a bang!

272
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,770
Sir.

273
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,470
I got overexcited.

274
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,780
Why did she arrest him in such a flashy manner?

275
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,460
I can't even hide him away somewhere now, damn it ...

276
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,770
I was going after that person's corruption.

277
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,210
Is a corruption investigation more important than your own health?

278
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,100
I have a reason similar to yours, you see.

279
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,240
 Help! Help, please. 

280
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,190
 Please help. Do you know how many hospitals I've been to?  

281
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,230
 Please don't chase us out at least. Please! 

282
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,700
I couldn't find an ambulance, or get a bed.

283
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,040
 Grandma ... 

284
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,910
 Grandma, because of me ... 

285
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,450
 Yeon Ju ... 

286
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,020
 It's not because of you ... 

287
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,060
 I interfered.  

288
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,310
 In this world ... 

289
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,650
  nothing happens 100% because of one person.  

290
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,320
 - I would have gotten involved anyway ...
 - Grandma ... 

291
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,110
 Even if you had stopped me ... 

292
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,010
 I would have stepped in anyway. 

293
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,360
 Grandma! 

294
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,840
 I don't want ... because of what happened today ... 

295
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,200
 I don't want you to suffer your whole life ... 

296
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,340
 ... and become someone who can't do anything. 

297
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,130
 I don't want that ... 

298
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,570
 Grandma! Grandma. 

299
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,490
 No ... Grandma! 

300
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,370
 Ajeossi! 

301
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,160
 No other car passes there apart from the factory workers' cars going in and out. 

302
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,820
 And there is no witness either! There's nothing we can do. 

303
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,460
 There must be a speed camera on a nearby road somewhere! 

304
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,160
 The cameras in that area don't work, they're just there for show! 

305
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,820
 We don't have the manpower right now either! 

306
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,270
 Just go home and wait! We'll call you if we find something! 

307
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,410
They weren't even going to investigate. So what "call"?

308
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,000
I decided not to go around

309
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,820
begging for help anymore.

310
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,680
So, I studied hard to the point of bleeding shit to become a prosecutor

311
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,800
in order to meet that person.

312
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,850
I had heard that the investigation was blocked

313
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,490
by a prosecutor who worked at the Seopyeong Branch Office at the time.

314
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,160
People said I was a prosecutor who blindly tried to climb the ladder, from taking bribes to doing personal favours.

315
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,630
And one day, unbelievably, he came looking for me.

316
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,110
 I feel as if I've seen you somewhere. 

317
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,190
 I heard you worked at the central office? 

318
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,020
 Ah, yes. I've seen you several times from afar, Seonbae-nim. 

319
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,380
 Ah, really? Well, I do have many junior colleagues around. 

320
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,820
 Here. 

321
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,870
 I've heard a lot about you! That you're an ace prosecutor in Seopyeong. 

322
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,250
 It won't be a difficult task for you, Prosecutor Jo. 

323
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,480
 The son of an acquaintance of mine was involved in a hit-and-run accident. 

324
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,290
 He's in quite a difficult situation, you see. 

325
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,990
 - A hit-and-run accident?
 - It's something that happens often to kids of such families. 

326
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,050
 This country lacks places to enjoy speeding, so they go to empty roads with their sports cars and ... 

327
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,110
 - Drink.
 - Ah, yes. 

328
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,730
 But these kinds of things, hmm ... 

329
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,290
 These are opportunities for people like us who work as prosecutors. 

330
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,320
 You should return to Seoul, no? 

331
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,390
 It feels stifling down here. Right? 

332
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,150
 Yes ... 

333
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,070
At that time, I wondered whether my grandma's case was ignored in a similar manner.

334
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,710
 Sir, you're the best! 

335
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,730
 - Best, best.
 - Best best best. 

336
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,830
 - Prosecutor Jo, you're the best too!
 - The best! 

337
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,460
When I looked into it further, it turned out he was a hyena who got rid of all kinds of shit done by the Hanju Group.

338
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,280
 Another song! Another one. 

339
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,610
My grandma's accident, I don't know whose shit it was, but it must have been handled the same way.

340
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,630
That's why you contacted me, the leader of Hanju's legal team, isn't it?

341
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,710
To find out more about the connection between prosecutor Ryu Seung Deok and Hanju Group.

342
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,370
Yes.

343
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:27,950
And you, Director, asked me to come here and take this person all the way to the central prosecutors' office?

344
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,730
The doctor asked her to be careful today, but she insists on going.

345
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,250
You've said you hate hospitals,

346
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,470
yet you flew over here, remained unreachable this whole time,

347
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,720
and now you're contacting me because you need a chauffeur?

348
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,180
Ah ...

349
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,530
I-if my arm had been fine, I'd have driven myself—

350
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,290
That's not what I'm saying!

351
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,930
Why didn't you contact me when you got hurt, then?

352
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,930
Ever since your father passed away,

353
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,470
who's been your guardian in Korea, Director? It's me!

354
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,180
What were you going to do had the brick landed on you too, Director?

355
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,760
Look at your arm!

356
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,750
Did you get hurt anywhere else?

357
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,270
No. There's nothing else.

358
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,690
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,040
Am I your driver or something? I seriously can't stand this.

360
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,200
 4774 up here! 4774! Move your car! 

361
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,970
Yes, I'm coming!

362
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,830
Wait. I'll bring the car around.

363
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,620
Your daily life will be uncomfortable with only one hand.

364
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,400
You said you weren't going to worry. If it's inconvenient for me,

365
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,700
are you going to be like people in the movies,

366
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,480
and come feed me, wash my hair, shave me ...

367
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,460
Are you going to do that?

368
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,080
You've watched way too many movies.

369
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,930
- What?
 - I mean, what are you imagining?

370
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,710
You can still eat with your right hand even if your left is injured,

371
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,640
and you can still wash your hair with one hand. Even shave.

372
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,090
- There's the car.
 - Get in!

373
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,760
- Yes sir!
 - Imagination?

374
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,830
Who imagines that?

375
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,120
I wasn't even imagining the idea of imagining that!

376
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,810
For now, keep your mouth shut.

377
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,970
I have some really important informa—

378
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,200
You just got caught in the act of throwing a brick at a prosecutor!

379
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,930
Even if you're arrested right now, there's nothing you can say, so be quiet.

380
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,360
No, it's not that, I seriously—

381
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,460
You bastard! Don't say anything to anyone, ever. Understand?

382
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,890
- No—
 - Shhh!

383
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,750
Don't you know you're not supposed to be here right now? Huh?

384
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,180
Just stay inside for now. I'll take care of everything for you later.

385
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,000
Damn it! I seriously have important—

386
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,370
Oh, Chief Prosecutor! You're already here!

387
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,560
Y-Yes. I am.

388
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,450
You've suffered so much until now because of this bastard.

389
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,460
I've finally caught him for you!

390
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,800
Oh. Oh, yes, Prosecutor Jo.

391
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,230
You did well.

392
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,390
But, Prosecutor Jo, a-are you all right?

393
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,900
Oh, of course.

394
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,830
This bastard. He's an offender caught in the act. There's no need to investigate further.

395
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,240
Send him to prison immediately.

396
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,440
We can't do that.

397
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,390
A rascal like him must have committed other crimes. We need to investigate everything meticulously

398
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,140
and with enough vigor to shake the dirt out of his underwear, too.

399
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,290
Leave this to me, you can head in!

400
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,150
Ah. Then, then should I?

401
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,650
Right. Work hard.

402
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,290
Bastard.

403
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,900
Sir!

404
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,800
You must have something to say that people outside shouldn't hear?

405
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,130
How much are you involved in this? What's your identity?

406
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,730
Did the chief prosecutor tell you to shut up?

407
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,630
Then should I tell you my identity first?

408
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,420
You should know well already.

409
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,490
Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju of the central district office ... and at the same time, Yumin Group's chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

410
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,910
You think I'm sitting here without knowing who you are,

411
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,550
nor what is going on, because I've lost my memory, don't you?

412
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,610
Oh dear. Thanks to you slamming down on my head with that brick,

413
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,150
I got all my memories back.

414
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,940
I have several amazing talents, but even among those,

415
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,710
I'm most talented at lining up behind the right people.

416
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,370
So ... I want to give you a piece of advice.

417
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,890
You. Which line do you think you should hold onto?

418
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm your prosecutor in charge right now,

419
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,410
and the chairwoman of Yumin Group, ranked 20th in terms of economic power.

420
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,900
Which means I am someone with the money and power to do whatever I want to you.

421
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,420
The last time you were here, you made a deal with the chief, didn't you?

422
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,320
You did!

423
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,390
If you make a testimony of that, I'll let you go.

424
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,960
You just thought, "She's just a public prosecutor, and she doesn't have the authority to release me," didn't you?

425
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,010
Hey. Prosecutors have independent power of authority.

426
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,910
No matter what the higher-ups say, if I do my utmost to propose the harshest sentence for you,

427
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:37,510
you'll never crawl back out unless you're completely innocent. However, you've got crimes under your belt.

428
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,120
And Chief Ryu Seung Deok, who keeps floating around your head right now ...

429
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,380
Guess where he's gone?

430
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,230
Wow ... this, every time I come here, truly ...

431
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,360
It looks alive.

432
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,860
One of my subordinate prosecutors

433
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:08,610
arrested Lee Bong Sik, thinking that it would help me.

434
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,230
Things got a little complicated,

435
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,590
but l'll find a way to solve everything soon.

436
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,690
But isn't that guy a con man?

437
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,390
The kind of guy who should've been arrested a long time ago.

438
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,880
lf you let him go again, it'll put you in a delicate position this time, too.

439
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,920
Since he scammed people, he should be put in prison. Don't you agree?

440
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,860
Unlike then, you're a chief prosecutor now.

441
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm sure you'll be able to take my daughter's name off the list now.

442
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,850
 Prosecutors submit criminal sentences day and night, 

443
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,360
so they know very well how they'll be punished if they do something wrong.

444
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,570
That's why their capacity to take action is only this much.

445
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,220
l'm sure he's busy brown-nosing Hanju right now. And what about Hanju?

446
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,600
Last time, they called it even just by letting you go and didn't pay you a dime, right?

447
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,080
Hey! Do you know how much they gained thanks to you not giving their names? That was low of them.

448
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:36,140
Forget stingy people like them. Don't you think you had better join hands with me and straighten your life?

449
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,910
Who are you trying to trick?

450
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,360
Bong Sik, use your head.

451
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,480
They let you go once. Now you're back clinging onto them. Do you think they'll let you go again?

452
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,730
Fine. Take time to think it over.

453
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,010
You're feeling anxious right now, aren't you?

454
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,310
You know, when people get to choose either money or power,

455
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,390
they fret about trying to get the other one as well.

456
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,530
But when you have both, your heart is completely at ease. Just like me right now.

457
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,620
If you join hands with me, I'll let you live in luxury in Vietnam for the rest of your life.

458
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,410
You want me to testify?

459
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,270
That's right. Finally, we're speaking the same language.

460
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:23,660
Where's the list? The list of counterfeit artwork customers that disappeared with you when you fled three years ago?

461
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:31,170
- l can't give you that. 
 - Come on. Why is it so hard for you to open your heart to me?

462
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,400
Did you get hurt in your childhood? You're almost breaking  my heart.

463
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,170
Should we talk about something else first, then?

464
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,550
Where's the real Kang Mi Na?

465
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,170
What? You and I have never even met before,

466
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,710
yet you knew I'm not her. So you must know the real Kang Mi Na very well.

467
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,500
Don't you think I'd have that much of brain, at least?

468
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,800
The chief prosecutor hasn't a clue whether you are a friend or foe,

469
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,580
but you are seeing right through him.

470
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,510
That's why I'm recommending that you side with me.

471
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,350
Where is Kang Mi Na?

472
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,470
I don't know, of course.

473
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,200
Hey!

474
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm saying I don't know her whereabouts now. All I did was to put her on the boat to China.

475
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,580
I was told that all the Hanju art dealings would pass through her hands.

476
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,660
I thought they had some dumb chick sitting on that seat, so I went to see her.

477
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:42,820
 This is the work that the Taeryeong Group's madam purchased directly from the artist. 

478
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,170
 I believe she's parting with it due to an unknown circumstance. Other than the chaebols, 

479
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,760
 public officials in high positions are also known to purchase from this series for special gifts used for requests. 

480
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,470
 It's fake, I see. 

481
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,050
 - Pardon?
 - That watch. I'm saying it's fake. 

482
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,910
 I don't know what you mean ... 

483
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:13,150
 Do you know why conning people is a bad thing? It's because people who are in the most dire situation 

484
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,630
 are the ones who fall into the trap. 

485
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:22,460
 Still, we could say you are a better person since you are conning the rich. 

486
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,620
 Whether it's good fortune or misfortune, 

487
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:35,100
 this is the only activity that allows me to get out of the house ... 

488
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,400
 and I ended up meeting a con man? 

489
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,450
But she wasn't the idiot I imagined she was. She suggested a deal.

490
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,500
She said that she might die mysteriously if she remained in Korea,

491
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,490
that she'd buy the paintings at three times the price,

492
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,810
and that I should help her leave the country.

493
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,010
So I managed to get her on the ship. She has a fake passport

494
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:06,020
and a lot of money, so I'm sure she must have fled from China to somewhere.

495
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,040
Are you telling the truth?

496
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,700
Never mind if you don't want to believe it.

497
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,580
So that's it ...

498
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,250
That's right, Bbong* Sik. 
  (double B to make it sound close to the word "fake") .

499
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,610
Then, if you knew full well that I wasn't Kang Mi Na,

500
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,950
why did you try to kill me, you crazy bastard?

501
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,960
Because your identity didn't matter to that person.

502
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,010
"To that person"?

503
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,000
 Kang Mi Na might not be Kang Mi Na. 

504
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,230
 Is that what you're talking about? 

505
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,900
 I already have that information myself. What I need is evidence. 

506
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,530
 Shall I give you a chance? 

507
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,040
 If you bring the evidence, I'll let you live. 

508
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,770
 If finding the evidence is too hard, 

509
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,310
 just kill her off instead. 

510
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:16,220
 That woman's existence in itself is what gets on my nerves, so whether she is the real Kang Mi Na or a fake one 

511
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,150
 doesn't matter at all. 

512
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:25,400
 If you kill her, even if the real Kang Mi Na reappears, she will have no place to return to. 

513
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,500
 You get my gist, don't you? 

514
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,490
Director Han Seong Hye acted as if she was the smartest one around,

515
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,000
but she let that rascal con her and walked into it herself?

516
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,140
You've got a big problem, by the way.

517
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,220
- What?
 - You have too many connections, more than you can handle.

518
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,070
Every side is calculating what to do with you.

519
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,530
Merger, you say?

520
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,200
It's the condition under which they'd acquire Hanju Hotel.

521
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,440
We need to provide the right pretext to the Yunmin side.

522
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,740
I clearly asked you for more time ...

523
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,100
Lee Bong Sik was caught.

524
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,880
Because word of his capture has already spread around the prosecutors' office, they aren't able to pretend it didn't happen.

525
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,050
You know your name is at the top of the counterfeit artwork customer list that Lee Bong Sik is holding.

526
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,350
In the hotel business, nothing matters more than image.

527
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,000
If it were discovered that you made a slush fund using art purchases, even if I give you more time,

528
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,570
you'd just be criticized for longer and cause greater losses to the hotel.

529
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:45,150
The chief prosecutor says that he can remove your name from the list.

530
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,780
Don't you think it's beneficial to Hanju in the long run?

531
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,180
We get rid of the losing business and gain a hotel that's the cream of the crop as a bonus.

532
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,480
It's so like you, Father.

533
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,660
Whenever there's a chance, you only think about yourself.

534
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,270
In the end, you are hoping to gain the Yumin hotel without its owner.

535
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,910
How about doing this?

536
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,580
The heavens helped you when you were caught by me.

537
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,450
Hand over the list, and remain here quietly.

538
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,240
What are you saying?! You said you'd let me go!

539
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,910
Hey, if the woman who told you to kill me, regardless of who I am,

540
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,050
found out that you're here, do you think she'd let you live?

541
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,580
You are safest when you are inside here.

542
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,260
Don't worry about it even if you land in the detention center. The place is full of my people.

543
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,650
Y-Y-You're telling me to t-trust the guards?

544
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,910
Not the guards. I'm saying my people are everywhere among the prisoners.

545
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,870
I won't let you get stabbed. Stay put in there.

546
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,060
By the way, what on earth is your identity?

547
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,570
If you are curious, why not cooperate?

548
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,560
You'll give me the list, right?

549
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,810
Deal!

550
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,610
Yes, Bong Sik.

551
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,630
I'm off. Let's see each other again.

552
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,500
All right.

553
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,090
Why are you waiting for me?

554
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,720
Do you really have to go to my uncle's house?

555
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,510
You stayed here to ask that? Why ask something when you know the answer?

556
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:37,860
I tried so hard to catch a tiger. Things worked out and I find myself right in the tiger's den.

557
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,030
How can I get out of the den now?

558
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,540
What?

559
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,080
You're like this, yet you said you'd listen to me if I asked you not to go somewhere alone?

560
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,970
That's why I ask you not to say things like "don't go."

561
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,200
I won't ask you not to go, since I understand how you feel.

562
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,640
Let me see your phone.

563
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,970
What will you do with it?

564
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,820
Hand it over.

565
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,210
   

566
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,140
I can't do nothing ...
    

567
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,570
   

568
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,640
   

569
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,700
   

570
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,050
If something were to happen, I'll run to you somehow.

571
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,330
Ajeossi is waiting. Go on.

572
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,750
Though you can eat, shave,

573
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,860
and wash your hair alone, I don't think you can do this alone.

574
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,600
As for Kang Mi Na,

575
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,350
Lee Bong Sik said he put her on a boat to China.

576
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,600
He doesn't know her current whereabouts.

577
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,960
I was just hoping that this may help you find her.

578
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,730
I'm off.

579
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,650
 Are you all right? 

580
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,060
  I met the arsonist involved in my father's criminal case. 

581
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,760
 Are you saying the fire was set intentionally? 

582
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,770
 Yes. 

583
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,130
 What did he say? Is he repenting? Showing remorse? 

584
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,390
 No. 

585
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,610
 What a nasty jerk! 

586
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,220
What happened the person who was excited to enter the tiger's den and expose Hanju Group's corruption?

587
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,800
Why are you sighing so much?

588
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,600
It's nothing. I'm full of motivation now.

589
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,210
Not only Director Han, but even you are like this. Is it because you are young?

590
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,100
I mean ...  What are you trying to do jumping in, head first, when you only have suspicions?

591
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,870
When did you say that accident took place?

592
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,990
Why can't you answer? Wasn't your memory back fully?

593
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:50,950
It is. Every memory came back without fail, all of it.

594
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,250
What is it? Did you remember something important?

595
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,380
Yu Jun!

596
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,070
What's taking this nuna so long?

597
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,170
   

598
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,330
   

599
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,480
Even with amnesia, her thoughtlessness towards me remains the same.

600
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,510
I'm home.

601
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,960
What an exciting and honorable event it is.

602
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,480
They say people change when about to die.

603
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,840
Someone who hasn't shown the tip of her nose while our family was gathered,

604
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,120
is now suddenly greeting us.

605
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,300
Gosh, it's said that if you're nice to your in-laws once, they'll ask for it ten more times.

606
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,420
What?

607
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,910
I was saying that I must be such a lucky woman.

608
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,280
With one mere greeting, you welcome me in such a jolly way.

609
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,520
You came at the right time. Come and sit down.

610
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,250
Ah, yes.

611
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:07,500
I was planning on telling everyone when all were present.

612
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,670
I did bring this up last time as well.

613
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,850
It's regarding Yumin Hotel.

614
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:19,750
How do you feel about expanding it by acquiring Hanju hotel?

615
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:24,340
Can you discuss this without the owner of the hotel present?

616
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,650
I know about it.

617
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:33,920
It is certainly inefficient to run two identical businesses separately when we're the same family.

618
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,710
The most competent of us two can take over the management. Think about it, Sister-in-Law.

619
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,720
Boy, it's said in-laws keep giving their daughter-in-law stuff like this

620
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,040
making her life harder, while mistakenly believing that they are being generous.

621
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,660
I'm saying that I'm such a lucky woman. Since my in-laws aren't like that.

622
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,320
Take it easy, Sister-in-law.

623
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,230
Don't you think you're letting your true colors show too much, now that your situation has changed?

624
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,030
Rather than revealing my true self, I'd say I'm back in my right mind.

625
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,810
I realized I had to,  in order to live in this household.

626
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,840
Didn't you come back to your senses already after that car accident not that long ago?

627
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,140
I think you should make regular use of some brakes.

628
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,580
My brakes are perfectly fine. If no one messes with them, that is.

629
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,410
I think you should also have those brakes, Hyeong-nim.

630
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,780
Anyway, I'll gratefully accept the merger.

631
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,990
In many ways, it's all the better for me if the relationship with Hanju becomes closer.

632
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,780
So are you saying you'll side with the little sister-in-law?

633
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,370
Why are you asking such a question?

634
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:55,310
Based on my earlier observation, things are starting to become advantageous for your wife.

635
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:59,170
You have to firmly partner with your wife

636
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,190
in order for me to decide whether to stand with or against her.

637
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:07,150
What connection would I have to her without you in the middle?

638
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,830
She would just be an ajumma who is a stranger to me.

639
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,770
Ah, seriously. You should ask a suitable question.

640
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,130
If the husband doesn't take his wife's side, whose side would he take instead?

641
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:23,910
Excuse me. With whom we side is of no importance whatsoever to them.

642
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,740
A while back I told Eonni I'd definitely be on her side, only to be openly ignored and belittled by her.

643
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:34,060
I'd like to think that perhaps Nuna has been ignoring us as she does not count us as competition.

644
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,250
Now that the situation has shifted a bit ...

645
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,480
- Where are you headed in the middle of our conversation?
 - What do you mean?

646
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,430
A husband should go to his wife.

647
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,510
What's Han Seong Hye up to?

648
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,380
She's not the type to easily hand over a hotel she made with her sweat and blood.

649
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,760
Gosh.

650
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:18,520
Honey. As Nuna said before, aren't you overworking yourself, so soon after the car accident?

651
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,020
Nah, I'm not overworking myself.

652
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,950
Come on. I think you might be tired.

653
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,260
- Are you going to work early tomorrow as well?
 - Yes, I am.

654
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,480
Really? What time?

655
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,770
Right now. I have to go out now.

656
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,300
I'm off.

657
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,100
That rude little ...

658
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,430
 I don't want these kind of incidents happening in this house anymore. 

659
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,520
 Not anymore, you say? 

660
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,340
 Is it possibly related to Director Han Seung Wuk's father? 

661
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:08,920
 If he hadn't passed away in that manner, the current situation would be much different. 

662
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,200
We were able to catch the culprit thanks to you.

663
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,750
Thank you.

664
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,920
The one who drove when you were in the recent accident was Han Seung Wuk, right?

665
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,360
Did he get hurt anywhere?

666
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,670
His arm is a bit ...

667
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,780
If it's all right with you,

668
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,100
could you give him this for me?

669
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,880
I was going to give it to him the last time, but he ended up leaving without even having dinner.

670
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,480
I'd like him to control his emotions, as he thinks about his father.

671
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,820
Pardon?

672
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,480
If you dislike someone, you will become similar to that someone.

673
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,680
And in some cases, when you cause an incident,

674
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,180
you cannot put things back to the way they were before.

675
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,240
If you're uncomfortable giving him this, you don't have to.

676
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,600
Not at all. I have something to tell him anyway, so I'll give it to him.

677
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,780
It is clear that Director Kim has a lot of affection for you.

678
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,100
How would you know that?

679
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,730
Without affection, it is not possible to make this spicy cockle dish.

680
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:46,620
These have to washed over and over, until you say to yourself "I'm never going to buy these damn cockles again".

681
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,670
But she made this many? She has to be someone who holds you very dear.

682
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,890
Why don't you eat it?

683
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,230
Ah, is it difficult to eat with one hand?

684
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,630
It's the dish my father liked. I haven't seen it since he passed away.

685
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,050
It's a bit hard for me to eat it.

686
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:11,460
I guess you were really close to your father.

687
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,730
There hasn't been a day I haven't thought of him since he passed.

688
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,220
I guess he was a really good father.

689
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,440
Isn't every father a good father to his children?

690
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,690
Even the arsonist who caused my father's death ...

691
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,870
Even someone like him started to talk to me about his daughter.

692
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,410
But ... did you come here to give me these at this hour?

693
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:46,910
Ah, I have tons of work pending at the office, so I dropped this off on my way over there.

694
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,410
- Enjoy!
 - Wait ...

695
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,400
Have you ever raised a puppy?

696
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,720
Nope. Why do you ask?

697
00:55:53,720 --> 00:56:00,790
As you said, I think I can wash my hair, shave, and eat on my own,

698
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,380
but there's one thing I just can't do, no matter what.

699
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,070
Just pretend you're blow-drying dog fur and take it easy.

700
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,080
I mean ... I just couldn't do it with one hand.

701
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,970
You've just got to be fussy, don't you?

702
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,380
All it takes is a few flicks of a towel.

703
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,740
Then I can't get my style right. Since I have very straight hair.

704
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,750
 My birthday is the anniversary of my father's death. 

705
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:36,870
 If he hadn't passed away in that manner, the current situation would be much different. 

706
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,190
 I'm curious where you'll be going when you go back. 

707
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,530
 What ... Are you worried that I might be a dangerous person? 

708
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:48,870
 I'm wondering if you might find yourself in danger. 

709
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:52,840
 If something were to happen, I'll run to you somehow. 

710
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,330
That's enough on that side.

711
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,190
I mean, if you just keep it on one side ... Argh! So hot!

712
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,100
It's really hot!

713
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,810
I think ... you might ... burn my scalp ...

714
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,980
I'm sorry.

715
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,840
Well, you don't need to apologize with such a serious look.

716
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,160
Right.

717
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,060
Oh, I find you here.

718
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:51,500
Ah, right. I had a lot of overdue work at the office, so I stopped by on my way over there.

719
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,790
I came by early just to sleep here, since it's burdensome to drive back and forth during rush hours.

720
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:02,690
Why are you still in a cast when they said you can be out of it by now, Director?

721
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,370
Wh-Who said that?

722
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,530
You know who.

723
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,730
The doctor said that.

724
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:19,100
As it was a soft cast, it was short-term and you could have removed it sooner.

725
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,430
Why are you still wearing it?

726
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,000
I'll be going now.

727
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,310
Why has the mood changed since my arrival?

728
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,710
Were you two badmouthing me?

729
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,420
You hair is all dry already.

730
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,150
Oh my goodness!

731
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,040
Why are you sleeping here?

732
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,170
Are you all right, Nuna?

733
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,070
You're fine. I'm relieved.

734
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,180
Why are you acting like that?

735
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:08,180
I logged into the prosecutors' forum earlier. They were in a frenzy about how Lee Bong Sik hit you with a brick,

736
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,570
and how you caught him by spinning two-and-a-half turns in the air and landing a flying kick on him.

737
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:13,470
Are you all right?

738
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,740
Why are they so into other people's business?

739
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,810
They are all impressed that you arrested the culprit of an unsolved case from three years ago.

740
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:25,460
They're saying that last time you threatened to blow the whistle, and this time you're cozying up to the chief prosecutor.

741
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,310
But how did you know it was Lee Bong Sik and was able to catch him?

742
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,180
Don't tell me that's why you came here?

743
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,700
Do you really think that's why?

744
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:37,750
I wanted to check that you're fine. I was also worried about you making a mistake tomorrow, since you'll be the focus of attention.

745
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,220
So I came over to do a brief check of your work this early morning.

746
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,100
Is that right, my Yu Jun? I'm so glad you came.

747
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,890
Don't just casually check,

748
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:51,130
but separate the "need immediate decision" cases from the "need to investigate" cases.

749
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,490
For the "need immediate decision" ones, please write the arraignment for me.

750
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,100
It's truly simple, no?

751
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,170
What?

752
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,020
Has your memory come back?

753
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,520
- No. 
 - It has.

754
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,230
Why didn't you tell me?

755
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,290
I didn't have the time to tell you.

756
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:14,900
Fine. You can tell me during the end-of-the-year party if a thought of me pops into your head.

757
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,030
Why are you mad?

758
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,530
Yu Jun, do you know what made me the saddest since the return of my memory?

759
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,450
I filed so many cases as non-indictment last month

760
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:29,630
that I have to hit the quota of prosecution this month. That's the first thing I thought about.

761
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,870
How bad would things have to be for me to be here at this hour?

762
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,900
Are you going to the bathroom? You're coming back, right?

763
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,070
I'm trusting you.

764
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,480
I know that your brain is over-working right now.

765
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,060
The fact that you are headed to prison is a known outcome.

766
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:58,140
I will somehow release you on probation, so spend some time in prison.

767
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,510
Is that all?

768
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,190
You've got some nerve, haven't you?

769
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:11,670
Look at this rascal. Do you want to spend a lot of time in prison?

770
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,700
It's just ... Are you going to let me go?

771
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,560
Without any conditions?

772
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,200
Reveal the list you have.

773
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,280
Not as is.

774
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,630
Just fix it a little bit.

775
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,410
This nuna, really ... she's seriously getting me concerned.

776
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,550
Hey, Bong Sik.

777
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,280
Someone must have stopped by.

778
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:20,230
Han Seong Hye, this chick. She asked to put Kang Mi Na's name instead of hers?

779
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,290
Since Kang Mi Na is already being criticized,

780
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,300
she wants Kang Mi Na to be made liable for the slush fund and illegal lobbying charges too,

781
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,280
so that Kang Mi Na is pushed out of the merger discussion.

782
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,050
What can she do, when the dude who has the list is in my hands?

783
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:35,360
You have no reason to involve yourself in that merging issue or whatnot, anyway.

784
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,040
That's not your place. And you don't have the time to do it either.

785
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,950
Still, why should I let them steal a hotel from her for free?

786
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,120
What are you going to do?

787
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,650
I already did it.

788
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:49,490
These chaebol punks, since they always give the publicly traded companies to their children,

789
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:54,690
they believe they own the companies. But the true owners are the shareholders.

790
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:58,540
And especially the largest shareholder.

791
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:19,850
My oppa had mentioned numerous times that expansion through mergers and acquisition was the most effective.

792
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:24,730
But is it right to already talk about this with me?

793
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,250
I could have done it earlier.

794
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,600
Is some list really being released to the public?

795
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,660
Yes?

796
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,670
You two must have been talking about something important.

797
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,750
Since it's not our first meeting, I won't need to introduce myself again, I suppose?

798
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,510
Of course, I know you.

799
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,450
That time during the shareholders' meeting,

800
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:54,550
the majority shareholder who appeared talking about voting or something.

801
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:58,280
Why do I feel that you're on guard? I'm sure we should be on the same side.

802
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,820
Well, to be honest, I'd rather not be on the same team

803
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,480
with a person with less than sterling integrity.

804
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,400
I wonder if you are aware of the odd rumor about you and my married niece.

805
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,550
It's too sordid to bring myself to mention it.

806
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,710
Are you talking about an affair?

807
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,690
This is a proposal for the Hanju hotel merger and acquisition.
    

808
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,000
Why is a board director talking about this?

809
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,450
It's as if something has happened to Chairwoman Kang Mi Na.

810
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,170
Seung Wuk, what are you saying?

811
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:36,430
Having secret discussions with people from Hanju behind the back of Yumin shareholders,

812
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,840
isn't it something like an affair in the business world?

813
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,840
What about you stop this, before I bring it up as an issue at the board meeting?

814
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:47,940
It appears there's a misunderstanding between us.

815
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,580
Let's consider the affair issue null and void.

816
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,640
If you'd like, I shall.

817
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,280
But I'm sure you already know

818
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,660
that the vote you like so much only works during an election.

819
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:03,070
Elections can be entirely lost even if you lose by 1%, but publicly traded companies are different.

820
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:09,820
Whether we win or lose, the 40% shares we have will remain in our hands.

821
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,910
I'll keep that in mind.

822
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:20,600
Whether the list has 100 names added or subtracted,

823
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,290
it is my prerogative to publicize it or not.

824
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:27,680
No matter whose name is in it, it has nothing to do with you.

825
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,650
You got your memory back. Why are you still so concerned about them?

826
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,210
Is it perhaps because of that guy, Han Seung Wuk?

827
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,580
Why are you suddenly so serious?

828
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:44,360
Han Seung Wuk would know that your memory is back, of course.

829
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,590
Then, does he know about that too?

830
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:53,020
About his father's case that he brought me. Does he know whose fault that is?

831
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,850
What do you know?

832
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,310
I found out while I was investigating it.

833
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:09,410
I didn't say anything as I didn't find the need to reveal it when your memory hadn't returned.

834
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:14,050
That's because, to me, it doesn't matter what kind of parents you have.

835
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:18,140
But Han Seung Wuk is different.

836
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:22,670
Does Han Seung Wuk also know?

837
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,060
I couldn't tell him.

838
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,020
What makes you hesitate?

839
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:31,100
Are you worried that he will be hurt by it?

840
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,560
Or do you have something else in mind?

841
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,770
   

842
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:16,220
The prosecutor who wanted to meet with me

843
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,290
was you?

844
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:29,720


845
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,950
   

846
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:55,160
I can wash my hair, shave, and eat by myself,

847
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,880
but cutting meat is a bit hard.

848
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,150
If you have time, I wanted to ask you to come and cut it for me.

849
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,880
 The doctor said your arm was just fine. 

850
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,670
About that ... Ajeossi didn't hear it correctly.

851
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,480
 Just cut it using scissors. 

852
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,130
 Why did you want me to come over? 

853
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:18,330
I can wash my hair, shave, and eat by myself,

854
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,440
but I can't open the juice bottle.

855
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,360
My goodness, are there only juices like this?

856
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,330
It'd be nice if you can stop by and open—

857
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:29,650
Hello? Hel–

858
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,060
I really, really can't put a nail in the wall by myself.

859
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,420
You really, really have to come here and help me.

860
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,620
Right?

861
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,840
 Do it later. 

862
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,350
"Later"?

863
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,080
Damn it, she's smart.

864
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,930
   

865
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,630
 Isn't it cheating to suddenly jump in like this? 

866
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,820
 I didn't know this fight had rules. 

867
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:10,180
 I'm just waiting for the perfect opportunity to shove every one of the bad guys into jail. 

868
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,550
 Tell them to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid, instead of trying to protect him from others. 

869
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:19,200
 So stop looking down on me whenever you see me, all right? 

870
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,180
 This stupid wench. How dare she try to hold me back?  
    

871
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,080
 So it's because of Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju? 

872
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,590
 What's your relationship with Prosecutor Jo Yeon Ju? 

873
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,570
 And I ... am the daughter of the arsonist, Kang Myeong Guk.
