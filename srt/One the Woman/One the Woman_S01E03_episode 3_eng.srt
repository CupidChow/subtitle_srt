1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,540
It's obvious. No matter how we try to control it, the gossip has already spread everywhere it could reach.

2
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,430
This issue could be used against us at the shareholders' meeting.

3
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,800
Omo! This means that even if we don't do anything, she could be chased out with nothing to her name.

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,860
How many times must I tell you that it's more beneficial right now if she's with us?

5
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,160
Even if the remaining shareholders combine their shares,

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,100
as long as the major shareholders back Seong Wun's wife, there won't be any issue, right?

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,430
Yes. We're pursuing their whereabouts, but one of them is in South America and can't really be reached.

8
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,390
We're also looking for the other one.

9
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,090
Keep trying to reach those two major shareholders,

10
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,240
and let's wait and see what happens until the shareholders' meeting.

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,270
But then ... Do you think that Sister-in-law's memory has returned?

12
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,020
Don't you feel that she's overreacting, just because she heard us

13
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,590
speaking English and French?

14
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,810
What difference does it make if her memory has returned or not?

15
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,800
This is all because you trained her badly.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,500
With her temper, imagine how it will be if she gets the control of her company? Would she listen to us as before?

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,460
I think it's actually better if her memory returns. My endurance has its limits.

18
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,800
I want to kick her around now.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,130
Still, let's wait until the shareholders' meeting is over.

20
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,350
Watching her earlier, it seems we could get our hair pulled out if we aren’t careful.

21
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,100
So why didn’t you speak more cautiously?

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,860
You weren’t especially nice to her either, Nuna.

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,790
She said it's something a subordinate could say.

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,260
You ... seem a bit excited.

25
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,310
The scene earlier felt slightly cathartic to me.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Are you taking her side right now, Oppa?

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
Is that important?

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,910
As it is, no matter whose side I take, it won't influence how Hanju flows.

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,300


30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,490
I'm sorry about today.

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,830
Do you have a particularly Confucian way of thinking?

32
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,900
Are you here to bicker with me like a condescending elder?

33
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,450
Sure. I lost my temper a bit.

34
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,360
But that can happen! You heard it all too, earlier.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,140
Also, after a shocking experience, one might let out emotions violently—

36
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,040
You ... Who are you?

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,200
- What? 
 - I asked, who are you?

38
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,130
What's your identity?

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,810
Where is the real Mi Na?

40
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,430
What do you mean, "the real Mi Na"? Are you saying I'm not the real Kang Mi Na?

41
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,890
You truly can't remember anything?

42
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,530
How many times do I have to tell you?

43
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,030
 Her behavior after the accident was recorded very thoroughly.  

44
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,490
 It seems that it would be very difficult to feign memory impairment. 

45
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,760
 The issue is, does this woman know this or not? 

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,450
 Of course. If she doesn't know, 

47
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,920
she's also a victim, in a way.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,350
Who knows what Hanju will do if you make a big deal out of it?

49
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,920
 They may use her because of her fortune. More than that— 

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,820
 They could find the real Mi Na and do something to her. 

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,120
Of course. Since, according to succession laws, the entirety of Yumin Group could be handed over to us.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,590
 I wouldn't put it past these people to do that. 

53
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,720
 For now, let's just see how the situation progresses. 

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,970
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,180
You're so different from the usual Mi Na, so I think I was confused for a second—

56
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,950
Look at this. Before, you spoke to me without honorifics, so why the sudden politeness now?

57
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,050
But the strange one is actually you.

58
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,740
I’m “quite different from the usual Mi Na”?

59
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,640
This isn't proper attitude for a cousin-in-law who has just returned from the US.

60
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,850
It's my turn to ask. What's your identity?

61
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,220
Did we have some kind of relationship?

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
Perhaps...

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,970
an affair?

64
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,450
I've caused you much trouble.

65
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,560
Wait, wait! Are you just going to leave like that?

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,550
Are you just going to say all you want, apologize and then leave?

67
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,220
What do you want me to do?

68
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,810
Did you bring your car?

69
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,460
Pardon?

70
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,110
   

71
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,380
How did you get there without a car?

72
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,540
Someone without a car or taxi fare is in no position to talk.

73
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,480
It's not that I don't have a taxi fare.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,340
The fare is in my bag. My bag is in the car.

75
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,450
And the car? It left without me.

76
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,950
What are you going to do now?

77
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,800
What can I do?

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,710
Since they probably don't know I overheard them, I'll see how much they keep lying to me.

79
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,020
Wait until I get my inheritance. They’re done for.

80
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,280
Will you be able to get the inheritance?

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
What are you saying, out of the blue?

82
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,560
Management rights are not inherited. You have to be appointed by shareholders.

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,650
Everyone who was here earlier is either a member of Yumin Group's shareholders’ meeting or knows someone who is.

84
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,910
By now, they'll have told everybody what they saw.

85
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,720
That the Yumin Group's heiress is mentally unstable and—

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,830
You're saying something strange.

87
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,510
Are you saying that I have a mental problem?

88
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,020
You heard earlier. That family is the one with mental issues!

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,980
Even if everyone else thinks you are abnormal,  if you are considered normal within your own circle, you are normal.

90
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,850
Wow ...

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,820
In any case, after hearing the rumor, the shareholders will call for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting.

92
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,990
They might entertain a dismissal resolution.  Because they can't allow their property to be controlled by a lunatic.

93
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,920
Amazing. Are you saying I'll be dismissed immediately because I said something that was right?

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,980
I know you're angry,

95
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,550
but making Hanju your enemy won't do you any good.

96
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,400
They are the only ones who will protect you until the shareholders' meeting.

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,690
Can I believe what you're saying?

98
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,940
Do as you wish.  Believe it or not.

99
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,360
Perhaps ...  are you saying "do as you wish" to avoid responsibility later?

100
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,480
Is that your ploy?

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,520
What do you want me to say?

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
How bad is this situation for me to have become so distrustful?

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,580
Whatever people say, I can't tell whether it's false or true,

104
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,090
whether they're a friend or foe and if I should smile or glare at them.

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,860
Why are we getting off together?  Why don't you take the taxi home?

106
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,220
Don’t you have money to pay for the ride?

107
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,820
I have enough to pay. I also have something to say.

108
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,900
What else is there?

109
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,890
I want to say I’m sorry

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,980
that I made a joke before about you losing your memory.

111
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,940
If someone doesn't remember, shouldn't they be able to start over without being bound to the past?

112
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,660
I've wondered about that occasionally.

113
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,790
That's why I treated it so lightly when you said you couldn't remember.

114
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,320
I got out of the taxi to apologize to you.

115
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,070
Go on in.

116
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,700
Where are you crawling in, after humiliating your family?

117
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,330
When hurting your head, you should have been thoroughly injured so you couldn't move.

118
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,750
Just go and jump onto a car again.

119
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,070
Is that all?

121
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,960
Because I’m trying to speak carefully, I really have nothing more to say.

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,170
Now I finally understand you. Why you say everything you want.

123
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,770
What did you just say?

124
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,320
And here I thought you had returned to your old self.

125
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,970
But Sister-in-law, you were a bit mean to Seon Wu earlier.

126
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,800
How could you do that to a child, in front of all those people?

127
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,970
Do you look down on him because I raised him by myself?

128
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,230
What will you do if my Seon Wu is traumatized because of that?

129
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,660
After all, as a woman alone,

130
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,220
how can I raise him well by myself?

131
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,840
There’s no suitable role model,

132
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,320
and I worry so much every day.

133
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,060
I see. Don't worry. Just look at Mother and raise him, Sister-in-law.

134
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,220
- What? 
 - "Just don't be like her"... That's enough of a role model.

135
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,590
I know, right? I don't have to worry.

136
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,550
Oh no, Mother.  I'm not saying she's right.

137
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,290
Today, I went too far.  I'll go to my room.

138
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,780
She should have lost all her gusto.

139
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,130
Why is she still in such high spirits?

140
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,230
Even so, she is still being submissive, right, Mother?

141
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,470
Was that “being submissive”?

142
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,520
She was playing "strike people with words" at an expert level.

143
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,070
I was too submissive.

144
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,770
As expected, submissiveness isn't for me.

145
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,870
 I'm sorry that I made a joke before about you losing your memory. 

146
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,390
What was that? I was over it all anyway.

147
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,770
Why do my legs hurt so much? I'm sore all over.

148
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,290
This is why it hurts.

149
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,240
They shouldn't be new. Why am I getting blisters?

150
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,430
 They don't "quite" fit perfectly. 

151
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,000
 Whether it’s a curse or a blessing, they say she has amnesia. 

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,660
 Since she's forgotten how she was treated, you only need to treat her with common sense. Why are you all— 

153
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,580
 Then it means that I knew everything these people had done. 

154
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,500
 Only the memories before a certain point disappeared. 

155
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,830
 Her memories are gone but the emotions will be left. 

156
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,370
 In truth, there weren't even any emotions. 

157
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,920
 It felt I was a blank page with everyone. 

158
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,740
 You were monitored according to your schedule, 24 hours a day.  

159
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,870
 Even your clothes. You only wore what was chosen for you. 

160
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,520
  Right now, it's heaven. Everyone is being nice to you. 

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,350
Then I wouldn't have hidden anything in a place like this.

162
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:59,420
Nice car! Look at this! Oh my...

163
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,480
Wow ...

164
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,960
This car is so good!

165
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,140
Awesome! Look at the reverse cornering on this one!

166
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,800
Was I a hell of a good driver as well?

167
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,750
My goodness ...

168
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,410
Of course, everyone in this century needs this to multitask.

169
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,750
What? Whose car is that?

170
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,310
I said I wasn't able to answer the phone today.

171
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,980
Regardless ...  How could you come here? What if someone sees you?

172
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,330
Who? Your wife?

173
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,420
Ah, I see ... Now that her situation has changed, don't tell me you're scared of upsetting her?

174
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,180
You're right that her situation has changed, but you've changed as well.

175
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,040
We've been together for quite a while. Why do you nag this much lately?

176
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,340
For now, go home. I'll call you later. Hurry and leave. Go.

177
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,430
Oh, it is you!

178
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,740
- Look at this. We got caught. I knew this would happen! 
 - Wow, this car is really nice!

179
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,230
Ah, move away.

180
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,920
What are you doing in there instead of going in?

181
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,380
Long time no see...

182
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,390
I heard you had a lot of bad things happen, but you seem to have overcome them quickly.

183
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,880
Who...?

184
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,260
For now, let's go inside.

185
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,670
Are you pretending you don't know me, now?

186
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,000
It seems I've seen you somewhere ... You look quite familiar.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,210
The news. You saw her on the news.

188
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,560
She's announcer Park So Yi from SBC's 9 p.m. news.

189
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,050
What are you trying to do right now?

190
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,460
Should I tell you who I am, specifically?

191
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,910
Your husband and I have been seeing each other since before you met—

192
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,180
- You don't need to bring that up. 
 - What?

193
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,260
Well, She is ... No, I mean ...

194
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,900
Well, it's not a good story to begin with.

195
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,110
I see ... So, you two are having an affair and I'm aware of it?

196
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,880
And she shamelessly comes in and out of here?

197
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,720
Yes.

198
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,170
I'm not just a good driver. I'm patient as well.

199
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,160
I couldn't stand you when you did nothing but watched us like a voyeur.

200
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,580
But I can't stand you either when you're being sarcastic like this.

201
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,630
Let's stop. If I start screaming, you'll be embarrassed.

202
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,200
Embarrassed?

203
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,890
Wow. In our country, since when has the wife had to be embarrassed when the husband is the one cheating?

204
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,470
For someone on the news, you are very disrespectful.

205
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,310
Disrespectful?

206
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,660
How many times do I have to tell you? I've never once been disrespectful toward you.

207
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
I've always made sure he sleeps at home.

208
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,780
That's why I'm so mad. All he does at home is sleep.

209
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,180
He's useless! This isn't some kind of hotel!

210
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,360
Stop already! Let's go inside, all right?

211
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,920
Ah, let go! This is the only time you touch me!

212
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,710
Huh?

213
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,920
I'll just stand in the middle.

214
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,850
Look here. What exactly are we competing for?

215
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,650
This very confused man who doesn't even know whose side to take?

216
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,360
I don't want to be part of this fight where I have nothing to gain.

217
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,260
So, you two can make love or break up all you want.

218
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,020
But don't ever step into this house again. Understand?

219
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,050
Is your wife on drugs? What's up with her?

220
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,320
I know. Her face is no longer expressionless.

221
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,810
But I have no idea what she might be thinking.

222
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,520
What?

223
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,630
I have to find out.

224
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,300
Leave, all right?

225
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,170
How could she come here?

226
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,380
Your room is out front. What? Do you have amnesia too?

227
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,530
I didn't ask her to come. She suddenly arrived by herself.

228
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,630
By the way she drove in here so smoothly,

229
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,230
it's obvious she's been here more than once.

230
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,840
You're worse than her for making a perfectly good woman

231
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,480
sneak into someone else's garage. You're the jerk.

232
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,870
Fine. If making me into a jerk makes you feel better, go ahead.

233
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,550
No way. You're blaming me for calling you a jerk

234
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,290
when you're the one doing all kinds of bad stuff.

235
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,530
You're very smart with things like this, aren't you?

236
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,380
Fine, fine, I got it.

237
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,810
Stop saying a hundred things when one thing someone said bothers you.

238
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,640
Nothing good will come from the shareholders' meeting if more people suspect you've changed.

239
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,130
Don't act as if you care about me.

240
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,770
I'm being sincere, here.

241
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,580
Sincere? Hey, there's even a movie about how the Joker has sincere feelings.

242
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,760
I don't care about your feelings.

243
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,660
I have to wake up at 4 a.m...

244
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,890
and grill deodeok* that your father is craving, so I have to go to bed. 
 (Codonopsis lanceolata root) 

245
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,320
Can you leave?

246
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,180
- I'm leaving. 
 - Good night!

247
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,860
Good night.

248
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,780
Good night, my foot.

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,410
The unit across the hallway must be empty.

250
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,320
The interior took a while but now it's finally presentable.

251
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,060
The layout is different in each unit.

252
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,300
This is the largest one, the "royal size."

253
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,370
But are you sure it's enough?

254
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,060
What's wrong with this place?

255
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,730
I came back to Korea to invest in social businesses. To me, this is like a palace.

256
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,030
Hello.

257
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,670
Hyeong-nim*.
 (lit: "elder brother". Also said by subordinates to gangster bosses) 

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,210
The ones held at the prosecution office are small fry, so there's no need to worry.

259
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,380
The prosecutors will get nothing out of them.

260
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,600
And the girl?

261
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,040
It seems she only knows the leader of the World Cup gang.

262
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,890
The others don't know her. We're searching the downtown Seopyeong area right now.

263
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,170
What's her identity? How can she disappear without a trace?

264
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,800
- Where is she hiding that even you can't find her? 
 - I'm sorry.

265
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,570
Downtown Seopyeong is not that big! Is it?

266
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,890
How could she look just like her? It's unbelievable.

267
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,530
- What will you do now? 
 - First, I have to find the real  Mi Na.

268
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,890
Please, check the emergency department at every hospital in the country.

269
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,140
Do you plan to look for her without informing the Hanju people?

270
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,600
We have to meet the real Mi Na first. You said it too.

271
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,730
That we don't know what Hanju will do if they find that the current Kang Mi Na is fake.

272
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,970
Regardless of what happens, we must find the real one first.

273
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,160
They said that as the chairman, he wants to be first to arrive at the company. What's taking him so long?

274
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,430
At this point, the security guard ajeossi will take over.

275
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,090
Have you heard there will be an extraordinary  shareholders' meeting today?

276
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,630
No, Father. As you can see, I've been cooking all morning.

277
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,030
How can you be in the kitchen right now, without a care in the world?

278
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,300
If you had asked for simple toast

279
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,090
rather than a full-course breakfast, I wouldn't have to be in the kitchen "without a care in the world."

280
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,660
It's very unfortunate.

281
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,860
- What about the major shareholders? Still no response? 
 - Yes.

282
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,400
Seeing that an extraordinary meeting is being held so quickly, it's not going to be easy.

283
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,360
Don't embarrass the entire family by letting it be known that you've lost your mind. Just stay home.

284
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,390
Father!

285
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,330
Won't you have some deodeok before you leave?

286
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,400
I peeled and pounded it all by myself.

287
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,260
Pound some more!

288
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,520
Good for you. Go make some juice so we can drink after eating.

289
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,300
Mom, you should stop.

290
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,930
Why? Compared to how I usually treat her, I'm being an angel right now.

291
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,970
What about your food?

292
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,060
Hey, I'm letting you off easily by just telling you to make juice.

293
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,920
If I went all out, you would be making Sujeonggwa* instead. 
 (cinnamon punch made from dried persimmons and ginger) 

294
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,820
- Mom, stop it! 
 - What's wrong with you too? Did you eat something bad?

295
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,130
I have something to say to Sister-in-law.

296
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,140
Sister-in-law, it's about the day you got hit by a car.

297
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,960
I had told you to go pick up my shoes but you never went there.

298
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,550
Since you're not going to the shareholders' meeting, go pick up my shoes from the department store.

299
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,730
Before all of that,

300
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,430
I need some more soup.

301
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,070
Things have finally gone back to normal.

302
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,860
Letting me off? For what?

303
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,410
What did I do so wrong?

304
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,270
I'm their daughter-in-law, not their slave.

305
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,130
Why is everyone ordering me around?

306
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,700
Today, we have to wash the curtains. Please hurry up.

307
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,320
Oh, my. Curtains?

308
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,210
Director. You heard them earlier, right?

309
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,000
They heard about an emergency shareholders' meeting because of me and suddenly their attitude changes.

310
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,240
At the shareholders' meeting, if they decide not to give me management rights nor shares, and I become penniless,

311
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,930
I will suffer so much starting tomorrow.

312
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,610
Can't you go easy on me today, for just one day?

313
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,620
All right.  I'll take care of the curtains.

314
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,050
What?  She's not denying it.  That makes it even scarier.

315
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,640
Am I really going to be ruined?

316
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:40,480
Wow, seriously. Oh, this is really good. Damn.

317
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,390
Hello.

318
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,300
She's on vacation. She's not back yet.

319
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,340
Yes, thank you.

320
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,920
Calls asking for Prosecutor Jo keep coming in.

321
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,800
I mean, fine, let's say she took yesterday off too. But shouldn't she be back today?

322
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,670
I know. She may be corrupt, but she works diligently.

323
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,460
That's right. Diligently taking bribes.

324
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,280
Good morning.

325
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,670
Hello.

326
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,920
Isn't Prosecutor Jo in yet?

327
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,190
Why? What's going on? Is something up?

328
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,650
She was supposed to return yesterday, and she didn't apply for an extra day's leave.

329
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,730
- What about her phone? 
 - It's off.

330
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,680
Wow, she must be somewhere nice.

331
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,980
- If you do get hold of her, tell her to call me, please. 
 - Yes, sir.

332
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,170
Good day.

333
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,330
Shouldn't we tell him that the Second Division took the Hanju Group bribery case?

334
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,930
It seemed as if they were going to send a summons right away.

335
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,650
And what if we told him, then Prosecutor Jo gets angry with us when she returns?

336
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,680
Where is she? What is she doing? Does she know this is an emergency situation?

337
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,130
 The number you're trying to reach... 

338
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,390
It's still off.

339
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,700
 It's an emergency. 

340
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,950
I can't think straight after waking up at 4 a.m. every day.

341
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,290
I think I'll die of sleep deprivation before any emergency.

342
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,150
Excuse me, Director.

343
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,820
Yes?

344
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,320
Do you know what "four at breakfast, two at lunch, and three at dinner" means?

345
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,070
It's the number of times I set the table for yesterday's meals in this house.

346
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,650
Four times for breakfast. Lunch was twice. And three times for dinner.

347
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,080
Why don't they all eat at the same time?

348
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,480
Sleep-deprived every day,

349
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,450
doing all the housework, and a husband who cheats on me.

350
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,870
I can't live like this anymore.  I'm going to that shareholders' meeting!

351
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,490
Whatever it takes, I'll go to the meeting and prove I'm perfectly sane.

352
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,410
And I'm going to take my inheritance. I'll no longer obediently do as I am ordered!

353
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,500
I won't keep being their docile little puppet!

354
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,100
When you come back, bring Han Seong Mi's shoes.

355
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,880
Yes, ma'am!

356
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,130
Trang.

357
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,050
Knife skills should be in the muscle memory, but ...

358
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,130
So strange.

359
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,180
Honey.

360
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm on your side.

361
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,330
You're on my side, Honey?

362
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,340
Then why don't you just eat with the others,

363
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,690
instead of making me set the table twice

364
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,720
because you were sleeping while the others were eating?

365
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,340
There's no reason for you to look down on me that much, is there?

366
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,600
Something else you've forgotten, Honey,

367
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,120
is that you and I are the same class.

368
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,160
You chose me because I'm an heir of this family.

369
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,530
What nonsense is this?

370
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,720
Just saying. Have a nice day.

371
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,930
What is this car?

372
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,390
Oh, I bought it yesterday.

373
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,640
My foundation began distributing coal to the needy.

374
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,390
Those neighborhood alleys are so narrow that my car won't fit.

375
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,130
I'll use this for volunteer work.

376
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,780
You're very picky.

377
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,350
But Agassi, are you going to work?

378
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,150
Yes, I should at least go in twice a week.

379
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,260
In this day and age,

380
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,950
what if someone has a problem with that?

381
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,660
Why? Do you think my slacking off will upset everyone else?

382
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,890
That's not my problem. I was born with everything, so I don't have any tenacity.

383
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,540
Good for you.

384
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,900
Of course it is.

385
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,820
Is she crazy?

386
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,580
That I have to come back to set the dinner table for such people is just ...

387
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,420
If the shareholders' meeting doesn't go well, I'll just jump into the Han River.

388
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,160
Do I know how to swim?

389
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,840
No matter what, I'll make this shareholders' meeting go well!

390
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,190
Did the prime minister eventually decide to stay at Yumin Hotel?

391
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,030
Yes, that's correct.

392
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,800
It's the same person doing the same work, but isn't it strange?

393
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,620
I made our department store, distribution center, and construction company all number one.

394
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,890
So why can't I get our hotel on top as well?

395
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,960
The hotel industry is very conservative.

396
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,050
Do you think I'm asking because I don't know?

397
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,520
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,170
Why did you sue the car driver for damages in the recent hotel accident?

399
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,950
When we ultimately receive criticism over things like this, it casts a poor light on us as a service provider.

400
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,640
Public Relations was busy covering up the fact that the youngest madam was the accident victim,

401
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,750
so they followed standard procedure and didn't consider the driver's circumstances.

402
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,330
And all criticism falls on me.

403
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,290
I'm the immoral executive demanding compensation from an epileptic

404
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,980
who had a seizure because he couldn't afford medication.

405
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,080
I'm sorry, ma'am.

406
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,090
What's scheduled next?

407
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,840
There is nothing in particular for today.

408
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,150
Isn't there a meeting about a duty-free shop today?

409
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,850
Well... Due to the investigation, we may not obtain the permit to open a duty-free shop.

410
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,030
What are you talking about? That was all settled.

411
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,760
Another summons came.

412
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,180
I received a call from the chairman's secretary to wait for now.

413
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,270
Then let's go directly to the hospital.

414
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,500
If the Epilepsy Association gives an interview saying that we stigmatize patients, what will happen?

415
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,040
Make an appropriate donation to the association, otherwise everyone might continue to gossip about the accident.

416
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,740
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,800
Don't give so little that we get cursed at,

418
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,690
like last time, when I passed out watching the news.

419
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,130
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,960
Don't you know Madam is particularly sensitive to things like this?

421
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,810
Put a sentence in the article stating that she values the low-income class

422
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,580
and societal concerns.

423
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,550
Ma'am! Welcome.

424
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,130
I heard that my sister-in-law asked for something.

425
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,340
Yes. Our store is very grateful for

426
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:19,660
Hanju Group's  "noblesse oblige" , seeing that you always come to pick things up personally.

427
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,590
So I was totally their shuttle.

428
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,600
Pardon? What...

429
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,820
It's nothing. Please bring the shoes.

430
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,320
Of course.

431
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,100
 I see Her ladyship here is also quick to catch on. We understand each other. 

432
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,250
  I know, right? So, hey, share the tip with our Prosecutor Jo too. 

433
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,350
Aigoo, Your Ladyship!

434
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,930
I can't believe I'm running into you here.

435
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,500
Wasn't that tip really great? Did you already make a killing with it?

436
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,520
- Do you know me? 
 - I almost didn't recognize you.

437
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,510
You look so prosperous now.

438
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,300
Who am I?

439
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,960
Who am I?

440
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,670
I made a mistake.

441
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,630
You look very similar to someone I know.

442
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,920
I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry.

443
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,470
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

444
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,820
- No, who– 
 - Ma'am!

445
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,840
Yes.

446
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,350
Is that someone you know?

447
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,340
No, I think I made a mistake.

448
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,950
 "Your ladyship"? 

449
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,340
 It's obvious he's a nouveau riche scammer. 

450
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,360
 How did I live my life as Hanju's daughter-in-law? 

451
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,100
He wasn't taking his epilepsy medication.

452
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,460
I found out he was trying to save the medicine money.

453
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,050
It's been a while since we closed our store because the business didn't do well.

454
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:08,640
Seok Ho, how could you cause such a big accident while trying to save a little bit of money?

455
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,790
You even hit someone.

456
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,950
The victim wasn't seriously injured.

457
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,330
But of all things, the car went in her direction.

458
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,200
That's what I'm saying.

459
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,310
What can we do?  The hotel is like that because of us ...

460
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,680
That's the reason I'm here.

461
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,090
You don't need to worry.

462
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:35,080
Because Mr. Jang Seok Ho is lying in a sickbed like this, and all responsibility will be shifted to his wife,

463
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,960
I don't think it is right for us to ask for compensation.

464
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,080
Then ...

465
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,310
Actually, it's hardest for you who has to nurse someone.

466
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,270
I know that very well, as my grandfather was sick for a long time.

467
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,570
Use this to hire a caregiver, so that you can get some rest.

468
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,250
And ...

469
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,570
take care of yourself.

470
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,610
Among the upper class, there are people like you!  Thank you.

471
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,660
"Upper class"? Why would you say that?

472
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,450
Actually, we had to give up all the insurance too.

473
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,990
There's no source of money.

474
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,530
So I was worried about how to compensate the hotel for everything ...

475
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,610
I was thinking of just dying.

476
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,320
Thank you ... thank you.

477
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,710
Wet wipes.

478
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,810
Why are there still  so many vicious comments?

479
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,780
Did I throw a glass of water in someone's face? Or did I assault someone after paying them for it?

480
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,560
Do you still not know?

481
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,750
If someone like me makes a mistake, the green light goes on for everyone to join in dragging me down.

482
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,970
Even my father is like them.

483
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,400
I am sorry.

484
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,170
How much longer do I have to take care of each and every little thing myself?

485
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,290
In these kinds of cases, you can't quickly recover your memory just because you want to.

486
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,310
Is that so?

487
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,080
After you went back home, did you remember anything else?

488
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,320
No, everything seemed foreign to me.

489
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,290
In your case, if I put it simply,

490
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:44,020
it's not your memory itself that got damaged, but the process of remembering that has an issue.

491
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,160
So you'll recover.

492
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,830
The problem is how long it will take.

493
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,220
When you live your daily life without memories,

494
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,810
it can be stressful even if you're not aware of it.

495
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,030
So why don't you try to relax here?

496
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,780
All right.

497
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,010
Does anything come into your mind?

498
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,240
If I do remember my past, am I going to say everything in front of you?

499
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,850
- No, I'm not hypnotizing you. 
  - Ah...

500
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,020
By any chance, are you close with my mother-in-law?

501
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,920
No, not at all.

502
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,710
Medical personnel are obligated to keep patient confidentiality.

503
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,020
So, don't worry about it and relax.

504
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,370
Let's try to remember your past memories.

505
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,680
How would you have been before waking up in the hospital?

506
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,180
 "How would you have been"? 

507
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,830
 "How would you have been"? 

508
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,770
 Grandma!  Grandma!  

509
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,840
 Grandma!  Grandma!  

510
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,170
Then why don't we try to think about earlier memories rather than recent ones?

511
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,180
Let's try to think about your father and mother when you were young.

512
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,560
 "Let's try to think." 

513
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,740
 "Let's try to think." 

514
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,510
What do you see?

515
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,410
I think it's my father, but the memories don't come easily...

516
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,060
It's painful.

517
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,560
How do you feel right now?

518
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,870
What kind of emotion do you feel?

519
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,900
If it makes you uncomfortable, you don't have to try too hard to remember.

520
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,510
Your father was the chairman of a large company, so he might have been extra stern.

521
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,880
If trying to recover your memories  makes you stress more,

522
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,860
it's better not to try too hard.  Let's wait for them to come back naturally.

523
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,710
Yes.

524
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,600
You don't have any symptoms at present, but if you suddenly experience headaches,

525
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,960
nausea or vomiting, please come to the hospital right away.

526
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,290
It could be helpful for you to visit the accident site,

527
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,790
but considering your condition, it's better not to do it for a while.

528
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,500
"The accident site"?

529
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,900
First of all, on that date, no female patient

530
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,810
who looked similar to Kang Mi Na, went to the ER.

531
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,730
I investigated the possibility of Chairman Kang Jang Su

532
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,630
having another child out of wedlock.

533
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,900
But at the time Kang Mi Na was born, because his wife pestered him to do it,

534
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,800
he was not just "tied", he had it completely "ripped off."* 
  (irreversible vasectomy) 

535
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,540
There is no recovering from it.

536
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,020
His entire past was carefully scrutinized back then,

537
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,420
so there is almost no chance he has another child

538
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,230
who was born out of wedlock.

539
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,750
Is that so?

540
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,810
So just think of her as a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Kang Mi Na.

541
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,540
Let's go to the accident site.

542
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,750
I'm not your personal secretary...

543
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,700
You mean, let's go together, right?

544
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,160
Seven, eighty-three.

545
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,070
Eighty-three.

546
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,260
Look, Hyeong-nim. We're already very busy doing business.

547
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,540
So let's stop taking care of Yeon Ju's messes after her.

548
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,610
So if and when she returns, let's tell her we can't do it anymore.

549
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:29,210
Hyeong-nim, gangsters with a strong history don't hastily move just because someone asks for help.

550
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,640
We don't have a strong history.

551
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,810
That's right.

552
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,490
Anyhow, she has to come back first for us to say anything!

553
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,390
I think the situation is serious.

554
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,620
- Why? 
 - The Prosecutor's Office said she'd be back to work by yesterday.

555
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,820
But I called today, and they said she's not in the office and is still on vacation.

556
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,730
It sounds like this could be serious.

557
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,510
I think it's time for us to take action.

558
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,780
What? She's on the same team as those clumsy guys?

559
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,660
The people at Seopyeong said she sometimes appears here.

560
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,130
Maybe they look like that but there's more to them than meets the eye?

561
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,050
As they say,  "a rotten slender shad is still a slender shad"*. They might have been strong in their prime.

562
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,590
Anyway, if you see them take any action, call the kids.

563
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,240
Yes, sir.

564
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,300
It means the car traveled at 80 km/hr speed and hit here.

565
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,940
I'll stand right here. Can you drive the car straight to here?

566
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,580
I mean...

567
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,620
To hit here if you start driving from there,

568
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,120
you have to turn the steering wheel at least once when you're over there.

569
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:58,910
The epileptic driver passed out, the car drove straight ahead but he still turned the steering wheel?

570
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,760
It does sound strange. But what do you want to find out?

571
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,820
I think he might have hit her on purpose.

572
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,780
- Why? 
 - We have to figure that out now.

573
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,920
If that car was trying to hit Kang Mi Na or the other woman.

574
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:24,040
Since things turned out this way, the fake Kang Mi Na has to get the inheritance.

575
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,970
What?

576
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,890
If someone was trying to kill the real Mi Na, that's the way to protect her.

577
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,140
When she's more important, it's harder for anyone to attack her.

578
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,950
Didn't you say you have to see Kang Mi Na in person?

579
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,740
Then shouldn't you focus on finding her first?

580
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,760
I'm trying to do that at the same time.

581
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,250
You know, there are two ways to find someone in the dark.

582
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,220
One is casting light on that person,

583
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,190
and the other is cast the light to me for them to find me.

584
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,020
Excuse me.

585
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,990
Are you going to the Yumin shareholders' meeting?

586
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,700
Just as I thought, your foresight is incredible, Eonni.

587
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,360
I wondered why your portfolio had stocks in the in-laws' business.

588
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,670
Is there any company in this field that's not in-laws in one way or another?

589
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,120
If you're here for your hair, just get it done and don't bother me.

590
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,680
I just heard something at the sauna.

591
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,290
Today's extraordinary shareholders' meeting at Sister-in-law's company

592
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,320
was called all of a sudden because her aunt strongly pushed for it.

593
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,840
But I heard that it's all because of this somebody who took action last night.

594
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,010
Did you want to step on the younger sister-in-law because of her behavior?

595
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:50,530
Or did you want to keep her in check because you think she'd be too strong if you leave her be?

596
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,210
What are you talking about?

597
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,450
Stop pretending to be a nice person! You're the most despicable.

598
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,890
You took advantage of her the most by pretending to care.

599
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,670
Also, on the day of her accident, you intended to frame her  if the slush funds became an issue,

600
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,380
so you sent her to the auction.

601
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,690
Why are you telling me this right now?

602
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,470
Don't misunderstand me, Eonni.

603
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,470
I'm a rude person, but I have no intention of being a bad guy to you.

604
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,180
If I can't beat you, I should be on the same side as you.

605
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,760
Side? Don't dare think we will be sharing Hanju.

606
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,160
Hanju is one slab of gold.

607
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,000
If anyone grabs it, then you have to cut that wrist and take it back.

608
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,740
   

609
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,550
 The memory of the time of the accident. 

610
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,090
 According to my official schedule on that day, 

611
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,700
  I, Kang Mi Na, came out of the hotel after the auction.  

612
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,660
 But why didn't I get into my car 

613
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:29,130
 instead of standing here and getting hit? 

614
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,580
As they say, the criminal usually returns to the scene of the incident.

615
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,250
Doesn't she look weird?

616
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,410
- How? 
 - What's with her clothes? Is she still undercover?

617
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,980
Is it already time?

618
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,420
Why does time fly when I'm doing anything other than house chores?

619
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,650
That's right. I have to pass this shareholders' meeting no matter what,

620
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,220
and get more of these dreamy times for myself.

621
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,680
Hey!

622
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,240
What happened to you?

623
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,850
Do you know me?

624
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,520
What's going on? Are you kidding me?

625
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,080
Why do all people who say they know look so shady?

626
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,660
What, what's going on?

627
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,480
Look who is here.

628
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,610
It's been a long time, lady.

629
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,990
What is this now?

630
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,460
Why are you pretending not to know me?

631
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,850
Don't you remember flying around and hitting us with your flying kicks?

632
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,320
What's going on, Hyeong-nim?

633
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,130
Did we bring them on our tail?

634
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,540
I-I became farsighted with age.

635
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,800
Don't you have something more to talk about with us in private?

636
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,270
I'm in a hurry to go somewhere very important.

637
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,110
How dare you pull that cheap trick?

638
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,240
I mean, I'd like to talk to you after I return from there.

639
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,280
Are you kidding me!

640
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,580
 Right then, I knew it with certainty. 

641
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,340
  I'm definitely not Kang Mi Na!  

642
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,280
Go get her!

643
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,660
She's my niece,

644
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,980
but because there are many bad rumors about her, I hesitate to let her be the head of the group.

645
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,970
First, because of the car accident,

646
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,550
there are rumors that she badly injured her head,

647
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,460
has lost her mind and is acting strangely.

648
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,400
So we need to look into this issue.

649
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,620
  Since she has a memory disorder,  she can be considered similar to a dementia patient.  

650
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:14,830
  Are you sure you'll be comfortable leaving Yumin to someone like this?  

651
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,380
From what I heard, she has a considerable problem with her memory.

652
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:28,020
How can we let a person like that take the reins of our Yumin Group?

653
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,700
I think that now she should focus on treatment rather than business management.

654
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,860
I had hoped to hear her explanation today, but she hasn't arrived yet.

655
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,350
So I think that this might be her answer.

656
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,490
Why are you doing this to me? Do you know me?

657
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,910
I don't know! How do I know you?

658
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,030
I asked why you're doing this to me! Why am I so good at fighting?

659
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,090
Why are you doing this? Do you know me?

660
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,630
Say something!

661
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,580
My father founded the Yumin Group,

662
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,200
and my older brother developed it for his entire life.

663
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,020
All of our Yumin families' futures

664
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,390
are in our hands right now.

665
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:49,060
With that in mind, I hope you can think about it carefully.

666
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,560
First, according to Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the General Shareholders' Bylaws,

667
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,560
we will start the vote to determine if Ms. Kang Mi Na succeeds to the leadership of the Group.

668
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,860
What?

669
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,200
One of the two major shareholders, who between them hold  32% of Yumin Group, is Alex Chang.

670
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,810
His Korean name is Han Seung Wuk.

671
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,190
The other is Alex Chang's stepfather.

672
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,700
He's the one who married Mr. Han Seung Wuk's mother.

673
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,810
Also, Han Seung Wuk is currently in Korea.

674
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,190
Then, are you saying he'll be attending the shareholders' meeting?

675
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,430
 I'm trying to shine the light on me so they can find me. 

676
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:49,310
  If anyone knows anything about the real Kang Mi Na, they'll contact Yumin.  

677
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,660
 Not Hanju. 

678
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,250
   

679
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,490
Sorry for being late. I'm Alex, the shareholder of the Prix fund.

680
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,030
The other shareholder is my stepfather.

681
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,060
But he's residing outside of the country right now, so he made me his proxy.

682
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:46,970
 Nuna, you climbed to your position by yourself, not because it was handed to you. 

683
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,580
  Work hard ... As hard as you can.  

684
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,600
We hold a total of 32% of the shares of Yumin Electronics, Yumin's holding company.

685
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,200
And if you include the 22% inherited by Ms. Kang Mi Na,

686
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,390
it's the majority.

687
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:16,770
I believe Miss Kang Mi Na is the legitimate heir of the Yumin Group and can lead the Group,

688
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,920
and I support ... her succession to the Group's leadership.

689
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,280
I think some of you might disagree with this.

690
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,160
You can't help it. Hating someone has no power.

691
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,780
Consider voting. You vote for the person you like, not the one you don't like, correct?

692
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,420
Are you okay?

693
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,780
What is it? Who am I?

694
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,320
Why do I fight so well?

695
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,400
You're the successor of the Nammun gang. Of course you fight well.

696
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,680
"The Nammun gang"?

697
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,220
  What is this? Why am I naturally so good at fighting?  

698
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,050
  Am I really a gangster?  

699
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,130
 Nothing good will come from the shareholders' meeting if more people suspect you've changed. 

700
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,880
 That the Yumin Group's heiress is mentally unstable .

701
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,080
 Don't embarrass the entire family by letting it be known that you've lost your mind. 

702
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,060
Run!

703
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,740
Since he didn't come to Grandfather's funeral

704
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,960
and I heard that he got a job in the US,

705
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,790
I relaxed too much.

706
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,980
His stepfather, who married his mother, has been living abroad for a long time.

707
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,290
His mother passed away last month.

708
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,510
- In the US? 
 - Yes.

709
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,800
I guess she didn't suffer in her later years, at least.

710
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,170
But he came to the shareholders' meeting and took Seong Wun's wife's side?

711
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:55,540
I think we need to find out his purpose.

712
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,860
Call him and ask him to come over for dinner.

713
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,940
Also, about Seong Wun's wife,

714
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,340
ever since she went through that big incident ...

715
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,120
Is this her true character?

716
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,590
I'm thinking about that as well.

717
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,960
I don't think she will be our puppet anymore.

718
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,070
The board of directors won't let the resolution pass easily.

719
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,630
So if they attack her and push her into a corner,

720
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,090
let's make it look as if we are helping her.

721
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:29,300
Yes. Besides her aunt, the other directors are from the maternal side of her family.

722
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,910
So I don't think they'll relinquish power easily to her.

723
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,620
Even if she were lucky and got the board of directors' approval,

724
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,870
she would eventually need to bend down for me.

725
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,030
 Who am I? Why do I fight so well? 

726
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,140
 You're the successor of the Nammun gang. 

727
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,490
  Of course you fight well! 

728
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,960
I mean, it's already ridiculous that I'm not Kang Mi Na.

729
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,420
But what? A gangster?

730
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,960
Wait.

731
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,520
Am I a twin, like Jeon Ji Hyun in the movie  Assassination ?

732
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,000
Except that  I grew up in a weird place, and Kang Mi Na grew up in a chaebol house?

733
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,010
So what am I going to do?

734
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,370
How can I reveal that when my parents are dead?

735
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,760
   

736
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,410
- What? 
   - I told you that I'm on your side, right?  

737
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,460
  Don't you ever forget about this.  

738
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

739
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,520
I heard you were approved at the shareholders' meeting.

740
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,190
But where are you? Why didn't you go to the meeting?

741
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,900
What?

742
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,700
  Honey. Honey?  

743
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,700
I'm not Kang Mi Na.

744
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,090
Why did they pass the resolution by themselves?

745
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,610
Wait, no. Then I was making all that fuss when I'm not even Kang Mi Na?

746
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,250
  What? Understand it?  

747
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,120
  You put it nicely by saying "understand it," but it means I should shut up and stay quiet!  

748
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,940
  Be quiet!  

749
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,970
  Is this a shouting match?  

750
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:09,170
  This is not a gambling place. Why are you shouting all of a sudden? You surprised me!  

751
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:13,210
  Sister-in-law, acting like this toward your husband's family is disrespectful. It's like spitting on yourself, so stop it!  

752
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,320
  Forget about it! Ptew! Ptew! Ptew! 

753
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,280
Well, I didn't say anything wrong.

754
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,400
It's not like I risk being found dead somewhere.

755
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,570
  After that, what is there to be afraid of, when she's a child with no parents or siblings?  

756
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,800
 Would anyone care about what happens to her while she lives in our house? 

757
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,170
They might really kill me.

758
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,050
My God, what am I going to do?

759
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,640
Right. For now, I have to pretend more than ever

760
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,150
to be the daughter-in-law of that family,  both in mind and in body.

761
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,250
I was born a daughter of a chaebol family

762
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,850
and lived my entire life as a chaebol.

763
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,810
Behave modestly.

764
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,280
- You're home, Sister-in-law! 
 - Yes.

765
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,740
Didn't you hear your father-in-law say that you shouldn't go out today?

766
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,510
Now that you got lucky and are rich, you treat your in-laws' words like dog crap.

767
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,360
Mother!

768
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,600
Why? Can't I even say this?

769
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,650
I'm not a celebrity. Can't I say what I have to, just because I might get cursed at?

770
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,450
If you go out, you should say where you're going!

771
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,510
How dare you show your feelings?

772
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,160
No matter how your situation has changed, how dare you?

773
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,750
  Let's not talk back.  

774
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,280
Your family's company hasn't become yours yet, and even if it does, do you think I care?

775
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,860
  But I can't stand it without talking back!  

776
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,310
 Let's just not listen to what she's saying. 

777
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,690
  Think about something else. Let's try subtracting seven starting at one hundred.  

778
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,350
  Ninety-three ... Eighty-six ...  

779
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,500
Even the daughters of a better family than you live quietly in their in-laws' house—

780
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,400
  Seventy-nine...  

781
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,070
  Seventy-two...  

782
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,820
What's going on with your eyes?

783
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,540
You'll kill someone with those eyes!

784
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,690
Sixty-five... fifty-eight*... 
  (The last two syllables of 58 in Korean sound like a curse word.) 

785
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,070
- What did you say to me, Mother? 
 - My goodness!

786
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,640
You're out of control!

787
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,160
Hey! Do you want to be kicked out of this family?

788
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,860
Do you know what happens when a chaebol daughter-in-law gets sued for divorce?

789
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,690
If it becomes a lawsuit, in the process of paying alimony or dividing the assets,

790
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,580
your son's source of funds will become an issue, since he doesn't have any disclosed salary as an executive at Hanju Department Store,

791
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,030
nor does he have shares in any affiliate.

792
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,310
Why am I talking about this?

793
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:52,510
I guess you were thinking about this the whole time!

794
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:55,560
That's why when you heard about divorce, that came out of your mouth instantly!

795
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,610
- That's not true, Mother! 
 - "Your son," what?

796
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:02,340
"The source of funds"?  What? Oh, my God!

797
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,720
No, Mother, I didn't mean—!

798
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,660
Sister-in-law, did you have to say it that way?

799
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,420
What?

800
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,770
That's what Mother-in-law implied.

801
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,400
And it made you angry.

802
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,660
I totally understand you!

803
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,350
I—uh—!

804
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:27,340
Why do my eyes get intense,

805
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,030
while my mouth says weird things?

806
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,800
What's inside my head?

807
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,400
I'm home.

808
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,250
Stop acting,

809
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,860
and since you're home, get ready and come inside now.

810
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,900
That didn't work.

811
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:57,880
Director, I believe you heard already, but I'm not just a stay-at-home housewife anymore,

812
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,350
I became CEO of an actual, respectable group.

813
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,350
Therefore, how long do I have to clean the cockles like this?

814
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,560
Director, I said, how long do I have to clean these?

815
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,110
"I'll never again eat seasoned cockles in my life."

816
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,920
Wash them until you think that.

817
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,600
That didn't work.

818
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,690
By the way, we always make a lot of food, as if we had a feast every day.

819
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,540
But why are we making more today?

820
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,460
The son of your father-in-law's older brother is coming.

821
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,970
He is your cousin-in-law, Youngest Madam.

822
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,780
Oh, the one who came from the US?

823
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,970
Yes.

824
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:34,390
Why do we have to do this much for him?

825
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,410
I don't think I'd prepare this much food even for someone who saved my life!

826
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,790
I don't know the details, but it seems he did a huge favor for this family today.

827
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,230
"A favor"?

828
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:46,980
How much of a loser is this family to owe so much to that kind of person?

829
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,070
Hello?

830
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,380
It's your aunt.

831
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,440
Auntie!

832
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,720
What's going on, Auntie!

833
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,380
I have something to talk about with you and wanted to see you someday—

834
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,840
What's that? I should come right now?

835
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,930
Of course! If you're asking me to come out right now,

836
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:15,150
then dinner is not important.

837
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,510
What's going on with her?

838
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:19,560
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

839
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,680
Yes, yes! Come to our hotel. I'll leave right now and wait for you.

840
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,430
What? R-Right now?

841
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,370
No, no. Wait a second. Wait.

842
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,180
Take your time! Of course!

843
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,390
I have cockles to wash, but what can I do?

844
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,750
Yes, yes! Oh, yes.

845
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,650
You need inborn ability for those tricks.

846
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:45,040
Is it possible to develop the ability after hitting your head?

847
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,040
Unbelievable.

848
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,130
Wait, wait one second!

849
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:57,490
- Can you turn the car around? 
 - Yes, ma'am.

850
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,530
She really isn't in good condition.

851
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,870
 Help me, please. 

852
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,860
 If you say one word, 

853
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,510
 it can be resolved, Uncle. 

854
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,150
 My maternal uncle and mother's side-family, 

855
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,590
 you can save all of them!  

856
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,320
 Is there a reason for me to rescue your family? 

857
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,760
 There's the harm that your father did to our company. 

858
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,070
 How can you guarantee that your mother's family won't do that again? 

859
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,760
  This is your grandfather's wish as well.  

860
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,210
 Just as you're kneeling right now to protect your family,  

861
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,620
 I also have to defend my own family. 

862
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,710
Are you dressed up because you were invited to dinner? Isn't that too tacky?

863
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,180
Why are you here and not going in?

864
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,430
Where are you going? You didn't even come to the shareholders' meeting.

865
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,780
How did you know I wasn't at the meeting?

866
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,510
What?

867
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,950
Ah, that is—

868
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,630
Are you perhaps following me?

869
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,510
Now that I think about it, that makes sense.

870
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:54,470
It makes sense for you to come to your grandfather's memorial service,

871
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:57,200
but you were spying on the family's conversation.

872
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,460
And you know I wasn't at the shareholders' meeting.

873
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:03,600
Now that you know that this family's not protecting me, do you think I'm a joke?

874
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,690
It's not like that—

875
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,520
In case you're following me to get something out of me,

876
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,640
forget about it! I'm not such a naive person.

877
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:37,160
So, what kind of work exactly will you be doing in Korea?

878
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,830
I'm going to sponsor companies that will make the world a better place.

879
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,930
I've also created a few non-profit corporations.

880
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,730
I heard about today's shareholders' meeting.

881
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,510
Human beings do things only for their own sake.

882
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,670
If it seems as if someone is doing something for others,

883
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:59,100
it's because there will be some benefit to it.

884
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,080
What's your real reason for returning to Korea?

885
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,210
I guess you feel guilty about something.

886
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,370
What is your goal?

887
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,350
Now you have a sturdy backing,

888
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,090
are you going to take Seong Wun's wife

889
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:15,130
and take back my company?

890
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,630
If you're saying "take back,"

891
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,620
does that mean it was originally mine?

892
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,380
You became much more confident than before.

893
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,880
You were a kid who couldn't even come into the house and kneeled and begged for help in the garden.

894
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,740
There's no reason for me not to be confident.

895
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,300
At least, I am not as powerless as my mother and I were back then.

896
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,150
You're misunderstanding something.

897
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:46,200
The reason your mother left this place with her head down was not due to lack of power,

898
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,870
it was because she willingly decided to shoulder it herself.

899
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,380
Well, try and do whatever you want to do.

900
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,340
I'll watch what you do.

901
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:59,090
Yes. Watch what I do until the end.

902
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:02,320
Let's see if this rain is just a passing shower,

903
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,360
or if it's a hurricane that takes away everything.

904
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:21,480


905
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,160
   

906
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,590
 I'm Alex, the shareholder of the Prix fund. 

907
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:28,360
 I believe Miss Kang Mi Na is the legitimate heir of the Yumin Group and can lead the Group, 

908
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,420
 so I support ... her succession to the Group's leadership. 

909
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,490
 You got to where you are on your own. 

910
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,170
  No one handed it to you. 

911
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:51,910
  Keep doing your best ... As long as you can.  

912
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,470
This place has been fully disinfected, right?

913
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,680
Yes, ma'am.

914
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:00,690
Why did they hit a person at my hotel! Also, with that dirty car.

915
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,030
It wasn't the spot we agreed on for the accident,

916
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,100
but Youngest Madam Kang Mi Na showed up all of a sudden,

917
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,280
so he panicked.

918
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,370
They can't do the work right and don't even die.

919
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:15,830
Poor things are always stupid and live long.

920
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:19,870
Do I have to pay for that thing's hospital fee?

921
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,700
My sister-in-law is very lucky.

922
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:31,060
She didn't die, but she also doesn't remember anything.

923
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,240
Watch her carefully for a while.

924
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,310
Yes, ma'am.

925
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:39,150
   

926
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,070
  What is this?  

927
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,950
  It's the official history of the person named Kang Mi Na.  

928
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:46,860
  Your mother "willingly decided to shoulder it herself." What do you think that means?  

929
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,890
  That woman is a weapon to us.  

930
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,900
  I'm saying let's keep her, so we can use her when we need to.  

931
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,880
  Who is close with Prosecutor Jo?  

932
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,300
  Tell him to go to her house right now!  

933
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,750
 What if I'm arrested for impersonating Kang Mi Na when I'm just a gangster? 

934
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,060
  My sanity comes and goes, and comes and goes like this!  

935
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,670
  Why did she climb all the way up there, just for me to drag her down with my hands?  

936
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,730
  I'll show you how scary a speck of dust can be  

937
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:09,670
  by trampling on you people and climbinb up.
