00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,599
(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,638
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,240
A kiss symbolizes a happy ending.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,640
Why is it that a kiss can put an end to it all...

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,160
in every fairy tale?

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,000
We all know that it's never that simple in real life.

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,209
A kiss is just the beginning.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,399
(Romantic Butterfly Effects)

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,079
My gosh! What is this?

10
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,200
Seriously! What is the matter with you?

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,520
(Follow Your Joy)

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,399
Just tell her to clean this up and let it go.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,000
I think it was a mistake.

14
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,409
You're living like a loser because you make mistakes like this.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,519
Why did you make a mistake like this?

16
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,079
Mistakes like this will pile up and turn into a serious problem.

17
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,719
I like...

18
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,000
the mint chocolate flavor.

19
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
Hey, why didn't you say anything?

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,240
You should've talked back, like you do with me.

21
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,520
This time, I did make a mistake,

22
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,680
and I'm just an employee after all.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
Yes, exactly.

24
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,959
Only I can pick on my employees.

25
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
Why let them yell at you?

26
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,280
Anyway, are you all right?

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,800
Oh, that.

28
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,479
I think my impacted wisdom tooth here popped out.

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,198
I don't think she slapped you that hard.

30
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,840
Do you think she's Shohei Ohtani or something?

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,759
- Anyway, why do you ask? - Because I was worried.

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Well, you should go to your fiancee.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
She seemed furious.

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,439
She has anger management issues.

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
No one knows when or what would make her blow her fuse.

36
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,240
She's like a booby trap filled with anger.

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Well... Did she not like my outfit today or something?

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,479
I bet she stormed out because she was flustered after slapping me.

39
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,759
Yes, exactly.

40
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,240
She must be flustered.

41
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,730
Ask her why she's flustered and if she's okay. Go check in on her.

42
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,360
She is your fiancee, after all.

43
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,610
Go and find her. I'm really okay.

44
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,050
It is true that she is my fiancee,

45
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,439
but we aren't in love.

46
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm not obligated to comfort her when she's upset.

47
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,759
We're just like business partners.

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,759
You know I don't really care about my business.

49
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,800
You see, for me...

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,439
What I'm worried about is whether or not you're okay.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,079
So, remove that stain and come out.

52
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Oh, right.

53
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,399
By the way, that outfit suits you.

54
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,199
Why is Mr. Moon...

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
suddenly nice to me?

56
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,600
(Chungdam Heaven)

57
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,079
Hey, let's talk.

58
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,800
Why did you do that?

59
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,240
I can't stand seeing you look out for someone else.

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Then stop coming here...

61
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,040
because I'll continue to look out for her.

62
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,599
Shall I slap you on the other cheek too?

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,839
You said we should help her become Cinderella so she'd leave.

64
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,040
I'll play the darned witch in the story of Cinderella.

65
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
You must've lost your mind.

66
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
Seriously, why are you being like this?

67
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Does a lunatic have a reason for what he does?

68
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,479
I'm just doing this because I'm a lunatic.

69
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Oh, I see. Is that so?

70
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,480
I turn into a lunatic often too, so this is great.

71
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,000
Hey, by the way,

72
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
why do you keep getting worked up over my problems?

73
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,319
It's making me uncomfortable.

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,600
Look who's talking!

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
Don't ask a lunatic why she's behaving a certain way.

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Dan A.

77
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,279
You're not a Chihuahua.

78
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,079
Will you bite and chew up everything you don't like?

79
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Oh, boy.

80
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,519
I wonder if I could somehow take her to Kang Hyung Wook.

81
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,639
You're really something.

82
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,800
You can do whatever you want with your business.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,839
This is a high-class cultural club.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
The owner trying to protect his employee's pride first?

85
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,519
It's unheard of.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,199
Of course, I should protect my people first.

87
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,639
There's no other reason?

88
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,079
Should there be another reason?

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,879
You see, men like us...

90
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,399
should never date a woman like her...

91
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,958
because it won't be that simple. You'd have to break social order,

92
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,240
which will be quite difficult to do.

93
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,360
Why do you assume that I'll find it difficult?

94
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Because you look like a delicate greenhouse flower.

95
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,600
Me?

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Thank you.

97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,800
That means I look pure and innocent, right?

98
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,920
Do you think I'm joking now?

99
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,600
Someone told me that it was a disease...

100
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,759
to take things too seriously.

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
Do you like her?

102
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,600
First off...

103
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Mr. Baek Do Hong, why are you being like this?

104
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,839
Don't tell me...

105
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,960
that you like me.

106
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
Don't fancy me. Just don't go there, okay?

107
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,919
You and I are very different anyway.

108
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,329
You're embarrassed of me, aren't you?

109
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,959
That is not what I meant.

110
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,359
Don't deny it.

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,559
I told you that you'll get nothing out of dating this loser.

112
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,879
Hey, Min Ji.

113
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,638
- Let's go. - Okay. Let's go, Sung Jae.

114
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,840
(The 34th White Dragon Film Festival)

115
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,039
I will not lose again.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,120
I was too flustered earlier.

117
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,639
I'm sorry I ruined the party for you.

118
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,799
I'll pay to get your clothes dry-cleaned.

119
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,120
It's fine. Why are you apologizing?

120
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,639
And let's be honest. I pushed you.

121
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,600
Saying sorry even when you did nothing wrong.

122
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,679
It's what poor people do.

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,119
Do they think they owe an apology for being poor?

124
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,759
They apologize all the time.

125
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,278
People who have power just don't do that.

126
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,720
Look at me. I'm always confident even after being mean to others.

127
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,399
Apologizing doesn't lessen my value,

128
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,330
so it's fine.

129
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,240
You're right.

130
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,759
Your value will never change much.

131
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,960
It won't change very much no matter what you do.

132
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,960
So, give up on Baek Do Hong,

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,639
or you'll hurt yourself while chasing him.

134
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,720
Director Baek!

135
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,799
I guess I don't deserve to meet successful people...

136
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,840
or change for the better.

137
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,639
Is this how my life will be until the day I die?

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,440
Being belittled right and left.

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,000
A loser who will always be a loser.

140
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,600
What's wrong? Did something happen?

141
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
I should not explode,

142
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,279
so I'm trying to suppress my anger.

143
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,440
I should hold back my anger to earn money.

144
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,079
After all, I get paid to put up with humiliation.

145
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,759
I never said I'd pay you for doing that, so don't hold back.

146
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,519
You matter too.

147
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,679
It's fine.

148
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,159
Who is it? Come with me.

149
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,720
This place...

150
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,919
The world...

151
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,320
is such an unfair place.

152
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,879
Since I was born into this world,

153
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,480
I wanted to live a good life like everyone else.

154
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,279
All my life, I got stomped on like this floor.

155
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,159
I didn't want that anymore,

156
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
so I started having such grand, unrealistic dreams,

157
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,759
but the world keeps putting me back in my place.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,559
You see, men like us...

159
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,399
should never date a woman like her...

160
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,559
because it won't be that simple.

161
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,959
You'd have to break social order,

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,919
which will be quite difficult to do.

163
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,798
I thought things could change a little...

164
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,440
once I joined Chungdam Heaven.

165
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
But this place is no different.

166
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll help you change.

167
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,799
If you want it, close your eyes.

168
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,840
Your value will never change much.

169
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,360
It won't change very much no matter what you do.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,679
Do whatever you want.

171
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,600
(Chungdam Heaven)

172
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,759
What could change...

173
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,840
after a kiss?

174
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,480
Mr. Moon, you've changed.

175
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
You said you hated my dreams.

176
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,879
So why are you helping me?

177
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,120
Because I don't hate you.

178
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,639
Turn your dreams into reality and receive love...

179
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,679
from others.

180
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,759
You told me about the innate right to be loved.

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
I'll help you...

182
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,720
so you can be loved and no longer feel sad.

183
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,200
Oh, I see. So you're saying...

184
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,799
you pity me.

185
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,399
- You said to do whatever I wanted. - I never said you could kiss me.

186
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,399
You didn't know I was going to kiss you?

187
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,519
I thought you'd fake it.

188
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,479
How could you actually kiss me? We're nothing.

189
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
You did it for real, so I followed.

190
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,200
You were very enthusiastic.

191
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,639
My gosh. When? Don't be ridiculous.

192
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,479
Gosh, this is really frustrating.

193
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,919
I wish we could hit rewind and check.

194
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,120
Shall we rewind?

195
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,960
Stop joking with me.

196
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,840
How am I going to face the members?

197
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,758
I must've been out of my mind earlier...

198
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,599
because I was having a mental breakdown, but...

199
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,919
And I was definitely in my right mind.

200
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
It was all intentional.

201
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,038
Now, they'll remember you as the woman who won the heart...

202
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,320
of the Chungdam Heaven CEO.

203
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,960
Other men will be interested in you now, no?

204
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,279
Oh, you think so?

205
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,960
I am much obliged.

206
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
No.

207
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,320
Did you mean to say you were ecstatic?

208
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,240
Very ecstatic, indeed.

209
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,279
Goodness.

210
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,559
Hey, where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

211
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,639
No, thank you. I can go home alone.

212
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,279
You have the corporate credit card, right?

213
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,039
Take a deluxe taxi!

214
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,159
Yes, I will take the most expensive taxi!

215
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,159
(Deluxe Taxi)

216
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
Snap out of it.

217
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,960
Don't be excited.

218
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,080
I feel like my lips have a heart of their own.

219
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,559
Are you all right, miss?

220
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh. Yes, I'm fine.

221
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,039
- What? - What?

222
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,279
What?

223
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,169
By any chance, weren't you driving the van...

224
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,440
I've only driven deluxe taxis.

225
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,680
Well, can I ask you something? What's your opinion...

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,519
on a man who kisses a woman he doesn't even like?

227
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,119
Shall I kill him?

228
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,838
Such a frivolous-minded jerk...

229
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,599
deserves to be run over with a heavy car like this.

230
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,119
Oh, no. He's not that bad.

231
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,519
The kiss felt nice at least.

232
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,039
I guess he's handsome,

233
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,599
like me.

I...

236
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,410
think of women as lifeless stones.

237
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
I am incredibly patient and...

238
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,119
Do whatever you want.

239
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,559
Darn it, seriously!

240
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,079
Go away, dirty thoughts!

Turbulent mind

245
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,119

Amen.

Will I really...

252
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,079
be able to see you date another man?

253
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,799
Get out. Why are you sitting in the driver's seat?

254
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,480
You called for a relief driver, right?

255
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,078
- Oh, this looks delicious. - I know.

256
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,759
Just enjoy it, and you won't gain weight.

257
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,039
Hi, Dan A. You're here.

258
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,799
Well, we're having a late-night snack.

259
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,200
Do you want to join us?

260
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,410
No, you eat it all!

261
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,000
Can you actually swallow that now?

262
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
I never told you not to eat it!

263
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,039
Darn it.

264
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,599
Hey, uncles! I'm so sad right now.

265
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,240
How could you have sweet and sour pork now?

266
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,038
No, we're going to throw this into the compost bin.

267
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,759
We're done. We're putting this away.

268
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,680
Hey, wait.

269
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,200
Oh, boy.

270
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,200
I couldn't have a single bite.

271
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
It's okay.

272
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,170
You know, when we used to do fieldwork,

273
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,358
we were called to the scenes...

274
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,039
every time we sat down to eat jjajangmyeon.

275
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,759
You're making it sound like we were cops or something.

276
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,200
We were just busy whacking idiots.

277
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,839
Right! But...

278
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,439
these days, we even let Dan A lash out at us.

279
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,650
Can you believe it?

280
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,720
You're right. We're too nice now.

281
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,410
Something must be done.

282
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,680
What happened that she's so upset?

283
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,519
Find out and take care of it.

284
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Yes, sir.

285
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
Oh, boy. What a waste.

286
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,039
Why did you put the sweet and sour pork at the bottom?

287
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,680
Even dogs wouldn't want to eat this.

288
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,199
Hey, let's not waste this. Eat up.

289
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,410
Has anyone told you that you look like Cho Jung Seok?

290
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,999
Mom, I like Cho Jung Seok.

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,038
- Me too. - So do I.

292
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,758
- I'm home. - My gosh. You're so handsome.

293
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,919
Jae Rim, you're home.

294
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,000
Jae Rim, this is Soo Jin's colleague.

295
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,279
He likes Soo Jin.

296
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,319
Nice to meet you. I'm Gu Nam Hoon.

297
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,920
Just call me Dr. Gu.

298
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,480
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

299
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,410
My gosh. Look at these.

300
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,039
I really wasn't going to accept these gifts,

301
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,650
but he picked out such perfect gifts for us.

302
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,650
Mom, I only accepted them because you like them.

303
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
My, it's lovely to see a mother and daughter get along so well.

304
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,079
It wouldn't be possible if you weren't such a cool mom.

305
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,519
You should give yourself a massage every day with this body oil.

306
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,518
Remember, it's important to maintain healthy circulation...

307
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,680
during pregnancy.

308
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,039
A massage...

309
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,880
feels nicer when you get it from someone else.

310
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,599
I'll give you massages from now on.

311
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,960
You? Why?

312
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,480
It should be done by someone with a strong grip.

313
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,159
Mom, I'll do it for you.

314
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,960
Go and catch a bull or something with those hands.

315
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,518
I should beat you up before I do that!

316
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,240
- What? - Jae Rim, do you want some food?

317
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,078
Dr. Gu also brought some beef.

318
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,118
He said it was important to get enough high-quality protein...

319
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,680
and iron during pregnancy. My gosh.

320
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
But it's not the Hanwoo beef.

321
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,519
So there are some leftovers.

322
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Here.

One more round.

325
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Hey.

326
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,118
Are you trying to tire yourself out because you're stressed?

327
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,519
That's even worse than stress.

328
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,240
I bet you think it's okay because this is a sport.

329
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,559
Once you get your knees busted, it can't be undone.

330
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,119
What's going on? Tell me?

331
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,559
Why, you little...

332
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Tell me honestly, or I won't release you.

333
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,720
- Well, there's someone I like. - Okay.

334
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,400
But I won't like her.

335
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,279
- Gosh. - Why not?

336
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,839
- Is she married? - No.

337
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,319
Her dream is to become Cinderella and turn her life around.

338
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Okay, she's weird.

339
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,200
My mom was like that.

340
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,400
She's a lot like my mom.

341
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,759
My mom...

342
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,518
got a divorce and left with a fortune in the end.

343
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,839
You know, I get it.

344
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,480
Following money and love.

345
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,079
Going to a better place. That's all okay, but...

346
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,000
it left my dad devastated.

347
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,880
I...

348
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,359
don't want my dad's life.

349
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,440
But as you know,

350
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,599
you're a lot like your father.

351
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,960
No.

352
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,240
I'll send her to the kind of wonderful man she wants to be with.

353
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,799
What are you, a new kind of pervert?

354
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,279
Letting her go and missing her would be better...

355
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,000
than resenting her after being abandoned.

356
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,839
That will be a win-win for everyone.

357
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,839
Oh, boy.

358
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Come on, one more round.

359
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,359
Goodness.

360
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,640
All he has to do is just let himself like her,

361
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,679
but he's intentionally tiring himself out not to do that.

362
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,720
Just use that energy...

363
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,359
to love her!

364
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,240
What's up?

365
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't people say hello to each other when they meet?

366
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,160
Are you still mad at me?

367
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,799
No, I'm not mad. I'm just...

368
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,759
I'm just a little...

369
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,759
embarrassed, that's all.

370
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,279
How about you? Are you all right?

371
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,839
What? Oh...

372
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,880
As you know, I'm very laid-back.

373
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,759
I don't really care about such things.

374
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,879
You should be cool about it too. Don't worry.

375
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,319
Relax and just be yourself.

376
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, I see.

377
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,799
I don't really care either.

378
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,598
Life keeps me so busy...

379
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,359
that those things don't mean much to me.

380
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,960
About that, I'll just think that I ate a big innkeeper worm.

381
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,440
What? "Innkeeper worm?"

382
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,920
That was not an innkeeper worm.

383
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,518
Why? The innkeeper worms from Jeju are meaty and delicious.

384
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,680
I wish they were easier to get.

385
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,839
Really?

386
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,039
So, I'm such a rarity, like the innkeeper worm.

387
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,799
Actually, no.

388
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
It had no nutritional value.

389
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
Nutritional... What?

390
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,359
(Innkeeper worm)

391
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,640
I can't believe she compared my first kiss to an innkeeper worm.

392
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,319
It's from our newest collection.

393
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
This design is perfect for men with nice bodies, like your groom-to-be.

394
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
What do you think?

395
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,960
Don't be ridiculous.

396
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,880
Don't get clingy just because we kissed once.

397
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,680
Your kiss...

398
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,880
sucked.

399
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,519
Mr. Groom.

400
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,439
Would you like to go with this tuxedo?

401
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,559
I don't need this.

402
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,079
Fix this first. My butt cheeks are literally eating the pants!

403
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,119
(Chungdam Heaven)

404
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,119
He seemed totally fine.

405
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,319
It only kept me up all night.

406
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,160
You know, last night...

407
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,999
Toward the end of the party,

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,359
there was a special event none of the employees knew about.

409
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,559
Oh, that.

410
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
I didn't know about it either. I'm an employee too, you know.

411
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,440
Did anything else happen after that?

412
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,079
No, nothing happened.

413
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,799
That's strange.

414
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,440
Did you enjoy the kiss at least?

415
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,960
Well, it was just...

416
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,440
I don't know. I wasn't thinking anything at that moment.

417
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
So, you were in a trance.

418
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,160
There are rumors about your secret relationship. Is it true?

419
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,839
- No, it's not true. - Then what happened last night?

420
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,919
Ms. Shin wants to meet her Prince Charming like Cinderella.

421
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,959
But she seemed lost, so I was simply trying to help her.

422
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,839
But you're not like that normally. Don't you think you went overboard?

423
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,719
That moment, I didn't realize I was going overboard.

424
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,839
I'm really sorry.

425
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,400
Do you want to look cool all the time? That's like a disease.

426
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,480
I never thought it could be a disease.

427
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,640
Please note that I was drinking when it happened.

428
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,599
As if that will be considered a mitigating factor.

429
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
They say a drunk man always tells the truth.

430
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,798
I wasn't that drunk.

431
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,160
Come on. Look.

432
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
Do you have a split personality?

433
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
I'll see a psychiatrist for an in-depth assessment.

434
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,598
- So, it's true. - A hundred percent.

435
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,160
Our Prince Cha Min, the eighth-generation heir.

436
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,078
Since when was he...

437
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,759
- so petty-minded? - Stop recording.

438
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,519
Mr. Moon, your problem is that you don't know what women want.

439
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,799
Then what should I do?

440
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,920
To win a lady's heart,

441
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
- you need tteokbokki. - Tteokbokki?

442
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,880
Even all the fancy restaurants sell tteokbokki these days.

443
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,558
We should also...

444
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
add tteokbokki to our regular menu at Chungdam Heaven.

445
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
Try it.

446
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,440
Okay.

447
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,359
I know I made this, but it's so good. My gosh.

448
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,279
But this...

449
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
also has no nutritional value, just like a kiss. Am I wrong?

450
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,160
What?

451
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,440
A kiss and tteokbokki nurture the mind.

452
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,559
It feels your heart with joy.

453
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,839
No way.

454
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,680
It's too spicy.

455
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,559
Jae Rim.

456
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,519
Hi.

457
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,880
Hello.

458
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,000
Would you like me to introduce you to the other members over there?

459
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,559
Or I'll give you a cup of tea.

460
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,480
I want to have a talk with you today, Jae Rim.

461
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,119
- Ouch, it's hot. - Are you all right?

462
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm fine. I only spilled a little bit.

463
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
I'll just have a glass of ice water.

464
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,880
Oh, really?

465
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,680
It's hot in here, isn't it?

466
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,119
I'm fine.

467
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,599
It's red.

468
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,759
You need to cool it down right away.

469
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Anyway,

470
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,920
what's going on between you and Mr. Moon?

471
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,119
Nothing. He's just my boss.

472
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
Then what was that last night?

473
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,799
What happened?

474
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,880
Was he abusing his power?

475
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,319
His drunken habit, I guess?

476
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,399
Rumor has it that he does...

477
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,519
a lot of ridiculous things when he gets drunk.

478
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
- Ridiculous things? - Yes.

479
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,319
Well, for example...

480
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,359
Whenever he gets drunk,

481
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,439
he kisses every utility pole in Cheongdam-dong,

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,920
apparently.

483
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,839
Isn't it so ridiculous?

484
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,279
Hey, how come your lips are so dry?

485
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,079
You didn't put on any lip balm?

486
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,559
You're so cute.

487
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,960
You're wearing a headband today.

488
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,599
(Utility Pole Collector)

489
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,119
Did you come here to ask me about this?

490
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,759
No, I'm going to ask you other questions too.

491
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
About what?

492
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,799
About you.

493
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,640
I want to know more about you, Jae Rim.

494
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,960
So how about we meet at my studio next time instead of here?

495
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,759
Why should I meet you at your studio?

496
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,640
There's something I want to show you.

497
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,599
This is your invitation.

498
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,400
Wear it when you come to my studio.

499
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
Yesterday, you went ahead and broke the order I talked about.

500
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,920
Why should I follow your order?

501
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
You're right.

502
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,960
So I'm going to play this game for real now.

503
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,519
I won't hesitate to cross the line.

504
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,679
That will be fun.

505
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,599
Was the kiss with Jae Rim fun too?

506
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,360
Hey, come on. Don't pry,

507
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,360
- or you'll get hurt. - The same goes for you.

508
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,289
Don't do that again.

509
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,360
Who do you think you are?

510
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,769
Just wait and see.

511
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,559
To find out what I'm capable of.

512
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,599
I don't know what he'll see,

513
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,960
but my eyes...

514
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,480
are delighted as I'm watching the two of them.

515
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,518
You totally bit the bait.

516
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,078
This was the big picture I had in mind.

517
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,959
How could you take the bait right away just as I'd expected?

518
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,288
Now, you're attracted to the girl I kissed?

519
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:03,439
Of course, you are! This is great.

520
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,288
Things are panning out exactly according to my plan.

521
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,960
Baek Do Hong, that idiot.

522
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:10,880
Honestly, I don't know who's a real idiot here.

523
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,199
Why is Baek Do Hong...

524
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,769
suddenly showing interest in me again?

525
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,119
Is the universe still working to make my wish come true?

526
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,559
Or...

527
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,809
is it really because of the kiss?

528
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,559
- Jae Rim! - What?

529
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,199
What were you thinking about? You look so spaced out.

530
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,119
No, I wasn't thinking about anything.

531
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Jae Rim.

532
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,769
- So, what are you going to do? - About what?

533
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,999
I think Mr. Moon really likes you.

534
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,239
He's acting like that to make me quit.

535
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,439
He'd feel bad if he had to kick me out,

536
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,809
so he wants me to leave of my own accord.

537
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,039
No.

538
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
He's overly sensitive and fickle...

539
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,239
when dealing with matters that involve you.

540
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,119
Trust me. He's not like that normally.

541
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,808
In the past, he was crazy but straightforward.

542
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,638
Like a kind bully...

543
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,119
or an innocent pervert?

544
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,880
I suppose Mr. Moon was like the unicorn in the past.

545
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,440
Why don't we go and summon the unicorn again?

546
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
Let's test him.

547
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,769
Mr. Moon, I brought you some snack.

548
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,329
What's with that hairpin?

549
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,638
Are you from North Korea or something?

550
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,039
Oh, this. Mr. Baek Do Hong gave me this.

551
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,809
I knew it.

552
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,159
So? What did you and Baek Ddong talk about?

553
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,480
"Baek Ddong?"

554
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,158
Baek... As in, "White Poop?"

555
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,359
Try saying "Baek Do Hong" quickly.

556
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,399
Baek Do Hong...

557
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,199
Baek Do Hong, Baek Ddong.

558
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,599
- Right? - Goodness.

559
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,840
It's "Baek Do Hong."

560
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,719
Baek Do Hong, Baek Ddong...

561
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,769
Stop making fun of his name. It's a nice name.

562
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,679
You're so mean.

563
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,159
Fine.

564
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,360
What did Mr. Baek Do Hong with such a nice name say to you?

565
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,329
You want to know what he said?

566
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
Yes.

567
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,639
Your spontaneous act must've really worked.

568
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,639
He...

569
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,639
invited me to his studio.

570
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,400
What? His studio? Why?

571
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,769
What does he want to do there with you?

572
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,769
That I don't know.

573
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,360
Hey. You're going to act all naive and go there, aren't you?

574
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,639
Yes, of course.

575
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,038
I'll act all naive and coy...

576
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,809
and go there as if I know nothing.

577
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,719
Isn't this what you wanted?

578
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,879
All of this happened...

579
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,769
because your kiss really worked.

580
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,599
But I think there are some adverse effects too.

581
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,119
Adverse effects? Like what?

582
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,329
You should take responsibility.

583
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,840
For what?

584
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,519
Let's...

585
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,440
kiss just once more.

586
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,159
There's something I want to know...

587
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,119
before I visit his studio.

588
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,199
Why? What is it?

589
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:45,599
Why should we kiss again?

590
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,519
Because it was so strange.

591
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,289
It was really odd,

592
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,119
and that's why I want to experience it once more.

593
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,880
Then I'll know better.

594
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,079
- Do you really mean it? - Yes, I sure do.

595
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,289
It's just the two of us here.

596
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,440
So let's do it properly this time.

597
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,079
- Won't you regret it? - No.

598
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,159
If you want it, close your eyes.
