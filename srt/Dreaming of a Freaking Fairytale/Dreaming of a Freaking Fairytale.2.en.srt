00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,599
(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,758
All fairy-tale princes are...

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,519
rich, handsome, and kind...

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,239
as if they're clones.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,039
They're all similar.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,959
But the truth is, not everyone from a wealthy family...

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,280
is cheerful and kind.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,199
Mirror. Mirror on the wall.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,280
Who is the most dashing of them all?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,480
Your Highness the Prince, of course.

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,920
If it turns out that you're lying,

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,119
I will break all the mirrors!

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,279
Here's a freakishly quirky prince...

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,320
who's an eighth-generation member of a super wealthy family.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,560
The romance of a Gen Z-er and an eighth-generation rich heir.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,960
It begins now.

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm suing you.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
For attempted murder.

19
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,200
"Attempted murder?" What do you mean?

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,319
Gosh.

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,439
What is this?

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,040
You're after my money, aren't you?

23
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,518
What? I don't even know how much money you have.

24
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,799
It can't even be measured.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,799
My money is accumulating interest even as we speak now.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,359
So, just ask for money instead of trying to trick me like this.

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,839
What? Why should I?

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,959
Death is what I'm most afraid of.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,359
I can't have fun once I die. There are so many fun things I can do.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,319
This guy is crazy. I shouldn't get involved.

31
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,840
All right. I'm really sorry, but it was an accident.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,518
Please hand over my shoe first.

33
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,518
What? This is evidence. I can't hand it over.

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,039
Why do you need evidence?

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,679
I told you. It wasn't intentional.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
I don't believe you.

37
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,399
The shoe suddenly slipped off and fell right on my head?

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,959
How could such a coincidence happen, unless it was intentional?

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,399
It was totally intentional.

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,719
When stuff like that happens, people say, "This is not my day."

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,878
What about when a bird poops on you?

42
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,530
Does the bird do that to get back at you?

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,960
You see, I'm not that unlucky.

44
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,000
I am a lucky man.

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,680
You're obnoxious.

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,370
I said it wasn't intentional. What is with you?

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,599
Give it back.

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,810
"Obnoxious?"

49
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,879
Why don't you go ahead and drop the honorifics too?

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,240
Shall I?

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,199
Then let me go now, will you?

52
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,089
No, not a chance.

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,439
I can't be lenient with stuff like this.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,370
No mercy.

55
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,439
If you keep this up, there will be real problems.

56
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,530
For me? Or for you?

57
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,810
For both of us.

58
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,158
My life has been a roller coaster ride, so if you mess with me,

59
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,759
you'll face a tumultuous future too.

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,199
Shall I show you how messed up your life can be?

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,840
This is "intentional."

62
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,080
And this is acting with good intentions.

63
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,439
I saved you.

64
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,800
Just like the hour hand and the minute hand meet at noon,

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,039
two strangers have met,

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,719
and a new kind of magic is starting.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
My gosh.

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,400
How dare he try to steal my shoe right before my job interview?

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Anyway, Shin Jae Rim.

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,599
From now on, try to have some mercy on rich jerks.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Relax.

72
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,800
I am an Angel Manager.

73
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,319
I must smile from this moment on.

74
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,599
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

75
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,719
My gosh.

76
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,120
Who walked into my office just now?

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,839
I thought you were the devil without the wings.

78
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,480
(Resume, Shin Jae Rim)

79
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,959
So, you're here for an interview.

80
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,079
I'm sorry. Only nice people can be our Angels.

81
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,730
Their job is to connect people together.

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,610
If mean people do the job, we'll go out of business.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,519
What?

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
What is this?

85
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,319
How come you're all quiet now?

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
You were well-spoken earlier.

87
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
I'll give you one last chance to say what you want.

88
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,759
Is it nice...

89
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,240
to be able to talk like this as the hiring party?

90
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes, it's the best.

91
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,319
It gives me a thrill.

92
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,519
Then...

93
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,240
What if I pray?

94
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,800
You said you were afraid of death.

95
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,399
You'll live a short but eventful life,

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,759
so I pray that you can never buy happiness...

97
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,000
with your immeasurable amount of money.

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,959
You see, I desperately wanted this job.

99
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
It's not fair that you get to live a happy life when I can't.

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,800
Then what do you want to do?

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,999
I hope you get...

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,360
struck by lightning, from top to bottom!

103
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,439
In moments of crisis,

104
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
animals discover abilities they didn't know they had.

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,879
A zebra can throw a back kick at a wild beast,

106
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,920
and a piglet can roar at a lion.

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,000
In this moment of crisis, Jae Rim...

108
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,240
verbally attacked him with her unbending confidence.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,839
By the way, what's with that umbrella?

110
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Is he emotionally attached to it or something?

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,479
He's paranoid that he might get stabbed in the back.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,599
So, he uses the umbrella to always protect himself.

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
That cannot act as a shield.

114
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,879
Who knows? He could be hiding a weapon in that umbrella.

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,439
Can you believe that a CEO could be that young?

116
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,519
Someone's young and rich,

117
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,600
while I'm young and poor.

118
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
A young guy who's rich is the odd one.

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,560
It's so unfair.

120
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,040
You should shine most brightly when you're young.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
But some of us have to feel like pathetic losers because we're poor.

122
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,279
A good person who works hard...

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,759
suddenly falls in love as if it's her fate.

124
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,519
Then she finds out that the man she loves is wealthy.

125
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,399
Will things like that never happen in our lives?

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,398
Try analyzing the big data of our lives.

127
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,040
Of course, it'll never happen!

128
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,800
People like us have to be doggedly persistent in finding ways...

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,959
to earn a living.

130
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,959
Gosh, seriously. What an obnoxious jerk.

131
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,680
The universe is so unfair.

132
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,480
A jerk like him...

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,759
deserves to get struck by lightning,

134
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,560
big-time.

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,318
I hope you get...

136
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,160
struck by lightning, from top to bottom!

137
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,399
Gosh, I'm still traumatized by it.

138
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,519
I saved you.

139
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,840
Hey, have you finally lost your mind?

140
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,480
What's with you?

141
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,399
Well, I met a woman.

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,679
She was so weird.

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,210
Hey, don't tell me she slapped you in the face.

144
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,090
My ears did hurt.

145
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,960
The moment wealthy heirs like us get slapped in the face,

146
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,450
it's declared a KO.

147
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
A KO? Me?

148
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,919
As if.

149
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,759
What? A KO?

150
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,450
There's no way I'll fall for that woman.

151
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,090
Peekaboo.

152
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,679
What are you up to?

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,759
No.

154
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,840
Go away. Go!

155
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,279
They said to think of women as lifeless stones.

156
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,559
Yes, she's just a stone.

157
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,450
She's a stone.

158
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,039
All right.

159
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,799
One.

160
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,000
Two.

161
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,210
What kind of stone? A stone named Jae Rim?

162
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,039
This is nuts, seriously!

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,519
I must be losing my mind.

164
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,090
Why do I keep seeing her? Darn it.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,039
Seriously, this is driving me crazy.

166
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,480
Darn, what the...

167
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,240
Seriously!

168
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,399
Gosh.

169
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
(Resume, Shin Jae Rim)

170
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,080
She's nothing special.

171
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,200
What has she done to me?

172
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Could it be...

173
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Did she hypnotize me?

174
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,080
(Milk, Original)

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,959
Cold brew.

176
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Turn into a delicious latte.

177
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,039
Abracadabra!

178
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
This is magic.

179
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh, it's good.

180
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,359
(You have missed 5 payments for your health insurance.)

181
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,878
I'll die while trying to make my insurance payments.

182
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,840
(Your credit card bill payment will be taken out of your account.)

183
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,600
(Your student loan interest payment is due on November 20.)

184
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,960
They're taking all my money when I only make peanuts.

185
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,638
(I'm Shin Jae Rim. I'm hard-working and optimistic.)

186
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,840
(I will put every effort into fulfilling my duties.)

187
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,559
(Incoming Call)

188
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,599
Hello? Who's this?

189
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,039
I'm Moon Cha Min, the CEO of Chungdam Heaven.

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,359
Why call so early and ruin my pleasant morning?

191
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,519
I wanted to call you as soon as possible...

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
to Chungdam Heaven.

193
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,559
You're not done yet?

194
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,679
I told you it was a mistake and apologized.

195
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,039
Are you a pervert who enjoys being cursed at?

196
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,600
Shall I do a little warm up, then?

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
Yes, go for it.

198
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
Do it in front of me while staring me in the face.

199
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,959
I don't even want to cross paths with you again.

200
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Oh, really?

201
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,039
Gosh, that's such a shame.

202
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,679
I called to let you know that you got the job at Chungdam Heaven.

203
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,879
Pardon me?

204
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
What are you thinking?

205
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,679
Are you hiring me to abuse me?

206
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,960
If I do that, you'll put another curse on me.

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,678
I thought you were the evil Royal Noble Consort Hui.

208
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,919
Why did you decide to hire me if you thought I was that evil?

209
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,720
Royal Noble Consort Hui is charming.

210
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,879
You're funny.

211
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
My goodness.

212
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,679
"Who'd want to work with such a psycho?"

213
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,519
You're probably expecting to hear something like that,

214
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,320
but I should do it.

215
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,879
They say,

216
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
"You need a villain to take down another villain..."

217
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,199
"and a lunatic..."

218
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,080
"to handle another lunatic."

219
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,200
You really are unpredictable.

220
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,158
You'll see me today at Chungdam Heaven.

221
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,240
All right. Hurry up and meet me here.

222
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,399
I'll put up with you.

223
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,039
Does it mean today is our first day?

224
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,719
Please make sure I get paid for every hour I work.

225
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,120
I refuse to work for free, even if it's just for a minute.

226
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
See you later.

227
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,519
Dad.

228
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,159
Dad!

229
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:56,919
Oh, my.

230
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm quite handsome.

231
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,639
My, look at that jawline.

232
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,879
It's as sharp as a blade.

233
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Do I have to be this dressed up...

234
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,200
to see her?

235
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Oh, right.

236
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,679
Women hate gold chains like this.

237
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Hey, you.

238
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Goodness.

239
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,080
Women hate men who wear tight pants.

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,080
Gosh, this is crazy. I can even pull this off.

241
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
No.

242
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
I should be humble.

243
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,720
Gosh, the fur is flying everywhere.

244
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,559
I suffer from chronic rhinitis.

245
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,440
Yes, this is what a real man wears when he goes to war.

246
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm not doing this to impress her.

247
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,799
But what if she falls for me?

248
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,039
Then things will get complicated.

249
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,960
Now, it's perfect.

250
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,159
I think she'll hate me.

251
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,240
(Chungdam Heaven)

252
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,759
(Chungdam Heaven)

253
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,200
Hello.

254
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
My gosh. So you can be polite and can behave sensibly at times.

255
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,519
Yes, when I need to earn money.

256
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,839
So, money can make you behave better.

257
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,720
Yes, I love money.

258
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,200
The more I get paid, the nicer I become.

259
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,479
I wasn't really expecting you to be nice.

260
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,359
I've lived long enough to know that money is a scary thing.

261
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,320
So I will obediently follow the capitalist system.

262
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, so? What do you need me to do?

263
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,720
- Put on a friendly smile? - Such a capitalist smile?

264
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
No, thank you.

265
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,650
If there are things you want to say, let it all out without a filter.

266
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,039
That's what I like.

267
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,170
Oh, I see.

268
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,920
Can I be really honest?

269
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,890
Yes, go for it.

270
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,920
Is that a chastity belt?

271
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,559
What?

272
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,650
How could this look like a chastity belt?

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,838
The design looks a little different, but it does the same thing.

274
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,650
Not a single woman would come and talk to you when you're wearing it,

275
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,920
so we can call it a chastity belt.

276
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,890
My, looking nice!

277
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
What? "Looking nice?"

278
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,599
What is wrong with this?

279
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,000
Darn it!

280
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,799
(Chungdam Heaven)

281
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Attention, please.

282
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,410
I was wondering what I should do to have some fun today...

283
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,559
and decided to hire a talented newbie.

284
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,518
- Applause, please. - Nice!

285
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,650
Hello, everyone.

286
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,410
She's new.

287
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,960
So, what should we do?

288
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,359
The initiation ceremony must be done.

289
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,519
I am Ground, introduce yourself

290
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,199
Is this a camera prank?

291
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,559
After one beat

292
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,079
No, we're doing it for real. Tell us your dream to introduce yourself.

293
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,239
After two beats

294
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,409
This isn't some kids' club. Why should adults do this?

295
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,519
Goodness. Just do it.

296
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,440
After 3 beats, 1, 2, 3, 4

297
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,279
Eternal youth!

298
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Crypto jackpot!

299
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Anti-aging!

300
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
A young husband!

301
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,240
Lease maturity!

302
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,240
Cinderella!

303
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,519
This goes to show the importance...

304
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,359
of what you think about often.

305
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,518
Your hidden desires can reveal themselves all of a sudden,

306
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,410
and they're bound to cause trouble.

307
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,359
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

308
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,440
I thought she was interesting.

309
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,960
Turns out, she's just like any other woman.

310
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,758
Hey, your predecessor became Cinderella and left.

311
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,239
How could you say right off the bat that you wanted to be Cinderella?

312
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
I was suddenly asked to state what my dream was,

313
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,169
so I said it without thinking.

314
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,200
My gosh.

315
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
So, that really is your dream.

316
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,170
My goodness.

317
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,839
I had no idea.

318
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,920
You had me fooled.

319
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
What do you mean?

320
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,599
I never fooled you.

321
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,799
So, you weren't desperate for a job. You desperately want to get married.

322
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,319
That's right.

323
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,799
I wanted to work hard...

324
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,170
and find a good man to marry. That's why I joined Chungdam Heaven.

325
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,170
A person like that is called an opportunist. Am I wrong?

326
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,200
I hate people like that.

327
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,319
I really can't stand them.

328
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,119
I am not an opportunist.

329
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm just tired of my reality. That's all.

330
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,960
I see. Life has been hard for you.

331
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,759
But even so, I'm not a philanthropist.

332
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,889
I can't work with you because you have too many issues.

333
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,410
I told you I'd never work for you for free. Not even for a minute.

334
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,720
We said today would be my first day.

335
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,519
Day One!

336
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,119
Then let's do this.

337
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,680
Let's make a bet.

338
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,440
Let fate decide whether or not you will work here.

339
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,519
I believe that having fun is the most important thing in life.

340
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,680
Follow your joy.

341
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,359
That's nice.

342
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,558
Then how about us two nutheads...

343
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,440
have a real showdown, without our job titles involved?

344
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,960
Sure, sounds good. You may decide what our showdown will entail.

345
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,440
Oh, great.

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,960
Follow me.

347
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,039
They look like they're about to cause trouble.

348
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,799
A man and a woman causing trouble?

349
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,920
That kind of trouble...

350
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,118
begins when sparks are ignited...

351
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,119
once their eyes meet.

352
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,799
(Employment Contract)

353
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,079
(Employment Contract)

354
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,599
Let's see who can drink more.

355
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay, sounds good.

356
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,920
But why here?

357
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,920
I know it's a showdown, but the taste matters.

358
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,519
Does it taste better by the Han River?

359
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,119
I mean, it's the same product.

360
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,598
Everything tastes better by the Han River.

361
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,759
That includes ramyeon and fried chicken with beer.

362
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,799
It's one of the privileges of living in Seoul!

363
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,079
But are you sure you'll be all right?

364
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,758
You'd better not change your mind later.

365
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,119
Why? You don't think you can do it?

366
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Are you backing out again?

367
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,440
Of course not.

368
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,880
Do you know how healthy my organs are?

369
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,119
I've been taking great care of my organs by only eating organic food.

370
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,279
The moment alcohol enters my bloodstream,

371
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,880
they'll start breaking it down and push it out of my system right away.

372
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,159
My diet mainly consists of junk such as palm oil,

373
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
high-fructose corn syrup, and GMO foods.

374
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,719
Maybe that's why my organs are incredibly strong.

375
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,240
Alcohol does nothing for me.

376
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,160
For me, alcohol is like a health supplement.

377
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,758
It's really good for improving blood circulation.

378
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,359
(Heavy drinking has a detrimental effect on your health.)

379
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,839
You're talking nonsense again.

380
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,480
You see, I don't go easy on women.

381
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,799
You can't ask me for help.

382
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,039
And I won't go easy on you because you're a guy.

383
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
You don't even know what kind of family I'm from.

384
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,240
Oh, yes!

385
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,399
- When are you off until? - Until today.

386
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,559
Nice, this is great.

387
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,359
Hey, let's gulp these down.

388
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,759
Sounds like a plan. Let's quench our thirst.

389
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,319
I was always so bored at home.

390
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,839
Mom's pregnant,

391
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,359
and Jae Rim is a lightweight.

392
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,960
She's still a baby, you know.

393
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,640
A baby, my foot.

394
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,759
She's too brave for her own good.

395
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Oh, boy.

396
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,039
All right. Talking nonstop won't get you anywhere.

397
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,920
Let's get started right away.

398
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,759
What? You can't even open it?

399
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,599
It's slippery because it's wet.

400
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,118
I have a strong grip.

401
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,119
Oh, is that so?

402
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
If we have an arm-wrestling match,

403
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,759
I'll beat a weakling like you right away.

404
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,720
What? "A weakling?"

405
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,640
Then shall we do it?

406
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,599
Just to see who wins.

407
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,039
Sure, let's do it.

408
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,039
Fight fair and square.

409
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,359
Okay, bring it on.

410
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Get ready.

411
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,839
- Set, go! - Go!

412
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
- Gosh... - "Fair and square."

413
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,319
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,359
You are quite strong indeed, but I'm stronger than you.

415
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,160
Oh, no!

416
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,119
I must've pressed too hard.

417
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,880
Your nail got all messed up.

418
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,880
No, it wasn't you. It was already like this.

419
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,599
I see. Gosh, it scared me for a moment.

420
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,119
Anyway, it must've hurt.

421
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,400
Forget it. Hurry up and drink.

422
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,079
I hope you do better this time.

423
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,599
This time, I'm really confident that I'll win.

424
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,000
Let's do it before it loses the fizz.

425
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,160
Hey.

426
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
This is just in.

427
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,880
A human black hole has appeared by the Han River.

428
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,640
Be careful and stay safe.

429
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
(Caution, Wild Animal Zone)

430
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,039
Stop drinking. Stop!

431
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,720
Done.

432
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,919
What are you, a whale?

433
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,960
It shows you how strong I am, mentally.

434
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,440
So? What do you want to do?

435
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
How about another glass?

436
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,200
You call this a glass?

437
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,920
Forget it. You're doggedly determined to win.

438
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Let's just say you won.

439
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Really?

440
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,599
Then you have to guarantee that I'll get a permanent position.

441
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,160
And you can't fire me for no reason.

442
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,319
Yes, of course. I must keep the promise I made.

443
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,440
What's gotten into you?

444
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,038
Are you drunk?

445
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,079
No, I am not drunk.

446
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Hand over the contract.

447
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,160
You can't annul it, saying you signed it drunk.

448
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,279
He'll sign it so easily?

449
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,039
Just as I expected,

450
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,960
it's fun to play with you.

451
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,759
Think about how much fun you can have if you see me every day.

452
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
All right.

453
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,518
I'll bother you every single day. You'd better be prepared for it.

454
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,038
My gosh. I'll happily get picked on as long as you're paying me.

455
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,519
Anytime. Thank you.

456
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,480
(Employer: CEO of Chungdam Heaven, Moon Cha Min)

457
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,440
You're quite naive. Your dream is to become like Cinderella?

458
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,400
You were joking, right?

459
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
I wish.

460
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,079
It is my life goal.

461
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,440
Goodness. If I were you, I'd read the room and lie.

462
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,599
I am aware that it goes against the modern thinking.

463
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,759
However, getting married...

464
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,039
is the only way I can get out of my situation.

465
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,799
Really?

466
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,759
Then what do you want to do once you get married?

467
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,400
I'll live a happy life while giving and receiving love.

468
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't believe in such abstract ideals.

469
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,279
It makes you the perfect target for scammers.

470
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
My goodness.

471
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
I guess you've never been in love.

472
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,440
I feel so sorry for you.

473
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,160
I believe that every living being has the right to be loved.

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,079
The innate right to be loved.

475
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,559
"The right to be loved?"

476
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,160
But not many people exercise the right to the fullest.

477
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,119
I love myself.

478
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,160
I'm exercising the right on myself.

479
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,279
So I don't feel the need to date or get married.

480
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,440
I already received plenty of love.

481
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,079
Good for you.

482
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,160
But aren't you lonely and bored?

483
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,920
I suppose that's why I'm here with you now.

484
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Romance is such a peculiar thing.

485
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,319
You never know who will suddenly steal your heart.

486
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,959
It's as if there are...

487
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,519
invisible compatibility codes the universe has laid out.

488
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,440
Come here. Come closer for a moment.

489
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,920
It's a match.

490
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
No. Code mismatch!

491
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,799
Anyway, what's taking Mr. Moon so long?

492
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,759
Then I'll officially start tomorrow.

493
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,240
How dare you. Your boss hasn't finished his drink.

494
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,039
Having a conversation like this and this atmosphere.

495
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,240
I don't mind this.

496
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,960
The Han River is really nice.

497
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,160
Shoot. I really have to go to the restroom.

498
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,279
But this boss jerk won't leave.

499
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,319
- Let me steal a sip. - Hey.

500
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,160
We have no more booze left.

501
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,839
All right, then. Shall we get going?

502
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,720
My goodness.

503
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,519
Oh, no!

504
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
What is it?

505
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,799
You said to get going. Why are you standing there?

506
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,720
- I really have to... - What?

507
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
The restroom.

508
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,680
I need to go to the restroom.

509
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,759
Hey. You're an adult, not a child!

510
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,680
Gosh, she did drink a lot.

511
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,759
Is there a restroom nearby?

512
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,079
No.

513
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,119
The closest one is a long walk away.

514
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,239
(Route 1, Route 2)

515
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,838
(Very far)

516
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,480
(Extremely far)

517
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,400
Why are you so reckless?

518
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,118
You should've considered the outcome...

519
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,439
and picked a spot near the restroom.

520
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,318
So why did you have to talk so much?

521
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,599
You talked a lot too!

522
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,440
Oh, no. I really have to go. My gosh.

523
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Oh, no. What do I do?

524
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,559
Darn it.

525
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
What are you doing?

526
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Are you crying?

527
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,279
Did you pee your pants?

528
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,799
I'm trying to squeeze out some tears.

529
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,359
Tears are made of water too, you know.

530
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,039
Hey, that makes no sense!

531
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,720
Shall I stand guard for you? Do you want to go into the woods?

532
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
No!

533
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,519
I am an upstanding citizen.

534
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,640
The sky is watching me. I'd rather jump into the river.

535
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,720
Do you want to borrow this to cover yourself with it?

536
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Gosh, please leave.

537
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,239
Whether I relieve myself here or not, I'll figure it out.

538
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,039
So please just leave.

539
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
How could I walk away from someone who's clearly in a crisis?

540
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,079
It'll be easier without you around unless you'll do it on my behalf,

541
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,640
so please just leave!

542
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,519
Let me...

543
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Just go!

544
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,719
Well, then... Clean this up before you leave.

545
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,360
The sky is clear, and so is my mind.

546
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,920
I wish it was raining.

547
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,079
I wish I was losing my mind.

548
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,639
Hold tight.

549
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll do the same.

550
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,960
Could this mean we're compatible?

551
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:11,400
Keep holding. If you pee on me, I will kill you.

552
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,400
Honey, go faster.

553
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,769
You're talking nonsense now.

554
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,480
Stay with me!

555
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,119
Where is it? Darn it.

556
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:22,840
Cha Min, the arrogant prince,

557
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,639
has turned into a loyal, strong servant.

558
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,289
Very nice.

559
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,439
Jae Rim's urethral sphincter, hang in there!

560
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,289
(Toilet)

561
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:42,039
(Toilet)

562
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,159
Now, it's all on you.

563
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,599
Thank you. I'll stay strong until the very end.

564
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,400
(Toilet)

565
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
My gosh.

566
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,289
Why is he still here?

567
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,289
How am I going to face him again after this?

568
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,360
He's actually pretty cool.

569
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,639
But there's nothing cool...

570
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,329
about this situation or what I did.

571
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:29,960
It's just him.

572
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,599
Perhaps, he's a nice person.

573
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,199
Goodness.

574
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,159
Hey, stop.

575
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
What's with you? Why are you walking like that?

576
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm embarrassed. That's why.

577
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,329
I made a complete fool of myself...

578
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,840
in front of you, who is my boss now,

579
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,000
so I'm really embarrassed.

580
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,329
Right.

581
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,960
I don't know who the real winner is.

582
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,639
Me, because I got a paying job out of this.

583
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,679
Honey!

584
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,440
Hey, Dan A.

585
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,329
You weren't at Chungdam Heaven, and you didn't answer my calls.

586
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,078
To find my fiancé,

587
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,769
I even had to use the couple tracking app.

588
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,519
"Fiancé?"

589
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,159
"Honey?"

590
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,118
He said he didn't feel the need to date or get married,

591
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,440
but he's engaged?

592
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,960
What is this? Why did he lie to me?

593
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,289
Is he a bad guy?

594
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,719
You struggle and work hard to get a job...

595
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,679
only to encounter a terrible boss.

596
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,159
I'm rooting for all job seekers and employees in the country.

597
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,809
See you next time!
