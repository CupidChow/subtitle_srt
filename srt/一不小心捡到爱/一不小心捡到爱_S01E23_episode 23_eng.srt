1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,490
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,660
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,530
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,220
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,170
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,570
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,500
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,040
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,280
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,790
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,300
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,670
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,150
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,520
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,250
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,540
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,050
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,600

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,310

22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,990
Are you sure you didn't see them on the island?

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,920
We searched for a few days and found a suspicious couple. We followed them for a few days and found out that it wasn't them.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,690
Boss, didn't Brother Lun burn them to death? What are you still worried about?

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,280
If I don't see their corpses, my heart can't be at ease.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,300
It's been more than twenty years. I understand Ling Yue too well.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,940
Sinister. Cunning.

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,300
Just like the fish in the sea, slimy.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,230
If they are still alive, we won't be able to catch them even if we wanted to.

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,980
Sprinkle some bait to get a bite, right?

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,960
I understood, Boss. I will send more people to continue searching.

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,570
Dad, what are you looking at?

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,680
While I am still lucid,

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm looking through old photos.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,510
Combing through the things in the past.

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,070
Dad, it looks like Second Brother's is still more important to you.

37
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,460
Nonsense.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,120
You three are all my biological sons.

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,370
You all are equally important to me in my mind.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,710
There was something I originally planned to tell you first.

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,080
Right now, just rest first.

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,270
I will go get your medicine.

43
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,700

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,280
Ling Sheng, what exactly happened?

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,520
Dad, Second Brother had an accident.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,450
As for his funeral, I have already taken care of it.

47
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,600
I was afraid you would be upset, so I didn't dare tell you.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,770
Don't blame me.

49
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,920
Doctor! Doctor, come quickly!  My dad fainted!

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,920
 I'm very sorry, everyone.

51
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,210
 My dad is still receiving emergency treatment in the intensive care unit. I'm not in the mood to be interviewed.

52
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,960
But, everyone, please be rest assured.

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,100
All the business of Ling Group will proceed as normal and will not be affected by this in any way.

54
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,090
Right now, the most pressing matter is my dad's health.

55
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,240
I hope my dad can smoothly get through this dangerous period.

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,150
But there have been rumors over the internet lately that  Ling Group's financial affairs have problems.

57
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,170
How do you explain this?

58
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,390
As the saying goes, family disgraces shouldn't be spread publicly.

59
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,790
 But according to the findings of our investigation,

60
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,570
 this matter is directly related to New Way.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,690
You mean to say that Ling Group did indeed transfer assets

62
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,640
and it was the dead Ling Yue's doing.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,930
Don't speak ill of the deceased.

64
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,080
Even if my second brother has done some wrong things,

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,180
  I, Ling Sheng, am here to implore everyone

66
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,320
 to not mention it again.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
  Thanks, everyone.

68
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,220
This interview must be released on all internet, paper, and new media platforms.

69
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Understood, President Sheng. I will do so immediately.

70
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,430
  Thanks, everyone.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,730
This Ling Sheng really is shameless.

72
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,710
He exploited your father-son relationship with your dad and even slandered you.

73
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,310
Does he really think that we're dead and won't tear off his mouth?

74
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,530
But it's true we don't have any evidence to prove that he is lying.

75
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,250
And with my dad's current situation,

76
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,540
I'm worried that Ling Sheng will do more excessive things.

77
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,680
But he clearly designed this.

78
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,260
If we appear hastily, wouldn't we be falling into his trap?

79
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,240
I must return no matter what.

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,430
I will go look at my dad's situation.

81
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,470
If my dad is also under his control,

82
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,820
the situation will be more troublesome than it is now.

83
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,150
Okay, I will go back with you.

84
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,160
Stay here. After I take care of these things, I will come back for you.

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,130
Didn't we say that we'd do everything together?

86
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
Let me go with you.

87
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,500
Fine.

88
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,680
Rest assured, I will protect you well.

89
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,060
It should be me protecting you.

90
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,370
Dad, look at me.

91
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,270
Why? Why? Why?

92
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Sorry for scaring you.

93
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,960
Have you been working too late recently?

94
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,460
Just now you were continuously sleeptalking.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,460
What did I say?

96
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,490
You must've been too worried about Uncle.

97
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,960
Uncle has the best medical conditions right now. He will definitely recover.

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,110
Xin'er, I'm so scared.

99
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,110
I had a dream.

100
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,380
So many things happened in the dream.

101
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,660
I am really scared that those dreams will all become reality.

102
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,500
In the dream,

103
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,430
I remember that no matter how I waited for you,

104
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,560
you didn't come at all.

105
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,320
When I wanted to give up, you finally came.

106
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,290
But you stood in front of me and said,

107
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,970
"Ling Sheng, how could I like you?"

108
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,130
Silly fool.

109
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,010
Xin'er, I'm so scared.

110
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,530
I'm really very scared.

111
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,680
I really am scared that you will leave me.

112
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,770
I won't. I won't.

113
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,840
From now on,

114
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,510
you won't be alone again.

115
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,420
We finally meet.

116
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,060
What do you think about the movie theater I found? It's very well-hidden.

117
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,810
- It's wonderful. Love you. 
 - As you should.

118
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,380
Young President Ling, your family really is a mountain of swords and a sea of flames.

119
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,520
Your own brother really is throwing you into death.

120
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,120
He's a person who does things too far to the extreme.

121
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,490
But since we don't have direct evidence, we must be very passive.

122
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,210
It's my purpose for returning. First, it's because I'm worried about my dad's safety. Second, it's to gather evidence.

123
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,770
Only by gathering sufficient evidence, can I confront him head-on.

124
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,250
How can you gather evidence? You can't enter the company or return home right now.

125
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,730
This requires you two Conan fans.

126
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,400
- Us two? 
 - Yes.

127
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,220
All my people are closely followed by Ling Sheng.

128
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,190
You two usually have little interaction with me, so it won't raise suspicion.

129
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,890
Understood. Zero suspicion.

130
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,550
I remember back then when you pretended to be my boyfriend to help me dodge a bullet.

131
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,460
It's time for the female warrior to repay the favor.

132
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,460
It's not important. Now you have a real one.

133
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm not asking you to be a female warrior. I'm asking you to be a detective.

134
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,510
No one is able to be as good of detectives as us.

135
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,430
Going through great pains to unravel the truth... just the thought of it is exciting.

136
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,330
Have a cocktail drink. I want a citrus oolong-flavored one.

137
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,720
- Are they reliable? 
  - One hundred percent reliable.

138
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,290
What should we do next?

139
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,370
Ling Sheng and Yang Hong's interests are deeply intertwined. It will be very hard to discover their crack.

140
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,620
First of all, we have to create enmity between them.

141
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,280
Firstly, I can gather evidence.

142
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,270
Secondly, I can enter Ling Group's internal affairs to check Ling Sheng's account.

143
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,860
Right now, he wants to control more shares very badly so he will definitely go to Yang Hong for help.

144
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,600
He wants Yang Hong to provide money, so he will definitely bring Gu Xin'er's marriage onto the agenda.

145
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,830
They will merge businesses through marriage.

146
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,030
Then, how can we know about their progress?

147
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,970
Rest assured, I still have a hidden bargaining chip.

148
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,650
President Sheng.

149
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,030
Why is it you?

150
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,810
Fang Xue, why are you here?

151
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,770
I come to this bar often.

152
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,500
President Sheng, congratulations. You are now the head of Ling Group.

153
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,800
It's too early to say that, I haven't officially taken office.

154
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,840
Sooner or later Ling Group will be yours.

155
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,050
I've been under your care all this time. I, Xiao Xue, will toast to you here.

156
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,660
Our cooperation has always been very pleasant. No need to be so polite.

157
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,180
Director Sheng, our contract will expire soon.

158
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,470
Should we still renew it?

159
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,610
Of course. As long as you have the desire, we can renew it at any time.

160
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,550
That's great, President Sheng! Then we should have a proper discussion on renewal matters.

161
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,260
Sorry, I am a little busy.

162
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,140
We can talk about the renewal matters some other time.

163
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,980
Xue'er, you've gotten pretty again. You're so pretty on the screen.

164
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,700
Of course, you'll get benefits.

165
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,550
Here's to a pleasant collaboration.

166
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,140
As expected, I must be vigilant against this brat.

167
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,300
I didn't expect that he'd do something like this.

168
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,610
Is this the good news you're giving me?

169
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,670
 What you see isn't the truth. I will give you an explanation in person.

170
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,670
You'd best explain clearly.

171
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,230

172
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,280
In the name of protection, he's keeping your old man captive here.

173
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,940
He truly is cruel.

174
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,110
I never would've expected that Ling Sheng wouldn't even spare Dad.

175
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,580
Ling Sheng has already gone deranged.

176
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,880
But rest assured, we have so many pairs of eyes monitoring him.

177
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,060
Even now, he is still suspicious.

178
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,890
Ai Li and I will protect him without leaving even a centimeter.

179
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,750
Hello?

180
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,150
 Yang Hong is already at the China World Mall.

181
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,850
Are Youyou and Zhao Lei prepared?

182
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,420
 Yes.

183
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,450
We will do everything according to the plan.

184
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,780
 This is the miniature recorder I modified. It can prevent detection.

185
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,090
 Youyou and Zhao Lei. Put it in Yang Hong's purse.

186
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,960
 Got it.

187
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,720
Hello, Miss! We sincerely invite you to join our store's event.

188
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,660
Apologies, I'm in a rush.

189
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,730
Are you Madam Yang?

190
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,450
Honorable Madam Yang, thank you for your continuous support of our humble store.

191
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,050
Today, we are specifically offering you a member discount.

192
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,430
How did you know my surname was Yang?

193
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,190
 Yang Hong is an extremely artificial woman.

194
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,450
 As long as you flatter her, she will drop her guard.

195
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,660
I've had the pleasure of serving you once or twice.

196
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,460
I couldn't forget your incredible temperament.

197
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,900
Besides, you are in the top three of our store's VVVIPs.

198
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,580
Fine then. Introduce me to which ongoing events you have right now.

199
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,390
Okay.

200
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,330
 Considering Ling Sheng's personality, he will make lots of inspections when meeting with Yang Hong.

201
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,010
 Then, wouldn't our recorder be discovered?

202
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,170
 According to my understanding of Yang Hong,

203
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,360
 she's someone who is very conceited. She isn't going to obediently cooperate with an inspection.

204
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,130
- What do you want? 
 - President Yang, please cooperate with our work.

205
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,100
How guarded you are.

206
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,630
Is this because you are guilty of something or do you think I'll do something to you?

207
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,430
No need.

208
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,690
 At the end, get the recorder back.

209
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,130
 - Don't let her get suspicious. We must prevent alerting the enemy. 
 - Okay!

210
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,850
 Every afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Yang Hong goes to Lin Mao restaurant to drink afternoon tea. I think it's a good opportunity.

211
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,680
Hello, Madam.

212
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,890
Give me a latte and a strawberry cake.

213
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,400
Yes.

214
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,970
You have such great taste.

215
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,360
This is our store's—

216
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,400
What is wrong with you?

217
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,830
- You're so careless! 
 - I'm sorry!

218
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,150
Get a napkin! Hurry!

219
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,020
- Goodness! Goodness! 
 - These pants are so expensive. Come on.

220
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,300
- They're quite expensive. 
 - Really.

221
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,030
I won't be able to wash it off.

222
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,610
 Auntie Yang, if you are taken advantage of by other people who want to sow discord during times like these,

223
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,880
 would this be falling right into the arms of others?

224
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,960
 Even so, we must give them an opportunity to exploit us.

225
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,010
 Auntie Yang, would you really believe these photos that are angle tricks?

226
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,990
 If I hadn't intercepted these photos,

227
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,150
 this news would've been all over the city.

228
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,500
 What do you think our Xin'er would think?

229
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,010
 I have my limits.

230
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,660
 I would never do anything that would hurt Xin'er.

231
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,820
 Believe me, Mother.

232
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,890
 I can't accept such a title.

233
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,850
 If there was a first time, there will be a second.

234
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,920
 I can intercept it once but not forever.

235
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,990
 Patience is limited. I hope that from now on, you won't commit such a low-grade mistake.

236
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,250
 Rest assured. From start to finish, Xin'er is the only one in my heart.

237
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,960
 Our goal has almost been accomplished.

238
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,930
 As long as you help me one more time and allow me to succeed,

239
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,390
 you will be saving Xin'er and Gu Group.

240
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,630
 In the past, I never realized

241
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,040
 any words coming out of your mouth become so noble.

242
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,230
 Since we are already allies, why is there a difference between "mine" and "yours"?

243
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,790
 Mom. I'm your son-in-law, which makes me half your son.

244
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,100
 I will treat Xin'er well and treat Ansheng like a biological brother. It's the best of both worlds.

245
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,430
 You make it sound nice,

246
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,970
 but your transfer of assets was illegal.

247
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,070
 If I am risking myself to allow you to become the biggest shareholder,

248
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,170
 would you keep your promise

249
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,610
 and put the promised equity under my name?

250
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,610
 I understand. What do you want me to do?

251
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,600
 Sign an official transfer of equity.

252
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,920
 What's the matter? You aren't willing to?

253
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,660
 Of course, I'm willing.

254
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,460
 Now, can you trust me?

255
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,420
 How far have you gotten in taking care of Anxin and Ling Yue?

256
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,270
 Relax.

257
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,610
 Those two have already become lonely ghosts.

258
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,050
  You're so sure.

259
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,940
 My father went into the ICU and still, that didn't force him out.

260
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,010
 I know him too well. This is his Achille's heel.

261
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,890
 As long as he is still alive, he would have gotten to my father even if he had to crawl to get there. Unless he was dead.

262
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,810
 Good, then.

263
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,090
 Last time, that girl brought up new evidence and I really worried it would not be beneficial to Xin'er.

264
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,140
 Only if she completely disappears can our Xin'er's past be undiscoverable.

265
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,370
 That Yu Guo sure is unlucky.

266
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,320
 That was originally the damned girl's alprazolam. Why did she drink it?

267
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,110
 She even had an allergy that caused her to lose the use of one hand.

268
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,750
Don't worry. It's all in the past.

269
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,170
I suppose I can give Yu Guo an explanation now.

270
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,770
- Brother. 
 - Xin'er.

271
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,020
Look at what this is.

272
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,270
Why did you suddenly buy this?

273
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,230
Isn't this your favorite thing to eat?

274
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,650
You always blamed me for being biased, saying I only remembered what Anxin liked to eat.

275
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,400
Don't I understand you?

276
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,190
You don't like eating sweets from that shop. You just liked being annoyed with Anxin.

277
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,430
Your favorite thing to eat is the walnut napolean.

278
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,960
Then, why didn't you know to buy it for me sooner?

279
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,970
I hope buying it now isn't too late.

280
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,870
Thank you, Brother.

281
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,540
Xin'er, I've recently been thinking about a problem.

282
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,800
I couldn't figure it out.

283
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,360
Do you think living in reality is more important,

284
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,390
or is living happily more important?

285
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,210
Living in happiness is more important.

286
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,330
Now, as long as we can get Yang Hong's signed contract with Ling Sheng and combine it with the recording,

287
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,240
we can prove they're the ones who transferred the assets,

288
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,560
and not you. Then your innocence would be returned.

289
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,790
That's true indeed, but we don't have much time left.

290
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,080
Do as my brother said.

291
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm pretty shocked that he's willing to help us.

292
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
Don't have such a huge prejudice against him. He's just like this.

293
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,590
As long as he says he'll help, he will do everything he can. So rest assured.

294
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,600
You have such high regard for him.

295
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,850
Why is this a reason to be jealous?

296
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,180
I'm jealous of him because he can inspire you to trust him so much.

297
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,510
Whenever we talk about him, your words are full of pride.

298
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,030
Not so.

299
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,540
My adoration and trust in you are right in here.

300
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,960
It's packed full. I can't give it to anyone else.

301
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,130
♫  Watching as the street lights flash on and off  ♫

302
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,340
Let's finish watching the movie.

303
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,000
♫  We can see how far away our future is just 
 by turning our heads back  ♫

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,930
♫  We've yet to part but longing has already begun  ♫

305
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:14,250
♫   Let me love you. Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

306
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:22,880
♫  and learn to use warmth to cover up the cold 
 memories of the past  ♫

307
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:31,830
♫  We've walked with the scenery along our journey and stopped  ♫

308
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,780
Is it pretty?

309
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,480
Beautiful.

310
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,360
The wedding dress is so beautiful.

311
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,220
Its name is Goya. In Urdu,

312
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,150
it represents a dreamscape being similar to reality.

313
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,480
Just like my feelings.

314
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,840
The sight of you wearing a wedding dress for me

315
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,490
has appeared in my dreams countless times.

316
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,060
Now it's appeared in front of my eyes, yet I dare not believe it's real.

317
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,600
♫  Turns out happiness caused audible laughs  ♫

318
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:18,040
♫   Let me love you. Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

319
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Xiao Sheng,

320
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,990
all of this is real.

321
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,970
From now on, every single moment

322
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,870
will be real.

323
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,620
I originally believed I would never be able to wait long enough for this day.

324
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,080
Thank you, Xin'er. Thank you for making my dream come true.

325
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,910
The dream I've had for so long.

326
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,610
♫  Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

327
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,450
I know...

328
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,050
life can't be restarted. But the time that's been wasted...

329
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,100
let it pass.

330
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:02,290
Starting now, let's begin again. Okay?

331
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,150
♫  The story continues on as the camera makes 
 a full-length shot  ♫

332
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,650
Okay. I promise you that.

333
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,190
I will definitely give you the most beautiful wedding

334
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,750
and the most dependable happiness.

335
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,900
Dad. Dad, are you ready or not?

336
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,460
We're coming! We're coming!

337
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,230
There's still quite some time before this engagement ceremony. Why do we have to go so early?

338
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,900
It's an important event, after all. Let's leave early in case something goes wrong.

339
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,720
Dad, you look lively. You even put the brooch on.

340
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,440
It's Anxin's engagement ceremony after all.

341
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,640
That requires a ceremonial presence.

342
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,230
It's Xin'er. Xin'er.

343
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,100
Why are you always so muddleheaded now?

344
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,360
Why don't you go wait in the car? I'll go see if Xin'er is ready or not.

345
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,550
Okay. Let's go.

346
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,390
Careful.

347
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,040
Mom.

348
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,600
Do me a favor and ask Xin'er why she suddenly made a U-turn?

349
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,780
She probably forgot something. She's forgetful.

350
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,120
We'll go with her.

351
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,380
How do you open this?

352
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,810
I'm using an automation console now. I re-programmed the face recognition software.

353
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,200
I'll go keep watch.

354
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,640

355
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,010

356
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,490
Wait a minute.

357
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,170
- Mom, why did you get out, too? 
 - I'm going to use the bathroom.

358
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,220
Xin'er, have you gotten everything?

359
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,610
- Yes, I've got it. 
 - I'm going to use the bathroom.

360
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,290
Is something wrong, Xin'er?

361
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,530
Don't worry, Brother. It's fine.

362
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,620

363
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,460
Old Gu.

364
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,410
Congratulations on your daughter's engagement.

365
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,910
Engagement?

366
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,450
- Who's getting engaged? 
 - Hey, Old Gu.

367
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,540
You really are a joker.

368
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,780
Old Jiang?

369
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,220
Thank you for coming to this event. These days, many people don't show this kind of consideration.

370
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,690
Not at all, not at all.

371
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,040
- Congratulations, congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

372
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,460
- I'm going to catch up with other friends. 
 - Okay.

373
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,130
What's wrong, Yuanchao?

374
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,170
Is... Is today Anxin's engagement party?

375
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,920
- It's Xin'er. 
 - Xin... Xin'er?

376
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,950
Then... who are you?

377
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,860
Let's get something to eat. Don't drink anymore.

378
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,490
I believe that, with all of your support, our Ling Group will definitely become better and better.

379
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,200
It surely will.

380
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,300
President Sheng, we'll take a look over there. Okay?

381
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,580
- Okay. 
 - Excuse us.

382
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,420
Third Brother, here. Let's chat for a few minutes.

383
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,360
Brother, I'm busy. If you need something, we can talk about it later.

384
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,890
Then... let's have a drink.

385
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,310
Since you have such an interest, let's drink.

386
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,920
Eldest Brother, let's talk later.

387
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,570
The banquet will start soon. I'm going to get ready first.

388
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,530
- Get this printed. Then put it over there. 
- There? 
 - Yes. That should work.

389
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,060
Damn it!

390
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,370
Where did you come from, waitress? Can't you carry water?

391
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,910
What's going on here?

392
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,440
What are you doing? You're so careless. Did you trade your intelligence for your beauty?

393
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,940
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There's nothing important on this computer, is there?

394
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,890
- This has all the videos we were going to show later. 
 - Well...

395
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,220
Fortunately, President Ling asked me to prepare a backup.

396
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,380
Go back to work. Be more careful next time!

397
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,650
Come to my office this afternoon. I want to talk to you.

399
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,180
Okay.

400
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,280
That's pretty much it So, Miss Gu, we'll be going.

401
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,860
Thank you.

402
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,040
Our Xin'er is very beautiful today.

403
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,550
Brother.

404
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,000
Thank you, Brother.

405
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,330
There are some other things I want to talk to you about.

406
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,900
I saw Ling Yue and Anxin.

407
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,550
  This is your home, too. You know where the back door is.

408
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,490
What were you thinking?

409
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,280
I'm, of course, glad that they're unharmed.

410
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,090
But what I thought before was that after this engagement ends,

411
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,510
everything will become easier.

412
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,480
Ling Yue and Anxin

413
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,770
would also come to congratulate us together.

414
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,490
They...

415
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,720
Xin'er, are you ready? It's almost about to start.

416
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm ready.

417
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,980
Brother, I trust you.

418
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,710
No matter what happens, you will be by my side.

419
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,880
What are you two talking about?

420
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,270
We are saying that in the future, if you dare bully me,

421
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,010
my brother definitely won't spare you.

422
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,210
Brother, relax. Leave Xin'er to me.

423
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,960
Let's go.

424
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,390
We're leaving, Brother.

425
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,400
Thank you, everyone, for being able to come to the engagement ceremony for Xin'er and I

426
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,060
and bearing witness to our happiness together.

427
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
To me, Xin'er is

428
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,750
like the moon in the sky.

429
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,130
Glorious. Luminous.

430
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,170
I prepared for so many years

431
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,380
in order to get closer to her.

432
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
Now,

433
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,830
I am finally next to her

434
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,920
and holding her hand,

435
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,830
laughing with her,

436
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,610
crying with her, growing older with her.

437
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,050
Whenever I think about this,

438
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,170
I think I'm happier than any person in the world.

439
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,120
And I...

440
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,530
will definitely give her happiness.

441
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,840
Xin'er, thank you.

442
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,010
Thank you for coming to my side.

443
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,760
Silly.

444
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,380
Why are you crying?

445
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,610
I also prepared a surprise for you.

446
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,390
What is it?

447
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,840
  - It's so touching. 
 - What's the meaning of this?

448
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,910
  Your asset transfer was illegal.

449
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,760
 If I take the risk and allow you to be the biggest shareholder,

450
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,920
 would you still keep the promise you made

451
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,820
 and list the promised equity under my name?

452
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,260
 I understand. What do you want me to do?

453
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,200
  Sign an official transfer of equity document.

454
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,460
  - What? You aren't willing to? 
   - Let me through.  Excuse me.

455
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,120
- Mrs. Gu, is the voice in the video your voice? 
 - Give us an answer. 
 -  Of course, I am willing.

456
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,810
I really can't believe that Mrs. Gu is that kind of person.

457
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,030
That's true. It's even harder to see that Young Chairman Ling is this kind of person.

458
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,280
  - How far have you gotten in taking care of Anxin and Ling Yue?   
 - This is huge news! 
 - Yes.

459
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,350
 Rest assured. Those two have already become lonely ghosts.

460
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,200
Soundman! Turn off the power! Turn it off.

461
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
 My father went into the ICU and still, that didn't force him out. Unless he's dead.

462
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,690
Xin'er, let me explain.

463
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,440
I can explain.

464
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,030
I don't know which statements you are saying are true

465
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,250
and which are fake. Which ones are real?

466
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,520
I am sincere about you!

467
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,420
  - What's going on? Can you tell us what's going on. 
 - Mrs. Gu! Mrs. Gu! Give us an explanation.

468
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,990
I originally believed that.

469
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,630
You know what the second half of that recording contains.

470
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,400
If you truly love Xin'er, you must let her leave with me immediately.

471
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,590
It's fine, Xin'er. Let's go.

472
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,170
  - What's going on? Can you explain this to us? 
 - Give an explanation.

473
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,720
You're not allowed to take pictures!

474
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,850
Xin'er, I will explain to you when we get back. Okay?

475
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,120
Xin'er, listen to me. You have to leave here right now.

476
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,420
  - Yes. That's right. 
 - Mrs. Gu! Explain all this to us.

477
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,560
 Last time, that girl brought up new evidence and I really worried it would not be beneficial to Xin'er.

478
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,060
  Only if she completely disappears,

479
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,500
 can our Xin'er's past be undiscoverable.

480
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,700
 That Yu Guo sure is unlucky.

481
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,940
 That was originally the damned girl's alprazolam.

482
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,660
 Why did she drink it?

483
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,400
 No matter how bad your insomnia is, you can't take this medicine carelessly.

484
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,640
  Once or twice is okay. More than that, you can become dependent on it.

485
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,440
  Don't worry, Mom. I'm requesting it for a classmate.

486
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,490
 Her rehearsals have been quite arduous lately,

487
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,890
 so she has insomnia and can't sleep.

488
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,200
 Right, Xin'er.

489
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,590
  When will that play festival be performed?

490
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,570
  My darling daughter surely has a huge leading role.

491
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,600
  Even in my dreams, I wouldn't have believed

492
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,360
  that I'd be Gu Anxin's understudy.

493
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,310
  I'm apologizing to you right now.

494
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,470
 Yu Guo!

495
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,750
 Yu Guo?

496
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,500
Mom, is this all true?

497
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,630
It's not!

498
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,110
Xin'er, you've done nothing wrong.

499
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,930
It has nothing to do with you.

500
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,360
It was all Anxin's fault. All her fault. All of it!

501
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,370
Mom!

502
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,760
Baby, I'm doing this all for your good!

503
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,920
- It was all for your good! 
 - For my good?

504
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,750
For my good?

505
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,780
Did you do it for me or yourself?

506
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,460
You kept it secret from me for so many years.

507
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,720
It wasn't until today that I realized that I was the perpetrator!

508
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,700
Now, it's great.

509
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,720
I have nothing.

510
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,810
Are you satisfied?

511
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,250
Xin'er, calm down. Let's leave this place first!

512
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,640
Is the recording real? Is this the reality of the situation?

513
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,610
- Can you explain? 
 - Did you hurt Gu Anxin for the sake of your own daughter?

514
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,290
Can you say sometning?

515
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,720
  Give us a response, Mrs. Yang!

516
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,410
  Can you respond to our questions?

517
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,320
- Dad. 
 - Dad! 
 - Yuanchao, what's wrong with you, Yuanchao?

518
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,970
Send your dad to the hospital. I'm begging you, Son. Son!

519
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,850
Someone, come!

520
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,160
You two, stop the reporters. You two, take my dad to the hospital.

521
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,660
Stop taking pictures! Stop taking pictures!

522
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,760
- Hurry. 
 - Answer the questions! Mrs. Yang! Mrs. Yang!

523
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,970
  Madam! Madam, give us an answer!

524
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,330
  Answer our questions, Madam.

525
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,990
Xin'er.

526
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,330
Just say something. Answer us, Miss Gu.

527
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,920
Answer our questions! Miss Gu, please explain!

528
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,220
  Did you really do those things?

529
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,340
Everyone wants to know the truth, Miss Gu!

530
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,190
  - Give us a response. 
 - Clarify this for us, okay? 
 - Don't leave.

531
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,720
What did that recording mean? Did you and your mother-in-law really transfer Ling Group's assets?

532
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,870
Is it true that you schemed the death of your own brother because of Miss Gu?

533
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,750
- Please give us an explanation. 
 - Answer our questions, okay?

534
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,860
Everyone, shut up!

535
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,940
The recording is a fabrication.  It's all nonsense.

536
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,080
Even now, you're still lying?

537
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,120
- It's President Ling Yue. 
 - He's still alive?

538
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,610
  This is great. This is going to be good.

539
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,010
  True. The company can be saved now.

540
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,100
- What is going on? 
 - How did this happen?

541
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,870
  How is it that he's here. Didn't he die?

542
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:45,610

543
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:51,430
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

544
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,000
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

548
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,220
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

549
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,710
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

550
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:25,500
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫
