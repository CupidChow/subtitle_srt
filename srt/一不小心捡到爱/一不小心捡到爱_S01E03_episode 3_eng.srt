♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,640
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,530
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,160
♫  Your breathing brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,460
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,990
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,260
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,600
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,350
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,550
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,100
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,440
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,230
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:31,440
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,220
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,540

20
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,310

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,280
Hand.

22
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't need your help anymore.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,500
I'll put my clothes on by myself later.

24
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,620
Not only was your service not up to par, you also saw every part of me.

25
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,650
Shouldn't you pay my mental trauma fees?

26
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,020
W-W-Who extorts people like you?

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,690
Moreover, I only accidentally fell in because you pulled me.

28
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,690
It's not like I did it on purpose.

29
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,480
But you saw every part of me.

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,120
What's there to look at? You're a dry stick like one of those telephone poles.

31
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,140
You make it seem like I want to look at you.

32
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,840
Dry? How am I dry?

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
Whatever. I won't argue with you this time.

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,730
There's no need for a compensation payment either. Watch out next time.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,790
 122 total clicks?

36
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,380
 Why so few?

37
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,530
 Original Poster, has your village just received internet?

38
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,750
 Who reads this kind of plot anymore?

39
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,430
 - I'll take some space! 
 - Li Tao, let me give you an immature piece of advice, Original Poster.

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,490
 Stop drawing those wholesome boring things. How about some dominating boss cartoons?

41
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,770
 Shut up! Shut up, all of you!

42
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,560
 Can you all stop being keyboard warriors?

43
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,460
 I think Original Poster draws well. I really like these warmhearted stories.

Done. Thanks.

54
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,830
Don't mention it.

55
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,850
It seems like my dry body... left a deep impression on you.

56
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,990
Are you a pig, Gu Anxin? Are you a pig?

 - Morning.

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,990
Everyone! Welfare distribution here!

62
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,630
Here, here, here, here. Come take your gift. Everyone has one, everyone has one.

63
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,800
- Thank you! 
 - You all have worked very hard during this time.

64
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,530
Tonight, I'll treat everyone to dinner. How about it?

65
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,210
Okay!

66
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,620
- Manager Du. 
 - Anxin, long time no see.

67
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,140
This... I left it specifically for you.

68
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,020
Thank you.

69
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,730
About tonight's dinner... you must come, all right?

70
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Go ahead and work.

71
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,930
- A toast! 
 - Thanks everyone!

72
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,670
Sister Anxin, I am a new coworker named Xiao Xu.

73
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,460
- Let me give a toast to you. Please take care of me.
 - Please take care of me.

74
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,810
- Anxin... can't drink alcohol. 
 - I can drink.

75
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,520
I'll drink this glass for her, all right?

76
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,570
Here, here, here.

77
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,960
So manly!

78
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,650
- The car's here. We're leaving, bye! 
 - Bye!

79
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,360
Bye! See you at the company tomorrow!

80
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,270
All right, all right, all right!

81
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,550
Anxin, where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

82
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,160
I live pretty close. The subway entrance

83
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,270
- takes me straight home. 
 - This place is really far from the subway entrance.

84
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,410
I'm worried if you go alone.

85
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,480
Give it to me. I'll bring you home. Let's go.

86
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,690
Let's go. Come.

87
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,600
Manager Du, my home is right ahead.

88
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,240
I'll just go home first. Thank you.

89
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
No need to always call me "Manager."

90
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
In the future, call me Du Ming.

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,010
I'd better keep calling you "Manager." I think that's more... polite.

92
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,190
Then, I'll go up now.

93
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,690
Anxin, I-I think

94
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,840
in the past few days, you've been sending packages and speed deliveries every single day.

95
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
You must be very tired.

96
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,140
- How about you help me with my work and keep track of the account books? 
 - No need, no need, no need!

97
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,200
I like my current life.

98
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,120
I also like this job as well.

99
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,970
I'll just go back first...

100
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,280
Anxin, wait a second!

101
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,360
I have something for you. Wait a moment.

102
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,150
 Why do I have a bad feeling?

103
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,960
- How cliche. 
 - Anxin,

104
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
I like you.

105
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,780
Ever since the first day you started working, I've liked you!

106
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,900
I only dare to say this because of the alcohol.

107
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,060
When I was out of town these days, I've missed you every day.

108
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,010
I know it's a little sudden,

109
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,650
but... please give me a chance.

110
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,740
I have a boyfriend.

111
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,980
- When was this? 
 - Just... a few days ago.

112
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,720
Few—

113
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,920
Where is he?

114
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,180
- He's not upstairs is he? You're living with him? 
 - No, no!

115
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,660
W-We're in a long-distance relationship. He lives abroad.

116
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,850
That means I still have an opportunity.

117
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,440
Here, take it.

118
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,990
- J-Just take it. I'll leave now. 
 - N-No need...

119
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
W-Wait, Manager Du!

120
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Go.

121
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,420
Did you see the two vases I have at home?

122
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,060
No.

123
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,280
You seem to be in a good mood today.

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,220
So-so.

125
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,380
What's up with you? What an unpleasant expression. 
  (T/N: "Unpleasant expression" literally means to "stinky expression")

126
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,530
It's the room that's stinky.

127
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,770
No. In fact, there are bursts of rose fragrance. It smells pretty good.

128
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,550
It's already 11:20 p.m.

129
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,000
You held up on 20 minutes of my sleeping time.

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,010
- If you come back so late—
- If you come back so late again next time,

131
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,490
you will have to compensate for my sleeping time.

132
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,050
You can also choose to...

133
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,880
Choose what?

134
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,270
Choose to sleep.

135
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,560
Acting so weird.

136
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,640
You're awake.

137
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Why did you cover it? It will go bad.

138
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,500
It attracts mosquitos.

139
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,560
It attracts mosquitos? Where are there mosquitos?

140
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,760
There are.

141
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,160
What's in that box?

142
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,960
Wait a moment.

143
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,560
As you requested, a wheelchair imported from Germany.

144
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
Try it.

145
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
- Imported from Germany? 
 - Yeah.

146
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,060
- This doesn't look too sturdy. 
 - How can that be? Look. The important part is looking here.

147
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,960
This slender design and this flowing line

148
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,940
are absolutely perfect. Also, it... it's convenient to fold,

149
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,330
and it's very lightweight.

150
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,560
Although my leg isn't even broken, I still want to sit on it.

151
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,740
How about you give it a try?

152
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,460
How is it?

153
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,710
This is manual?

154
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,350
Manual...

155
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,450
Well, isn't your leg broken? You have no way of getting exercise,

156
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,990
You can just treat it as exercise. It's good for your health.

157
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,060
Look. Now I only owe you ¥108,800.

158
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,660
Agreed?

159
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,540
You didn't spend your money on this wheelchair imported from Germany, right?

160
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,520
Smart.

161
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,930
Ever since you arrived, the water bills, electricity bills, and living expenses,

162
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,900
multiple fees are increasing nonstop.

163
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,160
I have difficulties. Try to understand them.

164
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Try it.

165
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,850
I forgot.

166
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,970
I'll push you around.

167
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,510
How is it? Don't you think it's pretty nice?

168
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,490
Look out the window.

169
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,640
You have to get used to using this.

170
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,260
Try it yourself. I'll take out the trash.

171
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,560
Throw the flowers away, too.

172
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,410
Quite wasteful.

173
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,090

174
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,180
About that project from last time, are we really not bringing Nancy?

175
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
I heard the rate of return is very high.

176
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,680
Many people want to get a share.

177
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,190
Then, do they know that that project

178
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,660
hasn't even received approval?

179
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Wow, you!

180
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,940
No wonder you aren't eating meat right by your lips. 
  (T/N: Not taking advantage of something right in front of you)

181
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,000
You already knew long ago that there was a problem. As expected of Gu Xin'er.

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,750
A toast!

183
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,470
Shasha?

184
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,160
Sorry, I mistook you for my first love.

185
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,560
As an apology, can I treat you to a drink?

186
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,690
This guy's pickup lines are so old-school.

187
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,290
Why are you being a stranger?

188
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,200
What are you doing?

189
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,080
Why did you hit me? Security!

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,850
He hit me! Hurry and catch him!

191
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,830
Hey, you've caught the wrong person!

192
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,450
Xiao Sheng?

193
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,500
You're that little wild kid who always said he'd marry Xin'er?

194
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,140
- Long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

195
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,940
A tiger has five mountain holes in front of him.

196
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,720
Then every hole has a lamb.

197
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,870
However, he only went into the second hole.

198
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,880
Do you know why?

199
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,300
Because the lamb in the second hole is fatter.

200
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,860
No.

201
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,130
Because he can go into whatever hole he wants to.

202
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,440
That's a joke?

203
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,600
No.

204
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
I attended a prize event while walking in the market today.

205
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,920
They gave me two movie tickets.

206
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,440
You're lucky enough to receive movie tickets?

207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,640
Then go by yourself.

208
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,880
I'm one person. I d-don't need two tickets.

209
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,040
That's right.

210
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,500
Then give me one.

211
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,050
I'll help you put it up online to sell.

212
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,910
No need. It can't be sold for much.

213
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,570
Even though a fly is small, it still eats meat.
  (T/N: A small thing is still valuable)

214
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,520
How about I gift it to you?

215
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,150
The movie's on Friday at 8:00 p.m.

216
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,560
At that time, you should probably be off work.

217
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't have time.

218
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,240
Anyways, the movie's on Friday at 8:00 p.m. Come if you want.

219
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,600
Anxin, we might have to get off late again today.

220
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,140
- Why? 
 - There was a notification just now saying that a batch of products was organized incorrectly.

221
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,550
But you see... Feifei and Xiao Yan have already left.

222
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,390
- But today, I— 
 - Sister, I'm begging you! Don't let me work overtime by myself.

223
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,830
- I can only stay with you for a short while. 
 - Okay, okay, okay. There isn't that much. We can finish it quickly.

224
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,700
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

225
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,660
- Hi, Sir, here is the popcorn you wanted.
- Thank you.

226
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,140
Hello, how can I help you?

227
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,830
Here. Anxin. Anxin!

228
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,940
There's these, too.

229
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,450
 Hello, welcome to Movie City.

230
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,980
 The 8:00 screening of Zootopia

231
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,270
 is now allowing the watchers to come in and get their tickets checked.

232
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,440
 Viewers who bought tickets for the current screening

233
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,660
 please come to the gate to have your ticket checked.

234
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,920
 Thank you for your cooperation and enjoy the movie.

235
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,240
We are finally done.

236
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,890
- Oh no! 
 - What's wrong?

237
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,220
I had an appointment with a friend to watch a movie at 8:00.

238
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,620
8:00 p.m? If you go now, it might already be over!

239
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,530
Xiao Ba?

240
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,580
No way.

241
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,730
You didn't watch it?

242
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,810
There's no point in watching it alone.

243
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,630
- A coworker... 
 - Don't worry about it.

244
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,670
Let's go.

245
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,990
Wait!

246
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,040
Wait a second.

247
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,040
How can we miss the movie you wanted to watch?

248
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,610
I'll treat you to this movie, so it's on me.

249
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,080
Then let's go.

250
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,820
I'll hold it for you.

251
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,550
Let me support you.

252
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,710
Walk slowly.

253
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,840
Oh my goodness!

254
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,610
Anxin.

255
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,890
Nothing, go to sleep.

256
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,510
Good night.

257
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,640
Good night.

258
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,680
 Anxin.

259
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,760
 Nothing, go to sleep. Good night.

260
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
  Good night.

261
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,600
 Did he really leave?

262
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,560
  The words he didn't say last night...

263
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,750
 were they a farewell?

264
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,160
 Were the movie tickets a farewell gift?

265
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,910
 This is a bit big.

266
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,530
 Will you be able to hold it later?

267
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,060
Anxin?

268
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,330
Anxin! Why are you spacing out? The package.

269
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,210
Is it Phoenix Neighborhood?

270
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,870
What's wrong? You're not in the right mind today.

271
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,510
Nothing, I probably didn't sleep well.

272
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,380
Kind person, have some pity on me.

273
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,720
Give me some food.

274
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,650
 Have some pity on me.

275
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,650
 Give me some food.

276
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,080
  Kind person, please give me some food.

277
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,740
  Please have pity on me.

278
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,510
  Please give me some food.

279
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,060
  Kind person.

280
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,090
  Please have some pity on me.

281
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,390
Xiao Yan, something came up at home!

282
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,200
Can I switch shifts with you?

283
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,860
What happened?

284
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,860
My house...  My house cat is missing.

285
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,750
 - You raised a cat? 
- Just a cat that grew up with me.

286
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,660
 There's a problem with its legs, and I suddenly lost it.

287
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,380
 Can we switch shifts?

288
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,880
 Okay.

289
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,760
Boss!

290
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,420
Did you see the guy that smashed all your beer?

291
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,850
No.

292
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,120
Thank you.

293
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,040
Okay, go play with them.

294
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,630
Doctor Xiao!

295
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,470
Brat! It's really you?

296
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,900
Is your leg...

297
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,430
all right?

298
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,810
It's fine.

299
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,950
You are pretty smart to guess it was me right away.

300
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,360
Of course.

301
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Besides you, who else knows I would be at the orphanage every Wednesday?

302
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,810
Besides you, who else would be so psychotic to send me a message using binary code?

303
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,410
Did you get what I sent you?

304
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,590
It's here. Your examination report.

305
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Thank you.

306
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,910
Give me your wallet.

307
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,420
Give it to me.

308
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,970
I—

309
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,940
I...

310
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,050
Ask Ai Li to reimburse you.

311
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,320
That's fine with me.

312
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,780
Do you really not need me to take a look at your leg?

313
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:37,070

314
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,610
 Attorney Chen,

315
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,850
 what you mean is that my father wants to give 5% of the shares to this woman?

316
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,570
 That's right. Jin Guan is no longer in this world.

317
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,350
 Based on the policy,

318
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,250
 the shares will be transferred to Jin Guan's daughter.

319
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,940
 Daughter?

320
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,960
 Could that old man have had an illegitimate daughter?

321
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,010
 I don't know whether she's an illegitimate daughter,

322
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,050
 but the chairman has always been looking for her.

323
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,420
 Then that means, as long as we have her 5% of the share,

324
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,570
 the heir position wouldn't depend on the old man's choice. Right?

325
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,110
 My brother also knows about this, then?

326
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,140
 Is that right, Attorney Chen?

327
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,440
 Then who am I?

328
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,210
 You don't know who you are?

329
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,040
 First pay the fee, then take the bill to get medicine.

330
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,920
 Hello, can I borrow your phone?

331
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,250
 Thank you.

332
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,160
 - Hello, who is this? 
 - It's me.

333
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,690
 President Ling?

334
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,950
  As long as you are fine, I can rest assured.

335
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,600
 Is there any movement on Ling Fang's side?

336
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,820
 Director Ling Fang's people have followed me the whole day.

337
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,430
 Unless something unexpected happened, this matter definitely has to do with them.

338
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,620
 - Is there evidence? 
 - As of right now, no.

339
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,140
 Then I won't make an appearance yet and observe for changes.

340
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,270
 - I'll wait for them to fall for the bait. 
 - Okay.

341
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,040
 President Ling, where are you right now? Let me prepare somewhere for you to stay.

342
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,040
 No need.

343
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,870
 I found the girl that the old man wants to find.

344
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,570
 ¥300,000? Are you extorting me?

345
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,430
 Then let's call the police. A collision injury is not a minor charge.

346
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,900
 So, how about...

347
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,710
 you stay at my house?

348
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,950
 Xiao Ba! Where is my toothbrush?

349
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,020
 When I used the restroom, I knocked it over by accident and it fell into the toilet.

350
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,490
 - What is this? 
 - A toothbrush.

351
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,430
 You seem to relate to this a lot.

352
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,670
 Because I was adopted.

353
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,730

354
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,370
 Thank goodness she isn't that old man's illegitimate daughter.

355
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,850
It's me, how have things been lately?

356
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,220
 Concerning the matter where the company's firewall was attacked by a secret group,

357
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,050
 we have already found their location with the IP address you provided.

358
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,300
 It was the act of Director Ling Fang and the others.

359
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,260
Don't worry. I have already fixed the firewall.

360
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,360
Do everything according to plan.

361
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,100
That's right. There's a new e-commerce business called Fit.

362
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,870
Recently, they've continually hooked away our people.

363
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,060
 They claim that those who leave New Way

364
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,050
 can receive double the salary.

365
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,580
The fish are about to bite the hook.

366
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,070
Also, recently, Director Ling Fang has been hiring people to find out more about Miss Anxin.

367
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,320
What did he find out?

368
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,160
 He didn't find out anything so far.

369
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,270
Watch him closely. Don't let him find out about Anxin.

370
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay, don't worry.

371
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,390
 T-Tell me honestly.

372
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,130
 Surely you're not some kind of wanted criminal in the underworld

373
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,620
 who has broken a law and is hiding in my house because you're scared that you'll be found.

374
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,800
 If I were a wanted criminal,

375
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,680
 I would have made a move on you first.

376
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,650
 After all, you're all by yourself

377
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,800
 and you're gorgeous.

378
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,420
♫  Those times we want to wipe away tears  ♫

379

♫  Those times we withdrew our hands  ♫

380
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,940
 Wait here. I'll go turn off the water.

 Let me push you around.

385
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,020
 Take a look out the window.

♫  Hugging the fragility, hold me  ♫

387

 How can we miss the movie you wanted to watch?

388

 Consider this as me treating you. It's on me.

389

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,590
Sorry. Excuse me.

392
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,490
Have you seen a boy with fair and clean complexion,

393
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,570
- rowing a wheelchair? 
 - No, we haven't.

394
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,320
Thank you.

395
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Xiao Ba!

396
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,510
Where exactly are you?

397
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,110
I will never kick you out again. Do you hear me?

398
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,260
I heard you.

399
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,330

408
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,570
So you heard everything I said earlier?

409
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,830
I wasn't the only person who heard what you said.

410
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,620
The whole street heard you. You can't go back on your promise.

♫  The hint of fate was already present  ♫

412
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,270
I just went out for a walk.

413
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,300
♫  Resting against each other in sleep that dark night  ♫

414
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,730
What do you mean, you went for a walk? You were out for so long.

415
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,790
You left so suddenly and didn't give any notice.

416
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,920
Not having a phone is really inconvenient.

417
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,680
I am truly a little...

418
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,600
short of  money.

419
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,320
- Where did you get the money to buy so much RIO wine coolers? 
 - I picked them up.

420
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,060
No way! You can even pick up money while going for a walk? Where's the money?

421
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,300
I spent it all.

422
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,780
You spent it all?

423
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,590
Then, what if they come to square accounts with you?

424
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,990
Don't I still have you?

425
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,060
Am I your ATM machine?

426
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,600
Let's go home.

427
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,850
If you weren't asleep, why didn't you make a sound?

428
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,270
I just wanted to see what you'd do to me in the middle of the night instead of sleeping.

429
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,890
What would I do to you?

430
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,310
There's no need for you to worry about that.

431
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,950
Drink together?

432
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,680
This is mine.

433
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,080
Impressive.

434
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,810
In the future, let me help you with any physical tasks like opening bottles.

435
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,620
Okay.

436
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,140
Then in the future, physical tasks like household chores

437
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,490
will also be left for you to do, how's that?

438
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,610
I've noticed that you're getting more and more arrogant.

439
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you need me to remind you who the creditor is?

440
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm only making a joke.

441
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,630
Just casual talk.

442
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,270
Although after enough time, this angry bird look of yours

443
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,710
is actually quite cute.

444
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,000
Who's angry?

445
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,460
 Just always stay by my side like this.

446
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,590

447
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,620
