1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,450
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,580
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,520
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,270
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,150
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,290
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,620
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,520
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,070
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,230
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,750
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,290
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,550
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,110
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,510
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,260
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,360
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,000
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,630

21
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,250

22
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,660
 Your transfer of assets was illegal.

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,890
 If I take this risk and let you become the largest shareholder,

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,790
 would you still keep your word and put the promised shares under my name?

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,160
 Of course, I would be willing.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,120
 Then sign an official transfer of equity.

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,820
- My feelings for you are sincere! 
 -  Only if she disappears completely,

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,480
 can our Xin'er's past actions never be discovered.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,500
Baby, I'm doing this all for your sake.

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,410
For my sake?

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,900
Are you doing this for my sake or for your own?

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,670
You hid this from me for so many years.

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,940
Only today did I find out I was the perpetrator!

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,480
 Give us an explanation, won't you?

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,260
Young President Ling! Young President Ling!

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,440
- What is the meaning of that recording? 
 - Did you and your mother-in-law really transfer the Ling Group's assets?

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Did you really cause your brother's death for the sake of Miss Gu?

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,140
All of you, shut up! The recording was forged.

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,610
It was all nonsense.

40
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,700
Even now, are you still going to lie?

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,640
What's the situation?

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,070
I assume everyone is really curious as to how I am here.

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,840
This is my engagement party. As an irrelevant person, you'd best leave now.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,130
I don't dare to be an irrelevant person.

45
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,260
I'm just here to return the truth to everyone.

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,430
While I'm at it, I can also ask all of the shareholders.

47
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,630
Can you feel at ease entrusting the company

48
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,170
to a person who used despicable means to be promoted?

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,310
When we talk about despicable, isn't the faking of your own death more jaw-dropping?

50
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,630
- The person who wanted to kill others to keep a secret... 
 - Kill others?

51
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,130
If you want to slap such a huge crime on me, where's the evidence? Creating rumors requires evidence.

52
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,640
Things have already developed to this point,

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,580
but you still want to cover things up and create falsities?

54
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,400
Ling Yue, I can also forge a recording like this.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,960
Father is currently in a critical state. In the end, he ordered

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,930
that he wished the person who would control the company shares and power to be me.

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,090
Everyone here is very wise.

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,130
And you are all clear on my father's wishes.

59
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,180
All of you elected me in becoming the person in charge of the company.

60
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,380
As for you, what do you have?

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,720
What will you use to contend with me?

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,970
 Old Chairman Ling is here! Old Chairman Ling!

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,190
 Dad!

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,490
- Hurry! Quickly! Let's take pictures over there! 
 - Got it.

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,610
Dad? How come you've awakened?

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,060
If I had waited even longer to wake up, the youngest son I doted on most would've hidden the truth from everyone

67
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,250
and ruined the foundation I spent most of my life fighting for.

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,810
Most doted on?

69
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,490
In my opinion, I was the one most despised, least regarded!

70
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,240
Dad, it's been 20 years. Why?

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,290
Why did that Ling Yue get to take good care of your business,

72
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,780
while I, Ling Sheng, am only a prodigal son who does nothing but squanders your foundation's wealth? Why does Ling Yue, the adopted child,

73
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,560
have the qualifications to inherit your company while I, Ling Sheng...

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,700
- can only be like any irrelevant, random person who has to rely on your mercy to live! 
 - Shut up!

75
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,780
You unfilial son.

76
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,730
If you keep speaking impertinently, I won't be polite to you anymore.

77
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,100
Impolite? Go ahead.

78
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,030
You can all treat me impolitely, but you must get this straight.

79
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,060
In this company, I'm the one with the most shares.

80
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,990
This company is mine! No one can change that!

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,710
Ling Sheng,

82
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,990
you are the youngest child in our family,

83
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,560
so everyone prefers to give their love to you,

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,780
but I didn't realize that it spoiled you into this,

85
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,800
rendering you to being unable to know right from wrong, causing you to hurt your brothers

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,070
to fulfill your selfishness.

87
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,230
How can you do this, my child?

88
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,040
Everyone.

89
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,660
Today, I, Ling Tian, solemnly announce

90
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,890
I will be transferring 20% of the shares in my hands

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,130
to Ling Yue unconditionally.

92
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,440
Although it cannot compare to the 30% of shares in the hands of this unfilial son,

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,200
but the will of the people doesn't rely on how many shares we have.

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,710
Rather, it relies on whether we can win others over by virtue.

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,050
I also have 10%. I will transfer all of it to Ling Yue.

96
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,180
Now, Ling Yue has 30%.

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,620
Brother, are you crazy?

98
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,940
- You're giving your shares to that adopted son? 
 - Ling Sheng!

99
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,310
He is like you. You are both my younger brothers.

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,660
Turn back.

101
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,310
Let me tell you! From the start, I never planned on turning back.

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,570
Fine. Now, we have an equal amount of shares.

103
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,210
Dad, you see, you're already quite old.

104
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,850
Your health is weak. Why not entrust the company to me?

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,960
You're so blinded by greed.

106
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,720
There's no way I'd entrust the company to you.

107
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,780
Fine.

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,690
Then allow all of the shareholders here today to vote.

109
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,430
Who leaves and who stays,

110
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,380
the result will naturally be seen by everyone.

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,960
No need!

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,130
Gu Anxin, you're an outsider. You have no right to speak here.

113
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,140
I have company shares, and I also count as one of its shareholders.

114
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,700
I have 5% of the shares that Uncle Ling gave my mother.

115
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,060
If we add my 5%, we have more right to speak than you do. Is that not right?

116
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,330
Just a measly 5%?

117
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,800
All of the shareholders here have a combined total of 20%.

118
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,940
Not to mention we have already reached a consensus.

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,890
We have made a better plan for Ling Group's future.

120
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,680
You don't need to feel regret over it.

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,450
After all, if it was in your hands, Ling Group would only continue its habit, walking itself step-by-step into ruin.

122
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,080
Leaving it to me is the best option.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,780
Ling Yue, help me up.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,490
Shareholders.

125
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,860
I, Ling Tian, have a few things to say to everyone.

126
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,120
You have all been with me from when I had nothing

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,780
and started creating my business and working hard.

128
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,260
You are the friends who accompanied me each step of the way until today.

129
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,360
I, Ling Tian, dragged you all into this turmoil due to my inability to educate my son properly.

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,910
I, Ling Tian, offer everyone a bow of apology.

131
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,120
Today's Ling Group

132
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,750
is definitely not mine alone.

133
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,960
It relied on everyone's collective hard work to lay down each brick

134
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,250
and build it together.

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,410
I believe many shareholders here

136
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,970
have a passion for Ling Group

137
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,260
that might even surpass my own.

138
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,650
Thus, everyone understands that at this critical moment,

139
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,550
what it is that the Ling Group needs

140
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,440
most.

141
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,530
I hope everyone can do as they've always done and make your most wise decision.

142
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,310
For everyone's shared company.

143
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,370
I, Ling Tian, thank everyone.

144
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,880
I... support Ling Yue!

145
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,120
I also support Ling Yue.

146
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,430
- Me too. 
 - Me too.

147
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,870
- I also support Ling Yue. 
 - Me too.

148
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,140
 - Me too. 
 - Me too.

149
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,090
 I support Ling Yue.

150
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,440
 I also support Ling Yue.

151
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,750
 - I support Ling Yue. 
 - I support Ling Yue.

152
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,640
 I also support Ling Yue.

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,680
I support President Ling Yue!

154
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,280
I support President Ling Yue!

155
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,250
 And me!

156
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,810
 I also support Ling Yue.

157
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,210
 - Me too. 
 - Me too.

158
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,030
 I also support Ling Yue.

159
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,740
 - I also support Ling Yue. 
- I also support Ling Yue.

160
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,250
 As do I.

161
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,170
 - I support Ling Yue. 
 - I support Ling Yue.

162
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,030
 I also do. I support Ling Yue.

163
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,660
 - I support Ling Yue. 
 - I also support Ling Yue.

164
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,330
 - And me. 
 - I also support him.

165
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,730
 - And me. 
 - I also support him.

166
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,620
 - And me. 
 - And me.

167
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,290
 - I support Ling Yue. 
 - I support Ling Yue.

168
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,770
What a good performance.

169
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,330
You prepared this long ago, didn't you?

170
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,220
You could only be content once you've completely ruined me?

171
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,320
Ling Yue, you're ruthless enough. I lost.

172
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,910
Why couldn't it have been me?

173
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,080
Child, turn back.

174
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,960
Xiao Sheng, we already reported your previous actions

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,220
to the police. If you admit your crime, there's still time.

176
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,150

177
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,880
Brother! How is he?

178
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,890
Dad's CT scan showed a brain tumor.

179
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,730
They're now giving emergency treatment inside.

180
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,330
Brain tumor? How can that be?

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,030
It's all my fault. I was only worrying about Xin'er's and Mom's situation.

182
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,530
I didn't even notice that Dad is now...

183
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,510
It's all my fault.

184
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,220
Brother, don't put too much blame on yourself.

185
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,120
No one wanted something like this to happen.

186
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,580
Then what about Xin'er?

187
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
Xin'er is currently being investigated by the police.

188
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,800
My mom, she... she couldn't take all this news at once. She is also being hospitalized now.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,560
The police said that once she is more stable, they will continue the investigation.

190
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,620
Doctor, how is he?

191
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,550
- Mr. Gu's surgery was very successful. However, he will experience after-effects. 
 - After-effects?

192
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,290
It's because this brain tumor was pressing against his cranial nerve for a long time.

193
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,690
Mr. Gu's hippocampus and sebum

194
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,300
have atrophied. To be precise, Mr. Gu has developed Alzheimer's.

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,320
It's what we commonly call senile dementia.

196
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Of course.

197
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,380
Don't worry. It's okay.

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,920
We'll find a way together, okay?

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,190
I never even got to tell him the truth.

200
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,230
Now he won't have me in his memories anymore.

201
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,770
Then we'll spend time with him so his present memories are all good ones.

202
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,550
Mom, I came to see you.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
I talked with the doctor. Dad has recovered very well.

204
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,620
He'll be able to leave the hospital at the end of the month.

205
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,250
Mom, the police will come soon.

206
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,920
They hope that we will cooperate in their investigation.

207
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,460
Mom.

208
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,350
I don't know where you started to go wrong.

209
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,260
But from now on, let's return to the right path.

210
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,960
Okay?

211
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay?

212
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,890
The food has gotten cold.

213
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll go heat it up for you again.

214
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,920
I've heard that in life, there are two kinds of people that you must never forget.

215
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,770
One kind is those who have helped me,

216
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,730
and the other kind is those who forced me into dire straits.

217
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,290
But I don't know why I met both kinds of people

218
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,120
in the same person.

219
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,160
How much I hate you is how quickly I hope you get better.

220
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,460
I want to hear you personally explain to me why you treated me like this.

221
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,920
If a person's reason for hurting another is so hard to decipher,

222
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,600
why did you make the decision so quickly back then?

223
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,230
I shouldn't have to tell you

224
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,860
where to go next, right?

225
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,800
Why don't you just punish me directly?

226
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,100
The police and the law will punish you.

227
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,720
But it's a waste of your talent.

228
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,290
Then are you not afraid I'll run?

229
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,920
Up to now, I, Brother Wu, have never misjudged anyone.

230
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,130

231
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,120
When you come out, call me.

232
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,030
Barring unforeseen circumstances, I'll still be here in 80 years.

233
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,270
I just hope that your skills will be used on the right path.

234
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,860

235
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,330
Everything Dad can remember now is from his youth.

236
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,730
By the way, I've already dealt with deferring my studies.

237
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,190
In a couple of days, the approval will be issued.

238
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,110
Our family can't be without me right now, nor can the Gu Group.

239
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,460
I can't have both my career and my education after all.

240
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,630
Actually, I can take care of Dad.

241
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,960
Right now, I only care that Dad's lifelong effort and career will be carried on.

242
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,360
My mom's situation isn't too optimistic either.

243
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,660
I also want to spend more time with her.

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,360
To be honest, if you asked me to forgive her now,

245
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,230
it's not very probable.

246
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,590
But it's all passed now.

247
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,530
I also hope she can start over.

248
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,560
Right. Your room has already been rearranged to your past habits from when you lived there.

249
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,960
You will always have a home here.

250
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,170
I will fulfill my duties as your brother to the end.

251
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,930
Xin'er.

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,930
Sister.

253
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,640
I'll go get you both something to drink.

254
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,600
How are you?

255
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,130
Everything's fine.

256
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,300
I've explained everything.

257
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,600
What happened with Yu Guo was my fault. I will take responsibility.

258
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm sorry.

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,430
In truth, I should have said that long ago.

260
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,270
It's just that I always relied on my parents spoiling me.

261
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,360
I took it for granted.

262
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,500
My sense of infallibility

263
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,030
and narrow-minded selfishness

264
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,460
hurt you and Yu Guo

265
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,700
in ways that can never be remedied,

266
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,400
no matter how much I apologize or how remorseful I feel.

267
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,350
From now on, each time you call me "Sister,"

268
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,280
it will cancel out 10 apologies. That effective immediately.

269
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,220
I hope we can both live the lives we want.

270
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,620
Okay.

271
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,840
Sister.

272
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,510
Dad.

273
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,790
You're back.

274
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,430
Dad, how's your health?

275
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,640
Do you want to go to the hospital again and check it out?

276
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,560
My health...

277
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,280
I know it well.

278
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,020
It's fine.

279
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm sorry, Dad.

280
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,140
Since he was young, Ling Sheng

281
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,980
grew up pampered by the entire family.

282
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,560
He surely was spoiled rotten.

283
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,170
If he had only coveted the family fortune,

284
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,510
I wouldn't treat him unfairly,

285
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
but now that he's done these acts against the heavens and against reason,

286
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,050
like his plot to murder a family member,

287
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,200
I can't forgive him for that.

288
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Dad, I think my little brother is still young.

289
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,620
As long as he is truly remorseful,

290
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,660
there's still time for everything.

291
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,740
I used to always think

292
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,820
the men in the Ling family should be encouraged to teach their young to be like wolves,

293
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,460
that they should be cultivated to be vigilant at all times and conscious of competition.

294
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,630
But the result? The opposite of what I wanted.

295
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,300
My education for him truly was useless.

296
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,690
All of this...

297
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,500
is the result of my incompetence as a father.

298
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,390
Dad.

299
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,180
In our hearts,

300
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,470
you're a great father.

301
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,030
You've always been.

302
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,100
Do you see? Evaluate the renovation style.

303
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,560
I designed it. Hasn't the old man's office become completely new-looking?

304
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,250
Look here. I chose these photographs.

305
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,850
Aren't they interesting?

306
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,960
I don't think they'll do.

307
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,690
Wait. You haven't even taken office yet,

308
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,590
yet you're putting on airs for me?

309
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,220
What I mean is that this doesn't belong to me.

310
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,720
What are you saying?

311
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
Eldest Brother, I'm handing it to you now.

312
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,180
Dad already said that the group is yours to manage.

313
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,730
Besides, I've already reserved my tickets for touring the world.

314
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,600
You're just disturbing my carefree rhythm.

315
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,920
The person Ling Group needs more is you.

316
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,350
Dad just said that he was giving this to me to manage, but I'm the one who decides how it gets managed.

317
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,720
So, I'll leave Ling Group to you.

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,710
What about you?

319
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,970
I'm establishing a 5G logistics warehouse and realizing the Sky Soar plan.

320
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,840
I will create a New Way that will bring people better lives.

321
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,350
That's my goal and my ideal.

322
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,360
- I regret this.  
 - Regret what?

323
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,490
You should've said this earlier! I renovated this to your favorite style!

324
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,840
Look at those photographs behind you. I'll be facing them every day as I work.

325
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,640
Where will I get my inspiration?

326
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,280
My style?

327
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,740
What is wrong with your aesthetic?

328
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,520
Welcome to your employment at our Galaxy Cool Man studio.

329
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,400
There are a few requirements I need to make clear to you beforehand.

330
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,540
This is a very fashionable company.

331
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,050
And it's a very strict company.

332
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,600
- In pursuit of a culture of overtime work. 
 - A wolf-like philosophy.

333
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,460
- No days off. 
 - Awaiting orders 24 hours a day.

334
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,000
- No procrastination on drawings. 
 - Unlimited revisions.

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,100
A soulless clock-in machine.

336
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,840
You can't be carefree like the wind!

337
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Did we scare you?

338
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,450
All that was just nonsense.

339
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,850
We actually have a very relaxed work atmosphere.

340
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,080
Our mission is to create joy within.

341
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,860
Okay, you're off work for today.

342
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,830
When you come to work tomorrow, you'll understand after experiencing it.

343
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,510

344
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,710

345
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,780
The follow-up purpose and plans

346
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,980
will be expanded as soon as possible.

347
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,450
I'm actually more curious about your plans with Anxin for the future.

348
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,890
Is this your brotherly concern?

349
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,140
As a brother who once loved her and will always love her in the future.

350
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,580
That makes me feel quite threatened.

351
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,410
A little sense of danger isn't a bad thing.

352
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,380
Don't worry. Anxin is the person I love.

353
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,300
And she's my family.

354
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,070
What are you doing?

355
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,460
Pretending to be proper and polite is so exhausting. And I don't even know how.

356
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,570
I already have a boss in the family. Can't I just illustrate my comic?

357
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,750
You'll learn over time. Artist Anxin,

358
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,440
our company's ancient-style comic, "I Accidentally Picked Up a Prince,"

359
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
already has its single volume edition in process.

360
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,580
But you have to change the name. The market already has many pirated copies with that name.

361
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,670
Disgusting.

362
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,550
Okay. Boss. Boss's wife.

363
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,110
Let this hard worker think about it back home, okay?

364
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,880
Good luck.

365
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,800
Look!

366
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Young Boss's Wife, is it time to go home?

367
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
I am considered one of the bosses here.

368
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,860
From what you say, you should be the young Boss's wife.

369
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,790

370
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,490

371
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,510
We're dating, not playing a video game that requires accomplishing monster-killing tasks to level up.

372
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,330
Work habit.

373
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,150
Actually,

374
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,420
we call this an intensive date,

375
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,680
but it's just with the intention of making up for lost time.

376
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,040
There are still a lot of things we haven't said

377
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,170
and a lot of things we haven't done.

378
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,460
Since that's the case, let's take it slowly.

379
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,370
After all, we still have a lot of time.

380
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,250
 My current state,

381
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,060
 you must be very disappointed.

382
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,790
 I'm very disappointed,

383
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,620
 but all of the worry

384
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,110
 and doubts in my heart

385
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,790
 have all fallen to the ground.

386
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,860
 It's so steady.

387
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,110
 I only have myself to blame for all of this.

388
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,470
You can begin a new life for yourself.

389
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,060
I won't continue bothering you or dragging you down.

390
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,550
 These days...

391
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,170
 I keep thinking back

392
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,080
to things that happened when we were young.

393
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,980
Those...

394
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,890
pure and blissful times,

395
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,410
when all we had to worry about was the homework we couldn't finish

396
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,310
 and the exams we had.

397
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,800
 I would also think about how

398
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,800
hypothetically, if everything could be relived,

399
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
 If the person I had met first had been you,

400
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,200
 would everything have been different?

401
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,500
 I'm sorry.

402
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
 I can finally understand you

403
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,000
 and how you felt at the time.

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
 You wouldn't understand.

405
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,800
 How could I not understand?

406
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,700
 Haven't I always been waiting for someone?

407
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,800
Waking up in the early morning every day,

408
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
there are things to be done,

409
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
places to go,

410
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,200
 and a person who needs me, waiting for me.

411
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,800
 How is it that you can always show up on time whenever I'm feeling down?

412
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,500
 I want to know if he's living well,

413
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,200
I want to resolve his worries for him.

414
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
 I want him to be able to have no more concerns

415
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
 and to have no more need to fear.

416
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I also hope that every day,

417
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
 he can be very carefree

418
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,500
 and happy. I hope that he can smile as much as he wishes.

419
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,010
 Did you know?

420
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,000
 To me, these things

421
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,380
 bring me the most happiness now.

422
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm not worthy of giving you happiness.

423
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,250
I also don't hope

424
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
 that after you see my ugly past,

425
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,400
 you still choose to stand by my side.

426
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
 Anyway,

427
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 in the times we were together,

428
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
 I was already so happy.

429
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
Ling Sheng!

430
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
 Look.

431
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,850
I've already made my preparations.

432
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
I will repay all of those days you waited for me alone

433
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,200
 with the rest of my life.

434
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,000
 I also hope there will be a day where you will turn back and look at me.

435
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,000
 As long as you nod once,

436
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,400
 I can also accelerate my pace and run to you like mad.

437
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,600
 To me, Xin'er is just like the moon in the sky.

438
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,600
 Wonderful, luminous.

439
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 In order to get closer to her,

440
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,800
 I prepared for many, many years.

441
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,100
 Now, I am finally standing by her side

442
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,400
 and holding her hand.

443
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
 Smiling with her,

444
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,500
 crying together, and growing old together.

445
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,800
 Whenever, I think about this,

446
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,600
 I feel like I'm happier than any person in the world.

447
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,400
 And I will definitely bring her happiness.

448
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,300
So don't make me wait too long.

449
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,600
Did you sign the Super Topic today?

450
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,000
I did... probably?

451
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Did you remember the iron law of fandoms I explained to you yesterday?

452
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
I memorized them. Establish terms of endearment, make sure the fandom color doesn't clash with another's, have the beginning and end of supporting times last in short bursts,

453
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
we cannot force the creation of couples ships, we must prevent rubbing off another fandom's popularity,

454
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,600
if we are being rubbed off of, we must not be soft on them, and the people who change their fandom but not their username...

455
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,700
You are an extraordinary talent and a fandom miracle!

456
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,000
Enough, Anxin, stop taking pictures! You're already pretty enough.

457
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,200
I wasn't taking pictures! I was checking whether there were any vegetables in my teeth and things like that.

458
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm a public figure, after all. Check out my smile!

459
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,600
Good, my big star.

460
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Your mission for today is to finish signing all of them.

461
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,700
For these, the ones that are signed don't have a discount, but the ones that aren't signed do.

462
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,600
For every additional signed copy, we earn an extra ¥9.63.

463
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,400
Then I understand. Even if I don't eat or drink, I must finish signing them all.

464
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Sister.

465
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Xin'er?

466
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
Congratulations on selling your new book.

467
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Congratulations to you as well. I saw the news.

468
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,300
Cai Niao Posting Station has officially launched a new product-fetching capability

469
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
and won the best new logistics technology award. Congratulations.

470
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
That's many thanks to Brother Ling Yue's technological support.

471
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
What could he have helped with?

472
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,200
Your station is now blossoming everywhere, and it's so large-scale

473
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,600
because you have enough ability.

474
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,400
By the way, have you read it? Do you have any precious advice?

475
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,240
I read all your comic.

476
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,100
Did you model a character after me?

477
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,000
Thank you for giving her such a wonderful ending.

478
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,100
The you in real life also deserves to be loved.

479
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Wait for me.

480
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,500
- Take one with you. 
 - Okay.

481
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,570
 Anxin, after arriving at the airport, President Ling suddenly disappeared.

482
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,600
 The company originally had a business meeting, but now we can't get in contact with him at all.

483
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,000
 Look and see if there's anywhere you can find him.

484
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
Got it. I'll look right now.

485
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:07,090
I have an emergency, you guys stay... stay here.

486
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,800
Ling Yue! Ling Yue, are you home?

487
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
Ling Yue!

488
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,300
 Better.

489
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,000
You better be all right. Otherwise, you're going to be in big trouble.

490
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,600
Miss, our nearby supermarket has a raffle event.

491
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,200
Come on. Pick one. Come on.

492
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,600
- Pick one. 
 - No need. I'm busy.

493
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,200
- Pick one. 
 - I really am busy!

494
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,100
Pick one. Just pick one.

495
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank you.

496
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400

It is worth ¥888. Congratulations!

503
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
¥888?

504
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
How coincidental.

505
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I actually do have an emergency, I'm leaving now.

506

That's great!

507
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,600
There was a gentleman who told me that if you aren't willing to go with me,

508
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,800
I should put this package in your hands.

509
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
What package?

510
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
My little motorcycle?

514
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,000
 Please punctually deliver yourself to the arranged destination.

515
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,300
How am I supposed to know where that is?

Ling Yue!

529
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,600
Ling Yue!

530
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,880
Gu Anxin.

531
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,360
Where did you run off to?

532
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,170
I was so worried.

533
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,660
I have something I want to tell you.

534
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,400
What is it?

535
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,590
I want to tell you that I'm not someone who likes unforeseen circumstances.

536
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,190
So I always take every precaution when doing anything.

537
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,200
Just like you said, I'm like an armadillo.

538
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,240
All of a sudden,

539
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,740
it was the first time in my life that any person had ever made me feel

540
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,940
I was so unprepared.

541
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,460
This person is you.

542
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,670
When we were little, we brushed past each other because of an unforeseen circumstance.

543
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,000
 Go!

544
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,600
 Xiao Maodou, I will come back to find you.

545
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,120
After growing up, we met again because of an unforeseen circumstance.

546
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,720
 Wake up!

547
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,750
But I really treasure these unforeseen circumstances.

548
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,240
I think that perhaps all of my preparations

549
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,470
were just to encounter you again.

550
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,700
After being with you, I did some

551
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,510
things I'd never done before.

552
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,670
 In the future, can you research some more food?

553
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,130
 Then in the future, I'll cook for you every day.

554
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,880
 Your so-called honorability

555
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,220
 neglected all of my efforts.

556
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,570
 Everything I did was for your sake. Do you have to get so mad at me?

557
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,980
 I shouldn't have interfered with your affairs without permission. These were all actions of disrespect.

558
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,820
 I thought I was doing it all for your sake.

559
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,460
 But I never asked you what you needed.

560
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,970
 I won't interfere with your affairs in the future.

561
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,130
 I will love you in the way you hope for.

562
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,310
 Are you willing to give me some more time to learn how?

563
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,490
No matter what difficulties I face,

564
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,640
as long as it's to protect you, I am filled with courage.

565
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,500
If it's okay, I'm willing to use all of my life

566
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,280
to protect you.

567
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,760
 Are you okay? Don't worry.

568
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,740
 Ling Yue, be careful!

569
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,710
This courage is from you. You, the one who says, "no problem" under any circumstance.

570
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,710
Because as long as I have you by my side, I feel very at ease.

571
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,580
 Then again, after a while, this angry bird look of yours

572
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,530
 seems pretty cute.

573
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,250
 Nonsense.

574
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,130
So,

575
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,750
Miss Gu Anxin,

576
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,250
will you marry me?

Go down a little.

That's right.

613
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,530
This is greater than or equal to.

614

Yes.

Xiao Ji? Xiao Li?

619
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,520
Why do you want to choose such basic names?

620
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,800
How are they basic?

621
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,340
When Xiao Ji and Xiao Li grow up, they will become Da Ji, Da Li. 
  (T/N: "Da" means big, "Da Ji, Da Li" is an idiom that means good luck and prosperity)

00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:32,010
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

636
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:38,150
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

637
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,630
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

638
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:50,590
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

639
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:56,540
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

640
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,680
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

641
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,940
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

642
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,030
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

643
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,370
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

644
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,960
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫

645
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,970
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
