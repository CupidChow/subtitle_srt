2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,470
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,600
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,120
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,310
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,620
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,450
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,100
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,200
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,750
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,270
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,520
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,660
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,170
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,130
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,370

20
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,210

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,820
Recently, it's true that some bad things have happened at Ling Group.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,070
Thank you all for your trust in me.

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,860
I will definitely take on the responsibility of the president

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,680
and lead Ling Group to the future!

25
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,620
 I do not accept!

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,370
 - It's Ling Yue! 
 - Yes, it's him.

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,800
 - It's really Ling Yue!  
 - It's Second Brother!

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,470
Dad, Second Brother is alive!

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,370
Second Brother, you're finally back!

30
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,310
We missed you like crazy, didn't we?

31
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,260
Dad.

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,400
Your leg injury isn't severe, is it?

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,670
It's not. The doctor said some rest will heal it.

34
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,140
You just said you didn't accept, didn't you?

35
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,190
Right.

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,640
Everyone thinks it's good. Your disagreement is useless!

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,500
Aren't I right, Little Brother?

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,330
I have enough supporters present here.

39
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,630
Your disapproval is useless. You can't take me down.

40
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,090
Look at this little brother of mine. He broke his leg

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,430
and even his head! Hilarious!

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,130
Tell everyone why you don't accept it.

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,580
Because this kind of business deal is destined for loss.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,840
Funds cannot be returned. Not only is it a failed plan,

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,470
it will eventually affect the development of the company's headquarters.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

47
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,860
- You're just a— 
 - Let him finish talking!

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,410
Luocheng does look like fertile land at first glance.

49
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,270
It is located in the East Asian monsoon region.

50
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,120
At its southeast corner is a heavy metal industrial field that's been established for decades.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Normally, it indeed doesn't cause much of a disturbance,

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,600
but every winter,

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,670
the factory emits large amounts of hazardous gas.

54
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,570
And due to the wind, it drifts towards Luocheng.

55
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,690
If you purchase this land, I'm sure everyone is clear about

56
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,210
what the outcome will be.

57
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,110
If that's true, wouldn't the property rot in our hands?

58
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,840
 - Yes. 
 - Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,030
Ling Fang, why is it that the environmental monitoring report

60
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,880
in your report says that

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,990
- there are no problems? 
 - Father.

62
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,050
Don't listen to his nonsense.

63
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,530
I've conducted an inspection across a radius of a dozen miles. There wasn't even a factory in sight.

64
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,060
You can't let him say whatever he wants, can you?

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,390
He has no evidence. He does e-commerce, what does he know?

66
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,360
What a coincidence. I just happen to have evidence.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Many years ago, when President Ling was looking for a location for the logistics warehouse, he considered Luocheng.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,490
This report not only shows the environmental monitoring report for a radius of ten miles, it even shows a hundred-mile radius.

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,620
Dad, listen to my explanation!

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,910
Why would I listen to your nonsense explanation?

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,050
You're eager for success and desperate for an achievement.

72
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,530
You don't even have any sense of foresight when making decisions!

73
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,320
What right do you have to be the president of the group?

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,110
Sorry, shareholders.

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,340
We took up too much of your time.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,300
Regarding the issue of Ling Fang

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,320
becoming Ling Group's president,

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,790
- I vote against. 
-  What are you saying, Dad?

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,810
I disagree, too.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,660
- Me too. 
 - As do I.

81
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,990
- I also am against it. 
 - I'm against.

82
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,210
- Against.  
 - I'm also against it.

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,350
- And me. 
 - Me too.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,420
Okay. The votes stand.

85
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,300
Meeting adjourned.

86
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,630
Luckily, Ling Yue made it back in time. Otherwise, we wouldn't even be able to measure the losses.

87
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,160
That's right. Luckily we found out quickly that he handled it so improperly.

88
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,370
You did this on purpose.

89
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,200
You purposely chose this time to come back to purposely make me look bad.

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,790
- I did do this on purpose. 
 - Why do you always ruin everything of mine?

91
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,750
Enough!

92
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,670
Do you need me to find the best doctor to take a look at your leg?

93
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,310
It's fine. I won't need it.

94
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,380
Stop acting so peculiar!

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,950
Who knows what your true intentions are.

96
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,380
You're the one with the impure intentions, aren't you,  Eldest Brother?

97
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,250
I just happen to want to ask, why do you always want me to die?

98
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,460
This was found from someone else's dashcam.

99
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,230
How will you explain this?

100
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,930
- How? 
 - Father, this is fake!

101
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,130
Bring that vehicle owner to me if you have any capability!

102
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,190
Shut up!

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,130
I will give you an explanation regarding this issue.

104
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,720
What have you been doing during this time?

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,170
Why was there no news?

106
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,630
- I had some things to take care of. 
 - What kinds of things

107
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,710
could be more important than that of the company's?

108
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Father, don't worry about this.

109
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,520
Isn't the most important thing that Second Brother came back safely?

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,790
Since he's back, let's let him continue to be the pres—

111
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,410
Shut up, you little brat!

112
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,590
Let the spot of the president

113
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,650
be empty for now.

114
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,450
Ling Yue, take this time

115
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,420
to rest up.

116
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,250
I will do as you say.

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,400
Ling Fang, you and that group of old things

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,100
are creating a small commotion behind my back.

119
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,620
Don't think I don't know.

120
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,140
That's why during this period of time, you'd best know your place.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,450
Behave yourself.

122
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,070
Do you think you've won?

123
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,410
It doesn't matter that you messed up my business. We're both the vice presidents right now.

124
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,120
We sit on an equal footing. The winner cannot be determined yet.

125
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,040
Eldest Brother, you're not my match.

126
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,580
Who are you looking down upon?

127
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,610
I don't care who the successor is.

128
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,280
I just don't want to be controlled by you.

129
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,100
So you want to control me?

130
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,410
- Eldest Brother! 
 - You don't care about the position of president?

131
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,890
- Eldest Brother! 
 - Ridiculous! Come over here! 
 - Eldest Brother, we're one family!

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,890
There must be a misunderstanding. Calm down.

133
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,280
Calm down.

134
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,280
You brat.

135
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,090
Second Brother,

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,150
looks like you're determined to make me your scapegoat.

137
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,710
You obviously know whether or not I've unfairly accused you, Eldest Brother.

138
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's see who's lying then.

139
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,950
Your leg is crippled, isn't it?

140
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,490
You really can't stand up anymore?

141
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,660
What? You don't trust me?

142
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,510
That girl is named Gu Anxin, right?

143
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,760
Don't look at me like that.

144
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,310
Why are you suddenly interested?

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,630
Don't think about doing anything to Anxin.

146
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,800
You care very much about her?

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,990
- It's none of your business! 
 - How is this none of my business? Did you forget?

148
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,600
Ever since we were young, I always made absolutely sure to steal everything you treasured most...

149
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,080
or ruin it.

150
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,470
- You wouldn't dare to. 
 - Why wouldn't I?

151
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,820
Unless you never meet her again,

152
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,300
I will definitely be able to find her.

153
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,570
Second Brother, are you okay?

154
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm fine.

155
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,600
Ai Li, did you borrow my car last time because you knew that

156
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
my dashcam showed Eldest Brother and the others

157
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,780
manipulating Second Brother's car?

158
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,980
On the day of President Ling's accident, we didn't see Director Ling Fang in the parking lot monitor.

159
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,930
But it just so happened that your car was there too,

160
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,070
so I thought it might be a lead.

161
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,280
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

162
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,120
I didn't even know my car had such a thing.

163
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,220
That was my idea. It doesn't concern you.

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,750
I just didn't want to drag you into this.

165
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,010
Second Brother, we're all brothers.

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,390
Eldest Brother just lost himself for a moment.

167
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,550
He wouldn't want to do harm to you.

168
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,570
You don't have to worry.

169
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,470
I will handle it.

170
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,700
President Ling, is your leg okay?

171
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,200
I didn't think that bastard would go so far.

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Then, should I send you to Miss Anxin's house?

173
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,400
We can't go back there. Knowing Ling Fang,

174
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
as soon as he grabs hold of a lead, he won't let it go so easily.

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
Since you've already been followed,

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,400
if we go back to Anxin's house, we won't be able to hide her.

177
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm sorry. I failed my duty.

178
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
For the time being, protect Anxin well.

179
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't let Ling Fang become aware until the matter is over.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Understood.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,800
 Excuse me. What is your friend's name?

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
 Next time, invent a name before you come.

183
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,200
 I have some issues on my end. Once I've dealt with them, I'll come and find you.

184
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Xiao Ba?

185
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,800
 Hello, is this Miss Gu Anxin?

186
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
 Congratulations! You've won a prize.

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,300
 The prize is to enjoy a set of undergarments worth ¥288!

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,200
 Please provide your chest, waist, and hip measurements.

189
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I don't like to wear undergarments.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,700
However, my good friend Youyou likes them.

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,800
Send them to her. Her chest measurement is 36A.

192
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,810
 Hey! I'm clearly a 36D.

193
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,200
 Gu Anxin! You've ruined my good reputation.

194
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm not in the mood to talk.

195
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,000
 Let Xiao Ba come and cure you. Where is he?

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,100
 Xiao Ba! Say something!

197
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,760
 Don't hide on the side in silence. I know you're there.

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,300
He—

199
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
 Xiao Ba!

200
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,700
 I didn't hear anything.

201
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,100
♫  But I've already started to miss you  ♫

202
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,100
♫   Hugging you like owning the whole world  ♫

203
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,000
♫   Too beautiful that I fear time is limited  ♫

204
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,200
♫    Promises are too superficial   ♫

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,600
 You're so big, but that's all wasted. You're afraid of cockroaches.

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,600
 Why are you looking at me?

207
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,300
 No reason.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,700
 How about I gift them to you?

209
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,000
 In the future, I'll help you with physical tasks like opening cans.

210
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 Stop fooling around,  give it to me!

211
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,700
 What do you want to do, leaning so close to me?

212
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,600
♫   Let the eyes of time be our witness   ♫

213
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,200
♫   for the words, "I do"  ♫

214
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,700
 Fine.

215
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,500
 Then it's a promise. Seal it.

216
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,200
 Anxin? Are you still listening?

217
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
 Is the connection bad?

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,400
He left.

219
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,400

220
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,200
 President Ling, the meeting with Director Chen is at 10:00 a.m.

221
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Got it. Go ahead and arrange it.

222
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,900

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
33 computers.

224
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,300
Anxin, you're still here?

225
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
You should hurry home. The company's new system doesn't allow overtime work.

226
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll be done very soon.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're taking the company bus, right? It's available before 10:00 p.m.

228
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,000
When did the company become so generous?

229
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,500
I don't know either. It's like there's a new person in charge.

230
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
- I'm going now. Bye. 
 - Bye.

231
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
 Anxin!

232
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,670
 How come you're here?

233
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I came out for a walk.

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
 You can't stand and you still want to go for a walk?

235
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,200
 Let's go home.

236
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,500
♫   I've just gotten used to you giving me consolation first  ♫

237
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,800
♫  Those times we want to wipe away tears  ♫

238
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,000
♫  Those times we withdrew our hands  ♫

239
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,200
♫  No need for right and wrong in a relationship, how dull  ♫

240

♫  Gaze at me, don't avoid me  ♫

♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

♫  Let me try to touch your hard shell  ♫

243
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,800
♫  Hugging the fragility  ♫

244
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,000
♫  Hold me gently  ♫

♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,800
♫  Memories are like heavy rain. 
Having never walked through it,  ♫

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,000
♫  how would you understand?  ♫

248
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,000
♫  Gaze at me, don't avoid me  ♫

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,100

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I have already increased the security there according to your instructions.

256
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,100
♫  Hold me gently  ♫

257
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,200

258
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,800
♫  Memories are like heavy rain. Having never walked through it, how would you understand?  ♫

259
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,100
President  Ling, I'm worried Miss Anxin will blame you.

260
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,400
At least she doesn't have to tread into these muddied waters.

261
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,710
Xin'er, look! Who's that?

262
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,660
I heard Ling Yue just escaped death

263
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,440
and is already burying himself in work. He's really going all out.

264
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,110
I heard his leg's crippled.

265
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,500
Let's not talk about this. Xin'er, how is your company coming along?

266
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,520
- How much is Uncle Gu deciding to invest? 
 - It's his own daughter!

267
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,820
She'll get however much she wants, right?

268
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,980
Angela, let me get off at that intersection there.

269
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,780
What's wrong?

270
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,860
I might have caught a cold and don't feel very well. I don't want to drink today.

271
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,990
It's so late now, and it's very unsafe.

272
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,390
Don't worry. My driver will come and pick me up immediately.

273
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,940
You two go ahead and have fun!

274
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,760
Then send me a message when you're home. Bye-bye!

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,230
Bye-bye!

276
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,080
I wonder whether I could have the honor of being this lovely fairy lady's driver?

277
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,240
What a coincidence!

278
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,770
It is and isn't a coincidence.

279
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,320
I was originally planning a "chance" encounter.

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,220

281
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,190
How about it? Are you getting in?

282
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,890
You're awake?

283
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,510
Why did you bring me here?

284
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,460
Whenever I feel down

285
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,980
or have something I can't come to terms with, I always come here to get some air.

286
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,610
Then, my mood improves. You can also try it.

287
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,340
Do I look like I'm in a bad mood?

288
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,160
Do you think you look like you're in a good mood?

289
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,750
How am I that ugly?

290
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,900
It's just that you're prettier when you smile.

291
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,530
Thank you.

292
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,420
It feels so nice.

293
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,970
You'll never go wrong listening to me.

294
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,920
You usually look like such an optimistic and carefree person. Do you also have worries?

295
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,080
I only appear carefree.

296
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,840
Think about it. I have two brothers who fight all day.

297
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,930
How carefree could I, a pond fish, be?

298
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,370
I heard... Ling Yue came back?

299
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,880
The internet must be frantically spreading the news about my second brother.

300
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,670
The media has yet to actually catch a real photo of him.

301
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,190
But everyone says he... says his leg—

302
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,670
They say my second brother's leg is crippled, don't they?

303
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,010
Don't listen to their nonsense. My second brother's leg is indeed injured,

304
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,950
but he's been recovering all this time. It will definitely get better.

305
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,280
Xin'er, don't worry.

306
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,360
Second Brother can always turn misfortune into good fortune. This time will be no different.

307
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,540
His injuries... are they serious?

308
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,950
Honestly, I'm not clear on it either.

309
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,440
Ever since Second Brother came back, he's locked himself inside the house.

310
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,680
He doesn't interact with anyone and devotes himself wholeheartedly into his work.

311
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,610
I think this matter really impacted him greatly.

312
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,770
He is so prideful, but now he's like this.

313
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,700
However, I believe he will definitely get better.

314
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,920
Because he is Ling Yue.

315
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,070
There is nothing that can knock him down.

316
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,850
Xin'er,

317
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,080
you still care about my Second Brother that much?

318
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,940
How can I forget so many years of feelings so easily?

319
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,980

320
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,920
All right, then I will place it in the To-Be-Received cabinet for you.

321
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,490
You're welcome.

322
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,480
Thank you for your call. If you have time, please rate my service.

323
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,110
- All right. 
 - Look!

324
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,580
So handsome!

325
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,710
Thank you.

326
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,050
Brother?

327
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,290
I'm sorry. I arrived late.

328
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,210
- What sort of charm does this Gu Anxin have? 
 - I know right...

329
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,640
The pond's so large, but why does she get to be the mermaid?

330
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,800
Perhaps that's just fate.

331
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,780
Today, we're all lemon fairies. 
  (T/N: It means that they feel "sour" and jealous)

332
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,520
Brother, why did you suddenly come back?

333
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,630
I should have come back earlier.

334
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,460
You've experienced so many things. Why didn't you tell me?

335
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,170
What things?

336
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,980
How long are you planning to keep the fact that you dropped out of school from me?

337
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,190
How did you know?

338
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,030
We've video-called so many times and sent so many emails.

339
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,810
You've always told me things are good, everything is good...

340
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,700
Look at you now. I can't help but worry about you.

341
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm all right, Brother. I'm actually living very well right now. You don't have to worry.

342
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,530
Give me your hand.

343
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,520
Look into my eyes.

344
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,210
You think I don't understand you? You've been like this since childhood.

345
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,730
No matter what wrongs you suffered or difficulties you experienced,

346
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,650
you just like to suppress them all in your heart.

347
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,140
Your only fear was causing trouble for others by telling them.

348
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,860
I'm not just anyone. I'm your brother.

349
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,820
Your brother is back. From now on, you won't ever feel wronged.

350
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,790
You don't need to pretend to be strong in front of me

351
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,220
or pretend to be sensible, all right?

352
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,570
This ice cream has made my teeth hurt.

353
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,640
It's all right. Don't cry. Your brother is back.

354
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,580
From now on, I won't let anyone bully you.

355
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,360
Right, Brother,

356
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,540
I only asked for a half-hour off, so I might need to get back earlier.

357
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,310
Okay, I'll drop you off. We have time.

358
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,690
You insisted on eating ice cream. Now you're cold, aren't you?

359
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,120
No need, Brother! Your sister has a very strong body, and I'm not afraid at all!

360
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,940
What do you mean, "strong body"?

361
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,080
Look at you! You look like a small penguin.

362
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,980
If I had always been by your side, you wouldn't have suffered so much.

363
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,150
Look.

364
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,270
You've always been next to me, always been by my side.

365
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,930
 I dreamed that a strange auntie was in my room.

366
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,540
 Don't cry, I'm here.

367
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,370
 - What is this? 
 - It's a nightmare-filtering bracelet.

368
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,900
 As long as you wear it, it will eat all of your nightmares.

369
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,790
 Thank you, Brother!

370
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,470
- All right. Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

371
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,960

372
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,430
Stop working here.

373
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,800
Work at the manga company that you brought up to me.

374
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,530
Haven't you always liked drawing?

375
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,850
Just like Auntie Jin.

376
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,770
If I can't draw well, then what do I do?

377
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll support you.

378
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,870
But I eat a lot. When the time comes, you can't blame me for that.

379
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,920
You have lost so much weight.

380
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,630
You have to eat more from now on. The chubbier you get, the better, okay?

381
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,030
Brother, don't you know that if you eat too much, you will get eaten?

382
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,830
Ever since you were little, you've always been competitive.

383
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,640
I came here to tell you that I'm back.

384
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,100
Go.

385
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,090
Go.

386
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,710
Hello?

387
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,210
Mom.

388
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,770
I'm going back now.

389
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,300
What are you doing here?

390
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,810
Yesterday, he drank at my place.

391
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,640
I didn't feel comfortable getting someone to drive for him, so I sent him home.

392
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,090
When I have time, I want to properly meet that girl, Anxin.

393
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,600
What kind of woman

394
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,580
could crack this hard rock into shavings?

395
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,210
This is the female lead of the story?

396
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,390
She is quite pretty.

397
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,010
Who is the guy next to her?

398
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,760
He's pretty good-looking! A new lover?

399
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,130
Given his way of avoiding a problem by walking away from it,

400
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,250
I would've also found a new lover if I were her.

401
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,210
Which eye of yours was able to discern that he's good-looking?

402
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,840
He's quite radiant.

403
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,640
At least he's better than certain rocks.

404
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,240
Girls like this type.

405
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,780
Why aren't you going back?

406
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,160
Are you waiting for me to ask you to stay for dinner?

407
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,500
I will leave soon in order to avoid eating food you poison for me.

408
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,380
Go do some digging on that guy.

409
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,880
Okay, I will do it right now.

410
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,010

411
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,360

412
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,350
Manga convention recruitment?

413
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,830
"If you send your work to our inbox,

414
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,120
your work will have a chance to appear at our manga convention,

415
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
allowing more talent scouts discover you."

416
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,860
 Sister Chang'an must go! Quickly, submit.

417
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,520
 Exactly! Goddess Chang'an, you have to participate!

418
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,800
 We will support you!

419
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,650
 Let's go, Chang'an!

420
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,410
  Can I really do it?

421
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,660

422
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,070

423
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,610
Does it still hurt here?

424
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,300
I'm asking you a question. Does your leg still hurt?

425
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,470
Can you please respect the doctor in front of you and tell me whether your leg still hurts?

426
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,920
"Sister Chang'an has to go"?

427
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,940
When did you become so effeminate?

428
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,730
And you call yourself Yuanyuan?

429
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,580
Why don't you call yourself Fangfang or Bianbian? 
  (T/N: "Yuan" means "round", "Fang" means "square", and "bian" means flat)

430
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,510
Give it back to me.

431
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,020
I don't even want to see it.

432
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,150
Who is Sister Chang'an?

433
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,070
President Ling's person.

434
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,110
Then it looks like...

435
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,050
there's a lot of interesting things going on.

436
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,630
 Silly, don't you know to block it?

437
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,450
Sister, wipe yourself and don't get cold!

438
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,940
Thank you!

439
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,050
Sister, use this umbrella.

440
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,350
Then how do I give it back to you?

441
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,880
No need to! My bus is here, goodbye!

442
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,130
President Ling, the manga convention has already been arranged.

443
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,020
Let's go.

444
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,480
Later, when we see her piece,

445
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,400
- Do you understand what to say? 
 -Yes, I understand. 
 - I do, so rest assured.

446
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,300
Please.

447
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,610
Hello, teachers.

448
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,010
Sit.

449
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,710
Okay, thank you.

450
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,570
You see? It is raining.

451
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,050
- You are all wet, please wipe yourself. 
 - Thank you.

452
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,250
Drink some hot water so that you don't get sick.

453
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,230
- Okay. 
 - Drink more.

454
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,670
  What is going on?

455
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,010
Gu Anxin. Right?

456
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,080
- Did you bring your work? 
 - I did.

457
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm sorry, I forgot to bring it...

458
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,280
No worries, you can tell us

459
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,580
about your previous projects.

460
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,010
In the past, I have serialized

461
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,120
"The Big Wolf and Little Sheep."

462
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,430
Also...

463
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,540
- Then... 
 - That's good!

464
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,770
I have seen it in the past and it's so well-drawn!

465
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,030
It can be directly published.

466
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,590
- Really? 
 - Really!

467
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,650
Is it that good?

468
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,010
What nonsense are you saying?

469
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,530
Your acting is going a little overboard. Pull it back.

470
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,660
Anxin, you have been selected.

471
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,390
S-Selected?

472
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,090
Just like that?

473
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,150
No need to do a second or third interview?

474
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,290
No need.

475
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,760
It's an unconventional hiring.

476
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,930
Clean up your stuff. You can start working tomorrow.

477
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,920
Tomorrow? I'm not ready to begin tomorrow, sorry.

478
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,900
Then, if you have any requests,

479
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,840
don't worry. You can just tell us.

480
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,520
No! It's not a request.

481
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,580
To be honest, it's because I haven't quit my job,

482
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,670
and I still need to pass on past work,

483
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,330
so I can't come to work tomorrow.

484
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,280
That's fine.

485
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,870
I know this good news has come too suddenly. I understand it may be hard to accept.

486
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,620
After all, we are Brilliant Worldly Culture!

487
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,840
Right, right, right.

488
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,910
Well... make sure to consider it carefully after you get back.

489
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,110
Once you are done considering, you can contact me whenever.

490
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,240
- Let me introduce myself. 
 - Zhao Lei, right? 
 - Yes, Zhao Lei.

491
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,650
- Me too. My name is Wang Li. 
 - And me as well.

492
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,690
- My name is Chen Hong. 
 - Hello, Chen Hong.

493
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,840
Then, I'll leave now.

494
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,430
- All right. 
 - Sure.

495
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,790
- Do you need me to see you out? 
 - See her out.

496
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,810
- No need. 
 - See her out.

497
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,840
- No need. 
 - Go ahead. 
 - Seeing you off is a must.

498
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
- I'll see you off. 
 - No need.

499
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,080
Take care. This way.

500
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,510
- Auntie. 
 - Son!

501
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,130
- Mom. 
 - My wishfulness for you finally brought you back!

502
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,220
Hurry and give me a hug.

503
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,770
Let mother see you.

504
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,330
Why have you gotten so much skinnier?

505
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,670
Is the food abroad not to your taste?

506
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,230
Not at all.

507
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,790
Come, quickly.

508
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,150
Try the food I prepared specifically for you.

509
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,010
Your favorite dishes.

510
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,710
Come on. Quickly, sit down.

511
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,620
In the few years I haven't been back,

512
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,220
- your cooking skills have really improved so quickly. 
 - Eat well.

513
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,030
You didn't order food to fool me, did you?

514
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,660
You always know how to sweet talk.

515
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,150
All you have left is your sweet talk.

516
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,480
Dad.

517
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,640
Your mother is always wishing to the moon and the stars for you to return.

518
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,660
The first thing you did after coming back was not visiting her. Do you think I don't know that?

519
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,590
You've spent the whole day with an outsider.

520
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:18,150
Dad, how could Anxin be counted as an outsider?

521
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,920
She isn't related to me.

522
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,150
How could she not count as an outsider?

523
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,800
Dad, look,

524
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,860
aren't I also not biologically yours?

525
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,310
Don't you still love me very much?

526
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,990
What sort of nonsense talk is that? How could that be the same?

527
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:45,010
Yuanchao, did you finish your phone meeting?

528
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,070
It gave me a headache.

529
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,330
Let me give you a massage.

530
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,700
You are just too tired.

531
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,560
Yuanchao, stop blaming our son.

532
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
He and Anxin grew up together.

533
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,020
- Naturally, their relationship is good. 
 - That's why I'm afraid he'll be used by her!

534
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,290
Dad! I always feel like there's something secretive going on.

535
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,670
Anxin has been so kind since childhood. How could she have ever hurt anyone?

536
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,140
Do you think you understand her well?

537
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,350
Look at her temperament!

538
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,820
She is made of the same mold as her mother.

539
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,560
No matter how terrible the deeds she does are, I still wouldn't be surprised!

540
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,060
That's enough, stop fighting. Our son just came back.

541
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,330
However you look at it, Anxin is a child of our Gu family.

542
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,290
You also promised Sister Jin Wan that you would take good care of her.

543
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,680
This child was indeed too headstrong in the past,

544
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,230
but I trust that she now knows she was wrong.

545
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,870
Right, Yuanchao.

546
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:54,090
Your birthday is in a few days. How about we welcome her over to get together?

547
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,720
You can organize it.

548
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,350
Leave it to me.

549
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,550
Son, eat more.

550
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,620
- Here. 
 - Thanks, Mom.

551
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:16,020

552
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,830
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

553
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,500
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

557
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,620
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

558
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,140
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

559
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:56,200
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, for it has always been you  ♫

560
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,240
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

566
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:39,060
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫
