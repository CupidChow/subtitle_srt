1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,420
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,620
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,490
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,110
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,280
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,550
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,210
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,080
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,350
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,660
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,370
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,560
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,130
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,490
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,210
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,470
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,060
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,550

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,330

21
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,850
Is there a problem?

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,750
You're not going to invite me in to sit for a while?

23
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,950
Look. I brought your favorite food.

24
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,940
Chestnut cake.

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,750
Brother Yue, you've lost weight.

26
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,840
Cut to the chase.

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,360
You're still angry over what happened with Dad, right?

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,450
Sorry. But one is my dad,

29
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,740
the other is you. I was really helpless.

30
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,300
The person who started all of this was Gu Yuanchao.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,330
It has nothing to do with you.

32
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,450
How did you get hurt?

33
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,530
Where's the first aid kit?

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,870
I'll do it myself.

35
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,620
Didn't you say you're not angry with me?

36
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,260
Why are you still so cold to me?

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,130
Anxin isn't here anymore either.

38
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,920
What kind of obstacle is between us still?

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,250
How did you know Anxin isn't here anymore?

40
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,190
I... I heard it from my brother.

41
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,570
Did Gu Ansheng say where she was?

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,400
What is it? Why did you ask it like that?

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,650
Did something happen to Anxin?

44
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,900
If Miss Gu has no other concerns, please head back.

45
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,920
- Brother Yue. 
 - If there's nothing else, you should go back soon.

46
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,340
Wait.

47
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,310
Take this with you.

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,610
Brother Yue, I made this myself. It—

49
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,180
Sorry. I don't eat what others make.

50
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,420
Am I only "others"?

51
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,300
Are we not friends?

52
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,590
If you really don't want to eat it,

53
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,300
just throw it out.

54
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,380
Xin'er.

55
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,290
What are you...

56
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,570
Li Ang told me you came to find Second Brother.

57
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,110
That Li Ang is getting more and more outrageous.

58
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
Don't blame him. It was me who wouldn't leave him alone,

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,240
making him tell me about you.

60
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,880
Xin'er, you don't look so well.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,140
Did Second Brother bully you?

62
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,100
What can he do to me?

63
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,390
His heart is full of that person.

64
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,390
Xin'er, can't you let Second Brother go?

65
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,370
Some feelings can't be willed away.

66
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,540
Of course, I understand. Xin'er, I will protect you well.

67
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,360
Believe in me.

68
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,290
How do you want to protect me?

69
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,670
You had quite the presence, yet your face becomes so red from a girl touching your ear?

70
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,650
I will protect you at all costs.

71
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,980
The weather is a bit warm.

72
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,830
 Is the weather too warm?

73
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,800

74
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,420

75
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,240
Help me book the soonest high-speed train to Clear River Town.

76
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,610
- Drive faster. 
 - Okay.

77
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,050
 Candied haws!

78
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,810
 Candied haws!

79
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,410
Candied haws. Selling candied haws.

80
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,600
Selling candied haws.

81
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,130
Hello. Have you seen this girl before?

82
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,140
- She was headed east from here. 
-  East...

83
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,580
Shoot.

84
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,330
 Help!

85
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,460
 Is anyone there?

86
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,320
 Help!

87
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,630
 Little girl, what is your name?

88
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,790
 I'm Anxin.

89
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,740
 I came to the wrong place.

90
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,900
 Do you know where No. 11 is?

91
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,770
 In front, make a left turn and you'll be there.

92
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,870
 Thank you, Auntie.

93
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,450
 You're up? Don't be afraid.

94
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,690
 Don't be afraid.

95
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,040
 Here, be good.

96
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,220
 Drink the medicine.

97
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,550
 Help.

98
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,550
 You must listen to me. Don't call out.

99
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,750
 Otherwise, I will punish you.

100
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,930
 You look so cute.

101
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,490
 The price probably wouldn't be too bad.

102
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
 Be good. Drink the medicine.

103
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,230
 Even if you want to die,

104
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,760
 you have to wait till after you are sold for a good price tomorrow.

105
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,460
 - Drink it. 
 - I won't.

106
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,660
 He already said he won't drink it. Why are you forcing him?

107
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,310
 None of your business. This is for fever reduction!

108
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,750
 Are you okay?

109
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,430
 It hurts so much.

110
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,090
 Thank you.

111
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,320
 Why weren't you willing to drink the medicine?

112
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,100
 If I drank it, she would sell me to someone else immediately.

113
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,020
 I would never be able to come back.

114
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,630
 Then, what do we do now?

115
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,680
 First, pick up that thick piece of bowl.

116
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,230
 Fine. I'll drink it.

117
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,060
 Let's go.

118
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,400
 Be careful.

119
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,930
 Agreed? The same place tomorrow.

120
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,700
 I have another six- or seven-year-old girl here.

121
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,120
 She is delicate and beautiful.

122
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,470
 Do you want her tomorrow, too?

123
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,140
 Okay. We'll talk in person.

124
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,020
 She's back! What do we do?

125
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,130
 Go into that room!

126
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,490
 Anxin.

127
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,400
 Anxin, open the door! Quick!

128
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,690
 What do we do? She has the keys.

129
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,010
 Even if we run away, she will catch us again.

130
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,770
 What do we do?

131
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,790
 Go!

132
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,230
 Little punks.

133
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,960
 Go!

134
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,990
 Don't run!

135
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,540
 Kids, have some water.

136
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,090
 - Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

137
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,980
 Your foot is bleeding.

138
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's fine.

139
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,360
 I'm Yuan Yuan. What's your name?

140
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,900
 - Xiao Maodou. 
 - Xiao Maodou. 
 (T/N: Means "Little Edamame")

141
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,810
 You saved me. How would you like me to repay you?

142
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,420
 I'm so hungry.

143
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,870
 I can't think of anything.

144
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,610
 Come up with anything.

145
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,650
 I got it.

146
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,520
 Well, the TV says this is called taking advantage.

147
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,070
 Right now, I've taken advantage of you.

148
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,090
 We're even, okay?

149
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,760
 Little boy, we'll take you back to the police station

150
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,020
 and wait for your family to pick you up. Okay?

151
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,260
 Xiao Maodou.

152
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,720
 I will come back for you.

153
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,360
How did you know I would be here?

154
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,130
You thought you left no traces, right?

155
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,030
You're Yuan Yuan?

156
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,890
You're Yuan Yuan?

157
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,960
When did you know who I was?

158
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,720
How did you hide it so well?

159
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,650
How do you think?

160
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,470
 You draw manhua?

161
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,040
 When I'm bored, I doodle.

162
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,840
 I'm just a delivery woman.

163
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,730
 Sit anywhere. I will clean this up for you.

164
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,310
Wait.

165
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,070
You're not thinking I was purposely trying to get close to you, right?

166
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,010
That's exactly what you think.

167
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,370
Your expression has already given you away. You really do think this way, right?

168
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,980
It's true that I was suspicious in the beginning,

169
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,600
but my suspicions

170
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,640
had been dispelled by your naivety long ago.

171
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,720
So,

172
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,230
your leg injury was fake and so was your memory loss.

173
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,860
The leg injury was real.

174
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,190
The memory loss was fake.

175
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,390
If you're angry, just hit me.

176
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,870
I was originally furious

177
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,130
and I did really want to hit you,

178
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,450
but my little flame of anger

179
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,330
had already been extinguished by those layers of shock.

180
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,880
If you become an actor, you can definitely get an Oscar.

181
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,190
If I told you everything from the start,

182
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,210
wouldn't I have been kicked out of the house for being a madman?

183
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,700
You would be kicked out,

184
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,080
and you'd get a beating in addition.

185
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,430
You can discipline me however you like.

186
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,030
As long as you let me stay by your side, it's fine.

187
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,180
Even if...

188
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,650
I'm always hindering your advancement on your road to success,

189
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,500
you still won't leave me?

190
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,530
It was like that with the 5% incident,

191
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,980
and it is the same with the Gu Group incident.

192
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,650
I'm your biggest problem.

193
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,210
Right?

194
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,950
You aren't.

195
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,040
You aren't my problem.

196
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,220
You are the answer to all my problems.

197
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,280
I've walked down a dark and cold road all alone all this time.

198
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,510
Thank goodness you lit a match for me.

199
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,270
It's more precious than anything.

200
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,580
Then you mean,

201
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,820
I'm the little match-selling girl.

202
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,170
I'll be your match in the future.

203
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,790
You said earlier that you would be my servant. Will you still do it?

204
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,290
I can be anything.

205
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,030
Got it. Then let me take advantage of you again.

206
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,650
There are so many names on here.

207
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,600
What's wrong?

208
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,910
- Let's switch roads! 
 - Why should we switch roads?

209
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,990
This route's closest to the market.

210
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,830
Let's go.

211
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,360
More walking is good for your health.

212
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,160
What do you mean good for my health?

213
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,880
Anxin! You run first.

214
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,020
Run where? What?

215
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,020
It's so cute!

216
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,700
It's so cute!

217
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,560
Do you want to pet it?

218
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,800
- No thanks. 
 - Pet its head.

219
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,950
It won't bite you.

220
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,920
- Come. 
 - Please don't.

221
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,990
Just pet it!

222
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,060
- No, no, no! 
 - Shake its hand.

223
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,180
No need, no need.

224
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,950
- What are you scared of? Pet it! 
 - No, no, no!

225
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,730
Don't!  Stop!

226
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,210
If it were a big dog, it wouldn't matter if you were afraid of it,

227
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,160
but you're even scared of such a small dog!

228
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,380
It's not called being scared, it's called being cautious.

229
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,600
Pets can carry a lot of germs. They can cause allergies.

230
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,650
That's true. You're allergic to everything.

231
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,870
Not being allergic to you is all that matters.

232
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,800
The sun is so nice.

233
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,470
Sleep a little.

234
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,880
 Come to speak of it, it's quite strange. This place isn't big,

235
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,690
 yet we've never met even once.

236
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,420
 What matters is that we met in the end.

237
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,410
 I will make up for all of the time we missed.

238
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,230
 Then we must live life slower; or else, how can there be enough time?

239
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,910

-

240
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,450
 We have an entire lifetime.

241
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,380
 So it turns out the one standing at the crossroads wasn't him.

242
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,990
 It was my hesitant self.

243
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:35,150
♫  Waiting to turn on this intersection; 
What a beautiful accident  ♫

244
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,150
♫   What I accidentally picked up was love  ♫

245
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,460
Here. I rinsed the fruit.

246
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,710
- So many? 
 - Yes. Dig in.

247
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,330
♫  Was love  ♫

248
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,640
Why does your house have this?

249
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,750
 Mom.

250
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,440
 Don't film me.

251
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,250
 What are you painting?

252
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,590
 I'm not showing you. I'll show you after I finish it.

253
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,270
 Anxin.

254
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,810
 Mom, who is this?

255
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,160
 That's your dad.

256
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,900
 There's nothing to see here.

257
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,930
 Go downstairs to eat.

258
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,540
 Dad?

259
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,500
What's wrong, Anxin?

260
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,460
Did you remember something?

261
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,960
I think I just remembered

262
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,000
where my mom put the videotape.

263
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,260
It must be that the videotape got damaged after being damp for so long.

264
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,540
Don't be anxious. I'm sure Auntie left other things.

265
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,180
Anxin.

266
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,560
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

267
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,910
How did you get hurt? There isn't a vet nearby.

268
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,930
Wait, I'll find a doctor for you right now.

269
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,140
What happened to you? Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

270
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,170
Where did you get hurt? Let me take a look!

271
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,950
I'm fine.

272
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,870
She's the one that's hurt.

273
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,780
You scared me to death.

274
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,960
Let me see.

275
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,290
Here.

276
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,420
How is she?

277
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,150
It's nothing serious, so don't worry.

278
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,120
It's just a superficial wound. As for...

279
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,480
whether there's any internal injury to the organs, I'd need to use a special instrument to assess that.

280
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,710
It must hurt a lot.

281
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,140
It's rare to see you be so gentle. You like cats too?

282
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,900
It's just that when I see her weak and helpless appearance,

283
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,200
I get the feeling of deja vu.

284
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,950
When I was at my most desperate,

285
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,540
I met President Ling.

286
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,880
He's also very lucky to have met you.

287
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,440
No matter what happened in the past,

288
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,890
in the future, everything will be okay.

289
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,160
At least you have me by your side.

290
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,410
And Ling Yue, Anxin.

291
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,350
In the future, no matter what happens,

292
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,380
we will appear by your side immediately.

293
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Good thing she's okay. She should be better in a couple of days.

294
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,340
Should we find her an owner then?

295
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,660
How about... you take care of her?

296
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,140
I definitely can't. I'm too busy with work.

297
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,280
If I don't take good care of her...

298
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,580
Don't you have me? Right?

299
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,200
We can exchange at regular intervals.

300
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,870
When you have work,

301
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,160
bring her to my house.

302
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,540
When I have work,

303
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,300
I'll bring her to your house.

304
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,850
That way, she won't be lonely.

305
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,050
That works, too.

306
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,290
In two hours, I have to change her medicine.

307
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,960
Tonight, I'll hold her while I sleep. How does that sound?

308
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,660
She doesn't have a name yet.

309
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,490
She and you are so fated for each other. Why don't we call her...

310
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,060
Xiao Ai?

311
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,480
Okay.

312
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,350
I still have some cocktail drinks at home.

313
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,880
Here, Youyou.

314
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,280
- Anxin. 
 - Here, Zhao Lei.

315
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,970
If there's anything you need, tell me immediately. I'm in a rush to leave.

316
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,270
We came to find you this time because of the promotion issue.

317
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,260
This time, you're the returning king; the rebirthed nirvana.

318
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,620
- We have to go big, I'm telling you, Zhao Lei, she— 
 - Okay, so,

319
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,540
we don't need to say more praise.

320
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,820
For the upcoming "Accidentally Picking Up a Prince," I have already

321
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,620
worked out a perfect marketing plan.

322
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,720
As soon as it's uploaded, it's guaranteed to be first on the trending page.

323
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,170
Okay, got it.

324
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,370
We can talk about the details when I get back. I really have to go now.

325
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,120
You can stay here. Drink and play as you wish.

326
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,310
- I'm going now. 
 - Hey, Anxin!

327
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,920
Where is she going?

328
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,460
She's l-leaving just like that?

329
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,720
I don't even know what she's off to do.

330
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,860
It tastes pretty good. It's orange-flavored.

331
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,530
Your throat's infected?

332
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,320
- It hurts!
 - Is it seriously that dramatic? I'm only eighty—

333
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
- How many? 
 - Ninety...

334
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,580
How many?

335
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,320
100 or so pounds.

336
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,700
Right. 120 is still 100 or so.

337
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,380
Wait, Zhao Lei, why are you like this?

338
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,530
I'm joking.

339
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,860
You don't say.

340
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,800
Although Anxin's house doesn't look fancy,

341
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,470
it has quite the rustic feel.

342
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,670
Zhao Lei! Are you really treating this as your own home?

343
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,260
This is called having a pair of beauty-discovering eyes.

344
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,390
Just these brown leaves...

345
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,530
really have a rich autumn feel.

346
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,300
Did I say—

347
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,480
What did you say?

348
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,180
- Brown leaves? 
 - That's right.

349
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,720
But these leaves are clearly red.

350
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,010
Red. Right, yes.

351
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,710
I was just going to say that they're red.

352
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,890
Are you...

353
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,530
Partial colorblindness.

354
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,770
How could it be?

355
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,280
I have never heard you talk about it.

356
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,710
It's not too bad.

357
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,430
It's because an injury got infected when I was young,

358
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,700
which led to my retina undergoing changes.

359
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,860
Since then, it became hard to differentiate between colors.

360
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,520
However, I think medical technology is flourishing so much now,

361
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,620
and I believe healing my eyes is only a matter of time.

362
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,550
So... that's why you like

363
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,020
taking pictures of anything pretty.

364
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,570
That's right.

365
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,130
I think this world must be very beautiful.

366
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,140
Full of color.

367
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,290
So I think camera lenses are my eyes.

368
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,310
It can be my eyes and save all the beautiful scenery for me.

369
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,480
It's nice.

370
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,440
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,070
I always blamed you for using the wrong colors.

372
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,280
Have you been...

373
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,550
moved by my optimistic attitude?

374
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,530
Don't worship me too much.

375
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,650
Narcissistic idiot.

376
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,960
But I don't think partial colorblindness is a weakness.

377
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,150
Although you can't see the original colors,

378
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,550
the colors you use are more exaggerated than anyone else's.

379
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,530
They're more lively.

380
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,480
Thank you.

381
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,340
It'll clear up phlegm for you.

382
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,840
Tastes good.

383
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,050
Here, Yuanchao. The weather is getting cold.

384
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,760
How about we turn on the heater?

385
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,030
I really have no choice but to accept my old age.

386
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,040
In the past, I'd be fine without anything to cover my arms.

387
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,980
But look at me now. It's no use no matter how much I wear.

388
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,870
Look at you. It's normal for people to age.

389
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,920
You just aren't willing to accept it.

390
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,160
The young ones are promising. This old man

391
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,280
is about to be flattened to death on the beach.

392
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,180
What death? I'm going to live long with you.

393
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,020
These years, it's all thanks to you being my side.

394
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,570
It's time to call Ansheng over.

395
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,020
The world belongs to the young.

396
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,350
It's time to give the company to him and Xin'er.

397
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,970
Then...

398
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,070
Chairman, Miss Anxin has come.

399
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,370
- Tell her to come in. 
 - Yes.

400
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,130
Anxin, you're here! Come in and sit.

401
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,720
Do you have anything you want to eat? I'll have them go and make it.

402
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,760
No need, Aunt Hong.

403
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,430
I came today

404
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,600
to ask Chairman some questions.

405
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,280
Why are you so polite to your family? Say, "Dad."

406
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,130
If she isn't willing, it's up to her.

407
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,400
I don't lack such a daughter...

408
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,280
Yuanchao.

409
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,950
So you were the one who threw me away to become adopted.

410
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,770
That's right.

411
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,110
If it wasn't for your mother's passing

412
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,050
and I took into account our lingering feelings,

413
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,690
I wouldn't have taken you back at all.

414
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,330
What reason did you have to suspect her?

415
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,220
Your existence is the greatest evidence.

416
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,190
That kind and warm-hearted mother of yours

417
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,550
didn't tell you?

418
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,970
I performed a paternal identification right when you were born.

419
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,930
You aren't my daughter at all.

420
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,940
Okay.

421
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,280
Last question.

422
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,580
Which hospital was I born at?

423
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,660
Maria First Hospital.

424
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,140
Do you have any other questions?

425
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,960
No.

426
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,580
Anxin.

427
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,480
I want to say,

428
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,610
when you took me away from my mother's side,

429
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,940
my mother was already crazy.

430
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,700
It was you...

431
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,390
who personally pushed her off the balcony.

432
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,360
You are the reason for her death.

433
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,870
Get out of here.

434
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,750
Get out!

435
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,510
What's wrong?

436
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,110
Don't be angry.

437
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,890
It's not right, Mister.

438
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,390
Wasn't I going to Maria First Hospital?

439
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,230
This is it.

440
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,540
T-This is only an empty lot.

441
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,440
That's right. It was Maria Hospital before.

442
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,230
Later, the hospital went bankrupt. Now it's a trade city.

443
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,120
Swipe it. 200.

444
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,520
200?

445
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,360
We didn't drive for that long, so why is it so expensive?

446
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,370
Little girl, you're trying to get off with not paying?

447
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,900
What? You three are together?

448
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,650
Let me tell you. It's the middle of the day!

449
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,730
Trying to ride without paying? Be careful or I'll report you!

450
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,580
Swipe.

451
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,720
I should be telling you that.

452
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,810
You clearly knew the destination didn't exist, yet you tricked a customer into your car.

453
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,020
That's already against regulations.

454
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,120
I welcome your report anytime.

455
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,460
I'm all right.

456
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,260
The hospital clue has ended.

457
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,020
Don't worry. Ai Li will help you investigate.

458
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,570
Leave it to me, Miss Anxin.

459
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,990
- Thanks for the trouble, Ai Li. 
 - It's my duty.

460
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,780
Your phone can't receive calls.

461
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,060
Get a different one. I bought you a new one.

462
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,560
You're wasting money again. My phone's fine.

463
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,370
It's just laggy sometimes.

464
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,670
- I don't need this. Return it. 
 - Take it.

465
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,080
Then... I'll use this.

466
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,300
Let me see if I can sell my phone for a good price.

467
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,060
What's this?

468
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,210
This...

469
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,190
Look! With this location tracker,

470
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,220
as long as I have internet, I can find you anytime.

471
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,020
You can find me as well.

472
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,880
This app of yours doesn't have some sort of camera, does it?

473
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,620
Like, the kind where you can see me when I'm showering.

474
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,170
You've reminded me.

475
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,140
Why didn't I think of that earlier—

476
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,180
Don't run off in secret again.

477
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,230
Or else, I'll really consider tying you up.

478
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,340
Just like how Xu Youyou said.

479
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,520
Anxin, the matter I told you about before,

480
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,580
have you thought about it?

481
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,590
What matter?

482
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,670
Come live at my house for a few days.

483
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,480
Let me stay with you.

484
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,060
Once you're feeling better

485
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,800
and don't have so many worries,

486
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,010
you can move back, all right?

487
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,860
Do you take me for a little dog?

488
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,520
Do you want to leash me?

489
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,950
Should I pair you with a rope?

490
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,790

491
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:14,560
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

492
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,290
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

493
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,820
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

494
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,080
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

495
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,800
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

496
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,420
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

497
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,860
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

498
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:48,940
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

499
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,870
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

500
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:59,360
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

501
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:07,330
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

502
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:13,360
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

503
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,830
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

504
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:25,860
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

505
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,850
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

506
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:36,150
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

507
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,830
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫

508
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,740
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
