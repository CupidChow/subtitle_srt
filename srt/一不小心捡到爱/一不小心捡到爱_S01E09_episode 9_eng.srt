1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:09,970

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,430
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,610
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,580
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,080
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,410
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,640
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,480
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,090
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,190
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,560
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,390
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,510
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,500
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,300
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,470
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,200
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,430

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,170
This is a present I prepared for you. It represents my kind regards.

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,530
Director Ling, giving a good review doesn't mean that we can be good friends.

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,300
You understand that, right?

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm only giving you a gift to express my apologies.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,500
If you don't want it, throw it out.

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,730
Sorry, I didn't do it on—

27
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,080
My heart is going to burst.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,780
I'm going to puke. Aren't you disgusting?

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,560
 Let go of her!

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,700
Brother.

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,490
Is it here that hurts? Is it here?

32
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,080
- Wait, wait, wait! 
 - Does it still hurt?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait—

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,590
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't.

35
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,120
I feel better.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Then I'll be leaving.

37
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,760
What?

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,020
Why are you and my eldest brother so close?

39
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,120
How am I close to him?

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,130
You even stroked his chest right in front of me.

41
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,750
What do you mean, I "stroked his chest"? I only touched it for a moment.

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,540
How come your words make me sound like a female pervert?

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,560
You haven't even stroked—

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,920
The point is, don't have contact with him. Otherwise, he will annoy you continuously like a fly.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,530
Don't you like flies?

46
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,560
When did I—

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,550
He's your eldest brother.

48
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,470
Who says that about their own brother?

49
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,450
If he's a fly, you're a little fly.

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,570
Why do you always speak up for him?

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,490
- Do you care for him? 
 - I'm not speaking up for him.

52
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm just telling it how it is.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,660
- Don't bring him up again. 
 - You were the one who brought him up.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,930
Are you jealous?

55
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,280
- No. 
 - That's good then.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,050
If you're not, then we're just talking about it. Right?

57
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,040
I think Ling Fang isn't that bad of a person.

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,760
But... he seems pretty cute.

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,480
If there's nothing else, I'm heading back.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,210
You can't.

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,740
Can't you move in with me?

62
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,730
Why would a single man and single woman live together?

63
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,900
- Is Gu Ansheng not a man? 
 - He's my brother.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,760
You and I just have a creditor and debtor relationship.

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,080
You're my creditor. Plus, I already owe you a lot of money.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,150
I don't want to owe you even more.

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,150
- You're allowed to not pay it back. 
 - No, I have to.

68
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,430
I can't always owe you.

69
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,090
- But isn't having a fate that lasts a lifetime a good thing?
 - That's not necessary.

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm leaving.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,500
 President Ling, how much was the car fare? I'll transfer it to you.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,260
 Talking about money hurts relationships.

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,240
 Talking about relationships also hurts money. I only carpooled with you.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,340
  I still have to pay.

75
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,820
 Cheesy.

76
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,850
Brother Yue.

77
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,580
Miss Gu.

78
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,410
I didn't expect you to also be attending this lipstick launching ceremony.

79
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,560
I saw their advertisement and thought their design was very original, so I came to take a look.

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,670
You probably understand lipstick very well.

81
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,870
After all, your girlfriend enjoys using it.

82
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,680
Girlfriend?

83
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,860
My sister Gu Anxin.

84
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,880
- Last time at the party— 
 - She's not my girlfriend.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,490
Really?

86
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,460
I am still pursuing her. She hasn't accepted yet.

87
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,610
That's the situation? Then, you'll have to work a bit harder.

88
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,840
It sure is hard.

89
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,430
What kind of gifts do you girls like?

90
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,640
For me, as long as it's from the person I like,

91
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,500
I would like it no matter what.

92
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
However, girls

93
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,490
usually prefer uniquely scented perfumes.

94
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,880
Ai Li, what kind of perfume do you use?

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Cologne.

96
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,190
That practically useless for reference purposes.

97
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,840
Apologies.

98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,400
Anxin has a bubbly personality.

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,650
A heavier perfume scent probably wouldn't suit her very well.

100
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,860
She's better suited for a sweet, fruity scent.

101
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,040
Miss Gu, you seem to know perfumes well.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,230
Not really. I just understand Anxin well.

103
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,510
She's my sister, after all.

104
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,070
Do you need me to give you any suggestions?

105
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,680
- Then thank you for the trouble. 
 - You're welcome.

106
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,250

107
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,640
This is our work area.

108
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,290
No need to be too nervous when meeting your coworkers later.

109
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,220
Hi, Department Head.

110
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,690
Anxin, from today forward, you are a formal editor of Brilliant Worldly Culture.

111
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm your group leader.

112
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,320
- Manager Zhao. 
 - No need to be so polite.

113
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Here we are. If you need anything, come and find me whenever.

114
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,600
Of course, if it's something minor, don't come and find me.

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,830
- After all, I have lots to do every day, and I'm quite busy. 
 - Okay, Manager Zhao.

116
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,730
- You can look for Xiao Zhang or Xiao Wang, too. It's all the same. Get to know them. 
 - All right.

117
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,000
- Then I'm going to go back to work. 
 - Okay.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,940
Find a seat yourself.

119
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,570
Hi! You're Anxin?

120
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,610
I'm Little Fox Mumu. Turns out you're so cute!

121
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,440
You're even cuter than I am!

122
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,190
Hello! I'm He Shuhuan.

123
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,350
 Is this a new comedy routine?  
  (T/N: Anxin thinks it's a joke because He Shuhuan is the name of a reporter character in Taiwanese drama "Romance in the Rain)

124
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,020
Hello! I'm Lu Yiping.  
  (T/N: Lu Yiping is the love interest of He Shuhuan in that drama)

125
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,710
Anxin, turns out you're so humorous!

126
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,390
- Isn't she, Huanhuan? 
 - She is quite funny.

127
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,560
Then, why aren't you laughing?

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,420
Aren't I laughing?

129
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,570
Wh-What are you laughing about?

130
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,310
Her name is made up of the "He" in "He Shuhuan", the "Shu" in "Shuqi" and the "Huan" in "Zhen Huan".
  (T/N: She is explaining the characters used to write He Shuhuan's name and using famous figures in Chinese entertainment for reference)

131
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,720
It's not from Romance in the Rain.

132
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm so sorry. I thought...

133
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's all right!

134
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,050
She's just like that. Although she acts indifferent on the surface,

135
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,040
she's actually super happy inside.

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,830
After all, our studio

137
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,840
is really lacking in beautiful young women.

138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,850
How? You're all beautiful young women!

139
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,320
In the future, everyone will be colleagues.

140
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,210
If you don't understand anything, feel free to ask!

141
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,020
- I'll take care of you! 
 - Okay!

142
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,040

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,740
Thank you, Brother.

144
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,370
Didn't the internet say it's not even possible to get in line? Why is there no one here?

145
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,680
Let me tell you. All of the ratings on the internet were only achieved through click farming.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,810
Not necessarily. What if it's because it's not lunchtime yet?

147
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,760
Who cares? Anyway, we're celebrating Anxin's employment at a new company today!

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Thank you.

149
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,370
Hey what-what is this?

150
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,320
It scared me!

151
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,740
Thank you.

152
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,750
Brother, we didn't order hotpot and this stuff, right?

153
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,520
We didn't.

154
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm sorry. I don't think we ordered red wine or... this stuff.

155
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,800
These are all gifts from our store's VIP, Mr. Ling, to you.

156
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,210
- Mr. Ling? 
 - Surely it can't be Xiao Ba?

157
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,490
He wouldn't do something so pompous, would he?

158
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,120
I've reserved this entire place!

159
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm the one who ordered the meat and wine. If it's not enough, there's more!

160
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,430
Call for anything you want to eat. Order anything and don't hold back.

161
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,450
How is it?

162
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,260
Are you moved?

163
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,770
I'm afraid to move.

164
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,040
Then I'll move more.

165
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm sorry. I have to drive in a bit and my sister doesn't drink.

166
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,480
We can only accept your kindness in our hearts.

167
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,770
That's unfortunate. It's Lafite from '82.

168
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,510
Which Mr. Ling is this? Although his actions are quite tacky, he actually has handsome looks.

169
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,980
It's the tacky rich man I told you about before.

170
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,330
His looks are so inconsistent with his actions. What a waste of great looks.

171
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,410
- "Great looks"? 
 - It's decent.

172
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,660
I can hear your little whispers.

173
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,040
So what if you heard?

174
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,060
This meal...

175
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,240
suddenly doesn't taste good.

176
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,130
Brother, this air conditioner's leaking water.

177
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,590
It's just because you're my little brother.

178
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,480
I'll go easy on you.

179
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,780
Let's all eat first.

180
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,540
Eat!

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,660
What horrible pot is this? The meat burns immediately upon roasting.

182
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,690
If you roast it like this, how could it possibly not burn?

183
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,630
You do it then!

184
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,140
Who knew Xiao Ba's actually quite skilled?

185
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,480
Because I had a good teacher.

186
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,950
This is called... the disciple is better than the master.

187
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,740
Did you get burned?

188
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,770
You supposed to be more careful! Where?

189
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm fine.

190
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,940
Brother, I'll go buy some ointment. I'll be back soon.

191
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,510
Wait here.

192
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Anxin, let's go together.

193
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,510
How disgusting.

194
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,570
What are you doing? Aren't we going to buy medicine?

195
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,460
Ling Yue, I'm talking to you. Hey-Hey!

196
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,880
Those eyesores are no longer around.

197
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,920
I can finally boldly do this.

198
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,130
Do? D-Do what?

199
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,480
Help me apply medication.

200
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,750
You should've said you had medicine in your car earlier. We toiled for nothing.

201
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,200
Then if I told you earlier, would you have come down with me?

202
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,020
So you did it on purpose?

203
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,040
Isn't that because of you? You're always pushing me thousands of miles away.

204
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,910
When you put it that way, it sounds like you're blaming me.

205
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,520
No. It's my fault.

206
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,770
Anxin, forgive me.

207
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,050
No matter what happens, I won't leave you again.

208
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,390
I can forgive you.

209
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,000
However...

210
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,660
I promise you my everything.

211
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,150
I-I wasn't talking about that.

212
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,460
What did you want to say?

213
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,310
I was saying...

214
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,620
Have you forgiven me?

215
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,220
Fine, I give up! I'm afraid of you. I've forgiven you, okay?

216
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Then come with me to meet my family tomorrow.

217
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,750
Meet your parents?

218
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,950
This fast?

219
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,380
I-I haven't agreed to be your girlfriend.

220
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,210
- Then aren't you right now? 
 - I'm not!

221
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,830
I only agreed to forgive you, I didn't agree to be your girlfriend.

222
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,260
Then if you aren't willing, then forget it!

223
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,740
What do you mean, "forget it"? You're taking it back already?

224
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
Then, you're my future girlfriend.

225
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,990
Surely it's not outrageous to eat a meal with me?

226
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,500
It's fine.

227
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,720
Then, where are we going now?

228
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,800
We're going somewhere else to eat barbecue.

229
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,140
Then I have to tell my brother and Youyou.

230
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,210
Send a message.

231
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,120
Why hasn't Anxin come back? They're taking so long just to buy medicine.

232
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,910
All right!

233
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,680
You two continue eating. Those two will likely not be coming back.

234
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,250
You're leaving?

235
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,890
I still have business, so I'll leave first. Hey!

236
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,290
The meat's burned. Hurry up, you two.

237
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,930
It's fine.

238
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,390
 Brother, I'll be leaving first. Make sure to send Youyou back home safely.

239
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,420
 Come home early.

240
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,670
 My beloved consort, I will be leaving first.  
  (T/N: Using first-person honorific that an emperor would use)

241
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,590
 Make sure to take advantage of your alone time with my brother!

242
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,860
 I will obey your command! I will try my best to birth a nephew for you soon.  
  (T/N: Using first-person honorific that palace servants would use)

243
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Ansheng, try this.

244
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,300
- It's delicious. 
 - Thank you.

245
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,850
Don't drink red wine. While eating barbecue, you must drink baijiu if you have any alcohol at all. 
  (T/N: Popular Chinese clear distilled spirit liquor)

246
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,850
We aren't leaving sober today. Waiter! Give us a bottle of baijiu!

247
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,860
Toast!

248
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,790
Youyou?

249
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,210
Are you... okay?

250
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm pretty much fine.

251
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,970
Why? I'm a little dizzy.

252
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,550
Can you... send me back in a bit?

253
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,470
Okay.

254
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,380
Youyou.

255
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,570
Here, I'll go drive the car over.

256
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,690
Wait for me here. Will you be okay by yourself?

257
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,640
Don't worry. Go drive the car.

258
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,920
I'll wait for you here.

259
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,060
Okay, I'll be quick.

260
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,570
Why did you crash into me?

261
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,620
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

262
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,690
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,130
I think you did it on purpose.

264
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,870
Elder Sister, who would take advantage of you?

265
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,920
"Elder Sister"?

266
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,220
Who are you calling an elder sister?

267
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,740
Are you blind?

268
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,550
- You're the elder sister! You're whole family's an elder sister! 
 - I didn't mean it like that—

269
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,050
I'm sorry! I didn't—

270
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,630
Wait, don't hit me!

271
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,560
- How could you call me "elder sister"? 
 - Don't hit me!

272
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,460
- What's wrong? What's wrong? 
 - Ansheng...

273
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,800
He bullied me.

274
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,930
- Who's bullying who here? 
 - You're bullying me!

275
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,660
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. My friend drank a little too much.

276
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,350
Well, should I take you to the hospital?

277
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,020
- No need! No need! 
 - No need. No need.

278
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,140
Hurry and take her back. Stop making trouble outside!

279
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,910
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
 - Don't let me see you again!

280
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

281
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,370
Youyou.

282
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,100
Let's go home, all right? I'll send you back.

283
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,630
I'm tired. I want to rest for a while.

284
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll take you to the car.

285
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,380
Why are you out of battery?

286
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,420
Don't be in a hurry. I'll charge you up, all right?

287
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,910
Youyou, there's nowhere to charge your phone here. I have one in my car.

288
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,730
Let's go into my car.

289
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,310
There is. How is there not?

290
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,640
Don't worry. It doesn't make a difference where we charge it.

291
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,470
See?

292
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
Youyou.

293
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,430
It's about to rain. Let me take you back to the car.

294
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,160
All right?

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,090
You keep trying to make me get in your car.

296
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,640
Do you want to do some embarrassing things to me?

297
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,320
No, no. You've misunderstood. I didn't mean that.

298
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,430
No problem.

299
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,130
I-I've always wanted to give birth to

300
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,460
little monkeys for you.

301
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,810
Perfume?

302
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,070
 Wow, who knew you were into perfume?

303
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,450
 Does that give me some points?

304
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,920
 Keep working hard!

305
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,470
 Right. I'm downstairs. We can leave now.

306
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,240
 All right, I'll change and go downstairs immediately.

307
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,490
Wait. Something's missing.

308
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,250
Don't worry. I'm here.

309
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,600
Is that a family portrait? Which one of them are you?

310
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,810
I sure read you wrong. You like him but not me.

311
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,020
Why is there a fly in your house?

312
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,610
Why are you here?

313
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,250
You two are really... compatible.

314
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Mom.

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,920
- This is Anxin. 
 - You're Anxin?

316
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,620
Come in and sit down.

317
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,150
Sorry, Auntie. There was some traffic on the way here.

318
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,180
It's fine. It's good that you made it.

319
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,880
Brother, the two of you planned to come together?

320
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,510
- Sorry. 
 - Future Sister-in-Law, I've finally met you.

321
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,160
Hello.

322
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,210
You're finally here.

323
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,780
- Hello, Auntie. 
 - Hello.

324
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,950
Xin'er, you played the piano well.

325
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,860
When Anxin was in college, she played a lot better than me.

326
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,430
- Anxin also graduated from Yale University? 
 - Auntie, you might not know.

327
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,570
Before I studied overseas, I studied for my undergraduate degree at Seijoh University.

328
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,180
Anxin was my classmate in my undergraduate course.

329
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,060
That doesn't seem right.

330
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,880
If I remember correctly, Anxin didn't graduate from university.

331
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,930
Eldest Brother!

332
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,510
Brother Ling Fang, you can't say it like that.

333
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,520
- Anxin is actually— 
 - You're not wrong.

334
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,440
It's true that I'm not a university graduate.

335
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,190
However, Director Ling Fang,

336
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,360
I at least know how to respect others, unlike you.

337
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,290
You went to university but still couldn't learn how to. What a pity.

338
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,460
Anxin, Brother Ling Fang didn't have any bad intentions.

339
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,680
- There's no need to be so bothered over it. 
 - That's right.

340
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,730
If a speaker wants their listener to not be bothered by their words, they must speak with the right intentions.

341
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,480
Right?

342
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,740
Mom.

343
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,330
Mom, just listen.

344
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,630
Didn't I say that? Anxin has such an explosive temper. I don't know whether Second Brother will be able to handle it.

345
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,740
- Enough, enough. Don't say too much. 
 - Coincidently,

346
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,180
I like her bad temper.

347
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,940
Listen to that.

348
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,340
What are you all talking about?

349
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,600
You guys are chatting so happily.

350
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,020
- Dad. 
 - Hello, Uncle.

351
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,660
Dad.

352
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,080
Dad.

353
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,690
Hello, Uncle.

354
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,040
Hello, Anxin.

355
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,520
You look exactly like your mom.

356
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,930
Sit.

357
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,900
Uncle.

358
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,150
It's our first time meeting, so I brought you a small gift. Take a look.

359
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,890
You are such a thoughtful child.

360
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,940
- What is it? 
 - Open it and take a look.

361
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,680
A calligraphy brush.

362
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,890
How valuable.

363
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,600
Uncle, this was my mom's favorite calligraphy brush.

364
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,840
I brought it here to gift it to you as a memento.

365
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,660
Thank you.

366
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,730
Speaking of gifts, I also prepared a small gift for Uncle.

367
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,830
Xin'er is so thoughtful.

368
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,550
Miss Gu always impresses.

369
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,220
This is the Baroque period artwork that I coincidentally happened to stumble upon.

370
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,740
Since Uncle likes it, it has found its soulmate who understands it.

371
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,450
Anxin, is there something you want to say?

372
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,550
This painting is not from the Baroque period.

373
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,340
Rather, it is from the Late Renaissance period.

374
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,070
It's also known as the Mannerism period.

375
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,320
Like its name, it likes the form it takes.

376
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,420
This painting style is exciting and strange.

377
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,540
Its theme is cryptic and ambiguous.

378
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,620
These are all aspects expressed during the Mannerism period.

379
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,920
What you said is true. As expected from the daughter of Xiao Wan.

380
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,990
All right, put this painting up in the bathroom upstairs.

381
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,040
Weren't you deliberately embarrassing her?

382
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,790
It was intentional.

383
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,220
You sure do hold grudges.

384
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,440
So don't provoke me in the future.

385
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,110
Dad.

386
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,910
Out of these two presents, which one do you like more?

387
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,530
- Brother, you're making trouble again. 
 - It's fine.

388
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,210
Anxin,

389
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,340
ever since your mom gave birth to you, I never received

390
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,970
any news about you and your mother.

391
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,140
How did the two of you live these past years?

392
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,930
Why did your mom suddenly...

393
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,460
Sorry, Uncle.

394
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,210
After my mom passed away, I fell gravely ill.

395
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,330
There was a lot I couldn't remember after I woke up.

396
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,640
Child.

397
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,310
You have suffered so much.

398
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm your mother's best friend. If you don't look down on it,

399
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,470
I hope you can take me, Uncle Ling,

400
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,090
as a family member of yours.

401
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,880
Thank you, Uncle.

402
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,550
I also have a gift I want to give you.

403
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,190
Open it and take a look.

404
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,780
Uncle.

405
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,740
I can't accept this gift.

406
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,380
You haven't even looked at it. How do you know if you can accept it or not?

407
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,290
You were close friends with my mom.

408
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm sure that when my mom helped you, she wasn't expecting to get anything in return,

409
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,500
so I truly cannot accept this valuable gift.

410
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,030
Looks like you're very clear on what is inside.

411
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,920
Anxin, I respect your decision.

412
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,770
If you change your mind someday, you can always come to find me.

413
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,240
You should know that Uncle Ling is also your family member.

414
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,790
The Ling family will always welcome you, okay?

415
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,170
Okay.

416
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,050
Everyone is hungry, right? Let's eat.

417
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,430
Eat. Eat. Eat.

418
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,680
Let's eat. Get Anxin some food.

419
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,610
Here. Second Brother, eat some fish.

420
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,540
He's allergic to parsley.

421
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,790
Look at how forgetful I am. Xin'er's the most thoughtful.

422
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,750
That's to be expected. At least, they were the closest in high school.

423
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,810
You can call them innocent playmates.

424
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,900
Moreover, their gorgeous looks complement each other.

425
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,480
The two of you knew each other back then?

426
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,890
We just went to the same school, that's all.

427
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,390
Here.

428
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,970
Second Brother, if I'm not mistaken, your watch and Sister Anxin's watch

429
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,010
are a customized couple model, right?

430
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,750
That's right.

431
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,290
Dad, it looks like you will be seeing Sister Anxin often in the future.

432
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,720
Ling Yue, you must treat Anxin well.

433
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,200
If she's mistreated even slightly, I won't let you off. Understand?

434
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,830
Dad, don't worry.

435
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,830
Anxin, eat.

436
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,350
Okay.

437
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,550
I picked out the parsley for you.

438
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,740
Ever since my second brother appeared, your gaze has never left him.

439
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,970
I know. The reason why you accepted my invitation to come to my house to eat

440
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,190
was because you knew he would be here.

441
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,080
Since you knew, why did you still bring me here?

442
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Because this is the first time you've ever accepted my invitation.

443
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,420
Even if it is because of my second brother, it is at least a good start.

444
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,520
My feelings for him won't change that easily.

445
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,820
I know, but that's okay.

446
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,370
Don't forget. You still owe me a date.

447
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,110
As you wish.

448
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,840
Where are we going?

449
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,410
Hey!

450
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,820
I wish you two a wonderful night.

451
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,820
Have fun.

452
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,820
Are they...?

453
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,300
President Ling.

454
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,220
- Ai Li! 
 - Hi.

455
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
Director Ling Fang... he...

456
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,280
It's going to rain soon. Let me send you back.

457
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,430
Are you coaxing a child? You're telling me it's going to rain when the weather is so nice.

458
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,310
Could it be that you prepared a surprise for me?

459
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,830
No, no, I really didn't!

460
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,990
I really didn't.

461
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,360
It's really going to rain. Let's go.

462
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,850
Okay. Let's go.

463
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,590
I finally understand why you hate your older brother so much.

464
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,150
He doesn't use money as he should. All he knows is how to make trouble.

465
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,470
I originally wanted to give you a surprise.

466
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,350
As long as I see the effort, it's fine!

467
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,200
Wait a second.

468
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,280
What is this?

469
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,050
Stupid, your face got dirty.

470
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,610
Anxin.

471
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Can we restart?

472
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,670
Then you have to promise that you will not hide anything from me in the future.

473
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,370
I promise you.

474
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,160
Now, what are you doing?

475
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,390
You owe me a dance from the Gu banquet.

476
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,730
♫  Walking across the long street at night with you  ♫

477
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,620
♫  Watching streetlights flash on and off  ♫

478
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,990
♫  We can see how far away our future is just 
 by turning our heads back  ♫

479
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:16,590
♫  We've yet to part but longing has already begun  ♫

480
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:25,370
♫   Hugging you like owning the whole world  ♫

481
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:31,310
♫   Too beautiful that I fear time is limited  ♫

482
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,410
You are my girlfriend now, so don't shirk your duties!

483
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,360
Say yes!

484
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,480
Yes.

485
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,430
Let's forget all the sadness from the past and create a new, better future. Okay?

486
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:04,730
♫  ...and learn to use warmth to cover up 
 the cold memories of the past  ♫

487
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:12,890
♫  We've walked with the scenery along our journey and stopped  ♫

488
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,920
♫  The story continues on as the camera makes 
 a full-length shot  ♫

489
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,770
Old Ling, are you not going to give it to the child just because she says she doesn't want it?

490
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,180
She... She is afraid that after she accepts my gift,

491
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,330
it'll confirm the rumors that outsiders spread regarding her mother and me.

492
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,590
This kid is a truly good kid.

493
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,860
Xiao Wan would rest easy knowing this.

494
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,450
Boss, are we going to give up like this? What about the shares?

495
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,970
What can we do? Didn't you see how those two were like Siamese twins?

496
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,530
That Gu Anxin...

497
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,060
is actually quite interesting,

498
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,970
but she isn't my goal.

499
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,910
As long as the shares don't fall in Number Two's hands, anything's fine.

500
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,690
You...

501
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,990
We're home.

502
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,950
Are you drunk or losing your mind? Why did you bring me here?

503
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,190
You will know soon.

504
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,650
♫  Meeting unexpectedly, those lost memories  ♫

505
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:18,360
♫  Illogical, too much like comedy  ♫

506
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,220
♫  That day of bad weather  ♫

507
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,220
♫  was good fortune that brought you into my life  ♫

508
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,430
♫  The flirtatious atmosphere spreads around us  ♫

509
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,170
♫  Unbelievably stimulates telepathy  ♫

510
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,890
♫  The you who appears aloof  ♫

511
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,930
♫  finally starts to reveal your childish self  ♫

512
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,620
♫  Were we destined to be together?  ♫

513
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,270
♫  Fate has already foreshadowed our path  ♫

514
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,760
♫  Resting against each other in sleep that dark night  ♫

515
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,730
♫  Absolute happiness is you by my side  ♫

516
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,130

517
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,760

518
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,500
 Breakfast is on the table. There's bottled water for you in the fridge.

519
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,830
♫  Absolute happiness is you by my side  ♫

520
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:47,190
♫  Are we destined to be together?  ♫

521
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,130
Do you want a drink? This is your favorite flavor.

522
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,630
♫  The future gives us both courage  ♫

523
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,690
♫  So don't suspect anymore, this must be love  ♫

524
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,510
♫  It's love  ♫

525
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,220
What exactly is going on?

526
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,600
I bought this house back.

527
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,760
I'm this house's landlord now and you're my tenant.

528
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,320
However, the rent period is everlasting.

529
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,550
You're not joking?

530
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,170
This is our contract.

531
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,000
But I added a condition on the back of it.

532
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,300
  I, Ling Yue,

533
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,260
 promise to rent the house and will only rent it to Miss Gu Anxin.

534
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,260
 I will never raise rent nor sell the house.

535
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,830
 If I ever go against the contents of the contract, it can be seen as purposefully relinquishing ownership of the house.

536
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,390
 The house will then belong to Miss Anxin.

537
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,770
This contract is too unfair for you, isn't it?

538
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,360
No, I think it's quite fair.

539
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm the landlord. You need to pay me rent.

540
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,380
It's very equal. Just like this contract.

541
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,930
Last time, I took advantage of it. Now it's your turn.

542
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,230
Thank you.

543
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,260
This was where our relationship started and now it is the continuation of it.

544
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,410
We will embrace each other tightly and never separate again.

545
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:10,920

546
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:18,610
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

547

♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

548
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,880
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

549
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,100
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

550
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,960
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

551
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,460
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

552
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,600
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

553
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:52,860
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

554

♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

559
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:29,830
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

560
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:35,860
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫
