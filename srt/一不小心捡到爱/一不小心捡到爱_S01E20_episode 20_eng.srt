1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,510
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,650
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,520
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,240
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,120
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,290
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,580
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,440
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,060
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,280
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,770
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,340
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,600
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,090
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,560
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,190
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,490
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,050
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,640

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,270

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,060
 Why must you do this?

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,630
 What makes you think I wouldn't do that?

24
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,330
 Because I know that you're not someone who will use any means necessary.

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,020
 Then you have to hurry up

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,780
 or else you may not be able to

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,360
 bear everything that comes later.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,880
 CEO Gu, the other company provided evidence that points out

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,900
 that Plan An is involved in large amounts of technological theft.

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,620
 You can't take pictures! Move!

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,450
 I hope you won't let your emotions affect your decisions

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,650
 and eventually become someone that you can't even recognize.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,810
What's wrong? It's so late and you're still not asleep.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,590
I can't fall asleep.

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,760
Would you like to drink a glass together?

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,010
Okay.

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,530
Someone gave me 10 bottles of wine.

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,510
Every year,

39
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,630
every flavor

40
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,350
is different.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,750
Are you talking about Ling Sheng?

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,260
Brother,

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,280
what kind of person do think Ling Sheng is?

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,770
Ling Sheng seems to have always been well protected by his family.

45
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,660
He's an outgoing person.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,250
Although it's true I don't like the people from the Ling family,

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,120
Ling Sheng is indeed different from the others in the Ling family.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,830
What's more important is that he's been serious about you all these years.

49
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I know,

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,160
but I'm very confused right now.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,310
I have no way

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,770
to completely let go of Ling Yue.

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,660
Xin'er,

54
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,610
every relationship has an overdraft limit.

55
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,820
Once withdrawals cannot be made,

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,160
there's no need to continue.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,790
If it weren't for the appearances of others,

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,680
my relationship with him wouldn't be what it is now.

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,260
I want to test it one more time.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
For the last time.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,660
It's Ling Yue.

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,300
Hello.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay, let's meet after the school anniversary then.

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,600
Ling Yue wants to meet you?

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
For what?

66
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,200
I don't know. Who knows what he's up to.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,980
Brother, can you help me go to the wine rack to get me another bottle?

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,670
Okay, I'll drink with you until you're satisfied tonight.

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,440
Wait for me.

70
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,650
 Tomorrow, let's arrive ahead of time, at 11:00.

71
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,520
 Let's meet at the small auditorium near the east corner of the school.

72
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,950
I didn't expect this place would already be abandoned.

73
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,040
Is it just like my memories with you?

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,520
They're also all being abandoned by you.

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,450
Why is it you? Where's Gu Ansheng?

76
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,300
My brother didn't come.

77
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,210
You kept avoiding me and not seeing me.

78
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,280
I could only use this method to invite you over.

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,300
I came to find Gu Ansheng to discuss the collaboration. If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,890
Why do you always avoid me each time you see me?

81
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,680
Do I look that scary?

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,430
Our time is very precious.

83
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,000
- Stop doing things that are meaningless. 
 - I know,

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,150
but this is the last time.

85
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,660
Let me finish what I want to say, what I couldn't say, and what I didn't have time to say.

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,020
Is that all right with you?

87
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,530
I locked all the doors here.

88
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,220
I also blocked all the signals.

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,720
- What on earth do you want to do? 
 - I want to make you stay.

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,520
I want you to reconsider and think it through.

91
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Who is truly your best decision?

92
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
You're wasting time.

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,560
Compared to a future life,

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,820
what does wasting this small amount of time matter?

95
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,800
Does revisiting this old place

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,030
bring a different feeling?

97
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
I know you're currently in the sweetness of love,

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,030
but I'm really not willing to believe it, nor can I be content that

99
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,010
that the person you chose at the end is her.

100
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,200
What decision I made

101
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,430
is my business.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,870
Brother Yue, we grew up together.

103
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,210
We don't need to waste another twenty years to understand and get acquainted with each other.

104
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,330
How can you confirm in these few short months that

105
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,980
your decision won't be a mistake?

106
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,840
As long as it's Anxin, there won't be a mistake.

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
If you want to keep talking about this to me,

108
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,190
there's no need to continue.

109
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,680
Since our childhood,

110
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,570
has there never been a time,

111
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,470
even a moment, where your heart fluttered for me?

112
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,410
We've known each other for so long.

113
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,680
To me, you were always a friend worth respecting

114
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,780
and being close to.

115
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,610
That's it.

116
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,600
Ten years.

117
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,910
I liked you for 10 whole years.

118
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,020
All of these years of our relationship

119
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,900
cannot even be compared to a few short months with her.

120
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,910
Since I chose Anxin,

121
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,190
I won't like anyone else.

122
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,020
Stop entangling yourself in something that won't have a result.

123
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,180
President Ling is not back yet?

124
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,700
President Ling did not come to work yet. There have already been a few important calls to him,

125
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
but they could not get in contact with him.

126
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,470
Hello?

127
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,870
Miss Anxin, do you know where President Ling is?

128
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,110
How would I know where he is?

129
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,090
 No one in the company can find President Ling,

130
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,470
and everyone is extremely worried.

131
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,250
When I woke up this morning, he had already left.

132
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,540
So he didn't tell you where he was going?

133
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,590
He didn't.

134
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,730
President Ling only told us that he was going to deal with the problems between you two.

135
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,710
With me?

136
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,860
Let me see if I can find a way to reach him.

137
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,730
Wait a moment.

138
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,290

139
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,790
 Sorry, your phone has not been answered at the moment.

140
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,360
 Please try again later.

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,500
 The school anniversary invitation.

142
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,220
 I know where he is!

143
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,720

144
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,520
 Ling Yue!

145
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,610
Ling Yue! Ling Yue!

146
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,440
Anxin!

147
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm glad you're okay. You scared me to death.

148
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,730
You're not angry at me anymore?

149
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,910
You did this on purpose?

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,580
I'm sorry. I made you worry.

151
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,840
You used my brother to invite Ling Yue here, right?

152
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,000
Your brother?

153
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,870
He's clearly my brother!

154
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,590
Gu Anxin,

155
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,950
do you like the things that belong to me so much?

156
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,030
I have zero interest in your things.

157
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,590
- What exactly do you want to do? 
 - What do I want to do?

158
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
Are you not at all curious

159
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,830
what Ling Yue has done to me in the past?

160
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,920
I don't want to know.

161
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,630
He and I...

162
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,920
had a past...

163
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,500
that no one can replace.

164
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,270
Don't you want to know?

165
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,110
I don't care.

166
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,880
Fine.

167
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,440
Then look at it yourself.

168
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,480
What can it prove?

169
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,770
Your relationship is great.

170
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,130
Gu Anxin, did you ever think about

171
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,450
what right you have to give him happiness? You already ruined Yu Guo's life,

172
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,800
and now you want to ruin mine? Ten years.

173
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,290
I waited for him for 10 whole years. What did you do for him?

174
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,320
You are just a mistakes-filled

175
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,580
person who didn't even graduate college.

176
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,370
I suddenly realize that my patience and holding back

177
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,310
could only be returned by certain peoples' limit breaching.

178
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,740
Gu Xin'er, let me tell you. I did nothing wrong to anyone.

179
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,030
From now on,

180
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,590
I am no longer going to be the Gu Anxin who allowed herself to be bullied,

181
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,890
the one who allowed herself to suffer in silence.

182
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,760
I will live properly,

183
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,250
loving Ling Yue diligently.

184
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,590
Please also live your life well.

185
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,100
Let's go.

186
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,800
Ten years!

187
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,000
I waited for you for ten years, but that can't even compare to the few months you spent with her, is that right?

188
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
Some things can't be measured this way.

189
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,980
Is it really not just a moment of impulse?

190
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,450
Anxin and I are not a momentary impulse.

191
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,200
And it was more than ten years. As for my relationship with you,

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
it's just like that picture.

193
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,990
Only a misunderstanding.

194
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,460
Ling Yue and Anxin have already left.

195
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,800
I just knew you would find me.

196
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,070
Then, what exactly was up with that kissing picture?

197
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,660
That was one of Ling Fang's past pranks. It was all a misunderstanding.

198
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,070
Then, if I see another picture like that in the future,

199
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,060
you're dead for sure.

200
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,130
I promise that nothing like that will happen again!

201
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,170
How can you smile? You were imprisoned by someone, yet you still smile.

202
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,820
I was just smiling at how someone just vowed sovereignty.

203
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,390
That's right. I've already made a vow of sovereignty.

204
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,440
Then you will only belong to me for the rest of your life.

205
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,250
Thus, the territory that is you cannot be divided by anyone else,

206
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,290
and in your heart, you can only have me. Understand?

207
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,410
- Are you going to be so bossy? 
 - I must be.

208
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,820
Okay. I obey.

209
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,820
Xin'er...

210
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,580
you don't look so well. Are you all right?

211
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,450
Why are you here?

212
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,470
Weren't you never going to care for me again?

213
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,930
It's my fault for being a disappointment.

214
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,730
As soon as I heard something was going on with you, I got so worried about you.

215
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,320
So I came without a second thought.

216
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,550
- That night... 
 - Nothing happened that night.

217
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,330
I asked a female worker at the hotel to change your clothes.

218
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,650
That night, you were so drunk that you went unconscious.

219
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,190
How could I take advantage of your situation?

220
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,280
Moreover, I know clearly that you don't love me.

221
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,250
Then, why did you ignore me?

222
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,190
I was just so angry at how you wouldn't love yourself properly.

223
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,310
Just like now.

224
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,810
You clearly know that that person doesn't care about you at all,

225
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,790
yet you aren't willing to give up and you're still in a painstaking struggle.

226
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,620
You already waited for him for a decade. Are you going to continue waiting?

227
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,150
How many decades will you have?

228
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,980
Is all of this worth it for you?

229
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,940
Actually, before you came,

230
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,060
there was still hate in my heart.

231
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,220
There was still blame.

232
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,660
And an unwillingness to admit defeat.

233
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,480
But at that moment where you suddenly appeared in front of me,

234
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,310
I suddenly felt relieved of it.

235
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,810
I said in my heart,

236
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,710
"Thank you, Ling Sheng."

237
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,900
No matter what state I'm in, you're willing to keep me company.

238
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,360
I promise you. This time,

239
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,610
I will definitely let go.

240
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,450
Let's go.

241
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,070
Okay.

242
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,990
Come on. I'll carry you.

243
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,110
That is what happened.

244
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,490
Yang Hong is a prime suspect in Yu Guo's matter.

245
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,000
Right! Why were you looking for my brother?

246
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,300
To discuss a collaboration.

247
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,460
It was always my uneasiness that got to me.

248
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,790
I always felt like he was the obstacle between us,

249
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,870
so I wanted to eliminate him.

250
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,530
But eliminating him wouldn't bring me anything.

251
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,250
It's the opposite.

252
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,580
Instead, it was destroying the people and things I loved.

253
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,370
No matter if it was you or the Sky Soar Plan,

254
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,410
I thought I should use another method to protect the people and things I love.

255
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,680
I can understand

256
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,860
your feelings of unease.

257
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,190
You're still the Ling Yue I love.

258
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,430
So you mean...

259
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,740
you don't love me when we argue?

260
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,800
But my feelings haven't lessened for you because of our fights.

261
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,500
I don't know who it was

262
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
who never said anything and kept it all in his heart.

263
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,370
What's wrong?

264
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,250
 I'm finally able to get in touch with you! Are you okay? Nothing's wrong?

265
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,680
I'm fine. I'm with Anxin.

266
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,790
 Your dad suddenly had a stroke and was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Hurry and come over.

267
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,550
- Eldest Auntie. 
 - Auntie.

268
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,340
- What's that situation now? 
 - The surgery is in progress and the doctor didn't say anything.

269
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,260
Dad was fine. How come he suddenly fainted?

270
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,120
How is he fine?

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
Your dad is so busy with work.

272
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,350
He hasn't taken a break in half a year.

273
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,860
Who was by his side when his illness acted up?

274
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,110
I was by dad's side.

275
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,620
Dad was in the study. He was fine,

276
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,330
but then he suddenly said he was dizzy. I thought something was wrong

277
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,200
so I immediately called Emergency.

278
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,810
When the ambulance arrived, he already fainted.

279
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,700
How long was the time period from when he fainted until he reached the hospital?

280
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,720
Doctor! Doctor!

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,040
The patient's condition is stable right now, but he still needs to be observed.

282
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,890
Anyone we ask says that he's stable. He's not awake. What do you mean by stable?

283
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,020
Currently, all signs indicate stability. Consciousness requires time.

284
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,130
Doctor, there are so many documents waiting for President Ling to sign.

285
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,960
Can you use better medicine

286
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,310
to allow President Ling to gain consciousness earlier?

287
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,980
Is the patient's health more important or signing the documents?

288
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,250
All three brothers are here.

289
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,120
Is there no one else in the Ling family?

290
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,850
Find us if there's anything.

291
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,270
I'll get going.

292
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,600
You've worked hard.

293
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,820
Regarding work,

294
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,770
let's talk after your dad wakes up.

295
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,110
I think before President Ling wakes up,

296
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,240
letting Director Ling Fang deal with everything

297
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,910
would be most suitable. After all, he is the eldest son in the family.

298
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,790
This doesn't seem like the rules.

299
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,310
How so?

300
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,970
The company has to have someone in charge.

301
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,980
No, after hearing President Ling was unconscious,

302
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,750
we shareholders discussed and decided to call a lawyer over.

303
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,290
Why did you guys notify a lawyer?

304
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,410
Everyone, this is Mr. Ling's signed

305
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,510
handover letter in case of emergency and his will.

306
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,280
President Ling is unconscious and not waking up so it's considered an emergency.

307
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,640
According to this document,

308
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,410
Mr. Ling Yue will be temporarily in charge of Ling Group.

309
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,620
President Ling Yue, since this is Old President Ling's intention,

310
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,340
then I'll have to trouble you to go back to the company with us.

311
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,870
There are a lot of things that you need to go back and handle.

312
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,280
President Ling Yue, if it's not taken care of in time and the information gets leaked,

313
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,870
it will affect the company and the stocks very negatively.

314
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,620
President Ling Yue.

315
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,280
Go ahead. I'm here. Don't worry.

316
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,860
Okay, I'll leave this to you guys.

317
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,040
Tell me immediately when Dad wakes up and I'll come over.

318
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,970
Take care.

319
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,680
Why are you looking for me?

320
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,600
I want to remind my old friend of a few things.

321
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,250
I know all that you want to say,

322
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,420
so you don't have to look for me in the future.

323
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,740
What about what happened in the past?

324
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,030
Don't worry.

325
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,490
This matter has already sunk deeply.

326
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,220
Ling Yue.

327
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,750
Ling Yue.

328
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,830
Ling Yue.

329
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,480
What's wrong?

330
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,890
Why are you sweating so much?

331
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,050
Did you have a nightmare?

332
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,090
I'll take you out for a walk, okay?

333
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,940
Here.

334
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,030

335
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,890
How is it? Are they cute?

336
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,100
There are more fun things downstairs. Let's go take a look.

337
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,790
Let's go.

338
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,870
There are sharks downstairs.

339
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,380
What are you guys doing? Can't you guys see that this area is under maintenance?

340
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,100
We already bought tickets.

341
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,340
You still can't go in even if you guys bought tickets. Come next month.

342
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,870
You can't go in.

343
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,410
Let's go.

344
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,920
What are you doing?

345
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,990
Carry me! Hurry, carry me!

346
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,250
Come in.

347
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,890
Welcome to the world of bad kids. Let's go!

348
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,620
 Who is it?

349
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,260
That's odd.

350
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,300
Do you know why I brought you here today?

351
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,360
Your feud with my brother reminded me

352
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,770
that we are all children who have been hurt before.

353
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,390
Even though wounds will heal,

354
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,830
scars won't come off.

355
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,840
But...

356
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
as long as we don't treat our fears as anything worth consideration,

357
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,690
memories will never be able to swallow us.

358
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,250
Just like today. We neglected the risk factor

359
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,400
so you could appreciate the present. Right?

360
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,010
I always wanted to get rid of the dangers that the environment brought me,

361
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,660
but I neglected that the largest source of uneasiness was always in my heart.

362
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,650
Anxin, thank you

363
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,960
for letting me experience firsthand

364
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
how one's situation is a result of their own decisions.

365
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,580
What I need isn't a fence,

366
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,750
but to walk out of the safe area.

367
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,310
Don't worry. You can do it.

368
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,570
I will always, always, always keep you company.

369
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,240
I'll have trouble you then.

370
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,450
Stingrays! Hurry! Stingrays!

371
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,480
Wishes will come true if they are made in front of stingrays!

372
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,580
- Is there really such a thing? 
 - Yes, I just came up with it.

373
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,170
CEO Gu, President Ling is here.

374
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,630
What's up? Are you here to declare war

375
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,400
or to settle the score?

376
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,080
Neither.

377
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,070
I'm here to talk about a collaboration.

378
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,550
President Ling,

379
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,060
why are you suddenly collaborating with your enemy?

380
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,250
If it's because of Anxin,

381
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,950
I don't think it's necessary.

382
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,890
I don't want the matters between the two of us to involve her.

383
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,110
I won't put her in a hard position.

384
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,810
It was Anxin who allowed me to understand the meaning of acceptance.

385
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,670
The method of fighting alone for a moment's benefit

386
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,350
cannot last.

387
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,700
I hope you can understand this as well.

388
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,360
Is this still the Ling Yue in my eyes

389
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,680
who is decisive and stops at nothing?

390
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,990
Because I now have concerns,

391
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,170
I became more candid.

392
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,620
Then, why are you so confident that I'll definitely collaborate with you?

393
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,960
This is your best choice now.

394
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,130
Also, I trust Anxin and the time she shared with you as family.

395
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Back then, the reason shaking hands was invented

396
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,990
was to tell others that there were no weapons in your hand.

397
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,650
Extending your hand out now

398
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,550
conveys...

399
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,680
an unwillingness to cause any harm to any party.

400
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,160
At the time, the reason I wanted to create 5G+ was because I was interested in the prospects.

401
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,420
It wasn't that I purposefully wanted to contend with you.

402
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,430
It's just that as I was working on it,

403
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,330
I deviated from my main intention.

404
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,410
What you mean is you didn't know beforehand?

405
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,760
President Liu didn't tell us that he was originally collaborating with you.

406
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,800
Are you still able to get in touch with President Liu?

407
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,410
I can't. After what happened to the Gu Group, we've been searching for him as well.

408
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,450

409
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,990
Ling Sheng,

410
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,660
didn't we say that you'd arrive in front of me at 10:00 sharp?

411
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,250
It's almost time. Where are you?

412
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,030
 I'm already here.

413
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,000
Where are you then?

414
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,740
 Walk out to the balcony and take a look.

415
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,690
Walk out to the balcony?

416
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,210
What are you up to? So mysterious.

417
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,940
Where exactly are you?

418
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,570
 Open it and take a look.

419
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,460
Where are you?

420
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,090
 Behind you.

421
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,750
This is...

422
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,670
Xin'er,

423
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,050
do you still remember this?

424
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,720
This is the first gift you gave me.

425
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,070
Although I know this was originally for my second brother,

426
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,130
I could never bear to wear it even once.

427
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm sorry. This is actually—

428
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,650
There's no need to explain. I understand it all.

429
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,820
But there's one thing you might never have known.

430
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,650
When you went abroad to look for my second brother,

431
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,160
I would secretly go look for you quite often.

432
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,670
Even though you never noticed me at any time,

433
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,340
and we would brush past each other,

434
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,350
as long as I could see you each time,

435
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,800
I always felt really satisfied.

436
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,350
I went across all the cities you visited.

437
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,750
I started to slowly collect these tickets and postcards.

438
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,520
I had already collected so many without realization.

439
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,300

440
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,450
How come you never told me this before?

441
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,750
Didn't you not tell my second brother of all the things you did for him either?

442
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,660
Xin'er, we're the same kind of people.

443
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,810
We loved too foolishly.

444
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,390
I'm telling you this now just to let you know,

445
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,970
when you were quietly watching my second brother, there was another person

446
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,220
who was quietly protecting you.

447
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,210
You don't have to love so arduously.

448
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,360
You deserve to be loved and cherished, too.

449
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,070
Ling Sheng.

450
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,790
Xin'er,

451
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,310
in the past, as long as Second Brother

452
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,750
took a step toward you,

453
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,810
you would run the rest of the path for him

454
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,750
without glancing back.

455
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,880
But did you know?

456
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,700
As long as you give a nod,

457
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,230
I can also run like mad for you

458
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,370
without looking back.

459
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,850
So are you willing to accept

460
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,250
the me who is willing to run like mad for you?

461
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,620
Thank you.

462
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,960
I love you.

463
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,230
 The patient has a nasal contusion. Routine blood test for blood clotting,

464
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,910
 STD screening, kidney function, electrolytes, etc.

465
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,270
 Gu Anxin?

466
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,370
 I seem to have no recollection of her.

467
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,990
 I can guarantee that no one will know.

468
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,220
 Don't let there be a next time.

469
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,930
Dr. Xiao.

470
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,560
Dr. Xiao?

471
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,380
I already looked at the report. The beginning is all pretty good.

472
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,490
It's just that at the end where the doctor's advice for the discharged patient is, aside from the most basic medicinal instructions,

473
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,710
you must also include some reasonable and specific

474
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,390
psychological

475
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,600
and daily life recommendations for the patient.

476
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,590
Got it, Dr. Xiao.

477
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,350
Thank you for instructing me during this internship period.

478
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,290
Let me ask you a question.

479
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,050
Why do you want to be a doctor?

480
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,720
I never had any far-reaching ambitions as a child.

481
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,450
However, I feel like the ability to be able to relieve pain and save lives

482
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,090
is a very noble thing to do.

483
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,370
If I can turn this kind of thing into a career,

484
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,890
I think...

485
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,530
my life would be more meaningful.

486
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,320
President Ling, Jack and the others have already arrived at the airport.

487
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,630
They will reach the meeting location in about 30 minutes.

488
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,870
 Bro, I feel so bad.

489
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,100
What's wrong?

490
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,520
 I don't want to continue staying like this. I want to resign!

491
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,940
Can you be more rational? Where are you now?

492
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,680
 I'm not good. I cannot be rational!

493
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,110
Xiao Yishan?

494
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,570
Hello?

495
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,240
Turn around and go to Xiao Yishan's house.

496
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Bro, you're here.

497
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,000
Drink with me.

498
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,710
Ai Li? I must be dreaming.

499
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,200
Dreams are wonderful. They include Ai Li.

500
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,200
Then, why did you come into my dreams?

501
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,300
You know to value love more than friends? Looks like you're not drunk.

502
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,200
You don't know how bad I feel.

503
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
I won't ever go to the hospital again.

504
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,550
Starting tomorrow, I will accompany Ai Li

505
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,000
to Wonderland.

506
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,200
I rarely see him like this. Just let him release it all for once.

507
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,460
Hello?

508
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,580
President Ling, Jack already arrived.

509
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,000
We must depart immediately.

510
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I can go to Jack alone. Keep him company.

511
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
- But— 
 - You're the one he needs right now.

512
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,600
Moreover, you've worked hard recently. Treat it like giving yourself a break.

513
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,000
Old Jiang, Old Jiang. Mentor Jiang.

514
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Why did you do such a thing?

515
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,800
Why?

516
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Is it because of Jiang Tao? Is it necessary?

517
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,500
You don't know how important he is to me.

518
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,540
He's my life mentor.

519
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Since you feel so bad and he's so close to you,

520
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,400
why don't you remind him to take responsibility?

521
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Do you know how many people he's saved?

522
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,800
Do you know he's the hope of many people?

523
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,400
If I were the one who sent him to prison,

524
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,800
how could I face him?

525
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,000
But if you avoid the problem this way, you will be letting Anxin and the others get hurt.

526
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,400
Moreover, your mentor is feeling just as tormented.

527
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,400
Aren't the closest people all like this?

528
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,600
It's hard to say it and face it.

529
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Just like you. Aren't you also avoiding my pursuit?

530
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,100
Look! Why?

531
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,400
Why?

532
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,800
Stop being like this. You can't solve the problem by acting like this.

533
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,700
But at least I can relieve the pain.

534
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Ai Li,

535
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,100
you're a robot.

536
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,800
Only I, Xiao Yishan,

537
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,600
understand how completely lonely you are.

538
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,600
- ♪ The gust of wind blows past my heart ♪ 
 - Xiao Yishan!

539
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,000
Stop singing and go to sleep.

540
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,200
- ♪ Its tears will never fall for me again ♪ 
 - Stop singing. Go to sleep.

541
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Stop singing and go to sleep.

542
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,000
L-Let go, Xiao Yishan.

543
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,600
I'm not letting go.

544
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,400
I want to keep hugging you until... forever.

545
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
- Let go first. 
 - I'm not letting go.

546
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
You'll fly away as soon as I let go.

547
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,400
I know you probably don't like me that much,

548
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,600
but can you give me a chance to like you?

549
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,200
L-Let go first.

550
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm not letting go unless you promise me.

551
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,000
Promise you what?

552
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,400
Promise...

553
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,230
to let us be together.

554
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,800
Say it.

555
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,900
Okay, I promise you.

556
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
President Ling said you had no food at home so he told me to bring breakfast for you.

557
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,170
It's all my favorites. Thank you.

558
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
And thanks to Ling Yue.

559
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Hurry and eat, then go to work.

560
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,000
Go to work? I'm not going.

561
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,800
I'm going to turn in my resignation letter today.

562
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm not working anymore. I'm resigning.

563
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,000
President Ling said he's not allowing you to resign.

564
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,600
What right does he have?

565
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,800
He's not my superior. I can do whatever I want.

566
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,300
Then, what if I don't want you to resign?

567
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,400
What?

568
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,200
Y-You're also not my superior.

569
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,600
What am I to you then?

570
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,500
Good friend.

571
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,800
That's right, good friend.

572
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,700
You don't know that I have people I don't want to see at the hospital.

573
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
I feel awkward when I see him.

574
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,400
I know.

575
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
You know? How do you know?

576
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,000
You said it yesterday.

577
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,700
Yesterday?

578
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,800
Yesterday, you were the one who took care of me?

579
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,600
Who else then?

580
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,800
I didn't say anything I wasn't supposed to, right?

581
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to do, right?

582
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,000
I also dreamed that I hugged you.

583
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Yes, in your dreams.

584
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
As long as it's in my dreams. In my dreams.

585
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,700
Xiao Ai is getting her vaccine today. Let's go together.

586
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,200
How come women change their temperaments at will? Why is she angry?

587
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,100

588
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,400
