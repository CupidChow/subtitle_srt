1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,970

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,490
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,550
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,510
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,090
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,380
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,570
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,440
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,350
♫  Happiness and sadness make up the moments of life  ♫

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,880
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,390
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,230
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

14
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,670
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

15
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,280
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,450
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

17
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,310
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

18
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,620

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,350

20
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,610
Where is Anxin? Where did you hide her?

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,890
Brother...

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,560
I think you're like a fly right now, buzzing around me every single day.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,290
You go eat. I'm not going to eat anymore.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,180
If you don't want to talk about it, I won't pressure you.

25
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,960
No matter what happened between you two, he was in the wrong. Right?

26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,680
Brother...

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,010
Mom, I can do it alone. You should eat more.

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,120
Eat more! You're about to move out.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,590
You can't have such good food anywhere else.

30
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,520
My house is just in the downtown area.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,600
You speak as if I'm going to study in another country.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,960
Then live at home!

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,990
The house is so big. It's not like there isn't space for you.

34
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,620
That's enough.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,210
Ansheng has already grown up and needs his own independence. It's a good thing.

36
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,320
What are you doing?

37
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,030
Oh, right, Dad! Anxin specifically ordered me to come back and spend time with you.

38
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,640
She's been thinking of you all this time.

39
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,710
She's thinking of me? If she doesn't anger me, then I thank the heavens and the earth!

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,730
She took a fine birthday banquet and made it into that mess,

41
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,480
embarrassing me in front of so many people!

42
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,910
Dad, Anxin didn't do it on purp—

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,460
Brother!

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,010
It's so hard for us to finally eat dinner together as a family.

45
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,370
Why does the topic have to go back to Anxin every few sentences?

46
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,990
- Anxin is also our family— 
 - Speak less, eat more.

47
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,570
 You let my mom down!

48
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,610
 Starting today, you have no more relations with the Gu family!

49
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,310
 Take your things and get out!

50
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,890
 Sir, it's been all packed up here.

51
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,010
-  Go ahead and move it out.
 - Okay.

52
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,650
 - Slowly, be careful not to break anything. 
 - All right, all ight.

53
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,400
 Here! There's this stuff, too.

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,290
 Got it.

55
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,390
Be careful with this chair. Be careful with the floor.

56
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,860
Got it, don't worry.

57
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,460
- Quickly. More nimbly. 
 - Sister Li!

58
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,520
- Anxin. 
 - What's going on?

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,990
You're awake. Perfect. Only the things in your bedroom haven't been moved yet.

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,550
Sir, go ahead and move the things from the room.

61
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,740
W-Wait. Wh-What's the meaning of this?

62
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,730
Didn't I tell you long ago?

63
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,490
Your lease was up last month.

64
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,810
If you didn't pay the rent, I would sell it. You should've made preparations long ago.

65
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,040
Next week, the buyer is moving in. I need to clean up.

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,290
I haven't found another place yet. Also, you did this so suddenly. Where am I supposed to find another place to rent?

67
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,830
That's not my problem.

68
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,220
- Over here, over here. Be more nimble! 
 - Okay, okay.

69
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,580
Be careful! Don't drop it on the ground!

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,040
Don't ruin my floor.

71
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,460
Young lady, where should we move these things?

72
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,870

73
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,210
- Brother. 
 - What happened?

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm sorry for arriving late.

75
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,520
Your landlord is so difficult. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

76
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,000
Renting is always like this anyway.

77
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,510
Don't worry, I'm here.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,360
I have an empty room. Would you like to move in directly?

79
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,980
That's not appropriate. I'd disturb your personal life.

80
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,160
Besides, if you bring over a future sister-in-law...

81
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,820
What kind of personal life do I have?

82
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,020
I only came back to the country a few days ago, and I don't even have many friends.

83
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,220
Even if I did, I need to let you come first.

84
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,930
I can't watch my little sister live on the streets.

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
Brother...

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,390
Silly child. You don't have to be shy around me.

87
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,990
The room's empty anyway.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,280
Fine then. Once I find an apartment, I'll move out right away.

89
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,290
Okay, I'll listen to you.

90
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,180

91
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860

92
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,510
 Xiao Yishan: What are you doing? You must listen to what I said

93
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,010
 Don't take the initiative to contact her!

94
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,430
 I have an idea for how you can make amends

95
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,220
 that will help you get Anxin back.

96
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,250
 - Tell me. 
 - You already know that I'm an expert when it comes to love.

97
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,050
 Since you've already sent her a lunch box made with love,

98
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,590
 you can't be the first to contact her.

99
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,680
 This is called giving a slap, then giving candy.

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,970
 That way you seize the right to take the initiative.

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,790
President Ling, Miss Anxin moved.

102
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,420
What?

103
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
 This is my new address.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,390
 I just got off the plane. I'll come and find you in a few days.

105
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,890
 Did you move to a big lake villa?

106
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,190
 [ never thought my friend would realize her dream of becoming a rich woman so quickly.

107
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
 Me? A rich woman?

108
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,830
 I don't know if I'll ever have that prospect in this life.

109
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,520
 I'm just benefiting off of my brother.

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,120
 It's his house.

111
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,090
 Your brother? The one you said is the most handsome student abroad?

112
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,200
 That's right. Haven't you been wanting to...?

113
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,150
 You wait for me! I'll go find you the moment I drop off my luggage!

114
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,920
 You value boyfriends over friends.

115
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,820

116
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,850
We're eating braised pig trotters today.

117
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,090
Okay! Is there anything you need my help with?

118
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,100
You can bring the apron over and help me put it on.

119
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,620
Okay.

120
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,690
Here! Let me help you put on your gear.

121
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,660
All right.

122
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,560
All right.

123
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,950
- Hello? 
   - Hello? Is this Mr. Gu?

124
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,430
 You have a package here. Please come to property management to pick it up.

125
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,090
A package? Okay, I'll come and get it soon.

126
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,130
Gu Ansheng said he'll come and get it soon.

127
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,560
President Ling, you were the one who said we had to wait until Gu Ansheng left before heading over.

128
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,920
Right. As long as he's there, Anxin won't give me a chance.

129
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,470
- Brother, you need to go pick up a package? 
 - Yes.

130
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,120
Then, while you're getting it, can you go to the supermarket to buy some good food?

131
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,040
I have an especially good friend coming over.

132
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,830
Okay.

133
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,960
Your drink!

134
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
 This is the kind of skin a guy should have.

135
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,280
 So pale and soft.

136
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,740
  I really want to pinch it.

137
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,210
 What godly looks. My goodness!

138
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,090
  Why is he winking at me?

139
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,230
  My blood will drain out.

140
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,960
  That damn charm.

141
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,280
I helped you get your drink.

142
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,820
Are you okay?

143
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,120
 Honey.

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,060
 What is our child's name?

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,340
- Let's call him Jeremy. What do you think? 
 - What?

146
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,280
Hi! My name is Xu Youyou.

147
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,720
Miss, your drink.

148
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,850
Then...

149
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,510
I will leave first.

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,730
Xu Youyou, Xu Youyou.

151
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,860
You should work out more.

152
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,120
You were almost successful in chasing your love!

153
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,480
He came back so quickly.

154
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,120
How can you eat my food and not acknowledge it?

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,700
I didn't eat it. I tossed it out.

156
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,730
You— Whatever.

157
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,370
I don't have time to entertain you.

158
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,150
I will treat it as my own house, so no need to entertain me.

159
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,100
You're pretty rude to just treat this as your home.

160
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,040
Everywhere you are is my home.

161
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,630
Wait. If I think about it, we've only known each other for a few months.

162
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,830
We're not that close.

163
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,740
Sometimes, even though certain people have only just gotten acquainted with each other, it feels as though they've known each other for a lifetime.

164
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,720
You don't have that feeling?

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,150
No.

166
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,110
I'm going to wash the dishes.

167
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,620
- I'll help you wash them! 
 - I don't need you to help me.

168
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,290
- Then let me cuff up your sleeves. 
 - No need.

169
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,920
I don't need—

170
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,190
Done.

171
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,190
Let me do it.

172
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,450
No matter how you push me away,

173
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,890
I have 100 ways to get closer to you.

174
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,750
Ow!

175
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,400
Hi, we meet again.

176
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,770
Hi.

177
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,000
Is this what they call,

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,970
"If two are destined, they will meet across a thousand li."

179
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,640
Where do you live?

180
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,080
I live here.

181
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,230
I also am in the 28th building!

182
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,880
What a coincidence.

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,780
- Do you need any help? 
 - Sure!

184
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,970
Wait!  Will it be a hassle?

185
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,110
No, it won't be.

186
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,910
  I was just waiting for you to say that, future husband.

187
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's go.

188
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,870
 He's got a face that can kill others just from handsomeness,

189
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,970
 yet he's not arrogant at all and he's so gentle!

190
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,910
 He's completely matches my ideal male lead!

191
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,610
 Am I dreaming?

192
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,400
Miss Youyou.

193
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,730
You didn't select a floor yet. Which floor do you live on?

194
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,960
The 18th floor.

195
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
What a coincidence!

196
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,270
Do you also live on that floor?

197
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,610
I live in 1808.

198
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,030
Can you be—

199
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,490
You are today's guest?

200
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,450
You are Anxin's brother?

201
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,720
I am Anxin's brother, Ansheng.

202
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,570
This is divine retribution, you know.

203
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,140
What kind of design is this?

204
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,550
There are dangers everywhere.

205
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,780
Who puts the spoon that high? What if you forget to close the cabinet someday, and it hits you?

206
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,780
You're the one who's incompatible with the place. How come nothing's happened to me?

207
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,900
It's all Gu Ansheng's fault.

208
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,520
Apologies.

209
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,070
This is my house, isn't it?

210
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,690
You are...

211
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,920
Miss Ai Li, right?

212
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,000
You are Xiao Ba's lover, Ai Li?

213
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,570
Who is Xiao Ba?

214
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,180
The little cripple who used to live in Anxin's house.

215
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,750
- There must be some misunderstanding— 
 - Anxin's house? 
 - See!

216
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,150
I knew it! These are the mistress's standard lines!

217
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,310
All dramas act things out like this. I've watched far too many.

218
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,170
I will repeat myself one more time.

219
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,350
If you continue to do this, I will call the police.

220
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,810
You Ling Group people like to barge into the homes of others so much.

221
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,990
If that kind of news spreads, it wouldn't bring very good effects to your image, would it?

222
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,640
You were the one who wasn't careful. Why are you blaming my brother?

223
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Your button.

224
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,220
- I'll help you button it up. 
 - I can do it myself.

225
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,100
- I'll help you. 
 - I don't need you to help me.

226
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,480
- Anxin— 
 - I don't need you to.

227
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,400
What are you doing—

228
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,940
Anxin, you need to do this kind of stuff in the bedroom!

229
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,240
No, Brother, we were just—

230
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,390
Anxin, wait here for a second.

231
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,680
President Ling!

232
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,660
Let him hit me!

233
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,200
Brother!

234
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,530
Ling Yue!

235
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,080
Why didn't you dodge it?

236
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,070
Your rejection hurts me more than his punch.

237
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,140
President Ling.

238
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,350
Let's go.

239
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,830
Ansheng, your hand is injured!

240
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,180
Does it hurt?

241
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,470
It doesn't hurt.

242
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,480
I just hate that I didn't beat that bastard up harder.

243
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,410
Brother, you really misunderstood.

244
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,570
I saw everything, yet you are still standing up for him?

245
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,760
- No, I— 
 - Wait, Anxin.

246
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,070
Isn't Xiao Ba's leg crippled?

247
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,530
How... What is this situation between you two?

248
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm getting confused.

249
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
I will explain it to you later on.

250
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,690
Let me do it. I learned nursing.

251
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,480
Brother, no matter what, hitting others is wrong.

252
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,120
He bullied you. Did you expect me to stand by and watch?

253
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,770
Okay. Don't let me see that man ever again.

254
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,120
I am seriously against you two being together.

255
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,250
I already explained to you that it was a misunderstanding.

256
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,450
- It was because my collar— 
 - Actually, I don't think this can be called bullying.

257
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,070
The two of them like each other.

258
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,680
It's just a couple's flirty banter.

259
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,960
- We aren't a couple! 
 - They aren't a couple!

260
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,730
Be careful.

261
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,880
That's what you get for not listening to me.

262
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,220
You just had to go there and find that girl.

263
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,480
Now, look where we're at. Not only did she not appreciate your kindness,

264
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,520
you even got injuries everywhere.

265
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,020
It wasn't completely without gain.

266
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,970
At least it's a good start.

267
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,240
Great. The hits damaged his brain.

268
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,560
President Ling, this time, Miss Anxin

269
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
should have forgiven you. Right?

270
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,410
What are you two whispering about behind my back? Are you having a secret meeting?

271
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,130
It hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

272
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,150
If I get fractured, there won't be anyone to apply medicine to President Ling!

273
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,150
I can put on medicine myself.

274
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,760
At a time like this, if you're not going to help me, at least don't support her.

275
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,610
- It' hurts! It hurts! 
 - However,

276
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,010
we still have use for Doctor Xiao elsewhere.

277
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,840
I can't get up. Help me!

278
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,460
The hands of someone who practices martial arts are quite soft.

279
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,160
If you dare to do this again next time, you are dead!

280
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't dare to!

281
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,770
 No way! That is too exciting!

282
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,500
 I announce that from today on,

283
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,380
 I no longer ship you two.

284
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,880
 I am Xiao Ba's antifan.

285
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,930
 Isn't he deceiving your feelings? He's the definition of a scumbag.

286
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,360
He is actually not a scumbag.

287
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,280
Forget it. Let's not talk about him, okay?

288
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,790
 But don't be upset.

289
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,920
 There's no man that my pretty little sister Gu Anxin can't get.

290
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,280
 You're just letting go of a little sapling

291
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,090
 in order to win a big forest.

292
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,650
 Don't worry. You can choose any cute man you want.

293
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,560
You're indulging me for no reason.

294
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,170
I have a feeling that you want a favor from me.

295
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,560
 It's nothing.

296
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,800
 Can you help me find out

297
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,590
 if your brother is still single?

298
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,030
Wow! Xu Youyou.

299
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,770
You want to become my sister-in-law?

300
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,820
 I'm shy!

301
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,120
Don't worry, leave it to me.

302
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,340
Don't let your own fertile water flow into someone else's field, understand? 
  (T/N: It's an idiom meaning that good things should be kept between those close to you. Gu Ansheng is the "fertile water" in this case)

303
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,410
 Thank you for your great kindness.

304
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,560
Don't! I'm going to throw up!

305
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,450
Quick! I'm hanging up!

306
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,390
 Are you asleep?

307
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,110
 How are you?

308
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,170
 How are you doing?

309
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,890
 I'm sleeping.

310
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,660
Is there no signal?

311
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,080
 Are you sleeping?

312
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,490
What is it, Brother?

313
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,990
 If you haven't slept yet, drink some milk.

314
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,780
Come on in.

315
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,730
Thank you, Brother.

316
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,270
Brother,

317
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,640
are you dating?

318
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
Why are you suddenly asking this question?

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,040
Are you dating or not?

320
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm so... stuffy.

321
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,090
Surely there wouldn't be any girls who wanted to date me, right?

322
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,500
No way. I remember when you were in college,

323
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,590
your backpack was filled with love letters every time you came home.

324
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,540
What do you think of Youyou?

325
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,450
She's quite energetic.

326
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,830
But don't get any of the wrong ideas!

327
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,350
- You've gotten shy. 
 - No, I haven't.

328
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,910
You've gotten shy! Look at that!

329
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,090
- You got shy! Youyou! 
 - I didn't.

330
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,730
Don't joke around.

331
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm hungry.

332
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,720
What woke me up this morning wasn't work.

333
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,020
it was breakfast.

334
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,700
You're up.

335
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,590
Why did you come out wearing so little? Aren't you cold?

336
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,280
It's very hot today.

337
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,700
That's still unacceptable. What if you catch a cold?

338
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,840
Go put on some pants.

339
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,910
Go, listen to me.

340
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,290
Thanks for your help.

341
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,850
Wait a moment!

342
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,790
Help me pass along a message. It's cooled down lately.

343
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,270
Also, wear more clothing and don't catch a cold.

344
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,160
Also! This breakfast is only for her,

345
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,780
not for the person named Gu Ansheng.

346
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,180
Remember, Gu Ansheng.

347
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,600
Gu Ansheng. Got it.

348
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,940
Hey, move over.

349
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,980
You don't even know how to flirt.

350
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,950
Let me teach you. When the time comes, say this.

351
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,090
Coming!

352
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,650
- Xiao Wang! 
 - Sister Anxin!

353
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,040
You moved into a new house so quickly!

354
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,730
This is the breakfast that Mr. Ling sent you.

355
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,250
Just tell him that I've already eaten breakfast today.

356
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,800
Give it back to him the way you got it.

357
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Sister Anxin, if you do this, I'll get fired.

358
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,200
 Ling Yue, you dare blackmail me?

359
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,210
Then give it to me.

360
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,210
Why don't you stay and eat breakfast before you go?

361
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,150
No, no, no, no.

362
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,580
My client has a message he wanted me to send you.

363
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,220
"Anxin, the weather outside is very cold today."

364
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,910
"Remember to wear a coat when you go out."

365
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,230
"Also, I know you're still mad at me."

366
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,110
"That's why I have kindly disappeared."

367
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,760
"But please accept the kind intentions I put into

368
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,570
making this loving breakfast for you."

369
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,650
"Remember, you must eat all of it without leaving any scraps."

370
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,380
"Don't split it with unimportant people. Good morning."

371
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,820
"I love you more today than I did yesterday."

372
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,500
Ling Yue said this?

373
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,340
Yes.

374
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,870
- I got it. I'll see you at work. 
 - Okay.

375
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,840
"Love you."

376
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,020
You scared me.

377
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,000
Brother!

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,900
That's too... wasteful.

379
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,440
I can make you whatever you want to eat.

380
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,130
No need to accept his kindness.

381
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,710

382
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,100
Hi, sisters! What kind of little meeting are you having?

383
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,510
Come quick. I'll tell you a huge secret.

384
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,440
- Ai Li and President Ling are together! 
 - Ai Li and President Ling are together?

385
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
Talk softly.

386
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,380
They're keeping a low-profile relationship.

387
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,940
If you leak the news, that'll be bad.

388
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,200
When did this happen?

389
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Why so suddenly?

390
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,740
How is that sudden?

391
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,020
This morning, when I went to report my work,

392
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,430
President Ling suddenly stopped Ai Li.

393
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,930
 Wait a moment.

394
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,100
 Was the breakfast eaten?

395
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,520
 Yes.

396
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,000
 That's all.

397
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,030
 You may go now. I have some business with Ai Li.

398
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,750
 All right.

399
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,320
Such a shame.

400
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,480
I didn't even get a chance.

401
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,690
Stop moving your mouth!

402
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,880
President Ling, I'll wait for you outside.

403
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,340
Okay.

404
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,830
You came at the perfect time.

405
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,040
I have to go on a business trip for a few days—

406
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,180
While I'm on my business trip, help me take a look at

407
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,330
the plan we discussed to make Anxin happy.

408
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,990
Why are you looking at me so wretchedly?

409
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,570
Your business trip.

410
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,360
Is it with Ai Li?

411
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,820
Yes.

412
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,100
Then everything is true?

413
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,880
Otherwise, would it be fake?

414
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,520
Then you tell me,

415
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,970
your liking Anxin is all fake, too.  Yes or no?

416
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,490
Of course, it's real.

417
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,430
What exactly are you trying to say?

418
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,040
Tell me truthfully!

419
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,460
You have never thought about doing something

420
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,170
with Ai Li? After all, she's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,210
Don't you like her?

422
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,950
How did you know? Does Ai Li know?

423
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,770
I don't have time to fool around with you.

424
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm going. Don't forget our plans.

425
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,610
Ling Yue!

426
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,790
Don't tell Ai Li!

427
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,940
My goodness!

428
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,970
Look!

429
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,430
Anxin! You're finally here.

430
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,390
We've been feeling sour all morning.

431
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,310
Come quickly, look!

432
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,250
- What's going on? 
 - Here.

433
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,230
First Batman, right?

434
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,450
We've met again so soon.

435
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,870
What a coincidence.

436
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,130
Come in first.

437
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,140
I just need to get this package to you. I'm leaving.

438
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,150
Is this your company's service attitude?

439
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,750
Didn't they say there were no bad reviews?

440
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,380
Is it time for me to make some contribution to your company's bad review count?

441
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,430
Client, do you need something?

442
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,180
Yes.

443
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,610
Here, come on in.

444
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,100
How is it? Surprised?

445
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,120
It was a scary surprise. You—

446
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,810
Don't get agitated.

447
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,900
Sit anywhere. Sit!

448
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,070
Have some wine.

449
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,040
This wine is too expensive. I don't want to drink it.

450
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,980
Expensive? Then have some cake.

451
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,720
Can I not eat?

452
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,300
What do you think?

453
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,720
What... What is the meaning of this?

454
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,290
It's a gift for you.

455
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,800
It's a gift for me? You shoved it into the cake?

456
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,120
What if I broke my teeth on it? I even don't have the money to get fake teeth.

457
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,100
Director Ling, what exactly do you want?

458
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,680
I just want to sit and have a nice conversation with you.

459
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,330
Is that okay?

460
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,750
Did you receive what I sent? Do you like it?

461
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,710
You sent me those bags?

462
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,340
I like giving pretty girls like you

463
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,860
little things like that.

464
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,720
That's true. That poop shade of yellow

465
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
would only be liked by you.

466
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,820
What did you say?

467
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,910
That poop shade of yellow

468
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,400
- would only be liked by you. 
 - Hey!

469
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,910
Fine. It looks like you still don't know what you want.

470
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,270
Then I'll give you one more gift.

471
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,310
I hope you'll like it.

472
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,920
- What is this? 
 - Open it and see.

473
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,260

474
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,470
What move are you playing now?

475
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,870
Sign it.

476
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,210
Then, the Fangyu Construction Mansion villa will be yours.

477
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,890
- So I only have to sign 
 - Yes.

478
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,760
- and I'll have a big villa? 
 - Exactly.

479
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,150
- I won't have to be a delivery person. 
 - Right.

480
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,760
And I can stay at home collecting rent every day—

481
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,070
Is there something wrong with you?

482
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,490
You're sending me bags, a car, and a house.

483
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,930
What are you trying to do?

484
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,250
Then what do you like? Whatever you like, I can...

485
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,220
I just like money.

486
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,850
What a coincidence.

487
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,400
Money is the only thing I have an abundance of.

488
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,750
Give me a number for you to leave Ling Yue and be my girlfriend.

489
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,210
¥1,000,000?

490
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,570
¥10,000,000?

491
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,410
¥100,000,000?

492
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,610
I couldn't tell from looking at you.

493
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,980
You're quite small, but your appetite sure isn't small.

494
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,170
- Fine, then I'll— 
 - One good review.

495
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,340
Anxin, why do you keep rejecting me out to thousands of miles away?

496
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,110
- I'm sincerely— 
 - You're sincerely trying to make things difficult for me.

497
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,800
Since you're so unwilling to give me a good review,

498
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,080
you can do whatever you want.

499
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,870
Didn't you say you wanted me to be satisfied?

500
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,590
Yes.

501
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,050
You've already sent me so many gifts.

502
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,050
It's only right that I give you a gift.

503
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,710
- What gift? 
 - Perfume.

504
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,960
What perfume?

505
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,730
What did you spray?

506
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,300
How is Six God? 
  (T/N: a mosquito repellent)

507
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,150
I also took someone's suggestion to add some Sichuan hot pepper. Is it refreshing?

508
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,100
I won't go blind, will I?

509
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,390
It won't go so far as to make you blind.

510
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,420
Instead of wailing here, you'd be better off using this time to go wash your eyes.

511
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,430
I'm warning you, don't casually try to seduce young women.

512
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,420
Remember this lesson. Goodbye.

513
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,250
She's interesting.

514
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,230
 If you're so unfortunate as to meet a pervert,

515
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,790
 use this Six God spray infused with Sichuan hot pepper

516
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,900
 and spray it crazily into his eyes.

517
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,610
 Hello, I am the #888 robotic vacuum that you drew from the lottery.

518
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,430
 I'll suck away your unhappiness.

519
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,050
 Please go to the Lin'an Bridge to retrieve me.

522
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:21,760

529
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,500
- Good. Take this. 
 - Thank you.

530
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,190
- Take it. There are two in total. 
 - Thank you.

531
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,820
- Take care. 
 - I'm sorry, Manager. Today is my last day at work.

532
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,260
I still haven't managed to get all good reviews. I've held everyone back.

533
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,600
How about this? You can deduct my pay.

534
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,950
That way, I can feel more at ease.

535
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,660
Anxin, you have already achieved a perfect five-star review.

536
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,790
The customer specifically made a phone call thanking you for sending his things to him just in time.

537
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,770
 That guy seems pretty perverted, but his heart isn't bad.

538
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,350
- Anxin? 
 - Please, go on.

539
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,150
Everyone, come over!

540
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,510
Here, this is for you.

541
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,540
Anxin, even though you will soon leave our Express Delivery Service,

542
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,180
I ask that you remember

543
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,960
we will always be your colleagues!

544
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,730
 - That's right! 
 - Yes!

545
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,760
How has Anxin been recently?

546
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Miss Anxin has already quit her job at Express Delivery Service.

547
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,180
- Tell Brilliant Worldly Culture to take extra care of her. 
 - Okay.

548
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,280
Right, President Ling! Director Ling Fang has recently been rather active.

549
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,770
Don't worry about him. Let him do as he pleases.

550
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,680
It's not work-related. Recently, he keeps hanging around Miss Anxin.

551
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,330
- Make a U-turn. 
 - Okay.

552
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,030
Anxin.

553
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,510
We're really brought together by fate.

554
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,870
- Do you need something? 
 - I was in the wrong that day. I'm here to apologize.

555
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,670
This is a gift I prepared for you as a token of my regard.

556
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,180
Director Ling, we aren't friends just because you left a good review. Do you understand that?

557
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,990
We may not be friends today, but that doesn't mean we won't be tomorrow.

558
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,370
Besides, there's the day after tomorrow, and the day after that. Take this!

559
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,170
The bags and other strange things you gave me,

560
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,330
I sent them all back to you. You should have received them.

561
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't do these kinds of things in the future. It's really childish.

562
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,790
How come I just can't seem to do it?

563
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,130
- You can't do it? 
 - Hey, hey.

564
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,970
I'm just giving you a gift to express my apology.

565
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,440
If you don't want it, throw it away.

566
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,670
Sorry about that, I didn't—

567
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,190
My heart is beating so fast it'll explode.

568
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,910
I'm going to throw up, you're disgusting.

569
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,880
Let her go!

570
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,090
Couldn't you see that Anxin and I were being intimate? Why are you running over to be a third wheel?

571
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,770
Who was being intimate with you?

572
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,550
Did you forget the Six God incident?

573
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,310
Look!  She's even concerned for me.

574
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,430
Elder Brother, is this where it hurts?

575
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,310
Or here?

576
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,980
No, no, wait.

577
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,330
It doesn't hurt.

578
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,250
- It doesn't hurt anymore, does it? 
 - No, it doesn't hurt.

579
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,520
That's good then. I'll go now.

580
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,890
What about you?

581
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,800
Second Brother, your leg just got healed. Take care of yourself.

582
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,670
Are you hurt?

583
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,860
Let's go.

584
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,430
Are you okay?

585
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,590
You can go to the briefing by yourself first.

586
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,170
All right.

587
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,780
 When did she get so close to Ling Fang?

588
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,800
 Could it be that something happened in the two days I was on my business trip?

589
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,880
 My wrist hurts and he doesn't even show any concern for me.

590
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,660
- If you don't drive, I'll get out of the car. 
 - Wait.

591
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,830
Q-Qiuhong Garden, thank you.

592
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,470
Then I'll go now.

593
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,660
What's wrong?

594
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:20,680
