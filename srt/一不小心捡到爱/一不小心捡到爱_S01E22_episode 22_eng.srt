1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,520
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,650
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,510
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,130
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,370
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,660
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,480
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,060
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,330
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,730
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,370
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,640
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,150
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,550
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,250
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,530
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,060
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,590

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,390

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,220
How are you two doing?

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,920
We're fine.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,980
How did you find me?

25
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,570
 We already have Ling Yue on the hook. Let's meet in half an hour.

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,240
 - Ling Yue? 
 - We've seen him come a few times before.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,450
 I assume someone in the company got in trouble and hired him to deal with it.

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,910
 Follow him.

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,590
What'd you think? Did I come just in time?

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,980
When I did that just now, did I look like a superhero?

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,890
Thank you, Brother.

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,920
You're thanking me? It's not like I came to save you.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,050
It's just that only I'm allowed to pick on you. No one else can.

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,770
Then be kinder to your younger brother in the future and stop plotting against him.

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,890
That really was a misunderstanding.

36
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,950
It's true. I originally did want to do something,

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,750
but who would've known that those idiots wouldn't even open the car door?

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,220
They took a stroll and then returned.

39
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,930
 - He switched lanes! Did he notice us? 
 - Don't fret. We'll catch up with them at the next crossroad.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,640
It wasn't you?

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,120
 On the day President Ling went missing, we saw through parking lot security cameras that your car also happened to be there.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
 Why didn't you tell me earlier?

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
 I didn't even know my car had something like that.

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,050
Ling Sheng!

45
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,160
Impossible.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,660
Back when the anniversary celebration collaboration was leaked to Gu Group,

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,350
I thought our Ling Group had a mole in it.

48
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,290
Also, a while ago, about the instigator of the turmoil between New Way and Gu Group,

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,340
only an insider would be able to leak the Sky Soar Proposal Plan to President Liu.

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,490
Just then, in that contract I signed,

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,590
even though the name of the benefiter was hidden,

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,820
it bore our dad's official seal.

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,350
The seal has always been in our family's safe,

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,750
and only Ling Sheng can take it out.

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,940
And he's the only one who can be in possession of the collaboration plan and Sky Soar Plan at the same time.

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,200
Right.

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,090
He recently has been together with shareholders and head managers of many departments a lot.

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,730
This time, Allen kidnapped Anxin to threaten me into signing the transfer of shares.

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,730
I think this must have something to do with him!

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,230
Anxin!

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,440
Brother?

62
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,530
How did things get like this?

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,530
Why are you here?

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,520
She's awake.

65
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,740
Yu Guo, how are you feeling?

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,600
Tell us. Who is your accomplice?

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,530
Kill me.

68
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,900
Yu Guo, stop lying to yourself.

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,680
We were all locked together just then, and the natural gas was also leaked.

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,350
If Ling Fang hadn't come, we all would have died in there.

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,000
It's impossible. She wouldn't.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,070
Yu Guo!

73
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,050
The person who you speak of

74
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,590
is Yang Hong, right?

75
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,530
 Child, don't be afraid.

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,530
 From today forward, I am your family.

77
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,900
 From today forward, I will take good care of you.

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,320
 Auntie Hong, you are so good to me.

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,740
 I don't even know how to thank you.

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,040
 I'm atoning for Anxin's deeds.

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,960
 She's my adoptive daughter. Our entire family has wronged you.

82
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,550
 Slowly. Don't be anxious.

83
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,490
 Don't blame yourself.

84
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,560
 The one in the wrong was the one who harmed you.

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,990
 She will pay.

86
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,370
So you had picked up on it long ago.

87
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,710
I saw my mother's account books.

88
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,740
She had been continually transferring a fixed amount of money to Yu Guo.

89
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,840
So I started to suspect.

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,840
So she could both force Ling Yue to sign a transfer of shares and get rid of you both.

91
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,890
- It truly is killing two birds with one stone. 
 - Transfer of shares?

92
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,770
To who?

93
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,620
Ling Sheng.

94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,980
My mother has already set a date for Ling Sheng and Xin'er's wedding.

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,060
We don't have any evidence that can point at them right now.

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,550
Accusing them rashly is even less beneficial to us.

97
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,950
Return. Treat it like we're really dead.

98
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,820
I will secretly arrange for someone to gather evidence.

99
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,120
You must not leak anything.

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,600
This is the only way.

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,030
We can still stall for some time.

102
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,950
Speak. What do you need my help with?

103
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,350
Take care of Yu Guo and deal with all of the follow-up work.

104
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,840
You must make the fake deaths look real.

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,770
I'll find a way.

106
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,820
Why would a fire start? Give me an explanation.

107
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,860
The weather is so dry that it's very normal for fires to start.

108
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,490
Isn't this the perfect way to get rid of evidence?

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,060
If any flaws appear, you know the consequences.

110
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,810
Rest assured, Boss. I had already locked the door.

111
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,900
Also, there was no one in the vicinity.

112
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,550
When I left, they were already at their last breaths.

113
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,350
Even with that good-for-nothing Yu Guo, they wouldn't be able to escape.

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,210
I can't feel at ease without seeing the bodies of the dead.

115
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,900
When you get the chance, go back and take a look.

116
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,780
Okay, I won't let them show up in front of you alive.

117
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,420
Allen, you're the only one I trust right now.

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,170
Relax, our whole family was saved by you.

119
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,020
I will definitely help you clear all obstacles.

120
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,250
 Ling Yue.

121
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,790
 Ling Yue.

122
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,800
 Father, can I help?

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,500
 Small child, don't get in the way. Call your second brother over.

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,330
 I can only feel assured when the task is given to Ling Yue.

125
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,510
 Ling Yue can do it well. He's my most promising child.

126
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,910
 I'm willing to help my dad share the burden, not just my brothers.

127
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,600
 The business world is like a battlefield. You must make a clear differentiation between friend and foe. The most important thing is

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,550
 you must have strong weapons.

129
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,680
 Boss, what's the next step?

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,390
 I originally wanted to use Gu Ansheng to drag New Way down,

131
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,300
 but unexpectedly, not only did Ling Yue not fall into the trap, but he also collapsed Gu Group.

132
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,490
 Still, it's not completely without its gains.

133
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,820
 - Don't lose your guard. Continue monitoring closely. 
 - Understood.

134
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,910
 When the earth-shattering news of New Way selling expired products and counterfeits arrives,

135
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,330
 their sales will definitely be negatively impacted.

136
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,330
 Now, it will be hard for Ling Yue to become the Ling Group's savior.

137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,660
 At the time, transferring Group assets in the name of the project

138
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,350
 resulted in the company falling into a state of loss.

139
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,670
 Now, we have also cut off Ling Yue's rescue route.

140
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,750
 Now, as long as you make your overpowering move and move against the tide,

141
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,030
 the shareholders will only validate you.

142
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,370
 But I didn't expect that this would provoke my father and cause him to suddenly be hospitalized.

143
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,460
 Even more unexpectedly, he sent out an emergency business sign-over letter in private.

144
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,910
 According to this document, Ling Group will temporarily be led by Mr. Ling Yue.

145
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,800
 Ling Yue ruined my plans again.

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,970
 I could only use a hard tactic.

147
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,450
 Last time, Du Ming was too useless.

148
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,890
 This time, we will use Gu Anxin to threaten him directly. Ling Yue will definitely come.

149
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,070
 Remember. Do it at any cost.

150
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,080
 You must make him sign.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,870
 Whether they live or die can be decided by Yu Guo.

152
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,050
This is it.

153
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,030
After all these years, Brother Wu still likes to hide the key under the flower pot.

154
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,990
Who exactly is this Brother Wu you keep speaking of?

155
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,440
After I dropped out of school, I came to Little Fish Village and made some good friends.

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,780
That Brother Wu was one of them,

157
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,840
but was the most skilled of them and the one who treated me the best.

158
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,230
Then is this Brother Wu you speak of

159
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
good-looking?

160
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,330
Incredibly good-looking.

161
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,150
Every time I think of Brother Wu's radiance and long strides,

162
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,290
I feel like all girls' hearts will beat nonstop.

163
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,770
- Brother Wu! 
 - Anxin.

164
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,950
Watch your image. Control yourself.

165
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,160
There's someone here.

166
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,400
Turns out Brother Wu's a woman.

167
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,190
Judging from my appearance,

168
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,660
I am indeed a woman.

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,170
Ling Yue.

170
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,900
Brother Wu.

171
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Tell me. What do you need my help with?

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,390
I want to ask you to deal with someone named Allen.

173
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,230
No problem. Give me his information and I'll deal with him.

174
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,260
Thank you very much. If you ever need anything in the future, I will grant it.

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,030
 Watch Anxin carefully. Ling Yue will definitely come.

176
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,260
 After you get what you need,

177
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,910
 let the two of them stay together properly for a while.

178
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,360
What's wrong, Ansheng? You look unhappy.

179
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,330
Eat.

180
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,100
Mom,

181
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,520
what about our current life

182
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,090
are you still unsatisfied with?

183
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,360
Why are you asking this out of the blue?

184
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,820
Not... Not much of a reason.

185
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,700
I've recently just been a bit lost.

186
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Dad, I've already applied to return to school. I'm leaving in two days.

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,970
How can you leave just like that?

188
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,800
I remember you promised me.

189
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,550
There are so many things at the company that are waiting for you to be dealt with!

190
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,090
Yes, Ansheng.

191
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,790
Your father is old now, and he doesn't want you to leave.

192
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,280
The company also needs you.

193
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,370
I'm full. You can continue.

194
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,370
Brother!

195
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,190
What happened to that child?

196
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,920
Xin'er,

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,880
did he not say anything to you?

198
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,110
No.

199
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,390
Mom, don't be too concerned.

200
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,810
Brother is just like this.

201
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,780
 Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be connected.

202
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,290
 Sorry, the—

203
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,810
Why can't I get in contact with Yu Guo?

204
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,910
Did anything happen?

205
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,730
 That is not possible. Things were handled well.

206
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,920
 Don't contact her again.

207
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,700
 What... What did you do with her?

208
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,120
 I just made things look more natural.

209
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
 Relax.

210
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,800
I don't care what you do.

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,050
Just make sure Gu Anxin disappears completely.

212
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,320
What are you doing?

213
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,350
I'm asking what you are doing?

214
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,220
That thing they sent me,

215
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,590
where did I put it?

216
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,930
What thing?

217
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,490
Is it the equity collaboration agreement?

218
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,030
Yes.

219
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,130
I just gave it to you, and you put it on your desk.

220
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,540
- You gave it to me? 
 - Yes.

221
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,780
Why don't I have a recollection?

222
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,540
What's wrong with you lately?

223
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,690
How about you go to the hospital to get a full examination?

224
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,230
No need. I know my own health.

225
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,200
President Ling, I'm sorry.

226
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,760
It's all because of my neglect that you got so severely injured.

227
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,360
No need to blame yourself.

228
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,780
If they are set on killing us to silence us and force our deaths,

229
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,520
they would've chosen some other way if this one hadn't worked.

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Later, go back. Cooperate with us to act out this skit.

231
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,200
But if I leave, who can ensure your safety?

232
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,750
Do as I say. Make them believe we truly died.

233
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,690
These people really are ruthless.

234
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,710
Considering how they hit your head like that,

235
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,390
it's lucky that you didn't get a concussion and a hemorrhage.

236
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,150
Are you sure no one saw you come?

237
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,030
We came by car and boat.

238
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,840
It's so remote. Who would follow?

239
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Besides, Ai Li and Brother Wu have already confirmed that no one followed.

240
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,050
Now we can confirm that the kidnapping was planned by Yang Hong and Ling Sheng.

241
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,880
Since they want to cause our deaths,

242
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,100
we will counteract their plans by faking our deaths.

243
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,300
In the meantime, I will find someone who can collect evidence of Yang Hong's and Ling Sheng's crimes.

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,840
Yu Guo's situation has also essentially been handled.

245
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,780
So no one else will know we are alive.

246
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,530
Although we are right about the situation, we don't have enough evidence.

247
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,160
We cannot make a conclusion so soon.

248
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,890
You mustn't expose anything.

249
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,580
Anxin and I will stay here.

250
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,180
I've already given the order to my eldest brother. He will deceive Xiao Sheng

251
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,440
and naturally spread the news that we are already dead.

252
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,130
I'll leave the care of my father to you.

253
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,180
Rest assured.

254
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,910
What kind of thing must be discussed behind a closed door?

255
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,170
Isn't it true that we haven't chatted alone together in a long time?

256
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,690
I wanted to have a proper discussion with you.

257
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,540
What do you want to say? Go ahead.

258
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,760
Mom,

259
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,320
do you remember when we first came to the Gu family,

260
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,350
you told me you were going to give me a great father

261
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,580
and a complete family?

262
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,630
Do you remember?

263
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,850
Do you still remember when you were newly divorced from my dad,

264
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,900
you took so many jobs all by yourself?

265
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,560
Then, you told me to study well

266
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,660
and to not worry. Do you remember?

267
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,500
Did you think I was too young and forgot about all of it?

268
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,250
But the truth is that I always remembered.

269
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,230
I know that all these years,

270
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,190
I know that all these years, for me and Xin'er,

271
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,190
you've already carried so much. I know that.

272
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,330
Son...

273
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,060
you and Xiner's happiness

274
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,850
is my greatest wish.

275
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,920
Mom, Xin'er and I have already grown up.

276
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,860
Neither of us needs you to worry anymore.

277
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,480
We can both give you a stable life.

278
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,060
The most important thing for our family is to be safe and sound, isn't it?

279
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,040
Let's stop fighting for the things that aren't meant for us, okay?

280
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,660
What fight?

281
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,820
Mom.

282
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,820
Mom, ever since childhood,

283
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,570
ever since childhood, I have always listened to you. Isn't that right?

284
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,360
I never added trouble for you or requested anything of you, right?

285
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,170
Just this once... Just this once, listen to me, okay?

286
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,250
Son, I don't understand what I'm supposed to listen to you for?

287
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,960
What do I need to listen to you for?

288
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,120
Let go, Mom. It's not too late. Let go.

289
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,790
By doing this... By doing this, have you considered the consequences?

290
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,950
Will Xin'er be happy? What about this family?

291
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,170
What are you talking about? I don't understand at all.

292
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,260
And Anxin. The Gu family owes Anxin too much.

293
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,360
We owe Anxin too much!

294
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,620
Stop mentioning Anxin! She's not part of the Gu family anymore!

295
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,080
When I was young, you taught me,

296
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,240
if we committed a wrongdoing,

297
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,930
we would have to pay for it eventually.

298
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,570
What wrongdoing did I commit?

299
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,260
What wrongdoing did I commit to make you accuse me over and over? Tell me!

300
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,480
The transfer of assets.

301
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,660
I saw the Gu family account books.

302
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,560
Aside from you, no one else has the authority.

303
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,930
Son, I'm just changing the place the company assets

304
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,550
are located.

305
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,410
We are family.

306
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,600
Your father's things are our things.

307
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,030
Is this wrong?

308
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,540
What did I do wrong?

309
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,560
Stop overthinking.

310
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,290
I understand.

311
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,610
Don't think nonsense.

312
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,460
I feel like this day has been extremely long.

313
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,500
You didn't sleep at all. Are you not tired?

314
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,590
Didn't we agree to watch the sunrise together?

315
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,380
But I didn't expect that it would feel like the calm before the storm.

316
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,550
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,130
I could've given you better.

318
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,500
We are alive together.

319
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,300
There's nothing better than this.

320
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,400
We will never separate again.

321
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,940

322
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,530
Everyone, my second brother Ling Yue has already transferred all of his equity shares to me.

323
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,980
- This is the transfer of equity document. 
 - Did something happen?

324
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,540
I don't wish that anyone has any further doubts.

325
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,740
Our top priority is to lead the Ling Group back on track.

326
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,400
I must emphasize one more thing.

327
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,800
I don't hope that anyone adds personal feelings to their work.

328
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,110
I hope everyone keeps this in mind.

329
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,080
Why would he transfer equity to him?

330
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,660
 - This is ridiculous! 
 - It was so fast. 
 - Exactly.

331
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,460
 How could this happen?

332
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,700
What are you all doing?

333
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,570
Who are you pouting to?

334
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,390
We two Ling family heirs are both sitting here.

335
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,030
What are you unable to accept? Speak up.

336
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,970
Eldest Brother, thanks for just now.

337
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,850
You're my little brother. Don't I always have to help you?

338
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,270
Hey!

339
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,820
Ling Yue's lackey!

340
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,730
You dare to touch me? Do you have a death wish?

341
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,310
You caused President Ling's death!

342
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,560
Third Brother, calm down, calm down.

343
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,630
What are you blabbing about? How could I cause my second brother's death?

344
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,050
You stole his position. Why are you pretending to be ignorant?

345
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,910
Hey!

346
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,080
This is Ling Group, not your New Way.

347
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,690
I am Ling Group's heir. That position was mine, to begin with.

348
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,490
- Take this crazy woman to the police station. 
 - Guards!

349
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,190
Third Brother! Third Brother!

350
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,320
She's just a crazy woman. Why teach her a lesson?

351
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,260
Let me see. Is your nose okay?

352
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,950
Boss!

353
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,740
I'll take care of it.

354
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,500
That slap on the mouth was so you remember

355
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,690
that because of your work negligence, my younger brother was put in harm's way!

356
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,790
I only have one more younger brother in my Ling family.

357
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,270
I can't let him be harmed in any way. Do you understand?

358
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,320
Brother, it's not Allen's fault.

359
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,260
It is his fault!

360
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,290
This bodyguard isn't reliable. Switch him out.

361
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,200
Allen is very loyal, Brother.

362
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,110
How many people are watching you right now?

363
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,540
This gangster is notorious. Keeping him will drag your reputation down.

364
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,440
Boss!

365
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,740
Take this opportunity to get some proper rest. Stay in touch.

366
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,410
Understood.

367
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,310
This is a critical time.

368
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,520
Our Ling Group cannot have any more negative news.

369
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,620
What do you think, President Sheng?

370
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,260
I'll listen to you, Eldest Brother.

371
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,870
Let's go.

372
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,260
- Is your nose fine? 
 - Yes.

373
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,960

374
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,590
Xin'er.

375
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,750
How come you're in such a good mood today?

376
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,520
I resolved a difficult problem.

377
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,920
I was in a good mood, so I wanted to see you first thing.

378
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,340
Dealing with company matters

379
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,270
must be so arduous.

380
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,070
Not at all.

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,860
Xin'er, do you know? I finally have an opportunity to prove to you

382
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm not any less than Ling Yue!

383
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,460
You don't have to compare yourself to him.

384
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,840
You can just be yourself.

385
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,700
Yesterday, I already transferred all of the equity shares he had left with me.

386
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,050
I cleared away all of his contact information.

387
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,380
I didn't expect the goodbye ritual to be so simple.

388
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,600
Quietly...

389
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,210
disappear from each other's lives like this.

390
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,170
It was as if we'd never met.

391
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,780
Rest assured. From today forward,

392
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,100
he will never come back into your life.

393
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,230
The truth is that I had been mentally preparing myself,

394
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,740
but I just wasn't willing to let go.

395
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,900
Thank you.

396
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,540
You cured my procrastination.

397
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,470
You gave me the courage

398
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,170
to clear my feelings back onto a blank slate.

399
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,890
I heard that at 14 years old,

400
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,460
one's fingerprint becomes finalized and will not change ever again.

401
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,370
Just like these five years.

402
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,760
My feelings for you

403
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,330
have never changed at all.

404
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,000
If you insist on saying something changed,

405
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,100
it's that I like you more and more, more and more.

406
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,430
A liking I cannot free myself from.

407
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,670
I remember I read an article when I was younger.

408
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,720
It was about climbing Mount Everest.

409
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,860
That was when I immediately decided

410
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,730
I would start collecting travel expenses

411
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,320
to store into the bank

412
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,300
and someday in the future,

413
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,120
I will definitely use all of this money on an adventure.

414
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
Later, where did this money go?

415
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,010
This money was used on my life's biggest risk. 
  (T/N: Risk and adventure are the same word in Chinese)

416
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,840
Xin'er,

417
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,850
I will give you a better life.

418
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,340
Miss Gu Xin'er, will you marry me?

419
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,640
 Xin'er, you don't have to love so arduously.

420
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,880
 You also deserve to be loved, to be cherished.

421
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,440
 As long as you nod,

422
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,990
 I can also run like mad toward you

423
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,910
 without hesitation.

424
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,990
 As long as you are willing, I will always be here.

425
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,920
So are you willing to accept

426
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,980
the me who is willing to run like mad to you?

427
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,330
I am.

428
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,720
 Ling Group's supervisor Ling Yue transferred all of his personal equity funds to younger brother Ling Sheng

429
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,370
 before mysteriously disappearing. According to insiders,

430
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,790
 Ling Yue had entered a tumultuous relationship filled with conflict.

431
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,510
 The Ling family has still not responded to either the transfer of equity or Ling Yue's disappearance.

432
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,400
I hope nothing has happened to them.

433
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,340
Does this worry...

434
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,550
also include Anxin?

435
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,500
Ever since childhood,

436
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,980
she was just like a weed by the road.

437
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,440
Every time I saw her pretending to be strong,

438
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,520
inexplicable hostility would rise in my heart.

439
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,150
But no matter how you put it,

440
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,140
she's still half my family member.

441
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,820
I don't hope for anything to happen to her.

442
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,680
Hearing you say this makes me very happy.

443
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,400
Very happy?

444
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,480
What kind of brother would hope to see his two sisters fight each other all the time?

445
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,180
Although she and I will never be as close as sisters,

446
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,330
I still hope she can return safely.

447
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,130
Let's talk about something happy!

448
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,680
Ling Sheng proposed to me.

449
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,210
I accepted.

450
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,520
Thanks for your blessing.

451
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,060
Wait.

452
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,620
You two... You two are getting engaged... so quickly?

453
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,400
You haven't truly dated for a long time.

454
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,610
Isn't this too fast?

455
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,900
I've already considered it very carefully.

456
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,050
The reason why I was never happy in the past

457
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,950
was because I kept hoping for someone I could never obtain.

458
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,530
It was Ling Sheng who taught me

459
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,990
that only taking a step backward

460
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:35,250
could I see the most beautiful landscape that belonged to me.

461
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,840
But do you truly know him? Between the two of you, is there really—

462
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,700
Enough, Brother!

463
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,100
Why is it that people need to give their opinions on all of the choices I make?

464
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,910
Ever since I was young, I was better than everyone at everything.

465
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,110
How is it that in the end, I'm not even allowed to control my own relationships?

466
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,060
Xin'er, that's not what I mean. But relationships are things that...

467
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,480
They can't be measured like this!

468
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,080
What right do you have to say this?

469
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,030
Xin'er.

470
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,060
I just wanted to protect everyone.

471
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,660
I'll always stand behind you.

472
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,400
This Allen is probably more troublesome than you guys think.

473
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,850
Because the person who rescued his whole family and raised him to do bad things is the same person.

474
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,390
A person who narrowly escaped death will be willing to pay any cost, even his life, to pay back his benefactor.

475
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,810
So, you must not take this situation lightly. Be careful of everything.

476
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,530
Thank you.

477
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,770
 Do we even have the right to speak?

478
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,080
  This all happened too quickly.

479
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,300
 - We're all long-standing shareholders. 
 - What do we do?

480
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,010
  Exactly.

481
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,740
  How could President Ling Yue transfer his equity shares to him?

482
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,600
  This shouldn't be.

483
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,760
  - This company can't be tossed around like this. 
 - Right.

484
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,320
  Will it be okay in his hands?

485
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,540
Everyone, according to the group's regulations,

486
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,430
whoever owns the most equity shares

487
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,870
becomes the group's chairman.

488
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,430
At this moment, President Sheng already has 30% of the shares.

489
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,680
He is ranked first place without a doubt.

490
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,980
Based on the board's resolution,

491
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,830
President Sheng becomes the new chairman of Ling Group.

492
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,390
All of you present here are my seniors.

493
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,160
I'm young, so I invite everyone to guide me in the future.

494
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,730
We can build Ling Group's new future together.

495
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,580
I see you're looking more and more handsome these days.

496
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,380
- These clothes you're wearing! 
 - Brother, you flatter me.

497
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,280
If Second Brother were here, that would be good.

498
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,290
Such a big thing happened to the family.

499
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,410
Although he was adopted, I'm still a little upset.

500
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,670
Why are you bringing him up? It's perfect that the two of us are left.

501
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,110
Don't worry, Eldest Brother, it's difficult to separate good and bad, but there is a distinction between inside and outside.

502
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,260
From now on, you'll surely have a position in the group.

503
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,210
I'm clear on it. I'm not capable and I have lots of problems.

504
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,520
But think about it. I'm not young anymore.

505
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,500
If I still don't succeed in business, our dad will be throwing me out.

506
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,960
You're good now. Shouldn't you help me now?

507
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,030
Eldest Brother, you don't have to say that.

508
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,090
You've always been outstanding.

509
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,350
You little brat.

510
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,250
Didn't you know that when I do things, I only consider good versus evil and not outside versus inside?

511
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,660
You really started seeing yourself as the president.

512
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,840

513
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,200

514
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,390

515
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,420

516
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,920

517
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,700
Why do I look like that?

518
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,140
You've always been like that. Don't you know that?

519
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,130
When have I been like that?

520
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,610
You've always been.

521
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,820
It really is hard to imagine

522
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,760
that I can let go of New Way, let go of everything

523
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,420
and become an idle person like I am right now.

524
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,490
So, you should enjoy today.

525
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,220
This is called finding victory amongst peril.

526
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,490
Tell me... Will Ling Sheng really believe we're dead?

527
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,160
Even though he's the youngest, he was able to hide for so long.

528
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,820
That means his schemes and shrewdness are surely even deeper than we know.

529
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,890
He'll only believe half of what Ling Fang says, and he will verify the rest himself.

530
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,450
So that means

531
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,940
our days of ease will not be much longer.

532
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,000
At least this time, you're not alone.

533
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,650
True. We're together.

534
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,250
You know how to continue a conversation very well.

535
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,800
Isn't this Brother Wu's supermarket?

536
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,490
Yes.

537
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,930
Didn't you say that it was boring staying at home?

538
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,430
Brother Wu and I discussed it. We've prepared a

539
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,100
private shopping time for you.

540
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,730
Okay, then. We'll choose some food to take home.

541
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,390
Let's go.

542
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,630
- Are you ready? 
 - I'm ready. 
 - We're off!

543
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,690
Stop, stop, stop. We're here. Hot pot ingredients.

544
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,620
The one over there.

545
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,280
Let me look. This is it.

546
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,280
- What's wrong? 
 - It expires tomorrow.

547
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,260
There's still an hour until tomorrow. It'll take half an hour to get back home.

548
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,960
We won't be able to eat hotpot tonight, but I really want to eat hotpot today.

549
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,550
- Let's start. 
 - Okay.

550
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,790
You don't have to add so much. Thank you.

551
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,660
There's no more meat. I'll go get some more.

552
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm here!

553
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,800
I forgot to grab the cocktail drink.

554
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,150
Okay. I'll go get some.

555
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,030
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

556
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,860
How about we eat some fruit?

557
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,800
I've already prepared it.

558
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,990
Here.

559
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:14,320

560
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,560

561
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,390
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

562
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,940
♫  Soaking the memory wet  ♫

563
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,600
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

564
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,840
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

565
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,660
♫  My heart suddenly beats out of normal  ♫

566
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,140
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

567
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,660
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

568
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:57,670
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

569
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,720
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

570
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,120
♫  Yet the reminiscing has never been able to stop  ♫

571
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:16,200
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

572

♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,360
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

574
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,660
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

575
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:40,560
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

576
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,170
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

577
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:56,220
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
