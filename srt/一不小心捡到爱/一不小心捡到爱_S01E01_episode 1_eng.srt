♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,230
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,840
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18

Are you crazy? Driving so fast! Hey!

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,030

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,740
President Ling, Chairman Chen's wife sent these handmade cookies over this morning.

32
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,630
First, there is no nutritional ingredients list on the food.

33
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,400
Second, there is no license allowing for the production of this product.

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,190
Third, there is no government safety certification. Take it away.

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
I understand.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120

37
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,450

38
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,790
President Ling, Director Ling Fang's actions have been somewhat great recently.

39
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,520
Don't worry about it. Just observe for now.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,740
Yes, sir. The meeting with the Vice President of Jiang Group is scheduled at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow at Michelle Hotel.

41
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,560
Vice President Jiang often uses work as an excuse to harass Lucy.

42
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,100
Cancel the meeting. New Way doesn't need a collaboration like this.

43
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,860
 Greetings, President Ling!

44
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,520
Let's begin.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,660
Unlike in the past, where we only considered the increase in speed of our designs,

46
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,070
this time, through the experience rate of our customers, we are going to improve this full scale through—

47
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,890
Do you have a question, President Ling?

48
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,690
It's greater than or equal to, not greater than.

49
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,960
I apologize. What are you referring to?

50
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,120
Your HTML code is missing a greater than or equal to sign.

51
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,030

52
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,330
I apologize! I will change it right now.

53
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,570
After a program is implemented, a targeted attack to steal data would only take a few hours

54
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,500
from beginning to end.

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,130
Yet it would take us several months to detect flaws in the system.

56
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,900
Then what are you going to do about the customer information leaks that have happened during this time?

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,590
You don't need to come to work tomorrow.

58
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,530
Enemies meet on narrow roads. 
  (T/N: Means one can never avoid clashing with those you want to avoid)

59
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,730
Express delivery!

60
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,850
- Okay, thank you. 
 - Please choose Express Delivery again.

61
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,510
Thank you!

62
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,220
- President Ling. 
 - President Ling.

63
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,990
- President Ling. 
 - These are President Ling's flowers.

64
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,510
President Ling, flowers to honor your mother.

65
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,340
- Go ahead and continue working. 
 - Okay.

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,290
 Now, we are reporting international news.

67
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,480
 Last afternoon, a store in America's state of Nebraska's

68
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,170
 Shelby village experienced an elevator malfunction.

69
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,890
 The three women and one man within the elevator all died.

70
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,900
 The man died particularly tragically.

71
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,570
 He got caught between the elevator and shop floors.

72
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,000
 When the rescuers arrived, the said man had already lost consciousness.

73
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,070
Anxin, you're back?

74
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,770
I'm back.

75
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,430
Anxin, you just got back?

76
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, and you're getting off work?

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,230
That's right. Hey,

78
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,250
did you switch shifts with Xiao Li again? You're too nice.

79
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,730
What's wrong with that? I receive money for working overtime anyway.

80
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,100
Fine, then. I have to get home early today.

81
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,860
The weather report says there will be lightning and rain today. I haven't brought in my laundry yet.

82
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,380
Okay, hurry and go home then.

83
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,300
I'm leaving! Bye!

84
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,030
Bye!

85
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,590

86
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,170
 Urgent report from the weather channel.

87
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,070
 Between 1:00 p.m. this afternoon and 10:00 p.m. tonight, there will be huge thunderstorms.

88
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,830
 Please be careful when outdoors.

89
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,060
 There is currently heavy traffic in the Kang Jia Ling neighborhood.

90
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,260
 Streets are slippery on rainy days. Please drive carefully and avoid tailgating.

91
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,830

92
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,720
 Rerouting for you.

93
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,040
 Final destination, Colored Glass Cemetery.

94
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,740
 Please turn left at the crossroads ahead.

95
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,810
Brother, tail him more closely.

96
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,020
What— Why'd he switch roads? Did he notice us?

97
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,740
Don't worry. I'll catch up at the next intersection.

98
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,130
All right.

99
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,600
Call Director Ling Fang first.

100
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,900
Director Ling.

101
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,620
 Director Ling, we've lost him.

102
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,040
You managed to lose him so easily?

103
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,780
 He suddenly turned at the intersection. We couldn't do anything.

104
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,850
Then, why don't you hurry up and chase him? Look up all routes to the cemetery!

105
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,680
Brother! What kind of terrible things are you up to?

106
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,650
You scared me? Scared me? Scared me?

107
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,940
You've gotten courageous. When'd you get here?

108
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,350
Why do you always hit my head?

109
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,560
Let me tell you... If you keep doing this, I'll go tell Second Brother.

110
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,810
Right. Where did Second Brother go?

111
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,050
Don't keep going on about your second brother, second brother. I'm your biological brother.

112
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,310
It's all the same.

113
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,110
Of course not.

114
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,610
Let's go. I'll take you to eat some good food.

115
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,390
- Your treat? 
 - Of course!

116
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,040
Let's go.

117
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,460
Don't panic, don't panic.

118
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,440

119
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,350
Hey!

120
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,720
Wake up!

121
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
Hey!

122
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,600
Hospital! Hospital!

123
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,030
- Make way. 
 - Please make way!

124
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,620
Excuse us, please make way!

125
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,680
Make way! Make way!

126
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,630
- Excuse us, please make way! 
 - Make way! Make way!

127
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,940
Make way! Make way!

128
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,790
Wait here, we'll go find a doctor.

129
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,200
Wait a minute.

130
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,070
Wait a minute, they're going to find a doctor.

131
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,640
How are you?

132
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,420
Are you okay?

133
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,120
How are you?

134
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,150
 Have you seen this person?

135
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,300
- I haven't. 
 - Look carefully. He's this tall. He's injured.

136
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,190
What's wrong?

137
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
I wasn't—

138
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,310
S-Sorry, I-I just, I...

139
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,830
I didn't do it on purpose, I...

140
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,070
Family member, please step away for a moment.

141
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,070
- Push him in. 
 - Okay.

142
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,690
We have already arrived at the scene.

143
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,630
This is where the accident happened. Right now, everyone can see that

144
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,500
the medical personnel have already arrived. The police and firefighters are currently urgently performing a search and rescue effort.

145
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,890
Up to this point, they have not found any injured persons.

146
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,910
For further developments, please stay tuned to our channel.

147
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,120
Dad! Mom! Dad!

148
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,950
- Dad! 
 - Dad, Mom!

149
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,880
- What's the matter? 
 - Ling Yue, h-his car fell into the ocean.

150
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,540
The p-police are searching now.

151
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,840
Then how is he? How is he?!

152
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,880
Second Brother, he... he may have also fallen into the ocean.

153
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,530
What did you say?

154
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,300
That's impossible.

155
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,680
How could this happen?

156
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,530
- Dad! 
 - Old Ling!

157
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,340
- Dad! 
 - Go call an ambulance!

158
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,350
- Old Ling! 
 -  Today at around 1:00 p.m,

159
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,150
 the President of both Ling Group and New Way, Ling Yue,

160
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,540
 drove a black Benz with license number AK8505

161
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,420
 and fell into the ocean.

162
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,500
 Now the police have already pulled the car out of the water, but Ling Yue is not inside the car.

163
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,110
 The search and rescue team is currently widening its perimeter.

164
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,300
 We will continue to follow up with further information.

165
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,490
It's so late and we still don't have news.

166
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm afraid it bodes more bad news than good.

167
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,800
It's best if he doesn't come back.

168
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,140
Ling Tian is getting old and useless.

169
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,030
His eldest son is responsible for managing real estate.

170
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,160
His youngest son is always messing about in the entertainment circle.

171
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,450
What's most important is e-commerce.

172
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,930
That was always the responsibility of his second son.

173
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,670
Now he is missing, and with it, our opportunity has come.

174
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,860
Xin'er, notify the marketing department.

175
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,810
We must immediately expand our business while New Way is without a leader.

176
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,640
It's time we retake the top spot in e-commerce.

177
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,040

178
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,640
Hey, don't move. Be careful not to strain your injury.

179
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,240
Who are you?

180
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,980
- I... 
 - Let me borrow your phone.

181
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,840
What do you need to use my phone for?

182
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,100
To call the police.

183
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,090
- Why are you calling the police? 
 - You crashed into me.

184
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,040
No, no, I can explain. That's not what happened.

185
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,980
Then just handle it by reporting to the police.

186
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,770
Please, if there's a problem, we can talk it through.

187
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,600
Can you not call the police?

188
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,860
Please.

189
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,310
Then, who am I?

190
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,110
You...

191
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,080
You don't know who you are?

192
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,520
I only remember that you were the one who crashed into me.

193
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,470
How do you feel?

194
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,040
A little dizzy.

195
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,970
Doctor, didn't he injure his leg?

196
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,650
How come I feel like his brain isn't working right either?

197
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,260
Judging from the examination, there shouldn't be a problem.

198
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,070
However, getting hit by an outside force can cause a slight concussion.

199
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,260
That can bring about temporary memory loss.

200
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,700
Outside force?

201
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,920
 I didn't—

202
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,000
Then, how long will his condition last?

203
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,680
That's hard to say. Two to three days

204
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,460
or several months are all within the realm of possibility.

205
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,210
First pay the fee, then take the bill to get medicine.

206
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,720
Rest well.

207
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,540
Pay the fee.

208
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you.

209
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,430

210
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,990
Excuse me, may I ask,

211
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,190
can you give a discount?

212
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,620
We cannot.

213
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,000
This... why is it so expensive?

214
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Was the head of the hospital the operating surgeon?

215
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,590
The surgery fee isn't expensive, but doesn't he also have to be hospitalized?

216
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,960
Then... Then if he doesn't stay in the hospital, how much would it cost?

217
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,760
¥13,000.

218
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,810
Then let's not stay in the hospital. Not staying in the hospital.

219
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,660
What a handsome face. It would be such a shame if it left a scar.

220
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,250
You should buy insurance for this face.

221
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,130
My face didn't get injured too badly, did it?

222
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,520
Even a small injury is an injury. Let me take a look.

223
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,590
Even small injuries must be closely paid attention to.

224
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,410
I'll leave now.

225
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,050
Thank you.

226
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,690
The doctor said you don't have to stay in the hospital.

227
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,210
You just have to come back for a follow-up visit on the set date.

228
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,420
Now, I'll go downstairs to complete the paperwork to be discharged from the hospital.

229
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,460
You can get your things ready, and then we can leave.

230
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,060
Did you hear me?

231
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,470
What is this?

232
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,070
The compensation you will have to pay.

233
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,680
A professional caretaker,

234
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,400
nutritionist, Hilton presidential suite.

235
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,100
Total expenses equal ¥300,000.

236
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,490
Are you blackmailing me?

237
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,260
Then call the police. Have the police take care of it.

238
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,720
A collision that results in an injury is not a minor charge. Not to mention whether or not my leg will have long term consequences,

239
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,140
the compensation and damages from absence at work alone are more than ¥300,000.

240
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,620
Moreover, you'll have to go to the police station, be detained for three to five days, and cooperate with the police investigation.

241
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,410
Do you still think I'm blackmailing you?

242
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,010
Didn't you lose your memory?

243
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,790
You've lost your memory, yet you're taking advantage of me and acting all—

244
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,840
I did lose my memory, but I didn't become stupid. Past experiences are still in my head.

245
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,230
Let's talk about the compensation instead.

246
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,190
I really don't have money.

247
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,090
After I paid the bills,

248
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,520
I only have ¥1,888 left in my bag.

249
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,420
Wait a moment.

250
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,890
Sister Li.

251
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,340
 Anxin, shouldn't you pay your rent for this month now?

252
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,360
No, Sister Li. I just sent it to you a couple of days ago.

253
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,180
 I told you long ago that the rent increases this month. Did you forget?

254
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,410
By fifty—

255
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,420
No, Sister Li. Isn't fifty percent a little too high?

256
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,230
 Little sister, many people are fighting for your house.

257
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,460
 I saw that life isn't easy for you so I never rented it to anyone else.

258
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,140
 If you're tight on money, why don't you make some room for others?

259
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,170
I can't, Sister Li. I'll send it to you. I'll send it right now.

260
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,250
Bye, Sister Li.

261
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,230

262
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,520

263
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,080

264
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,790
Eight, eight, eight. This number is quite auspicious.

265
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,250
Look, I really don't have money.

266
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,660
I just paid my rent.

267
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,250
- So? 
 - So...

268
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,520
So...

269
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,480
So, how about... you live at my house?

270
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,140
My house is pretty luxurious.

271
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,050
It won't be worse than that H-H-Hilton Hotel.

272
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,970
And if you need any caretakers,

273
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,560
I can be your caretaker. Does that work?

274
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,670
It's not that it won't work,

275
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,820
but you'll have to write me an IOU.

276
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,140
 I, Gu Anxin, on the evening of May 5,

277
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,050
 accidentally crashed into and injured the victim.

278
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,400
 To compensate for the victim's various losses,

279
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,800
 I am willing to listen to the victim's orders.

280
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,220
 During his recovery period, I will provide a place to live and take care of his daily life

281
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,850
 until the amount owed, ¥280,000, is paid in full.

282
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,770
Can you be discharged now, Mr. Victim?

283
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,900

284
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,650
What do I call you from now on?

285
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,260
Anything.

286
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,760
But I can't keep calling you "victim."

287
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,020
As long as you can pay attention to the road, you can call me anything.

288
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,820
I only have ¥888 left on my card today.

289
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,660
How about I call you... Xiao Ba. Okay? 
  (T/N: Eight is pronounced "ba" and "Xiao" means young/small)

290
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,400
Anything is fine.

291
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,550
Just say "anything." Why be so fierce?

292
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,290
We're here.

293
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,050
Can people really live here?

294
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,800
What do you mean by "can people really live here"?

295
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,270
I've lived here for several years already.

296
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,560
Then which floor do you live on?

297
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,680
The second floor. Right there.

298
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,130
Careful.

299
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,330
Let's go.

300
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,340
You don't have an elevator?

301
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,950
We only have stairs.

302
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,400
Moreover, it's only the second floor. It will be fine if I help you up.

303
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,990
What happened?

304
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,730
No need. Just lead the way.

305
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,560
I can walk myself.

306
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,720
What do I wear?

307
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,690
I only have one pair of slippers in my house.

308
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,440
How about I give you one? I'll go buy a new pair for you tomorrow.

309
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,630
Pretty luxurious.

310
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,490
Drink some water.

311
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,080
What is that?

312
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,630
This is something that all cups have after being used for a long time.

313
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,200
Probably water marks.

314
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,550
It's fine. You won't die. Drink it.

315
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
It's clean now.

316
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,010
Where do I sleep?

317
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,530
I can't sleep on the couch, right? I'm still a patient.

318
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,530
I'll give you a tour of the bedroom.

319
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,660
You draw comics?

320
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,330
I doodle when I'm bored.

321
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,060
I'm just a courier.

322
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,850
Sit anywhere. I will tidy up this place for you.

323
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,530
Don't touch.

324
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,810
Is that your mom?

325
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,520
Does it have anything to do with you?

326
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,380
Just asking.

327
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,570
I'm telling you, you can sleep in my bedroom,

328
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,900
but you can't touch anything in my bedroom.

329
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,470
These are all my treasures. I bought them with my savings.

330
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,330
You hear me?

331
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,350
No need. I will sleep on the couch.

332
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,370
There's no air conditioning in the house, only a fan.

333
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,890
If you think it's too hot, your only choice is to deal with it.

334
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,630
What is it?

335
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,630
The couch can't be placed under the fan.

336
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,730
Why? Are there any Feng Shui specifications for that?

337
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,300
It's too dangerous.

338
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,460
How is it dangerous?

339
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,230
Either you move the couch...

340
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,860
- Cou— 
 - ...or...

341
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,500
if you don't mind, I can sleep in the same room with you.

342
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,140
You... You look proper enough. You aren't going to do anything to me, right?

343
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,200
Not necessarily.

344
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,230
- I'm warning you— 
 - I'm also warning you.

345
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,100
You still owe me ¥280,000.

346
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,600
Not ¥280,000.

347
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,560
It's ¥272,000.

348
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,500
The water bill, room and board,

349
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,270
the tricycle, and the costs of my care.

350
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,340
Adding all of this up, it's about ¥8,000.

351
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,600
So now, I still owe you ¥272,000.

352
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,590
So was your service more expensive or this shabby house of yours?

353
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,470
How is my house shabby? I even have a luxurious, big bathtub.

354
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,330
Furthermore, my service is 24 hours

355
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,900
of personal service. This is considered cheap.

356
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,210
How personal?

357
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,030
It's... within three meters,

358
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,290
and further than one meter.

359
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,240
Okay.

360
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,630
Then, listen carefully.

361
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,820
I only drink mineral water. I only use 100% cotton towels.

362
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,740
The lights must be out in the living room by 11:00 p.m. You're not allowed to bother me after that.

363
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,820
I've only thought of these. I will add on when I think of the rest.

364
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,800
Why does your brain work so well even though you've lost your memory?

365
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,780
I will emphasize this once more. I have a temporary memory gap.

366
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,090
Not dementia. Those who can't do anything after losing their memories only belong in TV dramas.

367
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,630
Go, move the couch for me.

368
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,290

369
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,920
Why are there still so few clicks?

370
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,870
 You can eat cup noodles at noon, a very good deal.

371
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,310
 Breakfast is on the table.

372
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,130
 Your mineral water is in the fridge.

373
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,590

374
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,740
 Second-hand clothes were put under the couch.

375
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,680

376
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,090
How come there's suddenly a fire at house 208?

377
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,280
I heard the microwave caught on fire.

378
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,090
- 208? 
 - Yes.

379
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,380
What happened to my house?

380
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,150
In the future, when using appliances, you must be careful.

381
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,940
Don't put metal in the microwave.

382
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,600
Microwave...

383
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,880
You've never used a microwave at your house, right?

384
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,970
If you have nothing to do, go take a stroll outside. Don't mess up the house.

385
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,190
This is all money.

386
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,390
Damage of appliances, ¥600.

387
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,790

388
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,300
My phone number.

389
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,950
If you run into trouble, call me, but I hope that you have no reason to call.

390
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,650
Okay?

391
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,680
Hello?

392
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,270
 Anxin, your older brother broke the beer bottles in my store. You should come over quickly.

393
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,790
Brother?

394
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,080
Look at what my beer bottles have become.

395
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,560
- Sorry, sir. 
 - The delivery just arrived.

396
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,070
This beer is very expensive.

397
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,910
Your brother broke the whole crate.

398
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,640
I'm going to lose a lot of money.

399
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,760
That's all I have in cash right now.

400
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,120
When I get my paycheck, I will send the rest to you immediately, okay?

401
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,100
- Seriously. 
 - I told you to go take a stroll outside.

402
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,860
I didn't tell you to go out and take money for a walk.

403
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,410
- Hello? 
   - My son was scared into tears by your husband.

404
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,310
Sorry, Little Kid.

405
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,170
You're Gu Anxin?

406
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,550
Why is someone so old taking toys from a kid?

407
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,260
Can you watch your husband? Seriously.

408
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm really sorry.

409
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,570
Little kid, sorry!

410
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
You can't sit still, can you?

411
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,960
You just can't let me do my work well, can you?

412
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,680
Anxin, there's a problem with your attendance lately.

413
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,190
Don't disappear in the middle of work anymore. I'm reminding you out of goodwill.

414
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,100
Got it. It won't happen next time.

415
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,460
Hello?

416
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,910
 Is this Gu Anxin? Your brother is lost. Come pick him up.

417
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,070
I'm warning you. You better think things through.

418
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,380
If you injure me, you will have to compensate.

419
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,600
The ride fare for coming home today,

420
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,690
¥50. Damages from absence at work...

421
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,250
Damages are ¥600. And on the way back,

422
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,830
you got hungry and bought some food.

423
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,760
Fatigue fee.

424
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,470
Put it down!

425
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,630
I'm telling you, the most valuable thing at home

426
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,350
is this television. It's the thing the landlord treasures most.

427
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,350
If it breaks, neither of us will be able to afford to pay for it.

428
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,440
Look...

429
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,740
This red button.

430
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,420
If you press it, it will turn on.

431
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,840
Press it again, and it will turn off.

432
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,340
You actually don't have to worry about the other buttons.

433
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,980
Just remember this one and it will be enough.

434
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,040
Give it a try.

435
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,650
He's crippled but has quite a big temper.

436
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,380
Toi... Toilet. My toilet. Toilet.

437
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,690
What happened?

438
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,580
There's something in the bathroom.

439
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,790
Where?

440
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,470
It came out.

441
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,780
Just this?

442
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,440
- Is it really funny? 
 - Of course, it's really funny.

443
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,190
You're so big, but that's all wasted. You're afraid of cockroaches.

444
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,920
- Do you know how many types of bacteria are on a cockroach? 
 - How many?

445
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,600
- There are 48 types. 
 - Wow.

446
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,850
It can carry around 48 pathogens at most.

447
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,140
Parasite eggs, fungus, bacteria, and all that.

448
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,560
They spread a lot of viruses.

449
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,370
Isn't the problem solved if you just step on them?

450
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,870
You think it ends with stepping on it?

451
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,670
Do you know how many larvae it can create?

452
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,770
- How many? 
 - 84.

453
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,860
A single cockroach can produce 84 larvae.

454
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,330
So, you're saying that there are 84 cockroaches currently in my house?

455
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,110
That's right.

456
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,810
I'm telling you... You still haven't realized the severity of this issue.

457
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,110
Enough. Stop nagging.

458
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,160
I'll go buy pesticide for you tomorrow.

459
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,850
This cost will be your responsibility

460
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,400
because prior to your arrival, there were no cockroaches in my house.

461
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,050
What do you mean?

462
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,950
Do you mean that I brought this bacteria in?

463
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,840
I didn't say that. You said it yourself.

464
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,880
Right, I also need to remind you.

465
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,640
When it's the dead hours of the night

466
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,740
and you're lying on the couch,

467
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,650
there are 84 cockroaches in the house now.

468
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,750
If they crawl, crawl, and crawl in the night,

469
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,410
and crawl onto the couch,

470
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,740
take care.

471
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:05,810

472
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,620

 for it has always been you  ♫

480
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:51,870
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

481
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,430
♫  Yet the reminiscing has never been able to stop  ♫

482
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:04,360
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

483
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,410
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

484
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,930
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

485
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,860
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

486
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:28,850
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

487
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:33,400
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

488
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,870
♫  Using love to slowly open up  ♫

489
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:44,560
♫  a lifetime  ♫
