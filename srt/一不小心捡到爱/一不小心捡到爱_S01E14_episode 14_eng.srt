1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,460
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,690
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,560
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,130
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,590
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,510
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,080
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,290
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,840
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,340
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,630
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,170
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,570
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,220
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,550
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,090
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,560

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,320

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,150
Brother Yue, your tie is crooked.

22
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,690
Ling Yue!

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,280
Anxin, why have you come?

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,970
If I hadn't come, a green hat would've been soldered onto my head. 
  (T/N: The green hat represents being cheated on while being none the wiser)

25
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,790
Right, Xin'er?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,980
It's not what you think.

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,920
Then, what is it?

28
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,280
Anxin, don't wrongly blame Brother Yue anymore.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,450
I'm not talking to you.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,080
If you want someone to blame, blame me.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,650
Enough.

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,900
Ai Li, escort Miss Gu downstairs.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,450
Miss Gu, please.

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
Wait.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,220
This is yours, isn't it?

36
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,660
You like it? If you like it, I'll give it to you.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,170
You can give away a phone, but you can't give a boyfriend away.

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,510
You understand this principle, don't you?

39
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,250
Of course.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,950
Take it back and use it. I'm able to use my own phone perfectly well.

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,780
In the future, let's take care of our own things well. Do you understand?

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,420
Then I'll take my leave. Goodbye.

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,930
It really was a misunderstanding. It's not what you think.

44
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,200
Really?

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,380
She was about to leave, but she tripped, which is how that scene just now formed.

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,840
Then this Miss Gu is very good at falling.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,700
You know that I—

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,570
Don't put my hand on that lipstick print.

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,540
It burns the hand.

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,420
What are you doing?

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm changing my clothes so you won't get annoyed looking at it.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you absolutely silly?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,110
You're taking off your clothes in the office. If anyone sees, they'll think—

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,410
Then I'll change later.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,320
This is quite nice.

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,400
You must've worked so hard lately.

57
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't have any way to help you.

59
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,970
 Please feel at ease, Mr. Ling.

60
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Brother, why haven't you gone back yet?

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,870
After what happened, I wasn't able to rest assured so I came to pick you up and take you home.

62
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,030
Don't worry, I've talked to the security.

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,160
They will be strengthening security patrols in the next few days.

64
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,490
Don't worry, it's really not a big deal.

65
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,320
How could it not be a big deal?

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,130
Do you remember when you had a bad dream as a child?

67
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,040
Although you were clearly scared to death,

68
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,670
you clenched your teeth to make sure you made no noise just because you were afraid to bother others.

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,660
Do you still remember?

70
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,610
Brother, don't worry.

71
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm not a kid anymore, and I'm not eight years old like I was then.

72
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,370
I can protect myself.

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,630
Did you go on a date with Youyou?

74
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,610
Did you forget? You forgot?

75
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,670
Why don't you go already? She'll kill me!

76
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,070
- Hurry, go. 
 - Then get up there quickly.

77
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm sorry, I'm late.

78
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,980
Ansheng, it's no problem! Since you're so handsome, whatever you do is right.

79
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,070
Let me tell you!  Something big happened!

80
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,380
It says that Gu Xin'er and New Way's president are getting engaged!

81
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,720
Really?

82
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,620
That Ling Yue...

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,580
I'm sorry, Youyou. I can't watch the movie with you.

84
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,730
- I have to find Ling Yue and ask for an explanation. 
 - No! I will go with you!

85
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,680
That stinking bastard.

86
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,840
Ling Yue, you b—

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,880
Come out!

88
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,550
You two, leave first.

89
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay, President Ling.

90
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,530
Ling Yue, what are the rumors surrounding you and Xin'er about?

91
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,070
Right.

92
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,410
- You're making something out of nothing. 
 - You know best whether I'm making something out of nothing or you're covering something up.

93
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,700
There are no walls that wind can't pass. 
  (T/N: Secrets are bound to be discovered one day)

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,420
Besides, if there's truly nothing, where did the news come from?

95
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,010
What news?

96
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,830
Actually, it's not news, it's gossip.

97
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,140
Now is when you need our Gu family most.

98
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,780
How can I know for sure that you're not using Anxin first

99
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,460
and then using our family's Xin'er?

100
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,170
Gu Ansheng, I'm very curious.

101
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,300
Why do you keep targeting me, unable to let go?

102
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,410
Why do I keep targeting you, unable to let go?

103
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,870
You, President Ling, act decisively to achieve your goals by any means necessary.

104
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm afraid everyone in this business is aware of that.

105
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,510
You're right.

106
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,930
I am certainly decisive, but I am not willing to use any method possible.

107
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,820
If we're talking about using any means necessary to achieve one's goals,

108
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,330
we would be speaking of your Old Man Gu.

109
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,090
I don't need to rely on other people,

110
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,210
and I don't need you to worry about it.

111
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,900
Ansheng, after hearing what he said, are we misunderstanding him?

112
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,350
Listen up.

113
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,670
Your relationship with Xin'er will always be ambiguous in the eyes of outsiders,

114
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,620
so as long as there are any slight moves, things like this will happen.

115
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,170
To you, it may be nothing.

116
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,060
But think about Anxin. As far as Anxin is concerned, this will hurt her.

117
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,770
If you can't protect her well,

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,650
I will.

119
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,220
Gu Ansheng,

120
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,240
you are just her brother.

121
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
What right do you have to protect my girlfriend in my place?

122
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,140
If you let her get hurt one more time,

123
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,730
I will steal her back.

124
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,850
Then try and see if you have that capability.

125
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,530
What are you two doing?

126
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,170
You're all family. If there's anything you have to say, just speak and be done with it!

127
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,820
Ansheng, he's explained things clearly already. Let's go.

128
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,470
Ansheng.

129
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,490
What is it?

130
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,470
Earlier, when you said you had someone you liked,

131
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,580
have you confessed to her?

132
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,360
Not yet.

133
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,610
Is it possible that I also know the person you like?

134
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,550
Why are you suddenly asking this?

135
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,470
Is the person you like Anxin?

136
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,280
I...

137
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,240
It doesn't matter to me who you like,

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,860
but the person I like is you.

139
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,020
Youyou.

140
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm sorry, I always thought—

141
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,860
What's there to apologize for?

142
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,080
If you like me, then you do; and if you don't, you don't.

143
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,380
After saying it, I feel so much more relaxed.

144
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,350
Then, why don't you get in the car?

145
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,150
- I'll drive you back. 
 - No, I can get back on my own.

146
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,320
It's not very safe to go back on your own. I... It's better I drive you back.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,000
No. If you're so nice to a single girl like me, I'll misunderstand.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,740
Hurry and go back.

149
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,550
I don't know how Anxin will react after she sees the news.

150
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,820
You should go keep her company.

151
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,530
Then... Then I'll go back first.

152
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,220
Send me a message once you get home.

153
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,760
So embarrassing! So embarrassing!

154
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,500
My entire life's reputation of being known as Taizhou's Barbie Hsu has been destroyed in an instant! 
  (Famous Taiwanese actress who rose to fame after 2001's Meteor Garden)

155
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,410

156
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,720
I already hung up! Why are you insisting on calling me and calling me?

157
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,330
What?

158
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,920
You're phone's out of battery, and you want me to bring you a ch—

159
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,500
What does your phone running out of battery have to do with me? I'm upset!

160
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,380
What?

161
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,960
What meet-and-greet?

162
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,830
Where's my idol?

163
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,030
Where's my portable charger?

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,010
You have quite a complete setup.

165
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,620
Of course, I'm a professional.

166
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,970
Thanks! Bye!

167
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,140
Everyone has been waiting a long time, right?

168
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,450
Then let's give the warmest welcome to Asia's Prince of Music,

169
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,320
Mike, to the stage!

170
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,450
 Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

171
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,990
Hello! 
  (In Thai)

172
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,950
I love you all!

173
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,300
 I love you, too!

174
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,660
Okay, our meet and greet officially starts now! Please take a seat, Mike!

175
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,780
Today's signing event will end now. Let us all

176
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,360
bid farewell to Mike.

177
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,490
Are you okay?

178
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,910
What are you doing?

179
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,910
I thought you'd be too busy chasing your celebrity that you'd forget to eat,

180
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,780
so I brought you some food.

181
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,490
Have you been waiting for me all this time?

182
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,650
Right, and there's this.

183
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,830
I'll help you carry it for now.

184
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,700
Is there something on my face?

185
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,830
Yes.

186
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,100
What?

187
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,300
A bit of cuteness.

188
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,060
Am I being flirted with?

189
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,020
  Are you still busy? Remember to eat.

190
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,080
Why are you here?

191
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,170
Can't I come?

192
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,000
Is there something wrong?

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Nothing, I just wanted to see.

194
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,840
What kind of magic does this place have

195
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,890
that would make Brother Yue linger here?

196
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,720
Looks like I thought too much.

197
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,220
Aside from reeking of poverty,

198
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,350
there doesn't seem to be anything special here.

199
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,410
Perhaps he just momentarily found it fresh.

200
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,320
Your words are so disgusting. Are you still that well-mannered Miss Gu?

201
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,140
But it matches up. You've always been this kind of jealous, helpless person.

202
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,120
Jealous?

203
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,700
What do you have that I'd be jealous of?

204
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,580
Should I be jealous of your lowly identity?

205
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Please get out.

206
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,290
What right do you have to tell me to go?

207
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,600
What right?

208
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,680
As the owner of this house, I have the right to ask you to leave.

209
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,000
Owner? Who the owner of this place is is still up to debate.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,350
I remember that this house is rented to you by Brother Yue, right?

211
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,610
But that's right.

212
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,340
You really like to be a guest pretending to be the host.

213
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,290
I'm telling you...

214
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,620
This house was indeed bought by Ling Yue,

215
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,790
but I pay rent every month according to the law so this is mine.

216
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,490
I have the right to tell you to leave.

217
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,730
How could someone so obedient to the law

218
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,070
be expelled from school for purposefully hurting others?

219
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,820
It has nothing to do with you.

220
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,270
You're so savage. Does Brother Yue know?

221
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,890
Your Brother Yue

222
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,650
just likes someone as savage as me.

223
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,860
Unlike you. You show people one side of you and hide another.

224
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,020
You're pretty hypocritical.

225
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,540
So what if he likes you?

226
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,220
What type of value would your feelings have for him?

227
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,740
Now that he's in trouble, can you help him with your love?

228
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,830
Your love, to him,

229
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,620
is just a sort of burden.

230
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,880
He only lost the Ling Group President position

231
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,490
because of you.

232
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,390
- What do you mean? 
 - This Ling Group's president position originally belonged to Brother Yue.

233
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,340
Why after he was in an accident, suddenly it isn't?

234
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,930
Haven't you thought about the reason?

235
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,420
What exactly do you want to say?

236
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,380
Even like this, you still don't know?

237
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,220
Did you think he could just date you in this lovely utopia

238
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,310
without having to sacrifice anything?

239
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,190
It's only because he was tripped up over your trivial problems

240
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,040
and angered Uncle Ling

241
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,840
that he lost everything that originally belonged to him.

242
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,920
You've already seen all of the rumors on the Internet

243
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,170
about me and Ling Yue, right?

244
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,580
It's fake.

245
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,040
I trust him.

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,430
Whether it's true or false,

247
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,500
is it that important?

248
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,390
What's important is

249
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,080
I am the only person who can help Ling Yue.

250
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,740
You understand this point very well in your heart, don't you?

251
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,330
It's true.

252
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,990
He only has you in his heart right now,

253
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,810
so he's always refused my help,

254
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,230
but do you know?

255
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,450
Ling Yue shed so much blood and sweat to build the New Way you see now.

256
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,080
New Way's strength

257
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,710
determines how high Ling Yue's position in Ling Group is.

258
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,810
As soon as New Way collapses, everyone will mock him.

259
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,400
He will fall from his peak into a pit.

260
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,430
He will become the adopted son that only knows how to rely on his father.

261
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,580
Can you bear to watch someone as proud as him

262
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,150
give up all of this for you?

263
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,740
Even if I leave him,

264
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,250
would Ling Yue choose you?

265
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,390
It's not at all important whether he chooses me or not.

266
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,130
What's important is that you leave.

267
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,620
Xin'er.

268
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,190
Stop talking.

269
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,930
What's wrong, Brother?

270
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,380
Do you want to stick your foot in this again?

271
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,930
If there are any problems, let's talk once we get home.

272
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,150
Go home?

273
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,990
Do you still know which one is your home?

274
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,450
Stop messing around. I'm going back in a few days.

275
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,860
Brother.

276
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm the one who is your biological sister.

277
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,540
The dessert shop that Anxin likes to go to,

278
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,610
I also like that place. Did you know?

279
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,040
But, Brother, you've never thought

280
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,580
of bringing a portion for me, too.

281
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,790
Your heart...

282
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,080
only contains this outsider younger sister.

283
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,010
Xin'er, you and Anxin are both equally important to me.

284
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,920
I don't want the same things other people have.

285
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,960
Anxin,

286
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,450
are you all right?

287
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm fine, Brother. Go back.

288
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,890
You're clearly really sad. Since when did you have to act strong in front of me?

289
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,020
Leave him.

290
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,360
I can't bear for you to suffer this pain alone.

291
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,700
Why do you always want me to leave the person I love?

292
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,090
I...

293
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,350
 can't give you happiness?

294
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,150
I'm just worried about you.

295
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,620
I'm fine, Brother. You don't need to worry.

296
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,530
The news on the Internet is all fake, and I won't believe them.

297
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,240
Go home and go to rest early.

298
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,690
I'm also tired. Goodnight.

299
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,710
Goodnight.

300
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,920
 Even if you don't need me,

301
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,070
 I will always be here for you.

302
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,160
 I'll eat later. I'll come and see you after I'm done.

303
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,890
 Be good, wait for me.

304
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,350

305
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,500

306
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,900

307
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,280
Hello? I need a designated driver.

308
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,160
The address is the entrance of Suhe Bar.

309
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,330
Xin'er.

310
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,670
How did you know I was here?

311
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,110
Sorry for being late.

312
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,570
Yes, you did come too late.

313
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,430
However, I have already called for a designated driver.

314
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,040
Was it that Fast Bird Designated Driver?

315
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,500
How did you know?

316
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,850
I just paid him the fee.

317
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,660
Xin'er, can I get in the car?

318
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,140
Get in.

319
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,170
Why do you seem troubled?

320
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,800
When did you start to care about me so much?

321
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,480
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

322
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,910
Xin'er,

323
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,070
are you really preparing to enter into a marriage alliance with my second brother?

324
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,690
Since you know, why did you still come?

325
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,710
So, is it true?

326
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,560
There are indeed preparations for it.

327
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,740
You are not even willing to lie to me.

328
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,210
But I was rejected.

329
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,180
I originally planned on using this arrangement

330
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,590
to make my father spare New Way for the time being,

331
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,500
but Brother Yue wasn't willing to, no matter what.

332
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,380
Getting rejected repeatedly is truly embarrassing.

333
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,490
Xiao Sheng.

334
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,220
I'm sorry. I'm just thinking on your behalf that it's not worth it.

335
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,620
I'm fine.

336
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,610
Enough. Let's not think of those bothersome problems.

337
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,250
You still owe me a date. How about you make it up to me now?

338
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,070
I've always been wondering.

339
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,320
Wondering about whether one day,

340
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,550
I would be able to watch an open-air movie

341
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,650
with the person I like.

342
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,690
I don't know if I have this honor

343
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,900
to become the one who realizes your wish.

344
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,680
I am sorry.

345
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,990
Why would you need to apologize for this?

346
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,390
Xin'er, whenever you look back,

347
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,550
I will always be behind you.

348
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,330
Dad, why is there only one person standing at the entrance?

349
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,130
How do you have the free time to be staying at home?

350
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm fine.

351
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,820
Dad, did you read the news on your cellphone recently?

352
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,450
I don't check the news on my phone.

353
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,300
Reading too much news from a phone is bad for the eyes. You should also do it less, okay?

354
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,570
Dad, I'll stop! I'll stop.

355
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,540
Dad, if you don't have anything else to do, read it

356
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,850
to understand current events.

357
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,420
No need. If you have anything to say, just be straightforward about it.

358
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,960
Dad, Number Two's company is in trouble.

359
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,580
That's it?

360
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,890
You already know? I thought you don't go online.

361
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,810
I don't, but can't I read the newspaper?

362
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,620
Then, are you not going to do anything about it?

363
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,870
What would I do about it? Number Two is managing the company well.

364
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,400
What could I do about it?

365
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,830
You don't know. Number Two has been bullied pretty hard.

366
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,480
His resources got cut off unexpectedly.

367
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,170
Your information is rather up-to-date.

368
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,440
Of course. In any case—

369
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,070
Aren't we talking about Number Two?

370
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,940
Why are you making things about me again?

371
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,260
You've been talking nonstop about your younger brother.

372
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,380
Are you just wanting to watch what happens,

373
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,350
or are you genuinely concerned about him?

374
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,240
Well, of course, I'm concerned—

375
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,370
Of course, I'm concerned about Ling Group.

376
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,680
Dad, think about this.

377
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Although we granted New Way powerful rights to autonomy,

378
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,660
it is part of our Ling Group after all.

379
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,150
We have mutual interests. Right?

380
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,330
Besides, no matter what, Ling Yue is part of our Ling family, too.

381
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,160
He's your son.

382
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,330
If they beat him, they are slapping you in the face, too. Isn't that so?

383
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,670
Wait!  Why are you laughing?

384
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,830
I'm laughing because you

385
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,930
have finally grown up.

386
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,940
You know you should consider problems from the perspective of the group.

387
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,670
Well, don't we have to look ahead?

388
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,480
In my memory, this is my first time ever

389
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
hearing you say

390
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,990
you were so concerned about your younger brother.

391
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm not concerned about him.

392
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,090
I'm concerned about our Ling Group.

393
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,550
Fine. Regardless of who you are concerned about,

394
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,240
I will keep a close eye on what's going on at your second brother's side.

395
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,380

396
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,980
President Ling, we haven't received much positive feedback since releasing our statement to the audience.

397
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,720
What about France?

398
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,280
They probably heard about this sign of trouble.

399
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,460
They are no longer willing to collaborate with us for the time being.

400
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,100
Gu Yuanchao is willing to go all out this time.

401
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,320
President Ling, Gu Yuanchao had to know about our bargaining chip

402
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,230
to be able to discuss terms with the other party.

403
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,510
However, our collaboration parties all signed the confidentiality agreement.

404
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,560
Moreover, we didn't publicly announce any of those brands.

405
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,980
How did he get the information?

406
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,990
This is also what I'm worried about.

407
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,340
Are you saying that we have a mole in our company?

408
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,390
Does anyone want to eat steamed rice with dried duck?

409
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,560
You are here.

410
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,260
- I have a portion for you, too. 
 - Thank you.

411
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,050
Then I'm leaving now.

412
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,110
I personally cooked this.

413
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,160
It took a long time.

414
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,230
You only successfully learned 20% of my abilities.

415
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,810
Don't eat it then.

416
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,210
Perhaps I've been too tired lately.

417
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,400
I don't even have the energy to eat.

418
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,280
Then I'll feed you.

419
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,860
I could accept that.

420
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,320
Fine.

421
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,940
I will feed you.

422
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,790
Open your mouth bigger.

423
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,900
What a fool.

424
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,670
I suspect you did it on purpose.

425
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,800
You just wanted to choke me to death and inherit my Huabei account.

426
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,800
Do you want some? This is your favorite flavor.

427
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Later.

428
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,160
I actually have some things to tell you.

429
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
There will be a lot of nonsense online recently.

430
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
- It's about me and— 
 - I know.

431
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Rest assured.

432
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,000
I have been on the discussion forums for a long time.

433
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,200
How would I not be able to gain a discerning pair of eyes through practice?

434
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,200
How could these kinds of explosive news stories, created to gain readers and cheesiness,

435
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
trick me?

436
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,700
I was just afraid that you'd feel wronged.

437
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,600
Every moment with you, I will never feel wronged.

438
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
On the other hand, it's you

439
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,300
who has recently been so tired, but you're still working overtime without rest.

440
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,400
This is your so-called balance between work and rest and tireless work.

441
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,000
Do you want to ditch work?

442
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Let's go out to relax.

443
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Go where?

444
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,000
You'll know once we get there.

445

When we were down there, you said you weren't afraid of heights.

476
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,580
That's right. I'm not afraid of heights.

477
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,000
It's good that you're not afraid of heights then.

478
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,400
It's not a big deal to ride on a Ferris wheel for 20 minutes.

479
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,000
20 minutes?

480
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,000
You hit your head. Does it hurt?

481
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,480
If you're afraid, you can hold onto me.

482
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Look into my eyes.

483
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,600
Do you feel a bit more at ease?

484
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,800
♫  Walking across the long street at night with you  ♫

485
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,100
What would you have done if I weren't by your side?

486
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
♫  We can see how far away our future is  ♫

487
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,400
♫  Just by turning our heads back  ♫

488
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,400
♫  We've yet to part but longing has already begun  ♫

489
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,800
Ling Yue, I heard others say that when you reach the highest point on the Ferris wheel,

490
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,000
the wishes you make will definitely come true. Let's make a wish.

491
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,500
That's what they say to trick children.

492
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,000
Dummy. You should listen to your girlfriend at this time.

493
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,200
Okay then.

494
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,600
♫    Promises are too superficial   ♫

495
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,000
♫  Not even as good as one one thousandth of you  ♫

496
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
♫  Countless forevers wouldn't be enough  ♫

497
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,200
♫  Let me love you  ♫

498
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,800
♫   Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

499
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,300
♫  and learn to use warmth to cover up   ♫

500
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,900
♫  the cold memories of the past  ♫

501
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,400
♫  We've walked with the scenery along our journey and stopped  ♫

502
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,200
♫  The story continues on as the camera 
 makes a full-length shot  ♫

503
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,000
Go up.

504
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,800
Someone will see us soon.

505
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,800
The entire building is mine. What would they dare to say?

506
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,600
Childish brat.

507
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,280
I'm leaving then.

508
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,580
I'm leaving.

509
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,400
Ling Yue!

510
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,760
What's wrong? Can't bear to leave me?

511
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,600
I forgot something.

512
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,700
What?

513
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,500
Send me your Alipay account number.

514
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,200
Isn't it good to keep owing me?

515
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,640
Just send it to me. I'll pay it back, bit by bit.

516
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Okay. It's my cell phone number.

517
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm leaving then.

518
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
♫  Hold me   ♫

519
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,600
♫  gently  ♫

520
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,600
♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

521
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,400
♫  Memories are like heavy rain. 
Having never walked through it  ♫

522
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,300
♫  How would you understand?  ♫

523
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,200
What's wrong?

524
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,000
♫  Gaze at me, don't avoid me  ♫

525
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,800
♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

526
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Nothing.

527
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,400
It's just that today, I... missed you a little.

528
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,620
How come I keep thinking something's off about you?

529
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
How could that be?

530
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,200
In Korean dramas, the male leads

531
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,200
make a lovey-dovey fuss for a long time even before going to the bathroom.

532
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,700
This is just a small thing.

533
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,700
Then in the future, we can act more of these kinds of plots.

534
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,200
♫  We nestle against each other  ♫

535
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,500
♫  Like a fortress sheltering the soul  ♫

536
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,400
Go up.

537
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,120
I'm leaving.

538
00:43:50,100 --> 00:44:00,100

539
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:05,800
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

540
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,400
♫  Soaking the memory wet  ♫

541
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,200
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

542
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,400
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

543
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,100
♫  My heart suddenly beats out of normal  ♫

544
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:28,600
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

545
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,000
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

546
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

547
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,200
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

548
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,400
♫  Yet the reminiscing has never been able to stop  ♫

549
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,600
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

550
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:04,600
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

551
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,400
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

552
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,200
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

553
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,200
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

554
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,400
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

555
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,200
♫  Using love to slowly open up  ♫

556
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,600
♫   a lifetime   ♫
