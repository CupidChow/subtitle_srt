1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,960

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,490
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,620
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,580
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,140
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,360
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,650
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,440
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,230
♫  Happiness and sadness make up the moments of life  ♫

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,920
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,390
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,610
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

13
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,060
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,720
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,270
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

16
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,530
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,190
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,820

19
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,580

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,520
Right, I should also warn you.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,340
In the dead of night, as you lie on the couch,

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,190
there are 84 cockroaches in this house at the moment.

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,340
If at night, they crawl and crawl and crawl,

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,040
and crawl onto the couch,

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,510
take care.

26
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,010

27
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,680
 One cockroach can produce 84 larvae.

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,890
 If at night, they crawl and crawl and crawl...

29
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,270
You didn't stay awake all night, did you?

30
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,560
I was just scaring you. How could a normal cockroach go onto the couch?

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,190
You've watched "Infestation" too many times.

32
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,920
Where are you going?

33
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,230
I'm going to buy you some pesticide to keep you from driving yourself crazy.

34
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,760
- Then I'll go, too. 
 - I can just go by myself.

35
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about myself.

36
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,560
"I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about myself." Who wants your worry?

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,380

38
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,040
Green tea flavor...

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,120
You scared me!

40
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,670
Get this one.

41
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,050

42
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,290
Let me tell you...

43
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,360
This one has nice, showy packaging, but it's actually not very good.

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,660
This one is simple and definitely effective. We'll get this one. Let's go.

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,130
Then let's buy both and see which is better.

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,210
Fine, fine!  We'll buy yours. We'll buy yours.

47
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,740
I—

48
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,540
Are you satisfied now?

49
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,070
Coward.

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,270
Let me borrow your phone.

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,900
- What for? 
 - I want to look something up.

52
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,110
Are you done?

53
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,890
Did you do this?

54
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,800
Right after you took my phone, it became like this.

55
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,920
You did it, didn't you?

56
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,100
It looks like you're a coward, too.

57
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,560
Get rid of it! Get rid of it.

58
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,180
This code is only effective for thirty minutes.

59
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,930
After thirty minutes, it will automatically stop.

60
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm telling you, I have a full day of work today. I'm very busy.

61
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,000
You just stay at home obediently and do nothing, you hear me?

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,270

63
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Nana!

64
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,470
Did you hear? The president has already died.

65
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,700
Where did you hear that from?

66
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,430
All of the gossip groups on the work forum have been spreading it.

67
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,460
The upper levels of Ling Group are afraid it will affect the company's stock price, so they haven't made it public.

68
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,990
But the general shareholder's meeting has already secretly begun making arrangements.

69
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,170
If the president really died, won't we all have to leave?

70
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,690
I'm telling you this in confidence. You can't tell anyone else!

71
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,660
I've heard Fit is hiring. We'd better make preparations as soon as possible.

72
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,300
 The President of Ling Group, Ling Yue, has been missing since falling into the ocean half a month ago.

73
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,990
 Ling Group's subsidiary, New Way, has also been in constant turmoil. Its technology was almost leaked by hackers.

74
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,370
 Breaking news! The president already has no chance of return.

75
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,260
 Ling Group is already secretly preparing a funeral.

76
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,630
 Our reporter found New Way's current representative to seek confirmation.

77
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,830
 With regards to the false rumors spreading on the internet, we have already found the help of an attorney.

78
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,690
 We will use the law to protect our rights and interests.

79
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,990
 We ask also our friends in the media to stop making wild guesses.

80
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,380
You can't run all over the place.

81
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,860
If you get hurt, no one will look after you.

82
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,460

83
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,330
How come I didn't think of this?

84
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,690
Am I that attractive?

85
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,630
Narcissist.

86
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,200
Then, why are you taking pictures of me?

87
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,790
I'm helping you find your home. I'm taking pictures of you

88
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,960
so when your family sees your picture, they'll contact me.

89
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,330
That way, you can go home.

90
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,360
Don't delete them!

91
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,230
Stop messing around! Give it back!

92
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,900
You're leaning so close to me. What do you want?

93
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,930
I don't want to do anything. Don't think that way.

94
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,170
There's something off.

95
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,900
I think there's something off about you.

96
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,320
T-Tell me the truth.

97
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Surely you're not some kind of

98
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,260
wanted criminal from the criminal underworld

99
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,060
who broke the law and then hid in my house for fear of being found?

100
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,470
If I was a wanted criminal, you'd be my first target.

101
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,640
After all, you're all alone and are appetizing.

102
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,970
You better not do anything to me.

103
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,130
If you do anything to me, your 250k will be gone.

104
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,780
You haven't finished paying back the money,

105
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,500
so how could I be willing to do anything to you?

106
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,950
I will return it to you!

107
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,420
No matter how far you are or where you are, I will return your money to you.

108
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,660
It's just that right now, it's absolutely not appropriate for a lone man and woman to live together.

109
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,050
Just let me take a photo of you.

110
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,570
Look this way. Turn around.

111
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,900
So... you truly want me to leave?

112
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,010
Xiao Ba, come here. Turn on the flashlight! It's so dark! Quickly!

113
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,330
Don't you have a phone?

114
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,720
Right.

115
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,830
That's not right. I remember I just paid the electric fee.

116
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,160
Have you received a blackout notification?

117
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,120
The night before yesterday, I saw it in the stairwell.

118
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,790
It said the power would be out tonight from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.

119
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,140
Because of electrical maintenance, there will be a temporary blackout.

120
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,660
No wonder.

121
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,470
Why is your bracelet so ugly?

122
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,630
How is my bracelet ugly?

123
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,370
Are you 800 degrees nearsighted or astigmatic?

124
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,390
It's so ugly. Why are you wearing it all the time?

125
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,590
My older brother gave me this. It's a nightmare-filtering bracelet.

126
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,720
Those are just lies told to children.

127
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,990
Don't talk if you don't understand.

128
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,330
You seem to really care about him.

129
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,180
That's right.

130
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,580
He's my closest family.

131
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,090
 What's this?

132
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,310
 I made a bracelet that filters nightmares.

133
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,040
 Not only is it pretty, it'll also eat all your nightmares.

134
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,100
 Really?

135
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,390
There won't be electricity for a while anyway. I'll tell you a story.

136
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,860
In the past, there was an old king.

137
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,910
He wanted to find an heir. Therefore,

138
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,200
he called his three sons to him

139
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,470
and said... he said, "I'm old.

140
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,220
I am going to pass down the throne to you.

141
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,340
You three must engage in a definitive battle to determine the heir."

142
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,030
After it began, the third prince threw away his sword first.

143
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,350
He said, "Between my older brothers,

144
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,770
I am the one with the least strength.

145
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,890
Moreover, I don't have any ability to inherit this country.

146
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,130
I choose to give up."

147
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,440
Now, only the eldest prince and second prince are left.

148
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,990
Throughout their fight, the second prince's sword

149
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,110
already brushed against the first prince's neck. However, he hesitated.

150
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,320
At that moment, the eldest prince took advantage of the second prince.

151
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,180
And then?

152
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,360
And then the eldest prince won.

153
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,340
This king just watched his sons kill each other in front of him?

154
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,340
The king believed in a cruel and savage education.

155
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,070
He didn't even care for the life of his second son.

156
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,880
I think maybe he just didn't like this second son.

157
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,600
Maybe...

158
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,510
his birth was a mistake.

159
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,340
What do you mean?

160
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,740
He's an adopted son.

161
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,760
Adopted son?

162
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,410
What's wrong?

163
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,530
It seems like you relate to it very much.

164
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,020
Because I'm also adopted.

165
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,450
I'm kidding! Are you a pig? You even believed that.

166
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,630
All right. Sleep early. I'm going to go sleep, too.

167
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,690
What's wrong?

168
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,760
You forgot to take this.

169
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,800
I'll be outside. Call me if anything happens.

170
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,380
What could happen?

171
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,190
Anyways, even if something did, what use would you be with that crippled leg?

172
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,910
How come you old fellows

173
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,840
had the time to come together to see me today?

174
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,780
Chairman, how could you say that?

175
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,070
The doctor says you need to rest.

176
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,180
How could we dare to disturb you with trivial matters?

177
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,790
That's right, Old Ling.

178
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,180
Things have been crazy out there.

179
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,420
They all say Xiao Yue has met misfortune.

180
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,040
The company's workers are all uneasy as well.

181
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,980
That secretary that he has by his side

182
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,370
isn't of the Ling family, after all. She can't replace Xiao Yue.

183
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,250
That's right. We should quickly choose a new president

184
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,880
to replace Xiao Yue's position.

185
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,230
We are still uncertain of whether my son is dead or alive,

186
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,820
yet you all have started to form alliances already?

187
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,800
Old Ling, we don't mean it that way.

188
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,350
- Then, what do you mean? 
 - Everyone's worked so hard together for all these years.

189
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,110
We can only be well if the Ling family is doing well. We truly don't have any selfish motives.

190
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,860
Let me think about this matter.

191
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,900
I am slightly tired. Please leave.

192
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,660
Then... we will head over now.

193
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,160
 Hey! Did you see my Transformer?

194
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200
 No.

195
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,240
 What are you hiding?

196
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
 - Nothing! 
 - Let me see!

197
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,440
 Isn't it just a stupid spinning top? Why are you hiding it?

198
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,240
 Acting all weird.

199
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
 I'm warning you. Don't you dare tell Mom and Dad.

200
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,770
 Or else, just you wait!

201
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
 Here, eat some more.

202
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,790
 Xiao Yue! Xiao Yue!

203
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,590
 What's wrong?

204
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,190
Morning.

205
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,050
Morning.

206
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,860
Xiao Ba!

207
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,740
Where's my toothbrush?

208
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,380
I accidentally touched it when I was using the restroom. It fell into the toilet.

209
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,000
C-Can I beg you

210
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,950
to not touch my things?

211
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,430
Then... I'll help you take it back out?

212
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,860
How could I brush my teeth with it after you pick it up?

213
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,580
Makes sense.

214
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,000

215
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,700
Xiao Ba, don't talk. Warning you!

216
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,020
Hello, Youyou?

217
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,100
 Anxin! I have good news! I saw Mike!

218
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,850
 He's so much more handsome than on TV!

219
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,460
Then, did you take a photo with him?

220
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,650
 Of course! I'll be back in a few days.

221
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,750
 Can you let me live at your place for a few days?

222
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,590
 I don't want to go home, or else my parents will nag at me to get married.

223
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,460
No. None of these next few days will work out.

224
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,240
 Why not? Could you have

225
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,250
 hidden a man in your home?

226
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,570
It's— No, no!  The company held a training session and chose me.

227
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,920
They want me to go train outside of the city for a few days.

228
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,080
That's why you can't live here.

229
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,210
 I'm scaring you! All right.

230
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,530
 Then I'll have fun for a few more days before coming back! Bye!

231
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,120
Bye.

232
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,270
I noticed you're pretty good at coming up with stories.

233
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,950
I can also not make them up.

234
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,890
You move out and make some space.

235
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,110
It's all right.

236
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,970
I think the way you speak nonsense is pretty cute.

237
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,370
Right, remember to help me buy a wheelchair.

238
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,030
Imported from Germany.

239
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,780
Imported from Germany?

240
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,150
Wouldn't that be several thousand at the least?

241
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,480
Aren't you about to receive your paycheck?

242
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,180
H-How did you know that?

243
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,320
You talk about it every day. "Paychecks are coming on Wednesday."

244
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,660
You scared me.

245
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,040
What? Why does my right eyelid keep twitching? 
  (T/N: Signifies imminent misfortune)

246
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,420
Grandpa Liu.

247
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,090
- Grandpa Liu. 
 - Hello, Anxin! 
 - Your grandson sent you some good food again!

248
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,450
Here.

249
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,100
It updated again today?

250
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,080
The joy of getting a package is no longer about what's in it.

251
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,800
Rather, it's to guess what your new manga is about!

252
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,560
- I'm glad you like it. I'm going to leave first. 
 - Okay. Be safe on the road!

253
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm leaving.

254
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,080
What brand is your new perfume from? It smells really good.

255
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,670
Layered Fragrance. This perfume's fragrance is not bad.

256
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,000
You can try it, too.

257
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,250
Isn't it Gu Anxin?

258
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
Anxin? Is it really you?

259
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,370
- What a coincidence. 
 - Gu Anxin, it's been so long since we last saw each other.

260
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,440
You haven't even changed a bit.

261
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,810
Nancy, you know this person?

262
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,460
Of course. We used to be classmates.

263
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,560
Did you guys know? This delivery girl

264
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,000
was the adopted daughter that the Gu family abandoned.

265
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,670
Adopted daughter? The one who was kicked out of school?

266
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,670
- Yes! 
 - Nancy.

267
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,280
Stop talking.

268
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,170
Give me Director Wei's business card.

269
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,490
Anxin, this is the business my friend opened.

270
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,070
Go look for him.

271
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,570
He will arrange for you to have a very good job.

272
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,250
- No need. The job I have now is pretty good. 
 - Just take it.

273
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,360
I really don't need it. Thank you.

274
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,300
You are already in such dire straits, yet you are still so arrogant.

275
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,200
Xin'er is only helping you because she finds you pitiful.

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,250
Indeed you were birthed by a mother but didn't teach you properly.

277
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,400
Completely uneducated.

278
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,490
What are you doing?

279
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,760
People like me, who have no upbringing, don't know what our next actions are.

280
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,250
It's best if you watch your words.

281
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm leaving.

282
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,880
Take this.

283
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,770
By the way, Nancy. About your boyfriend's project,

284
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,400
our company no longer plans on investing in it.

285
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,290
This decision is from top management. Please relay this message to him.

286
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,080
Wait, Xin'er.

287
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
Gu Xin'er!

288
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,400
Xin'er.

289
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,440
 You bastard, get out of the Ling family!

290
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,780
 Why did you tattle to Dad?

291
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,200
 I-I didn't.

292
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,660
 It was you, you bastard child. After you came, everything changed.

293
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,650
  It was you!

294
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,510
  It's was you, you bastard child.

295
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,220
Left eyelid twitching brings wealth. Right eyelid twitching brings misfortune.

296
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,910
What are you trying to do?

297
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm asking you. What are you trying to do?

298
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,550
I'm talking to you!

299
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,410
I am the victim, why are you acting like that?

300
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,580
What's wrong with you?

301
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,990
What's wrong with you?

302
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,650
Why are you shaking?

303
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,000
Are you afraid of water?

304
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,210
Wait here.

305
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,320
♫  Gaze at me, don't avoid me  ♫

306
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,380
♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

307
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,340
♫  Let me try to touch your hard shell  ♫

308
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,770
Wait here. I'll go turn off the water.

309
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,360
♫  Hold me gently  ♫

310
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,010
♫  Give me the last of yourself  ♫

311
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,780

312
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,240
♫  how would you understand?  ♫

313
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,420
♫  Gaze at me, don't avoid me  ♫

314

♫  How would you understand?  ♫

321
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Why are you looking at me?

322
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,860
It's nothing.

323
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,160
You're holding the magazine upside down.

324
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,560
Let me calculate this debt with you.

325
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,280
You are responsible for all of this today.

326
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,790
Repair cost, ¥490.

327
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,900
Spanner, ¥30.
 (T/N: type of wrench)

328
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,940
Thread seal tape, ¥10.  
 (T/N: Plumber's tape)

329
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,060
Elbow pipe, ¥20.

330
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,610
Faucet, ¥35.

331
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,040
Water pipe, ¥53.23.

332
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,880
Pliers, ¥15.

333
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,450
In total it is...

334
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,670
¥653.23.

335
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,630
Got it.

336
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,500
By the way, we can clean these things tomorrow.

337
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,880
However, you need to help, too.

338
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,950
Even with your crippled leg, you still must help.

339
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,770
 Here, put this on.

340
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,710
 Thank you.

341
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,590
 It's burgundy.

342
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,400
 I think burgundy looks really good on you.

343
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,350
 You are wrong. I look good in any color.

344
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,380
 But burgundy looks exceptionally good on me.

345
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,870
 Oh, right.

346
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,520
 I didn't think of that.

347
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,650
 The designer who used to really adore me said it himself.

348
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,420
 Who was he? Someone I know?

349
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,320
 No. He's my mother's acquaintance, so you wouldn't know him.

350
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,670
 He adored me since I was a baby.

351
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,900
 So he used to make clothes for me.

352
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,280
 He made them for you?

353
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,640
 Yes. He didn't even make them for his own nephews and nieces.

354
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,700
 But he made it especially for me.

355
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,800
What's wrong?

356
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,590
Aren't you cold?

357
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,580
The weather forecast says it's 30 degrees Celsius today.  
  (T/N: 86 degrees Fahrenheit)

358
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,880
Yes, but there's a big difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures.

359
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,640
So weird...

360
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,360
You have something there.

361
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Just... let me help.

362
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,060
Do you know how many germs are on a bottle cap?

363
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,000
How many?

364
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,530
1.59 million.

365
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,630
Wow.

366
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,760
Moreover, it easily causes harm to the teeth, which will result in gum infection and enamel buildup.

367
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,440
It does sound pretty scary.

368
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,850
Hurry and eat. We still need to go to the hospital afterward.

369
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Doctor, are you certain that everything's normal?

370
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,970
Of course, it's normal. It's not like he's hurt anywhere else.

371
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Did I hurt you?

372
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,610
No. Is the doctor married?

373
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,380
Doctor Liu? He doesn't even have a girlfriend. Who could he be married to?

374
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,490
Everyone's too busy working in the hospital. No one has time to date.

375
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,710
 Sometimes, he'll walk around at home.

376
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,660
What about you?

377
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,310
No.

378
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,330
Then, do you have a girlfriend?

379
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,340
Right there.

380
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,590
Aren't you brother and sister?

381
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,290
Isn't calling each other "brother" and "sister" the trend nowadays?

382
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,640
I still have something to ask you.

383
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,120
His leg is pretty much fully healed,

384
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,100
but right now I think he has mental issues.

385
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,980
Just... he often

386
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,260
says and does some very odd things.

387
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,670
I don't know what's wrong with him.

388
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,990
The CT scan of his head showed no issues.

389
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,990
What you mentioned must've been that after the patient went through a traumatic incident, his mental health underwent a shock.

390
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,090
The patient's family must slowly make sure he recovers.

391
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,970
Can you keep walking?

392
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,910
I'm all right.

393
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,920
Watch out!

394
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,200
So accurate?

395
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,140
Oh my!

396
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,700
You aren't hurt?

397
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,280
How could I be hurt? I've trained before.

398
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,030
Trained?

399
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,270
I catch express delivery with my bare hands.

400
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,560
Wait.

401
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,860
The skin's broken.

402
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,630
So what? It's a small problem.

403
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,030
What are you doing?

404
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,450
It doesn't hurt?

405
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,950
It doesn't hurt. It's just a small injury.

406
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,920
I-It's a small injury. I'll handle it myself.

407
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,610
All right.

408
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,460
Thank you.

Call a car! I'll pay.

422

W-Why are you taking off your clothes?

423
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,750
What? You don't need to shower after getting rained on?

424
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,430
You don't need to take your clothes off in front of me to go shower. Go inside and take them off.

425
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,090
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

426
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,090
The showerhead broke this morning, so you can only use the bathtub.

427
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,210
Go and wash yourself first. I'll go after you finish.

428
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,650
I need you to help me.

429
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,540
Help you do what?

430
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,480
Help me bathe.

431
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,660
What are you thinking about?

432
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,230
What am I thinking of?

433
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,800
Or are you anticipating something?

434
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,120
W-What's there to anticipate?

435
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,050
Y-Your foot's hurt, not your hand.

436
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,050
You can wash yourself every day, but you can't today?

437
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,700
But I need to bathe today.

438
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,120
What's the difference?

439
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,240
The difference is that I, an injured person, cannot get into that tiny bathtub.

440
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,940
Figure it out for yourself.

441
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,060
¥100 per time.

442
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,410
¥200.

443
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,960
You're good?

444
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,110
Then I'll leave.

445
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,560
Wait a moment.

446
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,250
I can't reach the shampoo.

447
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,180
