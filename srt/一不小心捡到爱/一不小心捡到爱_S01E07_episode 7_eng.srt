1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:09,910

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,440
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,610
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,540
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,240
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,060
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,600
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,470
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,060
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,380
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,790
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,400
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,650
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,660
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,290
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,490
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,340
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,640

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,340

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,980
Thanks.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,730
Brother?

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,570
 Given his way of avoiding a problem by walking away from it, if I were her, I would find a new lover, too.

25
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,370
 With which eye did you see that he was good-looking?

26
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,980
 He's very radiant. Girls like his type.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,730
Your mother is always wishing to the moon and the stars for you to return.

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,750
But the first thing you did upon returning wasn't visiting her. Did you think I wouldn't know?

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,280
Anxin doesn't count as an outsider.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,350
Look at her demeanor!

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,900
She is made of the same mold as her mother.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,700
No matter how terrible the deeds she does are, I still wouldn't be surprised!

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,520
That's enough!  Stop fighting. Our son just came back.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,130
However you look at it, Anxin is a child of our Gu family.

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,140
You also promised Sister Jin Wan that you would take good care of her.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,510
This child was indeed too headstrong in the past,

37
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,840
but I trust that she now knows she was wrong.

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,570
Right, Yuanchao. It's your birthday in a few days.

39
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,020
How about we welcome her over to get together?

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,590
You can organize it.

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,120
Leave it to me.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,730
Son,

43
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,520
eat more.

44
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,050

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,370
Hello, Aunt Hong.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,940
 Anxin, have you eaten?

47
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,870
Yes.

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,770
So, tomorrow is your dad's birthday.

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,240
 We're celebrating at the Howard Johnson hotel.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,180
Look... You are, after all, a child of the Gu family.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,720
It's not right for you to stay adrift for so long.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,830
How about you take this opportunity to come back and take a look?

53
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,470
Aunt Hong,

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,390
ever since the moment he drove me out of the house,

55
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,390
 I was no longer a part of the Gu family.

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,850
Are you blaming me for not taking good care of you?

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,440
No. Aunt Hong, you've been very good to me.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,440
- It's just... 
 -  Anxin, your mom was my good friend.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,170
I am partly responsible for your current state.

60
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,710
 It's normal for you to blame me.

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,560
 It's just... your dad's health isn't as good as it was before.

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,510
He keeps wishing for you to come back and see him more often.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,170
Moreover, Ansheng has come back too.

64
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,150
 You two have such a good relationship. You must want to see each other.

65
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,820
 Then it's settled.

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,100
 I'll have Ansheng come pick you up tomorrow. Sleep early tonight.

67
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,170
You sleep early, too.

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
Brother!

69
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,180
Isn't there still a lot of time before the banquet? How come you've come to pick me up so early?

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,390
I'll take you to buy some clothes first.

71
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,170
Buy clothes?

72
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,290
Isn't what I'm wearing fine?

73
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,950
It's fine, but it can be better.

74
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,560
Let's go.

75
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,710

76
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,670
Xin'er, let me introduce you. This is Uncle Jiang.

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,840
- Hello, Uncle Jiang. 
 - Xin'er?

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,800
I haven't seen you in so long. You've grown up to be so beautiful.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,350
Whose eye fell into this?

80
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,770
Am I right, you little brat?

81
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,860
Stop staring.

82
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,440
That's the eldest son of the Gu family, right? Who's that girl by his side?

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,470
I don't know, but she's quite pretty, isn't she?

84
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,840
Do you feel like this girl

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,570
and Chairman Gu's previous wife, Mrs. Jin,

86
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,050
look somewhat similar?

87
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,680
They are really quite similar!

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,790
Could she be the illegitimate daughter Mrs. Jin

89
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,050
had with someone outside the marriage?

90
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,060
What "someone"? Isn't it the chairman of Ling Group?

91
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
That news has gotten around.

92
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,010
Eldest Brother.

93
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,480
Are those people discussing the gossip between us and the Gu family?

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
What else?

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,590
With how loud they're talking, I bet they're afraid others will hear them.

96
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,200
Old Gu,

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,830
this must be Ansheng's girlfriend, correct?

98
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,940
She's so pretty.

99
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,230
All right then, you should talk as a family. I'll go find Old Qin.

100
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,260
You go ahead.

101
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,830
Dad, happy birthday.

102
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,420
This is the gift Anxin chose especially for you.

103
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,570
Happy birthday.

104
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,170
It's good that you've come. No need to make yourself ill at ease.

105
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,490
That's right, Anxin. We're all family. No need to be so formal.

106
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,800
So that person is the five percent?

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,890
If only Dad were here.

108
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,660
Why would he come here?

109
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,690
To come to someone else's territory to recognize his daughter? That's crazy.

110
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,460
I've looked for her for so long. In the end, finding her didn't take any work at all.

111
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,760
As it happens, Second Brother's troublemaker isn't here today.

112
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,390

113
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,070

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,880
Is this Gu Ansheng a stamp collecting machine? What does he need so many awards for?

115
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,230
His gaze is gentle and soft, and his eyes are resolute.

116
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,980
There aren't many top students who are both good-looking and approachable.

117
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,400
This kind of man is most attractive to girls.

118
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,330
When did you learn to judge people by their faces?

119
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,530
This is called having a sharp eye for people. If you don't believe me, ask Ai Li.

120
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,020
As a woman, does she like your

121
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,150
kind of icy-faced man, or this kind of

122
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,320
warm, radiant man?

123
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,910
President Ling is, of course, the most perfect.

124
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,850
You are her boss. Of course, she doesn't dare to say the truth.

125
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,170
Speak courageously! I won't blame you.

126
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,940
President Ling, there is something more important than this.

127
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,770
Miss Anxin was invited to today's Gu banquet,

128
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,040
and this Gu Ansheng went with Miss Anxin.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,460
This Gu Ansheng is...

130
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,850
is Mrs. Gu's son with her previous husband?

131
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,670
He doesn't have any blood relation with Anxin.

132
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,880
Do you feel a little threatened?

133
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,890
Why are you still here?

134
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,490
Do you want to live in my house?

135
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,150
I'm not opposed to it. Your house is big and wide.

136
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,190
President Ling, the most recent news is that Director Ling Fang is also going.

137
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,460
- Make preparations. 
 - You want...

138
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,390
To the Gu banquet.

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
May I be so bold as to ask if you like magic?

140
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,520
You are...?

141
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,130
What's interesting about magic is that it's full of secrets.

142
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,440
But once the veil is lifted,

143
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,520
it may leave people disappointed.

144
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,550
Are you prepared...

145
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,600
to welcome the beautiful secrets of a new world?

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,700
 Why does his manner of speech give me the impression of multi-level marketing? Surely he isn't a swindler?

147
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,650
All of a sudden, I don't want to know.

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,510
The thoughts of women are indeed hard to discern.

149
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,150
Especially beautiful women.

150
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,300
Cheating me of my money won't work.

151
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,130
Do you think I'm here to cheat you of money?

152
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,280
Isn't that the President of New Way?

153
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,600
- He stole a lot of business from Gu Group. How come he's here? 
 - You're right.

154
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,830
Xiao Ba...

155
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,790
Long time no see.

156
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,260
Let me introduce myself. Ling Yue.

157
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,250
- Ling Yue... 
 - Second Brother, your leg sure healed quickly.

158
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,990
Tell me. What's better, Doctor Xiao's medical skills

159
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,840
or your acting skills?

160
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,480
May I invite you for a dance, Miss Anxin?

161
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,720
I don't think I have the qualifications to dance with you, President Ling.

162
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,870
Then may I have the honor?

163
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,490
Long time no see.

164
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,640
Let's have a dance together. Let's go.

165
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,230
Let's dance.

166
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,050
Let's go.

167
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,710
Let's go, too.

168
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,570
Now you see that I wasn't cheating you, right?

169
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,970
How long have you known that younger brother of mine?

170
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,610
We just met by chance.

171
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,160
Then I must give you a bit of a warning.

172
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,330
My younger brother is not a good person.

173
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,930
Most importantly, he wouldn't do anything that isn't of value for him.

174
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,830
What does that mean?

175
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,610
I know you have a lot of doubts. I will explain everything to you one-by-one,

176
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,730
but right now, can you stay away from my eldest brother?

177
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,090
I understand. You want me to stay away from your Ling family.

178
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,390
That's not true, Anxin. That's not what I mean.

179
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,900
Jerk.

180
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,120
Brother Yue, how do you know my sister?

181
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,560
It's a long story.

182
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,170
If my younger brother purposely tries to get close to you, you better watch out.

183
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,070
After all, you have five percent of our Ling family stock.

184
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,470
What five percent?

185
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,230
Aren't you curious about the world behind the secrets? Once you meet my dad, you'll understand.

186
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,600
Your dad?

187
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,750
The Chairman of Ling Group, Ling Tian.

188
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,660
He's also an old friend of your mother, Jin Wan.

189
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,870
Your father doesn't have the slightest relationship with my mother.

190
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,360
As for this five percent of stock you speak of, I don't know anything about it.

191
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,570
Don't make irresponsible remarks.

192
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,730
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,190
Gu Anxin, do you still remember me?

194
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,130
- Anxin! 
 - Anxin, are you okay?

195
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,380
- Anxin. 
 - Are you okay?

196
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,050
- Hurry and call the police! 
 - Don't call the police.

197
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,560
- This is my friend. 
 - Who is your friend?

198
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,840
I must have gotten eight generations of bad luck to have met you.

199
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,520
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have fallen into such a state.

200
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,550
What are you doing?

201
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,280
Anxin, how much longer do you plan on making a mess?

202
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,260
Dad!

203
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,410
Chairman Gu, shouldn't you be protecting your daughter at a time like this?

204
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,120
Ling Yue, this is my family matter.

205
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,390
I hope you can speak less and stay out of other peoples' business!

206
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,910
But I can't stay out of things concerning Anxin.

207
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,930
Chairman, we've disturbed everyone's banquet.

208
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,390
We'll leave right now.

209
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,370
Yu Guo,

210
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,810
I looked for you for so long and never found you.

211
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,070
Let's find a quiet place and I'll explain everything to you. Okay?

212
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,020
Let her go.

213
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,360
- Anxin. 
 - I'll go with you.

214
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,760
This is my private matter. None of you need to follow me.

215
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,820
If you keep following me, I won't speak to you ever again.

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,020
All right, all right. Everyone, stop looking. That was a minor interlude.

217
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,450
Confiscate all the cameras. Delete all the pictures.

218
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,530
Yu Guo, I'm sorry.

219
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,450
I never thought our reunion would be like this.

220
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,830
This pair of hands wasn't the only thing I lost. I lost my whole life with it!

221
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,310
Is this really something your one "sorry" can make up for?

222
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,200
Yu Guo,

223
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,830
I know there's nothing I can do right now that can make it up to you,

224
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,290
but I will do my best to give everything I possibly can to make things up to you.

225
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,320
That's right. You're now a rich girl at the top of society.

226
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,880
What can't you do? What can't you make up?

227
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,500
Stop!

228
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,960
Zoom in on this image!

229
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,110
After that, they disappeared.

230
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,380
- I'll do anything you ask of me. 
 - All right!

231
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,620
Right now, I want your hand. You can use this hand to make things up to me.

232
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,300
What part of the hotel doesn't have monitoring?

233
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,040
Neither the locker rooms nor the bathrooms have any.

234
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,050
Let's hurry and search them one-by-one.

235
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,650
Anxin. Anxin.

236
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,830
Gu Anxin.

237
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,680
Move aside.

238
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,530
Anxin. Anxin!

239
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,490
Send her to the hospital.

240
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,500
When did that brat become so cunning?

241
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,660
Anxin.

242
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,390
Thank you, President Ling. Hand my sister back to me now.

243
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,250
No need.

244
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
What did you say?

245
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,500
Even if your Anxin's friend,

246
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,590
to brazenly take my sister from my Gu family banquet

247
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,800
is not very appropriate.

248
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,330
She is mine.

249
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,630
What nonsense are you saying?

250
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,750
I said, she's mine.

251
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,810
Both of you, take it easy.

252
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,650
Mr. Gu, President Ling and Anxin's relationship

253
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,230
is closer than you think.

254
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,080
What can one picture prove?

255
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,820
Look at the mess you've made.

256
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,920
Make them leave.

257
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,820
And you.

258
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,480
Just for this trivial matter, you've left all those guests

259
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,850
- to the side. 
 - Dad, how can this be a trivial matter?

260
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,450
- Anxin is already— 
 - Ansheng!

261
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,330
Come back with me.

262
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,780
Xin'er, goodbye.

263
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,610
Eldest Brother, why are you holding your stomach?

264
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,450
It's nothing. I ate something bad.

265
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,720
Where is Second Brother?

266
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,140
Second Brother has already left.

267
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,160
Let's go home.

268
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,430
Are you okay?

269
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,280
- Is your stomach okay? 
 - I'm fine.

270
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,630
 Go back to the countryside and live there for a while.

271
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,670
 I will come find you.

272
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,700
 Gu Anxin, we will meet again.

273
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,150
Didn't you say she's fine?

274
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,480
- Why hasn't she woken yet? 
 - The reason she hasn't woken up yet

275
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,520
is not just because of her outer wounds.

276
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,940
It's because her heart has been hurt and has undertaken too much responsibility, resulting in an inability to pump sufficient blood.

277
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,140
I shouldn't have to say who the main cause of this was, right?

278
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,370
Here.

279
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,970
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

280
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,680
It's none of your business.

281
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,190
- Where is Yu Guo? 
 - Well, she... 
 - Yu Guo ran away.

282
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't worry, I won't let her get away with it.

283
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,170
If you dare do anything to her, I won't let you get away with it.

284
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,310
You're too softhearted. She already caused you this much harm, yet you're still protecting her.

285
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,090
I'm indeed too softhearted.

286
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,430
If I hadn't been this softhearted when I first met you,

287
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,590
I wouldn't have been lied to.

288
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,330
- It's my fault. 
 - It doesn't matter.

289
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
Let go.

290
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,380
Go out first.

291
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,660
Me?

292
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,010
Close the door on your way out.

293
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,260
Let's talk.

294
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,810
Talk about what?

295
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,740
Talk about how much severance pay you're planning to give me, President Ling?

296
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,220
- That's not what I meant. 
 - Then there's nothing to talk about.

297
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,010
Let go.

298
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,190
Then... if I let go, what if you run away?

299
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,650
I won't run away. Let me go!

300
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,190
Then we've agreed, you won't run.

301
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,610
Agreed, I won't run away.

302
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,550
No, you must be lying.

303
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,120
If you don't let go of me right now, I'll bite off my tongue and commit suicide now.

304
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,970
I'm going to bite!

305
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,890
Don't be rash.

306
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,820
What century is this even? Would anyone actually bite their tongues to commit suicide?

307
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,390
Can you give me one minute of your time?

308
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,150
Go ahead.

309
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,030
I'm sorry. I've come too late.

310
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,930
Honestly, you left, so there was no need to come back.

311
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,020
I only left...

312
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,110
because there was an urgent matter at home. I had to go back.

313
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,360
Would urgent matters require going to a hotel?

314
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,040
Hotel?

315
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,580
- How did you— 
 - How did I know?

316
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,910
There are already too many things I don't know.

317
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,400
When did you recover from amnesia?

318
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,150
Were you also lying to me about the leg injury?

319
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,470
No, you've been deceiving me since the start.

320
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,410
Just for the 5% of shares.

321
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,290
President Ling, acting must've been exhausting.

322
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,390
Ai Li is just my subordinate.

323
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,790
It's my fault for not telling you some things right away.

324
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,020
I was also a bastard for acting crippled even after my leg healed.

325
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,900
But my feelings for you have always been sincere.

326
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,850

327
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,990
- Dad. 
   - I don't care where you are right now,

328
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,250
 get back here right away!

329
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,280
Anxin, wait for me.

330
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,150
I'll be back soon.

331
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,570
Okay.

332
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,370
Keep your word!

333
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,010
Seal it.

334
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,520
Childish.

335
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,580
This is all that you taught me. Don't shirk your responsibility.

336
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,380
Why are you taking my shoes?

337
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,930
I'm storing them in case you run away.

338
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,090
Ling Yue, do you know a girl named Gu Anxin?

339
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,720
Yes.

340
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,330
- She's the one that I like. 
 - The one you like?

341
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,450
So you're saying you knew where she was all along,

342
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,580
but you hid it from me?

343
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,610
Did you do it for the 5% of shares she has?

344
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,300
Second Brother, that's wrong of you!

345
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,800
How could you cheat Anxin's feelings for such a small amount of shares?

346
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,500
Also, what if...

347
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,310
Anxin really is Dad's daughter?

348
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,840
Wouldn't you have made a huge mistake then?

349
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,030
I truly like Anxin.

350
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,610
Also, she's not Dad's daughter.

351
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,230
This is Anxin's DNA report.

352
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,900
It says she's not your daughter.

353
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,030
If Anxin isn't our family,

354
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,530
why did Dad give her shares?

355
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,710
You're right.

356
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,630
Anxin isn't my daughter.

357
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,110
Since everyone is gathered here today,

358
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,880
I might as well just tell everyone at once

359
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,590
about everything.

360
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,690
The reason I gave her the shares

361
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,910
is because of her mother, Jin Wan.

362
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,530
To me, Ling Tian, Jin Wan is

363
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,690
a person I will be grateful to for the rest of my life.

364
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,880
I remember when I first started my business and failed,

365
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,600
if it weren't for Jin Wan's financial aid,

366
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,270
there would be no way we could have today's Ling Group.

367
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,540
That's why, to me, Jin Wan

368
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,330
was both my friend and even more, my savior.

369
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,550
The 5% of shares

370
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,310
was the promise that I, Ling Tian, vowed to give to Jin Wan.

371
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,330
Although she is no longer here, the words I spoke

372
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,440
will not be taken back.

373
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,970
Although Anxin doesn't have blood relations with me,

374
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,570
Jin Wan's daughter is my daughter.

375
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,810
So you all remember this, do not

376
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,160
harbor any ill intentions toward Anxin!

377
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,290
Second Brother, didn't your leg just recover?

378
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,110
Walk carefully.

379
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,140
You don't have to worry about it, Eldest Brother.

380
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,420
Have a safe trip!

381
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,900
Eldest Brother, why are your words so harsh?

382
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,060
How was that harsh?

383
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,580
Elder Brother, didn't Dad just say

384
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,640
not to harbor any intentions toward Anxin?

385
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,410
Do you have any ill intent?

386
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,060
He did say that,

387
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,830
but if she were both his daughter and daughter-in-law, wouldn't that be approved?

388
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,710
However, I still think you aren't going to be able to beat Second Brother.

389
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,240
Wait!  Whose side are you on?

390
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,650
My sister is in this ward room, right?

391
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,150
No. Hey!

392
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,290
Don't make things difficult for me.

393
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,210
Anxin.

394
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,630
Anxin, I'm here to pick you up.

395
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,360
Anxin?

396
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,730
Anxin!

397
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,270
- Brother! 
 - Come up, quickly!

398
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,060
- Why are you here? 
 - Why aren't you coming up quickly?

399
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,420
I can't get up.

400
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,950
- Can I go down instead? It's not that high up anyway. 
 - Wait for me. I'm coming right away!

401
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,720
Hold on to the rope.

402
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,050
You almost scared me to death. When did you get so capable?

403
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,530
Go back and tell Ling Yue

404
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,720
that I'll return the medical fees and the money that I owe him.

405
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,370
Brother, let's go.

406
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,230
Let's go.

407
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,930
Can I give you the medical fees?

408
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,520
Can you not leave?

409
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,940
Ling Yue will blame me!

410
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,450
 Your call cannot be connected.

411
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,350
President Ling.

412
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,990
 Sorry, friend. I'm useless. I was unable to beat your young, clever, delicate wife.

413
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,480
 Even though I risked my life to block her over and over again, she still got away with Gu Ansheng.

414
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,950
 In order to be pardoned of my crimes, I have decided to ponder on my mistakes for a week. Don't come to find me.

415
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,880
Let's go to Bayberry Lane.

416
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,720
President Ling, you should knock.

417
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,830
Where is Anxin? Where did you hide her?

418
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,110
Isn't hiding people your specialty, President Ling?

419
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,610
Mr. Gu, we are looking for Miss Anxin because we have matters to discuss with her.

420
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,840
Then wait here a second, I will get her to come out.

421
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,170
What are you doing?

422
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,440
Guys can't randomly go into a girl's room.

423
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,210
I am Gu Anxin's brother. Who are you?

424
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,420
I am her destiny. I've slept here several times already.

425
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,520
Watch what you are saying.

426
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,930
You are both males, so it's inappropriate either way. Let's wait for Miss Anxin.

427
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,470
The young master of Ling Group

428
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,600
lying like this in others' houses isn't very appropriate, is it?

429
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,320
The right to use this sofa belonged to me since a long time ago.

430
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,850
That cup is mine.

431
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,430
What a coincidence!

432
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,410
That cup is Anxin's.

433
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,600
Brother.

434
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,260
This President Ling said he wanted to see you.

435
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,470
I already said what I had to say.

436
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,960
I don't have anything else I want to say anymore.

437
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,470
I just wanted to come and see you.

438
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,350
Now that you've seen me, you may leave.

439
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,030
Let's go.

440
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,660
Coincidentally, I'm also hungry. Together?

441
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,930
We are heading to a small and dirty restaurant. Are you sure you want to go? 
  (T/N: Literally "fly restaurant")

442
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,450
- Fly? 
 - That's right.

443
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,280
It's the type of restaurant with a lot of germs, dust, and flies that fly around.

444
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,820
While you're eating, it's possible that something might fall from off of the ceiling.

445
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,680
Do you still want to go eat there?

446
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,460
I... like flies.

447
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,440
We don't.

448
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,690
I think you are like a fly right now, buzzing by my side every day.

449
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,320
You go eat, I'm no longer going to eat.

450
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,550
I'm not going anymore. Don't starve yourself.

451
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,060
Miss Anxin, President Ling has good intentions.

452
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,980
Let's go.

453
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,260
I'm not seeing you out!

454
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,020
If you don't want to go out, let's not go out. I'll make something at home.

455
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,180
What do you want to eat?

456
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,900
Brother...

457
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,150
Why aren't you asking me?

458
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,420
Asking you what?

459
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
About everything that happened recently,

460
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,950
about what my relationship with Ling Yue is,

461
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,040
about why I am treating him like that now?

462
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,180
If you don't want to talk about it, I don't want to force you.

463
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,370
Besides, no matter what happened between you two,

464
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,840
it's all his fault. Right?

465
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,880
Brother.

466
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,020
Did he bully you? If he did, tell me.

467
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,400
I will go teach him a lesson right now!

468
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,770
Ever since childhood, you always favored me so unconditionally.

469
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,840
I remember when we were younger, there was a time

470
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,900
when I fought with my classmates.

471
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,630
I was clearly the one who hit him,

472
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,300
but you just had to rush to his house and drag him out, making him apologize to me before you would let things go.

473
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,660
For this, Aunt Hong punished you to write a week's worth of self-criticisms.

474
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,580
You are the one to talk. Who was the one who

475
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,570
told me to just photocopy my self-criticisms?

476
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,320
Well, who told you to be so bad at lying?

477
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,240
Every time you get caught, you become cowardly.

478
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,710
Right. Who could be as clever as you?

479
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,010
I'll go cook for you.

480
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,500
No need!

481
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,740
You definitely put a lot of good food in my fridge, right?

482
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,320
You should go home early. It's his birthday today.

483
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,090
Why can't Dad see your good?

484
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,890
Once I left the house, I relied on my own hands to keep myself alive. I've been very happy.

485
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,510
Okay! As long as you are happy.

486
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,860
If you are tired, come and find me. I will always be here.

487
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,760
Okay. Then I'm leaving.

488
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,200

489
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,770
That girl named Yu Guo disappeared after the Gu banquet.

490
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,940
We've been continually looking for her.

491
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,020
Let's go.

492
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,480
 I'm sorry, everyone. Due to personal reasons,

493
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,950
 the decision to temporarily postpone the updates of "Accidentally Picking Up a Prince" has been made.

494
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,900
 I look forward to the day we meet again.

495
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,710

496
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,660
Xiao Wang, why are you here?

497
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,520
Sister Anxin, it's really you? This is your delivery.

498
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,500
Mine?

499
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,210
Yes. It's even an emergency order and it's still hot. Eat it while it's hot.

500
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,470
Thank you.

501
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,950
If you have nothing else, then I'm leaving.

502
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,140
- Be safe.  
 - Okay.

503
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,420
My delivery?

504
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,120
 Then I will make food for you every day.

505
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,400
  Gu Anxin, you need to be stronger.

506
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,560
  How can you be bought off so easily? Where's your integrity?

507
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,210
 Right! I remember I still have instant noodles.

508
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,950
 Brother, can't you let me enjoy the happiness of junk food?

509
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,140
What smells so good?

510
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,090
Wow!

511
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,360
Weren't you going to reflect on your mistakes? How come you came back this fast?

512
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,910
It's enough as long as I keep it in my heart, right?

513
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,720
Did you make it? Your cooking skills are pretty good. Make me some someday.

514
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,670
It wasn't me.

515
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,880
It wasn't you? Then who could it have been?

516
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,190
You made it for Anxin?

517
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,770
We have known each other for so long, but you haven't made me a meal yet.

518
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,100
Just for a girl you've known for a few months, you—

519
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,820
You are paying too much more attention to women than to your friends!

520
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,030
President Ling, since Miss Anxin is still mad at you, will she eat what you made?

521
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,960
She is still mad at you?

522
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,080
No matter how mad she is, she won't be upset at the food.

523
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:23,010

524
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,380
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

525
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,920
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

526
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,570
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

527
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,880
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

528
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,680
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

529
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,120
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

530
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,510
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

531
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:04,710
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

532
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:10,750
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

533
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,750
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

534
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:23,260
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

535
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,230
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

536
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,310
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

537
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:41,650
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

538
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,620
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

539
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:53,790
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

540
00:45:53,790 --> 00:46:01,930
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
