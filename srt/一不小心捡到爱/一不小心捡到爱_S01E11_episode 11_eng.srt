1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,460
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,600
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,450
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,190
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,030
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,290
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,510
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,400
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,070
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,250
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,530
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,370
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,950
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,630
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,180
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,460
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,990
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,580

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,480

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,290
I thought about it a lot these past few days.

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,880
I shouldn't have interfered with your issues without authorization.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,140
These are all actions of not respecting you.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,510
I personally thought doing these was for your own good, but I never asked what you needed.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,950
Are you willing to give me more time to learn?

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,920
 I'll try my best to understand you in the future.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,540
 We must communicate when anything happens

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,380
 and be honest with each other, okay?

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,940
 Okay.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,220
You said that you wouldn't do anything.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,610
I'm holding my entire world, how can I sleep?

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,760
Good morning.

34
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,290
You've put your clothes inside the blanket and are not putting them on. Is it because you want me to help you?

35
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,670
No need, I can put them on myself.

36
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,840
You really don't need help?

37
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,280
Really.

38
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,720
You really don't?

39
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,290
All right, then. It's all your fault.

40
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,360
Then I apologize.

41
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Are you murdering your dear husband?

42
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,960
I will blow it for you.

43
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,190
Perfect timing. Just as I was about to go find you, you came.

44
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,250
That man over there is looking for you.

45
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,810
Where is Anxin?

46
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,590
She is changing her clothes.

47
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,830
Do you not understand speech?

48
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,100
I'll tell you one last time.

49
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,130
If you dare to do anything to Anxin, I will make you suffer.

50
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,350
I am also warning you!  Know your position.

51
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,640
Anxin is my woman and I will be responsible for her.

52
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,370
Your woman? Anxin is my sister.

53
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,510
That's not up to you to say.

54
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,350
Brother?

55
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,300
Why are you here?

56
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,260
Are you okay?

57
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,250
I'm fine.

58
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,350
Why do you look this like?

59
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,720
Yesterday, I called you all night and you didn't respond. You almost scared me to death.

60
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,020
Sorry! My phone didn't have any service last night.

61
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,200
Did he do anything to you?

62
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,020
He didn't do anything to me.

63
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,210
Come on. Let's go home.

64
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,540
I can walk myself.

65
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,330
- Ai Li. 
 - Give that to me.

66
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,070
Thank you.

67
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,580
President Ling.

68
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,210
Brother...

69
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,990
Gu Ansheng, do you not have your own car?

70
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,650
My car broke down. You won't mind this little thing, would you, President Ling?

71
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,100
Anxin, let's go.

72
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm leaving.

73
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,990
You're just going to leave like that?

74
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,810
Goodbye. I'm leaving now. Get some rest.

75
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,520
What's wrong?

76
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,370
You're mine now. Don't get too close to other men.

77
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,510
When did I become yours?

78
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,490
Last night, you—

79
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,450
Anxin.

80
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,340
You two? Last night?

81
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,310
Although I don't like you at all,

82
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,520
you are a very important person to Anxin.

83
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,930
Rest assured. I will not let her down.

84
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,630
I don't agree.

85
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,140
President Ling, do you think Gu Ansheng will continue to be an obstacle between you and Miss Anxin?

86
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,210
I trust Anxin.

87
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,080
Brother, the weather has been dry recently. You should drink more water.

88
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,450
What's going on?

89
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,170
Yesterday, you didn't really... with him...

90
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,060
Brother, do you really want to talk about these 18+ things?

91
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,090
- It's so awk— 
 - Anxin.

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,330
Sorry.

93
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,000
Did he take advantage of your situation?

94
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,590
It's not what you think.

95
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,180
So it was of your own free will?

96
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,060
Brother, actually...

97
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,160
Actually, you could try to get to know Ling Yue.

98
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,460
What if I tell you I can't?

99
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,020
Why can't you? Don't have such a huge bias against him.

100
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,200
Try to get to know him. Besides,

101
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880
it's not like it's either him or you.

102
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:37,210
If I tell you that it is either him or me,

103
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,430
who would you choose?

104
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,340
- No, Brother— 
 - Enough.

105
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,270
I'm sure you didn't rest well yesterday. Go and rest a little more.

106
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,620
I'll leave now.

107
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,560
Hi.

108
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,280
Come, come.

109
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,790
- Sit. 
  - There's this, too.

110
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,560
 Okay.

111
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,140
 - Xixi, look. Pour it in here, got it? 
 - Okay.

112
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,160
 Look at this line.

113
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,310
It's easy to get drunk if you drink alone. If you get drunk, who will send you home?

114
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,700
Anxin?

115
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,130
You're so good-looking, how could I feel at ease? 
  (Anxin literally means "feel at ease")

116
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,930
Anxin.

117
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,090
I mistook you for someone else.

118
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,360
You need to learn how to do these things yourself, okay?

119
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I remember now.

120
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,490
Excuse me. Can I have a glass of water?

121
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,280
Hello?

122
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,930
What's wrong?

123
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,010
Right now?

124
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,910
Okay, okay. Then I'll come over now.

125
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you! Let's go.

126
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,950
Did you tell me to come here just so I could pay for you?

127
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,190
M-My bank card was locked a couple of days ago,

128
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,820
and I didn't have any money in my WeChat either, so I could only...

129
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,670
If you'd told me earlier, I could've just transferred some money to you over WeChat.

130
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,590
That's why they say you're both good-looking and smart!

131
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,910
It was such a simple problem. How come I didn't think of that?

132
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,980
God is really too unfair to me.

133
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,180
Is there anything else you need?

134
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
Why do you smell so heavily of alcohol?

135
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,750
I had... a friend who took me out for drinks.

136
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,880
Since I hadn't seen him in a long time, I drank a little too much.

137
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,840
And you still came as soon as I called? You're too kind.

138
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,090
I didn't even have a chance to thank you for sending me home last time.

139
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,230
Now I've bothered you again. I'm really sorry.

140
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,300
How about this? As repayment,

141
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll take you to see a movie.

142
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,600
Didn't you not bring any money?

143
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,810
It's true that I didn't bring money,

144
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,100
but I have a movie card.

145
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,360
The kind where if I report my name, I can see the movie.

146
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,710
You're Anxin's friend, so you're my friend.

147
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,960
- You don't have to bother with this. 
 - That won't do.

148
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,320
I, Xu Youyou, am very particular about fairness in my journey across the Jianghu.

149
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,290
You buy me snacks, I pay for your movie. That way, it's fair.

150
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,020
It's my favorite movie!

151
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,400
Thank you.

152
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,560
 Right, what kind of movies does your brother like?

153
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,610
 My brother likes

154
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,740
 The Notebook.

155
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,880
You say, these two have been separated for so long, but the male lead is still waiting for the female lead.

156
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,690
Can't this female lead take a little more initiative?

157
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,220
This is too painful.

158
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,550
Perhaps when waiting becomes a habit,

159
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,840
it's not so painful anymore.

160
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,050
How do you know?

161
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,100
Perhaps I'm waiting for someone, too.

162
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,520
 What do I do? Is he giving me a hint?

163
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,280
 What do I do? How should I respond?

164
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,040
 "Me too." No, no, no, that's too direct.

165
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,060
 "I can."

166
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,010
 That doesn't work either.

167
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,960
Do you like someone?

168
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,890
For a long time.

169
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,290
 What is this? Didn't we just meet?

170
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,430
 Or is it that even though we've just met, it's like we've known each other for a long time?

171
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,740
 My God! Max-level romance!

172
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,950
Then, why don't you tell her?

173
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,680
I thought it would be enough for me to always watch over her quietly.

174
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,230
I never thought one day, someone would take her away.

175
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,150
What do you mean? Of course, you have to tell her.

176
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,770
God has already put true love right in front of you.

177
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,900
If you don't say anything, and I don't say anything, when will sweet love

178
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,670
come to us?

179
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,500
You're right.

180
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,160
 I'm ready!

181
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,010
I'll think carefully about it.

182
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,310
Thank you, Youyou.

183
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,260
Of course.

184
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,110
 This is a new beginning.

185
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,870
 You've got this, Gu Anxin.

186
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,850
President Ling, Miss Anxin has already begun to send out her resume.

187
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,740
The first round usually looks at educational background.

188
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm afraid her job applications won't go so smoothly.

189
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,480
That's true. Do you need me to make arrangements?

190
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,070
No need. I promised Anxin that I would respect her choice.

191
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,730
- Hello? 
 -  Have you eaten?

192
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,250
Yes. I just ate

193
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,290
a really big hamburger. I'm so full right now.

194
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,400
 Then... is the job search going smoothly?

195
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,530
Yes, of course, it's going smoothly.

196
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,790
Don't worry about me.

197
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,160
Be good. Be at ease.

198
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,020
I have to go to an interview. I'm busy here. Bye!

199
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,680
 Bye. Good luck.

200
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,640

201
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:31,590
♫  Walking across the long street at night with you  ♫

202
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,010
♫  Watching as the street lights flash on and off  ♫

203
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,670
♫  We can see how far away our future is 
 just by turning our heads back  ♫

204
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,670
♫  We've yet to part but longing has already begun  ♫

205
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,130
♫   Hugging you like owning the whole world  ♫

206
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,330
♫   Too beautiful that I fear time is limited  ♫

207
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,170
♫    Promises are too superficial, 
not even as good as one one thousandth of you   ♫

208
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:24,030
♫  Countless forevers wouldn't be enough  ♫

209
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,980
♫   Let me love you. Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

210
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,270
♫  and learn to use warmth to cover up   ♫

211
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,600
 Why does he have a pot on his head?

212
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,290
 But it's still pretty cute! Thank you.

213
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,170
 You've worked hard. You can do it!

214
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,230
 Good night~

215
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,500
The project everyone sees here comes from Cai Niao Posting Station.

216
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
According to Cai Niao Posting Station's logo designer,

217
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,000
the inspiration for this design originated from themself.

218
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,870
Because sometimes, when getting off work late and the number of express deliveries piled up,

219
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,180
there is no place to store them and no time to collect them.

220
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,910
- Later, it was understood— 
 -  Do you always have to go so far to pick up deliveries?

221
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,080
 Since I get off work too late, I can only leave the deliveries with the property manager.

222
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,310
 But I can only put it there for a little while and can't leave it for too long.

223
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,640
 If picking up deliveries were like the bank

224
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,260
 where pickups could happen at any time, wouldn't that be great?

225
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,730
So this idea of a posting station was created.

226
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,270
In every neighborhood, they would...

227
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,490
President Ling, this company was just established.

228
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,960
It primarily focuses on neighborhood deliveries.

229
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,220
Although it looks small, its progression has been rapid.

230
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,900
A company like this must have someone powerful behind it.

231
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,050
Since they've come to the venture capital conference,

232
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,150
- they are looking for another path to advancement. 
 - Understood.

233
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,250
All right. Next, let us welcome Miss Gu Xin'er!

234
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,570
Can we speak alone?

235
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,940
Brother Yue, thank you so much.

236
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,160
Who knew you would support our company so much?

237
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,230
It's a mutual collaboration. You used your abilities to deserve this.

238
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,170
I'm really curious. What part of Cai Niao Posting Station attracted New Way?

239
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,210
After all, there are actually many small startups like ours on the market.

240
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,700
Although the Ling Group is financially capable,

241
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,150
however, according to my knowledge, you aren't someone who squanders money at random.

242
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,070
It's obviously the value and potential of the project that I admire.

243
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,210
Your Cai Niao Posting Station took care of the problem of inconvenience that the working class has been having.

244
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,070
You've matched the lifestyle of young people and met the market's needs.

245
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,220
Most importantly, you've utilized the newest technology

246
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,730
and gathered middle-class workers, alongside laundromats, group shopping,

247
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,970
and recycling agencies.

248
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,850
This one-stop-shop to the neighborhood's services is the center of everyday life.

249
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,640
This matches with New Way's business direction quite well.

250
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,940
Therefore, collaboration is a must.

251
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,320
Brother Yue, you are someone who understands me very much. So...

252
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,250
Let's have a happy collaboration?

253
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,090
Let's have a happy collaboration.

254
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,480
By the way, you have something on your hair.

255
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,230
Let me help you.

256
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,270
All right.

257
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,330
Thank you.

258
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,210
There's no need to be so polite between you and me.

259
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,020
It's best to separate work and life.

260
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,920
But work and life

261
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,400
will definitely have unavoidable connections.

262
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,430
I look forward to seeing you next time.

263
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,490
Don't be in a hurry. You'll find a job suitable for you sooner or later.

264
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,850
It's too hard, Brother.

265
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,720
But thank you for finding time today to come job search with me.

266
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,020
Why are you being so polite with me?

267
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,180

268
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:36,410
 The user you are calling is unavailable. Please call back in a moment.

269
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,140
Let's go to the venture capital conference right now. They should still be there.

270
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,500
There's no need to go, Brother.

271
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,890
It's nothing. I believe in him.

272
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,320
Anxin, I will fight for you.

273
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,940
 Eat fish!

274
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,280
 - He's allergic to coriander.
 - They were the closest in high school.

275
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,850
 I've taken out the coriander for you.

276
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,070
Brother,

277
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,250
did Xin'er and Ling Yue know each other before?

278
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,800
So they knew each other before, right?

279
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,790
They...

280
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,010
were together before.

281
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,650

282
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,000
Ling Yue, he... didn't tell me.

283
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,640
Brother! Anxin!

284
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,260
You've also come to attend the venture capital conference?

285
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,130
Xin'er.

286
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,100
What's going on?

287
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,990
Those boring media people have started writing stories again.

288
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't think too much about it.

289
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,940
- Where's Ling Yue? 
 - He just left a little while ago.

290
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,040
You guys didn't meet him on the way?

291
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,990
He just left?

292
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,120
- You two stayed in the car for that long? 
 - It wasn't that long.

293
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,220
We just caught up with each other.

294
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,990
Xin'er, you clearly know Ling Yue and Anxin are together right now.

295
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,130
Why aren't you clearing up your own suspicion?

296
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,400
Anxin, don't take it personally.

297
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,000
Brother Yue only has you in his heart.

298
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,200
In the past, he put in a lot of effort to give you a gift.

299
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,900
He's just that hardworking for the girl he likes.

300
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,700
Your perfume smells nice.

301
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,600
It's Layered Fragrance.

302
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Do you like it, too? I can't believe our interests are so similar.

303
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,600
 But girls like a unique-smelling perfume.

304
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,200
 Do you want me to recommend you something?

305
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,600
Ling Yue gave it to you?

306
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
Is that important?

307
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,800
It is very important. I am his girlfriend.

308
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Today's situation must've been a coincidence.

309
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,100
Do you know? Many coincidences

310
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,000
were destined to happen.

311
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,200
Anxin, let's go.

312
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,080
Goodbye, Brother.

313
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,400
Hello?

314
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,200
 Boss, I arranged everything. Once the news comes out, I think our posting station can use it to our advantage.

315
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,700
Okay. I understand.

316
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,230
Brother, where are we going?

317
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,400
Didn't you always want to go to see the ocean? I'm going to take you there right now.

318
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Do you want to take a short nap? I'll wake you up later.

319
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,400
 The user you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

320
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,500
 Please call again later.

321
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,000
President Ling, we have already settled things with the photographer. We will also delete any related articles in succession.

322
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,200
But a lot of partners have asked whether you and the Gu family

323
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,000
are truly planning on having a marriage alliance?

324
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,100
The news will bring more positive impact than negative impact to the company.

325
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,700
My suggestion is that we should not confirm nor deny the claims.

326
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,400
Since it is fake news, we naturally must refute the rumors.

327
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,500
President Ling, Miss Gu's business image has always been excellent.

328
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,000
She is also a daughter of the Gu family and our company has a collaboration with her.

329
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,400
Why don't we use this opportunity to build support?

330
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Is this your idea or Cai Niao Posting Station's idea?

331
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,400
It's a plan that we both agree.

332
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,800
When did New Way ever need to create media gossip to build support?

333
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,700
I don't want to see any other news like this within the next ten minutes.

334
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,600
Okay, I will take care of it right now.

335
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,370
Also, immediately send out a notice denying the rumors.

336
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,800
There cannot be anything even slightly ambiguous.

337
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,100
Yes.

338
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,800
After you are done with this, you can also hand in your resignation.

339
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes...

340
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,800
President Ling, I know where Miss Anxin is at.

341
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,250
 While the good sunshine is still here, let's go out to the sea together.

342
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600

343
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
Hi, President Gu.

344
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,900
President Gu.

345
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Hi, President Gu.

346
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
What are you thinking about?

347
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
The rate at which you've been appearing is pretty high recently.

348
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,500
If I cannot occupy a spot in your heart, I can only occupy one in your memory.

349
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I just came by to ask,

350
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
the promise you made me last night about visiting the art museum together... is it still a deal?

351
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,200
If you are willing to wait for me to finish these documents.

352
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,300
Of course I am!

353
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,800
But do you need me to help you take care of the paparazzi?

354
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,600
You can ignore the rumors. It's fine.

355
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Rumors?

356
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Then that means my chance has arrived.

357
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
You brat. What are you thinking?

358
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Xin'er, I'm legally at the age to get married now.

359
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,700

360
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,200
Sorry, I don't want to go anymore today.

361
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
You don't want to go anymore?

362
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,230
That's fine. There's next time.

363
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,400
When you were younger, you always said you wanted to see the ocean.

364
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,100
I didn't have time to go with you.

365
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,800
Since we were young, you were always getting top marks in studying and behavior.

366
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,000
You would always go to things like violin lessons as soon as you were on break.

367
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,200
They wouldn't bring me along so I would stay at home alone and wait for you.

368
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Is it not too late to make it up to you now?

369
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,400
It's okay, Brother.

370
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
You don't need to say these things to your elder brother.

371
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,000
From now on, I won't ever let you get hurt ever again.

372
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Actually it's okay, Brother.

373
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
When I calm down,

374
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
I will go find him and have a clear discussion with him.

375
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
Let's not talk about irrelevant people today.

376
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,300
It's just us two. We will spend the day quietly and peacefully.

377
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,400
Okay!

378
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Anxin!

379
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,800
Anxin!

380
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,300
Why are you here?

381
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Aren't you scared of the water? Go back!  Don't come here.

382
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
I have to explain it to you.

383
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What do you want to explain?

384
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
Are you going to explain how you're wavering non-stop between my two younger sisters?

385
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
- Brother! 
 - Let's go.

386
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,900
Don't—

387
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,600
Ling Yue!

388
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,000
- President Ling! 
 - Ling Yue!

389
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,800
- Ling Yue! 
 - President Ling!

390
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
- President Ling! 
 - Ling Yue! 
 - President Ling!

391
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,100
You're awake?

392
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,190
Careful.

393
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,100
How do you feel?

394
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm fine. Why am I at the hospital?

395
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,600
Ai Li and my brother brought you here.

396
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,600
Why do you have to act so strong?

397
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,200
You scared me to death.

398
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,000
Are you worried about me?

399
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm not.

400
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,810
Anxin, Gu Xin'er and I aren't like what the news has reported.

401
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Then, why did you give me the same perfume as hers?

402
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,100
The perfume debacle was due to my negligence.

403
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,800
That day I was talking to Ai Li about it, and she happened to be right next to us and gave a suggestion.

404
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,600
But I wouldn't have expected her to be so scheming.

405
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,600
So, you two were together before?

406
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Absolutely not!

407
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,000
We were just classmates, and that's it.

408
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,200
- Also, about the picture— 
 - I know about the picture.

409
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,400
It's very obvious that that was just an effect of positioning.

410
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,500
With my intelligent little brain, how could I not see through that?

411
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,200

412
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,900
By the way,

413
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,400
have you always been taking that medication?

414
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,500
This is a medicine that lowers the heart rate. I've been taking it for many years.

415
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,100
Every time I think I am in danger, my heart rate will increase.

416
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,000
I can only rely on this medication to control it.

417
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,100
So...

418
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,500
is it the same with your fear of water?

419
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,600
It's all thanks to my brother that I have a fear of water.

420
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,600
 Why did you tattle to Dad?

421
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800
  I didn't.

422
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
  You're still lying?

423
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,200
♫  I didn't actually have no opinion  ♫

424
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,600
Silly, what's wrong?

425
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,100
I didn't know any of this.

426
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,200
I also said before that you were a coward.

427
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,800
After being with you, I stopped taking those medications.

428
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,700
As long as I have you by my side, I will feel at ease.
