2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,810

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,450
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,630
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,540
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,060
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,280
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,510
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,490
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,090
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,330
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,740
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,360
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,090
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,450
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,240
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,470
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,910
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,660

21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,310

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,550
Anxin, I like you.

23
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,100
Y-Y-You stand there. Stand there. We can talk from there.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,520
I like you sincerely!

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,310
Stand there! Don't come closer!

26
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,500
Listen to me! You need to give me a chance.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,240
- I... No, don't come closer.
 - Anxin.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,530
Listen to me.

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,020
- D-Don't come closer! 
 - Give me a chance, okay?

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,600
Anxin!

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,200
Anxin!

32
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,820
Listen to me! Give me a chance.

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,790
I truly like you!

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,380
You hit me? Anxin... Anxin!

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,490
Anxin! Anxin, open the door!

36
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,180
 Anxin, open the door! Open the door!

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,510
 Why won't you open the door?

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,050
Is it because I'm not as rich as that man?

39
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,210
 Anxin, open the door! Are you women just this vain?

40
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,340
Open the door, Anxin. Anxin! Open the door!

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,020
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

42
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,440
 Anxin!

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,020
 Are you afraid? Anxin!

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,140
 Anxin!

45
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,210
 Open it. You can't escape.

46
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,880
 I'll grab the moon for you.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,350
 The moon can't be grabbed.

48
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,480
  I can get it. Trust Mom. I'll get it for you.

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,260
 Mom!

50
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,160
 Open the door, Anxin. Anxin! Open the door!

51
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,750
Anxin!

52
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,740
Anxin!

53
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,880
Anxin!

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't be afraid. I am here.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,670
I saw that you didn't come straight home, and you didn't answer any of the messages I sent,

56
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,790
so I went looking for you at work.

57
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,300
Thank you.

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,250
I won't let that man off.

59
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,580
Don't be too impulsive.

60
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,960
Your leg injury hasn't even healed yet.

61
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,570
It will be dangerous for you.

62
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,070
Resign from your job. I'll take care of you.

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,220
If I resign, are we going to make a living as street performers?

64
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,510
Don't worry, I won't let you suffer.

65
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,970
Right, the office is so far from home.

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,900
How did you carry me back?

67
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,890
I called a Didi with your phone. 
  (T/N: Chinese equivalent of Uber)

68
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,450

69
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,910
How do you know my Alipay password?

70
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,670
I used your fingerprint to pay.

71
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,710

72
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,570
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

73
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,280
I'm okay.

74
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,720
I just feel like my heart is choked up with anxiety.

75
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,920
Your heart is on the other side.

76
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,090

77
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,900
 Anxin, I like you.

78
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,310
 You're drunk.

79
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,700
  I sincerely like you. You have to give me a chance.

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,310
  - No, don't come closer! 
 - Anxin, listen to me.

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,010
- Sister Anxin. 
 - Sister Anxin.

82
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,750
Sister Anxin, let us take it!

83
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,900
It's okay.

84
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,230
- No, no. We can take them. 
 - I can do it. 
 - It's fine, I can.

85
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,940
Manager Du is coming.

86
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,600
Anxin, don't you know? Manager Du has been fired already.

87
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,270
The boss got a letter reporting him.

88
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,710
It was filled with evidence of him making false accounts and taking kickbacks.

89
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,130
- The boss got so angry after finding out and made him leave immediately. 
 - Exactly.

90
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,740
When did it happen?

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,250
Not long after we arrived at the sales department today,

92
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,530
we received notice from headquarters.

93
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,320

94
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,440
Take it with you. I can't accept it. Yours too.

95
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,650
- Take it back. 
 - You... you must accept it!

96
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,600
- Well... 
 - Yes.

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,500
It's not easy to find work right now, and I don't want to get fired.

98
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,930
What do you mean, "get fired"?

99
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,370
I mean...

100
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,500
In any case, you have to take my token of gratitude.

101
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,730
Take it, Sister Anxin.

102
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,770
- You're back? 
 - Yes.

103
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,940
How come you bought so much? Did you get a bonus?

104
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,280
I'm telling you, it's even stranger than getting a bonus.

105
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,920
As soon as I got to work today, all of my coworkers were nice to me.

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,280
Even the people I don't usually interact with stuffed gifts in my cabinet.

107
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,700
Do you think my boss has taken a liking to me?

108
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,100
But he's over fifty years old!

109
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,710
Stop dreaming. You should go to sleep.

110
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,030
Good night.

111
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,390

112
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,990
Is the matter settled?

113
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,890
 Yes. We have already bought Express Delivery Service.

114
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,820
 President Ling, are we just going to let that Du Ming off so easily?

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,020
Just leave it be for now.

116
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,040
Hey,

117
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,670
it seems like you slept well last night.

118
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,570
I used the aromatic Xiao Li gave me. I slept really well.

119
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,290

120
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,840
Yours?

121
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,250
You didn't hide some embarrassing photos in here, did you?

122
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,000
You're so nervous!

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,160
What are you thinking about?

124
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,220
You're a little different today.

I'm also pretty busy! I-I still need to go to the bathroom to wash the dishes I just ate from.

Because it's hot?

154

Did you finish washing the dishes you ate in your bathroom in your bedroom?

You must really want to know why even though your resume is so exemplary,

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,810
you still can't find a job anywhere, right? Manager Du?

00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,470
 Did you make progress with that handsome boy? Tell me the truth.

162
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,620
What progress? I just posted randomly.

163
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,640
 Stop trying to trick me! Who posts love messages for no reason?

164
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,070
 If you tell me the truth, I'll let you off easily.

165
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,410
 If not, it'll be bad for you! Choose for yourself.

166
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,340
Perhaps... I... I might like him a little bit.

167
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,850
 My god! Isn't that super obvious?

168
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,880
It's obvious? You can tell?

169
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,560
T-Then if you can tell, c-can he tell, too?

170
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,260
 Of course, he can tell! And he also likes you.

171
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,200
No way. How do you know?

172
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,900
 I haven't shipped couples for so many years for nothing!

173
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,650
Then do you think... do you think he has a girlfriend?

174
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,440
 True... He's so handsome.

175
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,630
 There's no way he doesn't have a girlfriend.

176
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,680
Right.

177
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,590
 Don't scare yourself though!

178
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,080
 Maybe he's been single since the womb?

179
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,310
Single since the womb...? Doesn't really seem possible.

180
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,880
He's so great.

181
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,330
 Isn't there a lot of male protagonists like that in novels?

182
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,620
 Your meeting is so legendary, so anything is possible!

183
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,450
 Maybe he's your perfect male protagonist.

184
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,640
 Right? Anxin?

185
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,150
 Youyou, I'll talk to you later.

186
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,180
Manager Du?

187
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,830
 There is further news today about the crazed stalker who caused alarm everywhere.

188
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,080
 The police are currently conducting an investigation according to the security cameras that recorded the suspect.

189
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,210
 We also encourage citizens to actively provide evidence.

190
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,680
 Hello, the phone number you called is unavailable at this time. Please dial again later.

191
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,940
Hello, I am Anxin's boyfriend. Is she at the company right now?

192
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,040
I haven't been able to get in touch with her. Can you let her know?

193
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,740
 Anxin? She isn't at the company tonight. She doesn't have a shift tonight.

194
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,950
 She left work right this morning.

195
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,460
What time did she leave?

196
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,250
 I think it was 6:00?

197
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,840
Okay. Thank you.

198
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,090
President Ling, what are you...?

199
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,810
Come inside to talk.

200
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,670
- Why have you come? 
 - Things are urgent, and I only found out just now.

201
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,030
Look at this.

202
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,990

203
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,190
Tonight, Director Ling Fang will secretly meet with the stockholders.

204
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,620
- When? 
 - 10:00 p.m. at Michelle Hotel.

205
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,010
President Ling, if you don't leave now, I'm afraid it'll be too late.

206
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,430
Time goes by so fast.

207
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,810
I remember when you first arrived at the company,

208
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,320
you were still an intern who didn't understand anything.

209
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,450
That's right. Time went by so quickly.

210
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,840
Actually, about what happened last time,

211
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,040
I-I've always felt very guilty.

212
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,020
I wanted to find an opportunity to apologize to you.

213
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,610
Whenever I get drunk, I act like a jerk.

214
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,710
I troubled you.

215
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,090
I'm really... sorry.

216
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,760
Manager Du, you actually don't have to apologize to me.

217
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,220
Just let the past stay in the past.

218
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,520
I honestly believe that you didn't do it on purpose either.

219
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,510
You believe me?

220
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,640
President Ling, Du Ming disappeared.

221
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
- Keep looking. What time is it now? 
 - 9:00 p.m.

222
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,160
President Ling, if you head back now to the Ling house, you can still make it.

223
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,090
Leave finding Miss Anxin to me.

224
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,250
Let me get off over there.

225
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,110
Okay.

226
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,120
I believe you

227
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,170
because I've also hurt someone before.

228
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,020
I was desperate for their forgiveness.

229
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,040
So, I understand you.

230
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,160
If you understand me,

231
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,650
why are you doing this to me?

232
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,840
What does that mean?

233
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,190
If you understand me, why did you harm me?

234
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,290
Why did you drive me into a corner?

235
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,750
I don't really understand what you mean. What do you mean by

236
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,420
"driving you into a corner"?

237
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,920
You look so innocent.

238
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,220
Anxin!

239
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,160
Anxin! Anxin!

240
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
If I didn't know what you did behind my back, I'd be deceived by your pitiful face.

241
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,020
Even now, I still can't accept what you did to me.

242
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,010
Manager Du, I don't know what you're talking about,

243
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,100
but I think there must be a misunderstanding.

244
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,710
Misunderstanding?

245
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,650
Wasn't I fired because of you?

246
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,850
Wasn't it because of you that I fell to this state?

247
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,730
It's not like that.

248
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,000
- I... No, I don't have to capabilities to do that. 
 - You don't.

249
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
The person behind you does.

250
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,760
Why do you have to force me?

251
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,830
Why won't you let me be?

252
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,240
We can just all go down together. What else?

253
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,150
If you keep doing this, I'm going to call for someone.

254
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,140
Call. Call. Call. You call.

255
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,760
Call.

256
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,370
Anxin!

257
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Anxin!

258
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Run. Run.

259
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,110
Why did you have to force me?

260
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,110
Why? Why did you have to force me?

261
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,880
Tell me!

262
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,520
Anxin.

263
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,280
How are you?

264
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,710
Are you okay? Don't worry, I'm here.

265
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,890
You didn't hurt yourself, right?

266
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,150
Your leg.

267
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,690
My leg is fine. Here, I'll help you up.

268
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,420
Here.

269
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,690
Come.

270
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,770
Are you okay?

271
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,000
Careful.

272
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,610
Xiao Ba.

273
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,920
Xiao Ba.

274
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,760
Xiao Ba.

275
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,410
Come here.

276
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,480
What? You feel sorry for him?

277
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,980
Xiao Ba.

278
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,260
Xiao Ba.

279
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,740
Xiao Ba.

280
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,770
Should we take him to the hospital?

281
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,270
I examined him just now. It's nothing serious.

282
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,050
You should get on the car first. I'll take you home.

283
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,550
- Do you know each other? 
 - Yes.

284
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,480
You should get in the car first.

285
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,580
What should I call you, Miss?

286
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,250
You can just call me Ai Li.

287
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,160
You're Anxin, right? I heard Xiao Ba mention you before.

288
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,260
So you guys are...?

289
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,670
Not the relationship you think.

290
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,860
That's what I was thinking.

291
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,130
How could you like him?

292
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,600
Don't say it like that. He is my savior.

293
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,230
Doing this is my responsibility.

294
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,480
Do I turn right ahead, or...?

295
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,800
Anxin?

296
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,930
Do I turn right ahead or keep straight?

297
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,330
Keep straight and turn right and we'll be there.

298
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,010
Okay.

299
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,860
Left turn.

300
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,900
How come I'm here?

301
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,990
Ai Li brought you back. Shouldn't you thank her quickly?

302
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,970
Thanks.

303
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,620
It's nothing. I met you coincidentally anyways.

304
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,240
It's getting late. I also have to take that person to the police station.

305
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,080
I'll get going.

306
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,140
Be safe.

307
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,070
How did your leg suddenly get better?

308
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,480
It was probably a sudden spurt of activity before collapsing.

309
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,100
After I heard you yelling so loudly, I stood up out of desperation.

310
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,410
What do you mean, "sudden spurt of activity before collapsing"?

311
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,400
It was my instinct that triggered my potential, you know?

312
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,840
I was just smacked by that Winter Gourd Du again. Now I can't stand up again.

313
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,060
Sorry, I know it was because of me.

314
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,680
If you really are sorry,

315
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,400
how about you massage me a few more times?

316
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,540
When did you learn to become so cunning?

317
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,840
I didn't teach you that.

318
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,780
Where's the wheelchair?

319
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,390
I was in too big of a hurry so I forgot it there.

320
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,930
- I'll go find it right now. 
 - There's no need.

321
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,420
Ai Li said she'll buy me a new one, as thanks.

322
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,590
After all, I helped her before.

323
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,540
But she saved your life today.

324
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,010
How will you thank her?

325
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,480
That's right, too. Why does she treat me so well?

326
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,270
Do you think she... surely she hasn't fallen for me?

327
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,480
How is that possible?

328
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,780
Ai Li has such good skills.

329
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,330
Maybe she's a police officer.

330
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,230
I don't know either.

331
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,120
Let's go.

332
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Let's go home.

333
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,580
Take it slowly.

334
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,080
It's already 11:00 p.m.

335
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,080
Is something the matter?

336
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,140
It's fine now.

337
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,320
I won't let him appear in front of you again.

338
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,250
Then, what if he still does?

339
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,800
I won't let this sort of thing happen again.

340
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,720
But what if it does?

341
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,560
I'm here for you.

342
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,490
Okay.

343
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,500
Then that's...

344
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,200
a promise. Seal it.

345
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,220
Seal it.

346
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
This is how you do it.

347
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Rest early.

348
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,200
 Keep watching Ling Fang. Let me know immediately if anything happens.

349
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,950

350
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,840
Come in!

351
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,140
You're here?

352
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,050
Father, what do you think of this proposal?

353
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,160
I had a look already. Not bad.

354
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,250
The idea is quite unique.

355
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,150
Then, how much money are you planning to invest into this?

356
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,800
- Your father hasn't finished speaking yet. 
 - Speak.

357
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,820
If you want to go with this,

358
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,530
you'll need to spend some time to consider it yourself.

359
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,610
After all. there are market risks involved.

360
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,990
After all that talk, you just don't want to invest in me.

361
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,360
You should leave this tough work to the men.

362
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,950
Why waste your time on this?

363
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,160
I can do it, too.

364
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,440
Since you are not interested in this proposal,

365
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,500
I will take this away.

366
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,350
I heard that you've been looking for the Ling family's son.

367
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,780
Which one?

368
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,560
I, Gu Yuanchao, have a daughter with plenty of suiters.

369
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,710
No need to waste your energy on him.

370
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,900
If he doesn't return, I think that's for the better.

371
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,820
Understood, Father.

372
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,910
 President Ling, about the shareholders that Director Ling Fang saw previously,

373
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,750
 some of them have been incessantly seeking the chairman recently.

374
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,640
I fear that they may be discussing the shareholders' meeting.

375
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,550
Do you think that Director Ling Fang may be...

376
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,030
Those old men won't be easily bribed.

377
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,510
However, since it's been a while since I last made an appearance, they will waver a bit for sure.

378
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,420
It's understandable if they are looking for someone for support.

379
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,320
Then, when are you thinking to return to the group?

380
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,670
I'll wait a bit longer.

381
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,040
- Is the Du Ming matter all sorted out? 
 -  Rest assured.

382
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,370
 When all of the charges are combined, he won't be able to live comfortably.

383
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,660
Also, Du Ming has explained.

384
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,720
He only chose to target Miss Anxin

385
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,710
because someone severed his future, meaning he had no other choice.

386
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,330
- Who was it? 
 - It isn't clear yet,

387
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,030
but he is insisting that we did it.

388
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,220
Then it seems that someone is trying to frame us.

389
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,950
Could it be Director Ling Fang?

390
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,200
No way. Knowing my eldest brother, if he knew I was still alive,

391
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,040
he wouldn't be so sneaky.

392
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,640
 Then who could it be?

393
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,280
Don't worry. The truth will surface eventually.

394
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,150
Help me find out whether the time of the shareholders' meeting has been decided.

395
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,650
Who are you on a call with?

396
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,820
It's Ai Li, she said the wheelchair she bought for us has arrived.

397
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,880
"For us"?

398
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
She bought it for you.

399
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,770
Then I'll retrieve it for you after I get off work.

400
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,970
No need. She says that it'll be delivered to the door.

401
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
That's quite thoughtful.

402
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,230
She quite good to you.

403
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,350
Yes, not bad.

404
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,460
 Have a look, this bunch is not bad. It's quite pretty.

405
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,090
 You can choose a few more to complement it.

406
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,720
 - This purple one is quite nice.  
 - Sir, did you want to purchase some flowers?

407
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,830
 President Ling: Shun Jun Hotel, Room 1205

408
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,950
 There's someone tailing you. Make sure to lose them.

409
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,700
No, what's this situation? Going to the bar during the day?

410
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,820
Who knows? Let's just wait for now.

411
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,890
Hello, this is for "Little Cutie"..

412
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,600
- Okay, thank you. 
 - No worries.

413
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,170
Sorry, non-hotel residents cannot go up,

414
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,140
No, I know him. I need to speak to him.

415
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,060
Then may I ask, what is your friend's name?

416
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,840
Next time, make the name up before you try again.

417
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,040
Is there a need for me to make up a name?

418
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,570
I really know him. That's why–

419
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,730
Fine.

420
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,350
Thank you.

421
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,390
Hello, I made a reservation.

422
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,790
- And your name is...? 
 - Ai Li.

423
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,790
"Ai" as in wormwood, "Li" as in bamboo hat.

424
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,240
Your room key card has been retrieved by the man you are staying with.

425
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,550
He just went up in his wheelchair.

426
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,300
Didn't you realize that you were being followed?

427
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,090
Why are Ling Fang's men suddenly following you?

428
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,320
Sorry, it must be that the movement of acquiring of the Express Delivery Service was too big.

429
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,640
We can't hide it anymore.

430
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,880
There has been an update with the shareholders' meeting as well.

431
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,580
It's about the appointment of the company's president.

432
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,320
The chairman was considering all this time,

433
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,280
but today, it was suddenly announced that there would be a meeting tomorrow.

434
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,340
They will give Director Ling Fang the position of president.

435
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,790
Director Ling, you must return to the family immediately.

436
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,870
Let's go. It's about time I gave them a surprise.

437
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,250
Then, do you want to tell Miss Anxin?

438
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,060
If you leave without informing her, she would be worried.

439
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,000
 So you two are...

440
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,830
 It's not what you think it is.

441
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,860
 Do you think she fell for me?

442
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,100
 I have matters to attend to here.

443
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,090
 After I finish, I will go find you.

444
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,490

445
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,480

446
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,110
Recently, the Ling Group has encountered some unhappy incidents.

447
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,340
To become entrusted with it at such a critical moment leaves me with very much pressure.

448
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,840
However, I am thankful for the trust everyone here placed in me.

449
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,740
I will absolutely take on the responsibilities of the president.

450
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,600
I will lead the Ling Group into the future!

451
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,180
I don't accept!

452
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,870
President Ling! President Ling is back. It's really him!

453
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,780
It's Second Brother! Father, he's alive!

454
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:44,560

455
