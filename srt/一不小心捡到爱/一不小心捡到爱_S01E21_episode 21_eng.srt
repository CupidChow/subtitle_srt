1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,450
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,610
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,500
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,200
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,070
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,530
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,450
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,060
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,330
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,740
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,330
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,610
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,130
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,600
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,290
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,460
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,080
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,610

21
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,330

22
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,370
There are so many characters that are no longer legible.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll help you take a look.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,120
I've only just realized

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,170
that she forced herself to smile like this

26
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,540
in order to not affect me.

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,950
If she hadn't met my dad,

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,770
would she have not have suffered this much?

29
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,560
Would she have been happier?

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,970
At least, the sincere smile here cannot be a deception.

31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,140
Auntie was once happy.

32
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,430
At least, you had each other to share memories with.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,180
In the future, I'll do my very best not to bring work home and spend more time with you.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,730
How could you? You need to work well.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,830
Isn't there a saying that says, "A man who works diligently

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,510
always shines and touches the hearts of others?"

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,810
If... you could have more gentleness and tenderness, that would be even better.

38
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,090
How's this?

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,130
Not just towards me.

40
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,930
You should be like this to everyone around you.

41
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,880
For example... Ai Li.

42
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,370
For example... Xiao Yishan.

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,300
- For example... 
 - Xiao Yishan?

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,390
Forget about Xiao Yishan.

45
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,850
He's a hustler himself.

46
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,160
Hello. Do you want to have dinner together with Xiao Ai?

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,840
Excuse me. Wait just a second.

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
It's not a convenient time today. Another day, okay?

49
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,320
Look how many items I brought to show my sincerity.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,690
Surely you wouldn't be cruel enough to lock me out, right?

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,960
I still have work to do today.

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,920
Hello, President Ling.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,770
Okay. I'll arrange it right now.

54
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,280
You can't harass your employees after work hours!

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
  Are you with Xiao Yishan?

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
- I'm sorry, President Ling. Actually... 
   - I won't bother you two any longer.

57
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,480
Just look at this room.

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,760
It sure is unconventional.

59
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,260
It's all Ling Yue's fault. He's worked you so hard.

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,780
You don't even have time to keep your house in order.

61
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,590
Hurry back to your room to work.

62
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,760
Leave this to me. Give me half an hour

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
to return a new world to you.

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,040
What do you think? Aren't I very amazing?

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,480
The last time I came to your house, I thought it was too empty.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,990
So this time, I brought Xiao Ai's luxury house

67
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,450
and stress reliever toys.

68
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,520
While I'm here, I'll display my cooking skills to you.

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
I also bought a set of utensils. They are all for you.

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,970
I don't cook at home. There's no need for two sets of utensils.

71
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,420
Then I'll just come often.

72
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't touch me.

73
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm not that used to

74
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,000
having close physical contact with others.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,140
We're one family. Why are you acting like I'm an outsider?

76
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,550
Don't always be like that.

77
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,430
If you keep that up, I'll become disabled. Fortunately, I'm a doctor who can save myself.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,310
Eat.

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,110
Try it.

80
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,690
How is it?

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,400
Is it absolutely delicious?

82
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,570
I just don't want to waste food. That's all.

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,630
The last time, you said you didn't like boxing.

84
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,960
Then, what do you like and dislike?

85
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,790
I... like going to work.

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,720
I don't like getting off work.

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,750
That's all because of that unscrupulous Ling Yue. What ordinary person enjoys work?

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,590
So, do you not have any sort of private life or circle of friends?

89
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,010
I'm not very good at socializing.

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,660
- What about your family? 
 - All of my family members are abroad.

91
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,290
And I don't really have any close relatives anymore.

92
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,890
Then isn't your house just missing me, who can take care of you?

93
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,990
Actually, after I twisted my waist last time

94
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,770
and you came to take care of me,

95
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,580
many images flashed through my mind.

96
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,830
I suddenly realized

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,450
perhaps a life of two people together

98
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,040
might be much more beautiful than being alone.

99
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,260
So, are you willing to let me walk into your life

100
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,170
and spend all my time with you?

101
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,880
Can we... truly be together?

102
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,080
- I'm still not... 
 - Enough! Stop. Stop!

104
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,290
Don't tell me anything like, "You don't love me,"

105
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,440
"There will be no result."

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,040
You haven't even tried, so how could you reject it?

107
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,670
It's fine. I'll wait for you.

108
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,380
Eat.

109
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,910

110
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,850
Later, tell the other party that we will discuss based on the previous price.

111
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,550
- You've worked hard. 
 - No problem, no problem. It's my duty. 
 - Thank you.

112
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,120
- I'll be going. 
 - Okay. 
 - I'm leaving.

113
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,850
Once I've gotten through to both of these sides,

114
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,760
our studio will expand in the area.

115
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,410
What are you doing?

116
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,160
Is it still not obvious enough?

117
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,460
My pair of large, bright eyes

118
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,760
are filled with admiration for your narcissism.

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Be careful with your word choice. This isn't narcissism.

120
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,250
It's exceptional talent.

121
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,650
I can tell you're going to be a young boss.

122
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,280
You speak so logically.

123
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,220
Indeed.

124
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Youyou.

125
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,520
Thank you.

126
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,210
Thank you for being with me to do something I've always wanted to do

127
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,670
but never did.

128
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,420
Really.

129
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,310
I have to accompany another big client to dinner tonight.

130
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,980
What?

131
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,170
Then, I'll go with you.

132
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,170
Don't drink too much later, or you'll be in pain and roll around on the floor.

133
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,600
No need for that. I don't want you to drink.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,990
Just stay at home and wait to count the money.

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,640
Wait a minute.

136
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,340
Take this with you.

137
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,940
Apple vinegar.

138
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,800
When necessary, you can use this

139
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,030
and pass it off as real wine.

140
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,720
Don't worry. I can do this.

141
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,470
But I don't want to go.

142
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,330
Why?

143
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,590
I want to finish watching the meteors with you before leaving.

144
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,370
Why do I feel like you're getting cuter and cuter?

145
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,570
Really?

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,090
 According to experts, this year's meteor shower will be on the 18th, at 10:00 p.m. Beijing time for thirty or so minutes,

147
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,270
 inviting the rare sight of a rising meteor.

148
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,920
 Its peak speed will be at about 100 meteors per hour.

149
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Don't meteors descend?

150
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,060
How come this one is rising? What does rising meteor mean?

151
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,070
Rare indeed.

152
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,530
Ai Li, is this a harassment call?

153
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,180
If it is, I can pick it up for you. This serial caller keeps on calling.

154
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,340
It's Xiao Yishan.

155
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,980
Did he make you angry?

156
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,160
It's just not appropriate for me to take calls during work.

157
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,460
It can't be considered work right now. You can answer.

158
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,190
The most important thing is that as soon as I pick up, he will...

159
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,820
- He will what? 
 - As long as she picks up, he will go on and on.

160
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,240
You also know what kind of person he is.

161
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,460
He talks so much but there's no point to it.

162
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,030
He clings onto you because he likes you.

163
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,110
The last person who was as clingy as him was Ling Yue.

164
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,690
How hurtful. He's a person who fears loneliness most.

165
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,780
Moreover, he's also very stubborn.

166
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,610
Ai Li, you can spend more time with him.

167
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,680
No. I can't get distracted. My work is protecting your safety.

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,430
But this is your happiness. You have to seize it.

169
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,850
I was thinking of adding a little screen here

170
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,280
and a tatami or something for everyone to rest on together.

171
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,780
Then, help me measure how large the sofa and screen should be.

172
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,670
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

173
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,310
Ai Li, you truly don't have to keep following me.

174
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,120
President Ling said that your studio is under construction, and he was worried you'd be in danger.

175
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,140
He's just been too busy at work, and his nerves have been acting crazy.

176
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,850
Why don't you go back and spend time with him?

177
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,320
No. President Ling would scold me.

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,750
Scold you? Then hit him!

179
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,220
With such good fighting skills, are you afraid you can't beat him?

180
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,690
Don't talk like that.

181
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,490
If it weren't for President Ling, perhaps the person I am today wouldn't exist.

182
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,250
Actually, I felt that you two had a story before, but I didn't have the courage to ask.

183
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,120
Why don't you explain it today?

184
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,260
 Good! Go!

185
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,100
 - Yes! Hit her! 
 - Hit her!

186
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,230
 Great! Fight!

187
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,500
 This strong man is our

188
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,120
 most promising fighter here.

189
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,950
 He can definitely ensure your safety.

190
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,050
 Wasn't my recommendation correct?

191
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,410
 What are you trying to do? What are you trying to do?

192
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,420
 Are you purposefully holding a grudge against me? Let's not even mention this month's paycheck.

193
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,250
 I'm also going to stop giving you food! I'm going to stop!

194
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,860
 I choose her to be my bodyguard.

195
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,580
 You're going to have to consider carefully.

196
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,530
 There are so many people here who are more capable than her.

197
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,760
 You can follow me from now on.

198
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,510
 Number 14, I never would've expected that idiots really did have dumb luck.

199
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,900
 Her name isn't Number 14.

200
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,790
 She is...

201
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
 Ai Li.

202
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,310
 If President Ling hadn't brought me out

203
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,350
of that colosseum-like place,

204
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,090
perhaps I would've been long dead by today.

205
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,330
To be honest, I can really empathize with your feelings.

206
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,730
Some scars truly cannot disappear completely.

207
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,990
The more goodness your heart can feel,

208
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,180
the more you will fear losing it.

209
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,090
Thus, you will subconsciously avoid it.

210
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,260
You are keeping your distance and are afraid to confirm his feelings

211
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,240
because you value him, right?

212
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Ai Li, before I met Ling Yue,

213
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,350
I never yearned to be as happy as I am now.

214
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,160
The truth is that accepting a person isn't that difficult.

215
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,500
I can and so can you.

216
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm going to send President Ling to a social activity.

217
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,490
I am discussing business with President Ling.

218
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,550
I'm helping President Ling deal with official duties.

219
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,730
Did she hire a robot to reply to you?

220
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,710
Online, she's extremely cruel. Offline, she's cruel to the extreme.

221
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,010
In fact, at your current emotional stage,

222
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,960
you already don't need to test her further.

223
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,750
You just need to give her a clear, firm answer

224
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,540
to dispel the doubts and worries in her heart.

225
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,260
Then, give her a sense of ritual that belongs only to her.

226
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,460
This way, she will know that she deserves love.

227
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,180
All right.

228
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,540
Why it is you? Why did you come here?

229
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,480
This is the place where we first met Xiao Ai.

230
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,030
In a blink of an eye, so much time had passed.

231
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Yes, it's still the same.

232
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,270
So...

233
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,440
has our relationship...

234
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,110
also grown a step closer?

235
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,890
Maybe.

236
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,200
Ai Li,

237
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,330
I want to tell you.

238
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,160
The truth is that the first time I met you, I...

239
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,010
I liked you.

240
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,610
But I originally thought we could always be friends.

241
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,540
When I realized that I

242
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,050
was exposing all of my shortcomings to you,

243
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,480
I already knew my fate was sealed.

244
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,120
So...

245
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,570
are you willing to hand your weaknesses to me

246
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,210
and stop being the invulnerable Ai Li,

247
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,320
so I can protect you?

248
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,090
The orbit of a meteor is, in fact, very short.

249
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,840
During that period of time,

250
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,370
it seems like it's going to fly out of the sky.

251
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,710
 However, the meteor is attracted by the gravity of Earth from start to end.

252
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,080
 It eventually approaches Earth.

253
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,400
Just like you and me.

254
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,460
I met you. You have always been the one who harnessed my unknown potential.

255
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,910
Idiot.

256
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,380
Didn't I already promise you?

257
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,850
You really forgot?

258
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,730
 Promise me that

259
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,690
 we will be together.

260
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,850
 Okay, I promise you.

261
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,320
Xiao Yishan,

262
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,180
I don't need you to protect me.

263
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,920
Because I am capable of protecting myself.

264
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,900
But...

265
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,380
I am willing to try to be with you.

266
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,490
I'm sorry. You must be tired from waiting.

267
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,280
No.

268
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,740
I was just thinking about the last time I was so excited to watch a meteor shower

269
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
was back in high school.

270
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,120
I was also there that day. It was on the school grounds after self-study ended that night, correct?

271
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,120
But after all these years, this is the first time I've ever believed in wishing upon a meteor.

272
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,990
Why do I get the feeling that you don't really believe it?

273
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,930
After meeting you, I believe it.

274
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,790
What wish did you make?

275
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,030
Ling Sheng,

276
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,920
are you simple or complex?

277
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,430
Why do you suddenly ask?

278
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,340
In front of you, I am just myself.

279
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,120
Then, how did you know I was at the east corner tower?

280
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,980
Did you assign someone to follow me around?

281
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,170
I was worried about you, afraid something might happen to you.

282
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,420
How could anything happen to me?

283
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,130
I was just afraid you might get hurt.

284
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,180
I hoped I could be there to protect you at the first moment.

285
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,650
Just see it as overbearing care.

286
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,160
But, Xin'er, I really didn't have other intentions. Please believe me, okay?

287
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,610
Okay, I believe you.

288
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,450
Xin'er, I have another special present to give you.

289
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,260
Present?

290
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,750
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

♫  Soaking the memory wet  ♫

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,760
Xin'er,

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,900
will you be willing to be my official girlfriend?

Look.

307
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,890
Look!

308
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,820
Quick! Make a wish! Quickly! If you don't, I'll do it first.

309
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,040
Your wish is mine.

310
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
If I had 100 wishes, I'd definitely split fifty with you.

311
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,600
I'll give you my 100 as well.

Dad?

00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,290
Dad, what's wrong?

319
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

320
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,590
Dad.

321
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,890
I'm fine. Where's Anxin?

322
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,720
Dad, I'm Xin'er.

323
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,960
Xin'er? When did you come home last night?

324
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,130
Don't come home so late anymore. It makes me worry.

325
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,340
I understand, Dad.

326
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,930
Ansheng, these are my accounting records.

327
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,820
Help me pass them on to Manager Zhao, okay?

328
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,960
All right, don't worry.

329
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,130

330
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,690

331
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,720
 Yu Guo?

332
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,170
I got the news that she is alone.

333
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,790
The timing is perfect. Invite her over.

334
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,430
 This time, it's true that our class only has one representative position for the competition.

335
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,870
 Gu Anxin's overall grades are above yours,

336
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,530
 so we are going to let her go this time.

337
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,300
 Remember to use this color here.

338
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,290
 - I'm sorry! 
 - Do you not have eyes?

339
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,890
 You did it on purpose!

340
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,410
 It... It was an accident.

341
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,630
 It was an accident?

342
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,040
 You accidentally got the scholarship

343
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,190
 and accidentally got the competition opportunity.

344
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,890
 What kind of fake good person are you pretending to be?

345
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,970
 I think you did do it on purpose. You're the one with the most ulterior motives.

346
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,790
 I didn't do it on purpose.

347
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,800
 I got your clothes dirty. I'll get you new ones.

348
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,830
 Fine! If it was an accident,

349
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,290
 I also accidentally poured water all over you!

350
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,200
 Is that okay? I'm telling you right now—

351
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,270
 Yu Guo.

352
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,660
 It was this girl.

353
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,190
 She took away the life that originally belonged to you.

354
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,100
 Ruining the creativity you were so proud to have.

355
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,560
 But, child, don't be afraid.

356
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,060
 From today forward, I will be your family.

357
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,210
 I help you and care for you like this

358
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,930
 not because I want you to pay me a debt of gratitude.

359
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,740
 It's in order to allow you to get on your feet again.

360
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,630
 One day, you will get justice for yourself.

361
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,700
 Slowly. Don't be anxious.

362
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,470
 The person who harmed you will pay the price.

363
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,230
What do I say to her?

364
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,120
Do you need me to teach you what you should say?

365
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,860
Hello?

366
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,170
 Anxin, is that you? I'm Yu Guo.

367
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,570
Yu Guo?

368
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,140
Where are you? I looked for you for so long but couldn't find you!

369
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,970
 I left the country for a while.

370
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,860
Yu Guo, how have you been doing? Are you well?

371
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,560
 I... I wanted to see you. Can you come?

372
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,200
Of course, I can!

373
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,830
I'm really worried about you.

374
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,760
 I want to see you alone for the last time.

375
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,410
Yu Guo, please don't take things too hard.

376
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,210
Wait for me. Hello?

377
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,330
Miss Anxin?

378
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,360
 Let Yu Guo find a secluded, abandoned building to hide Anxin.

379
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,280
 You must watch her carefully. You can't let anyone know. Especially not Ansheng.

380
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,490
 Also, when Ling Yue comes to us and you've gotten what you need,

381
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,960
 allow them to have a proper meeting for a while.

382
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
 Operate cleanly.

383
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,300

384
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,350
 The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

385
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,380
President Ling? The shareholders meeting is about to start.

386
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,860
The foreign investors have arrived ahead of time.

387
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,440
Let them know the meeting is postponed.

388
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,650
Anxin!

389
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,360
Anxin!

390
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,040
Anxin!

391
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,740
 Anxin!

392
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,780
 Anxin!

393
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,940
 Anxin! Where are you?

394
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,980
Tell him to come here.

395
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,320
 Anxin!

396
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,850
 Anxin.

397
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,410
 Anxin.

398
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,020
 Anxin? Where are you?

399
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,880
Young Master Ling, we're here.

400
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,190
Ling Yue, don't come here!

401
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,590
Go! Don't come here!

402
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,080
Leave.

403
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,390
Leave!

404
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,230
Don't hurt her.

405
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,370
State any conditions.

406
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,240
Young Master Ling, I prepared a little something for you.

407
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
Take a look.

408
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,020

409
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,030
Just for this?

410
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,530
Sign it.

411
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,380
Don't sign it. Ling Yue, you can't sign it!

412
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,220
Don't touch her!

413
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,050
Stop spouting damn nonsense! Sign it now!

414
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,820
Okay, I'll sign it.

415
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,380
Don't sign.

416
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,890

417
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,220
Here.

418
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,100
Are you all right?

419
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,910
Ling Yue, watch out!

420
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,930
Hello?

421
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,050
Yes, I know. Send me the location.

422
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,600
Ling Yue.

423
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,500
Ling Yue, are you all right?

424
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,450
Ling Yue, are you okay?

425
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,300
I'm fine. What about you?

426
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,870
In a moment you won't be fine.

428
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,120
Yu Guo, did you know this was against the law?

429
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,450
Mind your own business.

430
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,940
I'm fine.

431
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,970
Great. I'm done here.

432
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,590
Whatever revenge you take next

433
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,170
is up to you.

434
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,910
What do I do with these two?

435
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,540
All you need is a fire

436
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,810
to be set up to look like a homocide caused by a lover's quarrel,

437
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,460
and everything will become buried like a secret that will never come to light.

438
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,610
Don't you hate this woman?

439
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,660
Your chance has arrived. Don't miss out.

440
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,330
Why did you become like this, Yu Guo?

441
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,880
Isn't it thanks to you?

442
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,630
If you hadn't pushed me,

443
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,280
would I be like this?

444
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,150
It wasn't like that.

445
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,010
What caused your accident back then wasn't falling from the stairs.

446
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,010
It was because of alprazolam.

447
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,790
You mistakenly swallowed alprazolam medicine, and that's why you are in this condition.

448
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,240
I have the medical records. I can show you.

449
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,560
Really! Please believe me, Yu Guo.

450
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,550
No way! I don't believe it.

451
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,050
All these years, you had no evidence.

452
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,210
Now that death is at the door, you've found some?

453
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,870
Fine. This is a grudge between me and you, right?

454
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,310
Yu Guo, can you let him go?

455
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,560
Let him go. He's innocent. Hurry and let him go. I beg you!

456
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,400
He's innocent, but aren't I?

457
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,620
Did you know how hard it was for me to recover after all these years?

458
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,370
Whenever I think of you living so shamelessly, I feel hate!

459
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,420
Now, I'll let you get a taste of despair!

460
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
What happened?

461
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,560
The natural gas has already been leaked. We need to leave here immediately.

462
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,020
If I must die, I must bring you two with me!

463
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,940

464
