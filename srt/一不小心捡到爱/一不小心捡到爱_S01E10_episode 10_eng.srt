1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,510
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,600
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,530
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,090
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,280
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,580
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,480
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,060
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,300
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,720
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,400
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,440
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,200
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,470
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,060
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,570

20
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,420

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,390
  I, Ling Yue, promise to rent this house

22
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,850
 to Miss Gu Anxin exclusively.

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,800
  I promise to never raise the rent or sell it.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,900
  If the terms of the contract are violated,

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,320
  I will voluntarily lose all of my rights to the ownership of this house.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,220
 The house will be returned to Miss Anxin.

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,930
Aren't the terms of this contract written too unfairly for you?

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,390
I'm the landlord. You're paying me rent. It's very fair.

29
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,170
It's just like this IOU letter. Back then, I took advantage of you.

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,210
Now it's your turn.

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,440
Thank you.

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,850
This is where our relationship began.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,980
Now, it is where our relationship continues.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,980
We will hug each other closely and never separate again.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,260
Let's go home.

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,940
Wait.

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,080
We are an official couple now. Asking for a good-night kiss isn't going too far, is it?

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,140
You should go home and rest early.

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,090
Then, I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.  Good night.

40
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,760
Good night.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Wait a second.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,500
Good night.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,340
Good night, Elder Brother-in-Law.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
Who's his brother-in-law?

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,240
Come on. Let's go home!

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
We're leaving.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,830
- He hugged me. 
 - He likes you.

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,900
Brother, cool down your anger.

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,960
Want some beer?

50
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,160
You and Ling Yue, what...

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,390
Did you agree to be with him so easily?

52
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,960
It's... It's just a kind of feeling

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,580
called an "inexplicable work of outer forces." I don't know whether or not you know. 
  (T/N: Literally, "the work of gods and demons". It's the feeling where one believes their actions are being controlled not by their own will)

54
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,640
  You really have fallen in love with him.

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Brother, I heard about it.

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,730
Youyou told me what happened yesterday.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,860
Yesterday, she might have been a li-li-little nervous—

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't use Youyou to change the subject.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,550
Exactly what is going on between you and Ling Yue?

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,120
It's exactly what you saw.

61
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,810
No, Brother. Ling Yue and his family are all very good people.

62
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,320
Other than... Other than his elder brother... Ling-Ling-Ling Ling Fang,

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
everyone else is really great.

64
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,130
You know that they're good just after meeting them once?

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,650
Looks like you've really fallen too deep.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,560
If you really like him that much,

67
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,550
I'm willing to let you two give it a try.

68
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,760
But you have to agree to one condition.

69
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,660
If he mistreats you, you must tell me.

70
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,600
No matter what, you can't let yourself suffer.

71
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,760
I understand.

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,170
I just know you are the best.

73
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Where's your bracelet?

74
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,380
When I was leaving the house, I put it in its box.

75
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,880
You'd better wear it. If you do, I'll feel more at ease.

76
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,210
It doesn't matter. I rarely have nightmares anymore.

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,180
Really?

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,300
You've worn it for so many years.

79
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,970
Suddenly, there comes a day when you don't need it anymore.

80
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,370
- What? 
 - Nothing.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,320
By the way, I have one more thing to tell you.

82
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm getting ready to move back to Barberry Lane.

83
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,210
- W-Wasn't that apartment sold? 
 - Yes, it was.

84
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,320
But the new owner is still planning to rent it out.

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,870
I made it in time and met with him.

86
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,440
If this new landlord pushes you out with no notice just like the last one, what will you do then?

87
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,160
He won't.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,940
This homeowner and I signed a... very special contract.

89
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,360
I won't get kicked out. Don't worry.

90
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,950
You just moved in and now you're leaving.

91
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,870
Do you really like that place so much?

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,060
That place truly isn't as nice as yours,

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,210
and it's not as comfortable,

94
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,490
but I really have gotten used to it.

95
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,550
Besides, there, I have some very, very, very precious memories.

96
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,080
Brother, I'm just moving.

97
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,690
You don't need to treat it like we will never see each other again.

98
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,980
You can come and see me whenever you feel like it.

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,410
I can also come over here to see you often.

100
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,380
But... I've already grown up.

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,100
I can't always live at your house.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,080
You can always live at my house.

103
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,640
Okay, okay, okay.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,210
I'll help you whenever you want to move.

105
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,180
Hello. I'm here to help Miss Anxin move.

106
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Ai Li, I've caused you a lot of trouble today. You've worked hard. Thank you so much.

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,880
It's nothing. It's my job.

108
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,930
President Ling originally planned to come personally today,

109
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,600
but suddenly, he had to go to a meeting. So...

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,430
Hadn't we agreed to do this move tomorrow? Why do it this suddenly?

111
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,760
From what I see, he's acting kind on the outside but actually hateful on the inside. How petty.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,450
The sooner you move back, the earlier President Ling's suspensed heart can finally calm down.

113
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,280
Then, I'll be going.

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,400
Be careful.

115
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,800
- Be safe on the way back! 
 - You don't need to walk me out.

116
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,390
That's it for today's meeting.

117
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,140
If you don't have anything to add, let's disperse the meeting.

118
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,430
What's up, Anxin?

119
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,490
Department Head, I have a

120
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,580
an idea that isn't fully fleshed out that I'd like to get everyone's opinion on.

121
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
No problem. Then, let's look at it together.

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,260
Okay. I'll hold everyone up a few more minutes.

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I'd like to make a story about a 9-headed bird who falls into the human realm 
  (T/N: The 9-headed bird was a legendary creature and early form of Chinese phoenix)

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,110
My inspiration comes from the 9-headed bird in the

125
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,060
"Classic of Mountains and Seas," the 9-headed phoenix. 
  (T/N: Ancient compilation of all Chinese mythological creatures and geography)

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,250
Because I think two-dimensional art forms combined with traditional Chinese myths

127
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,860
can invite a new direction of modern trends.

128
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,510
I think we could try it out.

129
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,180
These are some new character images that I've created,

130
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,290
and there are also some broad idea outlines.

131
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,450
It doesn't seem like this style of drawing suits our company's audience.

132
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,840
That's true, but I think Anxin's topic of selection

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,970
can be tried out.

134
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,640
However, the target audience for this style of selection is too niche.

135
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,970
Moreover, it doesn't conform to the taste of today's youth.

136
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,990
Have you done marketing research?

137
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,180
She definitely hasn't. This isn't even a sector of the market.

138
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,980
Besides, these demonstration sketches are far too crude.

139
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,880
Our company has indeed not used this kind of idea before,

140
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,680
but I see that this theme is quite original.

141
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,970
It's not that we can't do it.

142
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,110
How about this? Anxin, right now,

143
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,270
upload ten episodes and we'll look at the results.

144
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,690
Do you have the confidence to do this?

145
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,210
I'd like to try it.

146
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,220
Ling Yue!

147
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,090

148
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,290
I have to work overtime today. You should go home first.

149
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,820
Why do you have to work overtime again? Did your boss arrange more work for you?

150
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,510
No. It's that I haven't finished the work I was arranged to do.

151
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,910
Then, how late will you be working?

152
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,250
I think it might take until early morning.

153
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,300
Don't wait for me. If you're down here waiting for me, I won't be in the right mood to work.

154
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,310
It's so unsafe for a girl like you to work until the early hours of the day.

155
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,280
It's fine. Our company's security is quite good.

156
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,630
What's good about it? I haven't seen even one security guard.

157
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,480
Enough. Don't be so long-winded. Go on back, okay?

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
I'll watch you get in.

159
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,490
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

160
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,120
Why are you still here?  You didn't wait here all night, did you?

161
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,640
How could I do that?  Do I have that much free time?

162
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,390
Quick, get in!

163
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,520
Here, eat your breakfast.

164
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,340
Have you eaten?

165
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,950
Eat more.

166
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,150
I have to eat quickly. I have to get back up there after I finish eating.

167
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,140
You still have to work?

168
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,720
You can't sleep a little while?

169
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,730
How could I sleep?

170
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,460
I have a blanket in the car. Sleep awhile.

171
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,930
You said you didn't wait for me. If you weren't waiting for me, where did this blanket come from?

172
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,180
Then look at who I am.

173
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,770
I am the best boyfriend.

174
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,940
My boyfriend is so cute.

175
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,450
I haven't brushed my teeth.

176
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,170
It's fine. I haven't brushed mine either.

177
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,910
 Gu Anxin, what right do you have to be so happy?

178
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,550
  Gu Anxin, you can do this.

179
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,290
  Don't be a coward.

180
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,390

181
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,870
Did you see the data on The Alluring Nine-Headed Phoenix this morning?

182
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,120
I saw it, I saw it. I can't believe Anxin is so capable.

183
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,560
She just released more than ten chapters and it's already at the top of the rankings online.

184
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
First time in history.

185
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,020
What? Surely you can see through this fakery?

186
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,650
She obviously bought that data.

187
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,710
She brought her first place online ranking?

188
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,760
No way! Normal people don't have the ability.

189
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,930
Of course, normal people don't have the ability.

190
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,220
Our paratrooper here has New Way's president backing her up.

191
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,830
The rumors are true?

192
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,740
I heard the boss reporting to New Way's president this morning.

193
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,600
The original numbers weren't even that high before.

194
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,230
I didn't expect...

195
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,410
Anxin would have such support backing her.

196
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,780
Otherwise, what would you have thought?

197
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,970
How could an ignorant rookie like her join our company otherwise?

198
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,820
So many artists can't even get in.

199
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
You see, people are greedy.

200
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,160
Originally, the data for The Alluring Nine-Headed Phoenix wasn't bad,

201
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,640
but she insisted on becoming first on the web.

202
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,850
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

203
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,310
Although I'm a rookie, I definitely won't buy data.

204
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,740
I will go investigate this.

205
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,120
Hello, if you don't have an entrance card, you may not enter.

207
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,230
Then please help me notify them that I'm looking for your President Ling.

208
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,560
Please give me your ID.

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Anxin?

210
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,740
You came just in time. Do you have an entrance card? They're not letting me enter.

211
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,300
I don't need it. I use my face.

212
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,200
What's going on with you two?

213
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,720
This is your future Lady Boss of New Way.

214
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,750
It's all his fault!

215
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,460
I told you to let the Lady Boss go in. What were you doing, you—

216
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,480
- When did you say that? 
 - What about it?

217
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,590
 What did I do?

218
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,130
Let's talk in private.

219
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,000
You two may leave first.

220
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,710
Why did you come? Did you miss me?

221
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,010
There are some things that are not appropriate to say over the phone.

222
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,070
What words?

223
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,130
Was my entry to Brilliant Worldly Culture your arrangement?

224
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,890
You know all of it already?

225
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,290
So this morning's The Alluring Nine-Headed Phoenix

226
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,240
data was all bought by you, right?

227
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,070
Yes.

228
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,870
The truth is that I kept thinking,

229
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,060
as long as I kept working hard,

230
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,150
even if it's slow or even slower,

231
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,900
I will eventually become a talented manga artist

232
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,880
using my own abilities.

233
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,820
But why did you let all this happen so quickly?

234
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm still not qualified to have all this yet.

235
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,150
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

237
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,650
I just wanted you to focus on doing what you liked.

238
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,820
Even without me, you could still use your abilities to join Brilliant Worldly Culture.

239
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,990
I merely added wood to stoke the fire for you. You must believe in yourself.

240
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,510
This is not the problem of adding wood.

241
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,490
You built a stairway of clouds to bring me up to the sky.

242
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,680
The higher I fly, the worse it will hurt to fall. Don't you understand this logic?

243
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,660
Compared to silently releasing an entire series at home,

244
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,660
wouldn't going to an honorable company to work and do the things you enjoy

245
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,200
be killing two birds with one stone?

246
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,090
Honorable?

247
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,950
So you think...

248
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,000
getting a job that others don't even dare to dream of having through doing nothing is considered honorable?

249
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,020
Not to mention, I never thought silently releasing a series at home was not honorable.

250
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,690
Is this something embarrassing? Is it?

251
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,700
Your so-called honorability...

252
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,600
ignored all my efforts.

253
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,680
That's right.

254
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,640
In your world of elites,

255
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,470
even feelings can be used as a bargaining chip for shares.

256
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,810
These are separate matters. How did you drag this back to the shares?

257
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,970
I did all of this for your own good.

258
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,560
Is it bad enough for you to be so mad at me?

259
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,800
You think it's not bad enough, right?

260
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,070
Let's separate and calm down for some time.

261
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,390
Let's talk about the future things later.

262
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,760
No, we can't separate. Not for even a minute or a second.

263
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,960
I already said what needs to be said.

264
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,690
Let's talk it out, okay?

265
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,590
Let's make things clear.

266
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,770
I already made it very clear.

267
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,510
You're the one who has no way of understanding me.

268
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,440
Are you trying to detain me here?

269
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,010
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,880
I'm fine.

271
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,950
Good, as long as you're fine.

272
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,610
I'll sit with you for a bit then.

273
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,830
It'll be fine in a few days.

274
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,530
What right do you have to still come here?

275
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,490
I'm still Anxin's boyfriend. How do I not have the right?

276
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,890
You still have the face to say such things.

277
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,500
As her boyfriend, you let Anxin be this upset?

278
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,360
This is an issue between me and Anxin.

279
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,450
What does it have to do with you?

280
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,980
Since we were young,

281
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,040
Anxin's issues are mine.

282
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,050
Her being upset over someone who's not even slightly worth it, I won't allow that to happen.

283
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
Then, what do you want to do?

284
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,310
I will protect her.

285
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,620
If you can't give her happiness, get lost as soon as possible.

286
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,880
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

287
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,520
 The higher I fly, the worse it will hurt to fall. Don't you understand this logic?

288
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,610
 Your so-called honorability ignored all my efforts.

289
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,660
- Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! 
 - You're so noisy!

290
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,670
God, please continue.

291
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,710
- Don't you need to go to school? 
 - It's the weekend today.

292
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,770
Can't you find something else to do?

293
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,460
The class belle originally asked me out to play games today,

294
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,180
but she's mad at me and went to tutoring class instead.

295
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,490
Then you two are suffering the same problem!

296
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,020
Chubby kid, make way. The adults are going to talk.

297
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,360
My mom said that this isn't being chubby.

298
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,550
It's bodybuilding.

299
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,300
Schwarzenegger.

300
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,780
I just knew that you would be here.

301
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,790
You're becoming more and more like your old man now.

302
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,240
What do you mean?

303
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,420
Are you always annoyed that your old man

304
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,310
arranged for you to be the president of the group without giving you the chance to prove your ability?

305
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,790
How are all of your arrangements for Anxin any different from your old man's arrangements for you?

306
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,760
You always say that Anxin has a very stubborn personality.

307
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,370
She's so stubborn,

308
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,140
yet you still dare do that. You're really something.

309
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,200
That wasn't my original intention.

310
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,240
Then your old man must've also had good intentions originally.

311
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,000
 Anxin, the person you're looking for has recently been lurking in Green Tree Village. This is her address.

312
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,260
 No. 189 at Green Tree Village, Ningyuan Town.

313
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,530
 Sorry, the caller that you're dialing is temporarily unavailable.

314
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,710
- Alipay. 
 - Okay.

315
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:33,220
 Brother, I found Yu Guo. I'm going to Green Tree Village right now. You don't need to pick me up tonight.

316
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,190
 Sorry, the caller that you're dialing is temporarily not within the area. Please call again later.

317
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,240
Hello.

318
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,470
May I ask, have you seen Miss Gu Anxin?

319
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,480
Anxin? She got off work early today and has already left.

320
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,890
She left early? Did she mention where she was going?

321
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,130
It seems like... she's going to visit some old friend.

322
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,350
She's at Green Tree Village or something.

323
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Thank you.

324
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,680
President Ling, Yu Guo seems to be at Green Tree Village.

325
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,800
Yu Guo, are you home?

326
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,300
Why are you here?

327
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,770
It's too dangerous for you to come here alone.

328
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,170
You don't need to get in my business.

329
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,140
Wait a second.

330
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,830
Wait a second, okay? Wait a second.

331
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,340
Yu Guo, I'm coming in.

332
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,680
Yu Guo?

333
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,670
It's about to rain. Let's go back.

334
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,980
Her luggage is all still here. She'll definitely come back.

335
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm going to wait for her here.

336
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,130
What happens if she doesn't come back? Are you going to keep waiting for her?

337
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,030
Let's go.

338
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,990
It's about to rain. Get in the car first.

339
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,360
It's not like I don't have legs. I can walk by myself.

340
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,150
Are you sure? It takes 30 minutes to walk to the train station from here.

341
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,200
If it rains, then let it rain. It's not like I haven't been rained on before.

342
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,860
I know you're not afraid of getting rained on.

343
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,650
but your outfit is so see-through today. What happens if everyone sees everything?

344
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,590
I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself.

345
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,490
Why are your hands so cold?

346
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,370
Do you feel a bit better?

347
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,500
I already transferred the transportation fees to you.

348
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,930
There's no need for the two of us to discuss money. I'm not accepting it.

349
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,500
I accepted it for you. If you don't accept it, I won't ride your car.

350
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,230
Are you rich? Why do you always use money to solve problems?

351
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,890
I don't have money. I'm just copying someone else's mold and learning from certain people.

352
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,880
The car is out of gas and there's no gas station nearby.

353
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,590
I don't think this rain will stop any time soon.

354
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,900
If we don't want to spend the night in the wild, we must make other plans.

355
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
Boss, sorry to interrupt.

356
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,090
Do you have a phone for us to borrow?

357
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,110
- Boss. 
 - Booking a room.

358
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,170
Welcome, VIP customers.

359
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,670
Boss, can we borrow your phone?

360
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,670
The heavy rain was so spontaneous.

361
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,540
It cut my signal. I can't even watch my live broadcast.

362
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,920
- Does he not want us to borrow the phone? 
 - Seems like it.

363
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,980
Married couple, if you want to talk, do it in the room.

364
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,220
- We're not a married couple. 
 - You're not?

365
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,670
Then, why are you two standing so close?

366
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,960
Help us open two rooms.

367
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,570
Okay, one master bedroom.

368
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,710
No, it's two rooms.

369
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,740
What a coincidence. Our motel

370
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,450
only has one master bedroom left.

371
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,290
How could there only be one left?

372
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,200
It doesn't seem like there are people here, and it doesn't have the look of a full motel.

373
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,850
- Why don't we go to another place? 
 - Okay.

374
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,010
Go ahead. Go ahead.

375
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,210
Look at several hundred-mile radii around this small area.

376
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,050
See if this is the only place.

377
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,550
I'm afraid that there won't even be one single room by the time you come back.

378
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,380
If so, then one bedroom it is.

379
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,400
Okay.

380
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,370
Hotels are like this nowadays.

381
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,270
They always like to do weird things.

382
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,820
What are you getting that for?

383
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,930

384
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,540
Just make do with it tonight.

385
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,170
But there's only one bed here.

386
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,090
- Why don't— 
 - We can't.

387
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,670
We can't what?

388
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,240
I meant why don't I sleep on the floor and you sleep on the bed?

389
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,160
What? Do you want to sleep with me?

390
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,080
As if!

391
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,370
Quickly go and shower. Don't catch a cold.

392
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,300
Got it.

393
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,940

394
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,760
I already helped you blow dry your clothes.

395
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,390
Thank you.

396
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,430
Let's sleep early. Hurry and go shower.

397
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,580
- Sit down. 
 - What's wrong?

398
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,640
Your hair is all wet. You'll catch a cold if you sleep like that.

399
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,050
What are you doing?

400
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,830
There's a cockroach!

401
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,290
How could a cockroach run as fast as you?

402
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,720
Are you comparing me to a cockroach?

403
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,630
Okay, go down and sleep. It's dead.

404
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,030
I already smashed it. It's gone. Go.

405
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
You sleep on the floor then.

406
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,900
I'll sleep then.

407
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,700
Fine. Actually, you can sleep on the bed,

408
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,190
but I have to create a 38th parallel that neither one of us can cross. 
  (T/N: Reference to the uncrossable line between North and South Korea)

409
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,900
We'll sleep on our own sides, understand?

410
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,410
This is the 38th parallel.

411
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,480
You can only sleep on that side and I can only sleep on my side.

412
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,240
Do you understand?

413
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,790
Goodnight.

414
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,260
Since we've already slept together—

415
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,470
Why are you talking so carelessly?

416
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,090
What do you mean by "we've slept together"? This is called,

417
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,370
"Using a bed together."

418
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,100
Okay.

419
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,260
Since we already used a bed together,

420
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,070
can you forgive me for what I did before?

421
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,420
Isn't it said that nothing can't be solved after sleep?

422
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,720
I really don't know where you learned such inappropriate phrases.

423
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,740
Answer me first.

424
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,200
You're making me forgive you, but do you know where you were at fault?

425
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,410
I know. I thought about it a lot in these past few days.

426
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,570
Look at me.

427
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,540
I shouldn't have interfered with your issues without authorization.

428
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,950
I forgot to consider your feelings

429
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,790
regarding the 5%, leaving you,

430
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,870
and more importantly, when I was arranging your job.

431
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,420
These are all actions of not respecting you.

432
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,100
I personally thought doings these were for your own good,

433
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,790
but I never asked what you needed.

434
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,460
I won't interfere with your issues without authorization in the future.

435
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,430
I will love you using the method that you want.

436
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,790
Are you willing to give me more time to learn?

437
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,470
Why are you laughing?

438
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
It seems like you've never said

439
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,490
so many words in one go.

440
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,880
It's like you're writing an essay now.

441
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,960
Promise me first.

442
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,320
I actually calmed down and thought about it for a bit.

443
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,780
We're from two different worlds after all.

444
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,960
We will unavoidably have different thought processes.

445
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,670
Just like how I like to eat roasted sweet potatoes, but you say it's unsanitary.

446
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,060
I don't think that way anymore.

447
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,200
What I meant is that even if it's like that,

448
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,940
it's still fine.

449
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,580
As long as our purpose is to help the other,

450
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,760
I'll try my best to understand you in the future.

451
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,500
We have to communicate when anything happens

452
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,120
and be honest with each other, okay?

453
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,430
Okay.

454
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,030
We don't need this 38th parallel then, right?

455
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,960
Since we made up, we don't need it.

456
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,700
Okay then, but you have to promise me

457
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,070
that you can't do that "Hm" thing.

458
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,360
What "Hm" thing?

459
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,680
It's...

460
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,390
Nothing. If you don't understand, forget it.

461
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,290
Okay.

462
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,830
Anxin!

463
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,560
Anxin!

464
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,150
Anxin!

465
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,500
 The money has been transferred to your account already. Immediately move somewhere else to live. Don't act impulsively.

466
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,230
 I understand.

467
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,920
You said that you wouldn't do anything.

468
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,800
You were the one who stoked the fire first this time.

469
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,230
Weren't you already asleep?

470
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,100
You kept moving around and it woke me up.

471
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,230
How could that be? I was moving very quietly.

472
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,930
I am holding my entire world, how can I sleep?

473
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:40,000

474
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,330
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

475
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,960
♫  Soaking the memory wet  ♫

476
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,430
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

477
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,820
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

478
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,570
♫  My heart suddenly beats out of normal  ♫

479
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:12,120
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

480
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,660
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

481
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:23,660
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

482
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:29,680
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

483
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,060
♫  Yet the reminiscing has never been able to stop  ♫

484
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:42,160
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

485
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,160
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

486
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,520
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

487
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,530
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

488
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:06,620
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

489
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,900
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

490
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:22,230
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
