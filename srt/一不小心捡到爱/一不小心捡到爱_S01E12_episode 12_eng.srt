1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,500
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,580
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,500
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,090
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek   ♫

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,350
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,560
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,500
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,260
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,800
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,360
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,120
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,450
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,180
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,320
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,010
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,560

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,230
So you two were together before?

22
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,040
Absolutely not!

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,090
We were purely classmates.

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,020
That's where it ends.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,250
- Also, regarding the photo— 
 - I know about the photo.

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,330
It's obvious that that was a positioning trick.

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,720
I have such a smart brain. Of course, I can think of that.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
 So is being afraid of water also like this?

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,820
 Being afraid of water was all thanks to my eldest brother.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
 As long as you're by my side, I'll be very at ease.

31
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,950
 After Johnny's group of people changed jobs last time,

32
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,240
they left with the SA system that we were developing.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,300
Fit is preparing to hit the market and they are about to release the SA system with improvements.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,790
If they succeed in releasing it, then our technology will

35
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,420
be worthless in the market.

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,720
Most of Ling Fang's money was invested in Fangyu Construction.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,290
Things like research and development cannot successfully be completed in such short periods of time.

38
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,250
Where did he get so many launch funds?

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,410
The major shareholders behind Fit are part of the company. I really don't understand.

40
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,040
Why must these major shareholders invest in Fit?

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,320
Looks like they're determined to follow Ling Fang.

42
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,730
Ling Fang must've promised those people that they would get high benefits in return,

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,720
and they made the preparations to divide New Way's dividends.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,730
Come on. We're going to Fangyu Construction.

45
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,320
Okay.

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,790
Uncles, don't worry. I won't disappoint your hopes.

47
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,100
Then we'll all rely on you, Director Ling Fang.

48
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,320
You scared me to death!

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
W-Why did you stand behind me without making noise?

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
If you don't usually do any guilt-inducing things, what would you have to fear?

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm happy today. I won't hold it against you.

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,300
This time, you really used a merciless move. The two-pronged approach.

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,730
Not only did you inflict a heavy blow on New Way, you also took the opportunity to rope in many major shareholders.

54
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,050
Using Ling Group's money to block off New Way's survival route

56
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,110
is really a good method.

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,220
What do you think will happen once Dad finds out?

58
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,250
Then tell him.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,080
Haven't you always been a crybaby who only knew how to tattle anyway?

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,010
Let me put it this way. Even if he did find out, things will be fine.

61
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,540
It's a perfect chance for him to see how I, Ling Fang, can support some random

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,360
company and still easily replace your New Way that you put all of your efforts into.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,370
Didn't you always say that only e-commerce

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,170
and technology can represent the future of the Ling Group?

65
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,050
I'll let you see what the future is really going to look like.

66
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,760
You're always so impatiently trying to defeat me.

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,880
- What exactly do you want to prove? 
 - To prove that I'm the only successor to Ling Group

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
while you're nothing.

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,900
Don't you fear that your excessive greed will land you in a self-made mess?

70
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,610
All of this was originally mine!

71
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,840
You just got a share of it toward the middle!

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,100
You have the face to say I'm the greedy one? Ridiculous.

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,430
What consequences?

74
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,300
What consequences? What consequences?

75
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,720
I think you are just calling the grapes sour because you have no way of getting to them.

76
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,210
Then I hope your wish comes true, Eldest Brother.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,640
- Seriously, why doesn't this brat have any feelings of anxiety? 
 - Exactly.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,420
He's making me quite unhappy.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,980
Is everything prepared?

80
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't let him get another chance.

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,540
He's a gecko who pokes into every nook and cranny.

82
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,740
Don't worry, everything has been prepared.

83
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,400
Let's go.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,680

85
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,280
Nana, Jiejie, Beibei, and Xiao Chi, tell the people from your department to have a meeting with me.

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,100
This time, the invasion of hackers caused the company a severe loss and the leakage of multiple important documents.

88
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,290
The company is now making arrangements to recover them.

89
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,980
The amount recovered is... less than 35%.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,300
In terms of abilities, we have two groups who have applied for resignation.

91
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,090
We need to arrange effective people immediately to get into those positions.

92
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,160
Are you trying to murder me?

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,740
I was... was practicing.

94
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,720
Practicing?

95
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
Why did you come?

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Your delivery girl is here to send you shrimp.

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,310
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

98
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,480
Let's go.

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,690
Very fresh grilled shrimp

100
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,050
paired with the citrus oolong

101
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,600
is truly amazing.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you smell the deliciousness?

103
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,780
What is it?

104
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,900
Could it be that you've never eaten grilled shrimp before?

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,310
Give it a try. Give it a try and you'll know. It's really tasty. Come on.

106
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll demonstrate for you.

107
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,940
Remove the head and the tail.

108
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,480
Give it a try. Fine, let me do it.

109
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,990
I don't think this shrimp is ready for someone to eat yet.

110
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,940
How is it? Is it tasty?

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,400
Put on the gloves. Here.

112
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,710
Is it tasty?

113
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,060
Your delivery girl has accomplished her mission today.

114
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,250
I won't disturb you from working. I'll get going first.

115
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,310
- Let me send you. 
 - No need, I can go back myself.

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,170
No. Wait for me here. Let me go wash my hands.

117
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,760
I'll come back soon. Wait for me.

118
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,970
 Don't worry, I'm here.

119
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,010
 I won't hog up your time, Overtime-Working Dog.

120
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,600
 Hurry and finish so you can come and look for me.

121
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,160
Gu Xin'er, long time no see.

122
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,380
This is the rich daughter of the Gu family.

123
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,260
She gets on the Hot Search quite often.

124
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,760
Isn't she the one who has recently been in rumors with New Way's president?

125
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,900
Isn't that true, Xin'er?

126
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,010
What's going on with you and the second young master of the Ling family?

127
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,210
See, the two of you can be considered childhood sweethearts.

128
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,940
Why did he personally come out to deny this issue with you?

129
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,020
I heard you're getting married. Congrats.

130
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,310
Surely it isn't the Master Chen that we took back our investment from?

131
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,200
How could it be? I dumped him long ago.

132
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,900
My fiancé is Chairman Qin's son.

133
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,790
Turns out that it's the VIP golf managing Chairman Qin's son. Impressive.

134
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,880
Since you and Young Master Qin are getting married, I'll have to trouble you with persuading him.

135
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
It's been more than two years. Stop sending me flowers every single day.

136
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,580
I don't want our company's cleaning staff to do

137
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,750
useless cleaning every day.

138
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,840
You're spouting nonsense! It must've been you who seduced him!

139
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,060
Are you okay?

140
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,850
I'm fine.

141
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,340
Auntie, this fairy sister already said

142
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,090
it was your fiancé who kept pestering her wishfully.

143
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,050
Then, please go back and control your man properly.

144
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,470
Stop splashing others in public.

145
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,760
Make it clear, who's an auntie?

146
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,740
How did you know I was here?

147
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,530
Looks I need to post more cautiously in the future.

148
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,350
Then your fans won't be happy.

149
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,430
Thanks for today.

150
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,980
But at this time, the art exhibition should be closed already.

151
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,760
It's fine, there's always next time.

152
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,250
However, there seems to be a livehouse near here

153
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,880
just about to start operation.

154
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,330
Wait for me. I'm going to purchase the tickets right now!

155
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,760
How are things?

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,770
Don't worry. Everything has been prepared.

157
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,210
There are still three hours left before Fit's ceremony starts.

158
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,110
Is there any movement from New Way?

159
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,570
Nothing much.

160
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,540
Seems like my younger brother is trapped in a warm and cozy place and can't come out.

161
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,740
Director Ling, your diversion tactic was so wise.

162
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,710
Let me ask you. Is Ling Yue

163
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,890
going to be unable to save this hopeless situation?

164
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,580
He will be unable.

165
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,120
Am I handsome?

166
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,630
Handsome.

167
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
Let's go to Fit.

168
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,920
Hello?

169
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,740
Now?

170
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,040
- Boss. 
 - What is it? Speak.

171
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,230
Fit just received a legal notice.

172
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,390
What do you mean?

173
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,980
On the basis of stealing trade secrets, New Way just filed a lawsuit with the Disputes Department.

174
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,950
So suddenly?

175
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,670
Block off the news. Fit must join the market as normal.

176
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,720
What's that expression? Say it!

177
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,560
I'm afraid there's no way. It happened too suddenly.

178
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,540
The shareholders of the company seem to have already received the news.

179
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,050
They are selling Fit's stocks at a low price.

180
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,690
These impatient old men.

181
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,840
Just a lawyer's note made them unable to hold back.

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,070
It seems that the shareholders received an email last night.

183
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,050
It contained the turnover sales data of Fit.

184
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,860
They're saying we're giving everyone empty checks and

185
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,500
that the promised growth rate is very hard to achieve.

186
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,010
Immediately buy all those circulating shares back. Do you hear me?

187
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,750
Yes.

188
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,690
Enter!

189
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,960
President Ling.

190
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,060
I'm afraid you can't buy your shares back.

191
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,730
What do you mean?

192
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,970
Do you think Fangyu Construction can't afford it?

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,230
For now, let's not talk about whether you can afford it.

194
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,520
The more important thing is whether I'm willing to sell them to you.

195
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,290
What does it have to do with him?

196
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,920
It was you.

197
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,920
Let go! Let go!

198
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,770
Call security!

199
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you afraid of a woman?

200
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,310
Look, Director Ling, even if security comes, they won't  be able to beat her.

201
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,270
This isn't that simple.

202
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,940
Why do I feel like I got tricked?

203
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,740
Did you plan it a long time ago?

204
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,220
Eldest Brother, did you think I didn't know you've been coveting New Way for a long time?

205
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,580
My car accident was also a part of your plan.

206
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,220
Stalling me so Fit could rise easily.

207
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,490
You would even have time to take away my team and steal New Way's core technology.

208
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,640
You've known for a long time?

209
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,520
You did it on purpose!

210
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,150
In order to mess me up, you even dared to give me your own company's core technology so easily. You're really cruel!

211
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,000
But you think you won?

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Let's see how long your company can last without the core technology.

213
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,250
I am still Fit's biggest shareholder!

214
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,760
Do you think that by taking away my team,

215
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,840
taking away the SA system,

216
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,260
New Way would collapse?

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,750
Actually, I need to thank you.

218
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,330
I always thought New Way's personnel was redundant. It's all thanks to you

219
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,930
for helping me do some staff reduction.

220
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,500
I've always invested in new students inside and outside the country

221
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,810
to carry out fully automated technology research and development.

222
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,030
So far, it has been very effective and ready to enter the construction phase.

223
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,970
So that SA semi-automatic system

224
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,720
was nothing more than an illusion you created?

225
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,060
Originally, it wasn't.

226
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,300
It's just that you allowed me to advance my plans. That's it.

227
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,780
If it weren't for your premature greed,

228
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,560
maybe you wouldn't have lost so much today.

229
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,850
Also, if you keep being so greedy,

230
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,070
you will sooner or later be swallowed by your ambition.

231
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,380
Either way, you won.

232
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,870
You get to have all the cool talk.

233
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,400
Damn.

234
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,870
D-D-Director Ling, are you okay?

235
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,830
Hello. Chairman Liu.

236
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,320
No, it is definitely not like what the rumors say.

237
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,940
Our boss...

238
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,190
He isn't here. Yes. He coincidentally left the country a few days ago.

239
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,120
Yes, yes.

240
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,010
Boss, what do we do?

241
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,050
Right now, all the shareholders are looking for you.

242
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,030
What can we do?

243
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,070
Let me think about it.

244
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,540
I will not be seeing a single person who comes to see me in the next few days.

245
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,270
Okay.

246
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,020
Hello. Director Zhu.

247
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,050
By the way, President Ling, the Dispute Department needs new evidence.

248
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
No need.

249
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,430
I understand.

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,590

251
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,610
All these resumes didn't get any response, like rocks sinking into the ocean.

252
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,410
Being corporate livestock sure is hard.

253
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,220
Don't be anxious. I haven't found a job either.

254
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,310
If you really can't do it, just go back and be the president's wife.

255
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,080
Or inherit the president's family business. It's not bad either.

256
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,220
Look at you going again. It's not like you don't know.

257
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,340
Look over there.

258
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,960
Let me tell you.

259
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,310
That person has been taking selfies ever since we sat down.

260
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,600
Isn't he far too narcissistic?

261
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,190
With his looks, even if he opened skin smoothing and beauty filters,

262
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,460
- it still wouldn't be good enough to warrant this kind of picture-taking. 
 - Manager Zhao.

263
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,250
Someone you know?

264
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,790
Stop pretending.

265
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,780
I know you have been observing me for a long time.

266
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,530
Waiter, give me a glass of white water.

267
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,750
Are you looking for a job?

268
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,860
- Yes. 
 - Consider

269
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,610
- coming to my company. 
 - Your company?

270
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,410
Yes. I've resigned recently, and I'm preparing to start my own company.

271
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,220
I just met an author,

272
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,300
but I think his price offering was rather expensive,

273
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,400
so I'm still thinking it over.

274
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,090
Doesn't he just want to jump ship but can't find any jobs?

275
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,360
Your voice was a little too loud.

276
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,520
Great. Manager Zhao has great courage!

277
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,410
Just call me Zhao Lei.

278
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,190
Manager Zhao, why don't you consider our Anxin as your business partner?

279
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,650
Our Anxin is a super webcomic master.

280
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,900
Webcomic master?

281
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,470
No, she's speaking nonsense. I'm not any kind of webcomic master. I'm just a

282
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,960
rookie who likes to draw mangas. That's all.

283
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,950
What's your ID then?

284
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,220
The Northwest Watches Chang'an.

285
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,350
Excuse me, I couldn't hold it in the moment.

286
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,690
I'll do it myself!

287
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,420
Your lipstick doesn't seem to be very waterproof.

288
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,350
Apply Armani lipstick and l will smear it all over your face so you can see how you like it.

289
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,100
Don't, don't. I haven't had any intention of setting foot into the beauty circle lately.

290
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,820
The Northwest Watches Chang'an? I have always been your fan.

291
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,240
Really? You've seen my work?

292
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,700
Of course!

293
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Not long ago, I had been following "Accidentally Picking Up a Prince,"

294
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,030
but not long after, it stopped uploading. I was sad about it for a long time.

295
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,180
Why aren't you updating it anymore?

296
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,380
Y-Y-You can join my workplace.

297
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,970
You only need to invest in the copyrights.

298
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,200
So this job is...

299
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,370
just the two of us?

300
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,640
Our office will expand very quickly.

301
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,250
How about including my good friend Youyou, too?

302
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,890
Her sketches are super smooth.

303
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,910
Really?

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Brother, how is it?

305
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Not bad. You have some talent.

306
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,500
But who is this?

307
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
Mike. He's just an idol.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,200
Most of his drawings are done by Youyou.

309
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't know him, but it's fine.

310
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,300
Then, Miss Youyou, are you willing to join our workplace?

311
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
I'll consider it.

312
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't consider it.

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,600
You can't find a job anyway. Let's just do it together.

314
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
How do you know I can't find a job?

315
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Would anyone who could find work be like you two?

316
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Just chatting in a cafe in the middle of a workday?

317
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,200
How about it?

318
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Fine. Count me in.

319
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Then, what's our company called?

320
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
Galaxy Cool Man!

321
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
- All finished. 
 - Nice!

322
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
Isn't it still slightly crooked?

323
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
It's not crooked. The logo I designed is supposed to be a bit tilted like this.

324
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
- That's right, it's fine. 
 - Isn't it nice?

325
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,700
- Let's go take a look inside. 
 - Go, go. 
 - It's drawn quite well.

326
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,700
Look!  How is it?

327
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
- The new renovation cost quite a big sum of money. 
 - It's not bad.

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
The photos are rather nice.

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I was diligent, okay?

330
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Right, Anxin, that's your spot.

331
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,400
This is the CEO's spot, mine. Youyou, just sit there.

332
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,600
Why am I here?

333
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,300
- Because you're close to the door and can easily get the takeout. 
 - It's fine.

334
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,000
Right, we can put a sofa there and hang up a poster here.

335
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,500
- I think it's a bit empty here. 
 - Yes.

336
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Who is here? Who is here?

337
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,010
Why are you here?

338
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Boss, can you let me work here?

339
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Don't block me.

340
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
This person is totally senseless. Come, help me to tidy up.

341
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
Don't stop me from looking! I'm getting some eye candy!

342
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes, food and housing are included, but no salary.

343
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,300
When do I sign the contract?

344
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's go get some food.

345
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Why did you bring an umbrella?

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
It's going to rain today.

347
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,200
It's going to rain? How could there be rain when there's so much sun?

348
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Don't you check the weather report?

349
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
The weather report is often inaccurate so I never look at it.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Then let's just say it's accurate today.

351
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,590
I planned ahead. Is there a reward for me?

352
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,580
They're looking.

353
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Now it's okay.

354
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,000
♫  The first time I met you, I never would've believed there would come a day  ♫

355
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

356
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,400
♫  You are full of coldness. No way to get near  ♫

357
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,900
♫  Prepare for Plan B at any moment  ♫

358
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,200
Anxin, someone delivered warmth again.

359
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Quick! Look at what it is.

360
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
Stop gossiping. Come help me calculate the costs.

361
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,300
A ball?

362
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,910
 The weather is sunny today. The average temperature is 22°C.

363
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,000
 The temperate at night is 18°C.

364
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,500
 Please wear more clothes to prevent catching a cold.

365
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,200
Turns out it's a smart sphere.

366
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 It will be named Xiao Liu in the future, and you are Xiao Ba.  
  (T/N: Little Six and Little Eight respectively)

367
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,400
 It's named Xiao Liu, so it's a perfect match.

368
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
 My CP is supposed to be with you!  
  (T/N: Slang for Couple Pairing)

369
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,400
 You know what "CP" means? Have you been studying behind my back?

370
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
  I know much more than you think.

371
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
 Nonsense. Do you still remember that you burned my microwave?

372
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
 You're not down-to-earth at all.

373
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 Down-to-earth? Just wait.

374
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 It's 12:00 noon now. Time for lunch.

375
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 Eat your lunch on time so that you will have good health.

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Why are you as talkative as Ling Yue?

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
What happens if I don't eat lunch? Can you see me?

378
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Not eating on time can cause gastritis, stomach ulcers, and indigestion.

379
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
 It will also reduce cerebral function and affect cerebral development.

380
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,800
- Moreover, it will also lead to a decline in intelligence—
- I'm going. Stop talking.

381
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Eat!

382
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Is no one going to help me change the water?

383
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
P-President Ling.

384
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,900
It's done.

385
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,500
What's going on?

386
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Are the materials prepared?

387
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Yes.

388
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,000
 Can we get them back?

389
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 If this continues...

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,200
 I will have nothing and no prospects in the future.

391
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,770
 - It's a swift and violent collapse.
- That's right.

392
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,700
 If this is the case, there won't be any future prospects.

393
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
All right, stop arguing.

394
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Listen to me.

395
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
We are all aware of the situation now.

396
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Dear shareholders, please express your personal views.

397
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,300
Chairman, we and Director Ling Fang

398
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
signed a clear contract.

399
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,000
He said that he only made that whatever company in order to develop the Ling Group's strength in the logistics industry.

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,760
Now, not only the promise was not fulfilled,

401
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
we have incurred losses too.

402
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,600
We are family. We don't want to take this to court, either.

403
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Chairman, please preside over this difficult situation for us.

404
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
Then, what do you wish for him to do?

405
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,600
We just want our original shares back.

406
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,100
Since there's no money,

407
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,000
cash out Fangyu Construction's stocks

408
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
- to compensate everyone. 
 - Yes.

409
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
You're just trying to kill me, aren't you?

410
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Shut up!

411
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Such a huge problem happened,

412
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,800
and you want to wash your hands of this?

413
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,300
Do according to what they said.

414
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,600
Everyone, I have a better plan.

415
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,200
Fangyu Construction has now sustained severe damage.

416
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,000
Even if you cash out the stocks, it won't be able to make up for everyone's losses.

417
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,900
At most, it will only make everyone feel a bit better.

418
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,200
If everyone is willing, I can sell 5% of New Way's shares

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,400
to you at a lower price after dilution.

420
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,600
Take it as my eldest brother's apology.

421
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I believe everyone knows that New Way is going to be listed in the market soon.

422
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,900
This 5% profit

423
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,600
will have unlimited promise in the future.

424
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 That's right. This is not a bad idea.

425
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,800
 Given the current situation.

426
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
 Fine.

427
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 It's a solution too.

428
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,100
 Yes, it can make up for it.

429
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Look!  The report is rather positive, Old Shen.

430
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
Fangyu is currently an empty shell.

431
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Instead of beating it to death, why not choose one with a promising future?

432
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
It still requires us to spend money on its stocks.

433
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,300
It doesn't look like a worthwhile plan either.

434
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,200
Since that's what you think, you all should just take my brother's shares.

435
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Taking into account our relationship with the chairman,

436
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
I don't want to hesitate any further. Let's just go with this.

437
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Chairman, we will go now. We don't want to delay the handling of your family's matters.

438
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Thank you all for taking the trouble to come out here.

439
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,060
Eldest Son.

440
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,670
I can't care how you harassed others with unreasonable demands in the past,

441
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,570
but your current approach has

442
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,570
already threatened the interests within the group.

443
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,670
Fortunately, my second son has reaped some profits for you.

444
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,300
Otherwise, even I wouldn't have been able to protect you.

445
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,880
Dad, I know my mistake.

446
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,900
You know your mistake? Where were you wrong?

447
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,400
I shouldn't have been arrogant and switched from real estate to e-commerce.

448
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,140
My mistake was not predicting the risks and difficulties across the industries.

449
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,130
Let me tell you what your mistake was.

450
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,200
Your biggest mistake was reckless advancement.

451
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,280
Did you think this was due to a lack of experience? It wasn't.

452
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,150
What you lack are vision and insight.

453
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,830
If one day, you really sit in the chairman's seat of this group,

454
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,540
how can you convince everyone in the company to

455
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,120
have faith in you that you can lead the company and move forward?

456
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,350
Dad, have some water first.

457
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,270
Cool down first. Eldest Brother already knows his mistake.

458
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,420
Use this period to rest properly.

459
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't bother with the company for the time being.

460
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,400
- Dad! 
 - Let me tell you.

461
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,580
You should really be thankful to your younger brother this time.

462
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,300
Not only did he help you, but he also redeemed huge losses for the Ling family.

463
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,600
Do you know this or not?

464
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,530
What's wrong? Can't sit still?

465
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,750
You can't accept it?

466
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,260
Dad, the company still has matters to attend to.

467
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,020
I'm leaving.

468
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,200
Look at how your younger brother handles matters.

469
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,580
You should really learn from him.

470
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,320
Same for you, too.

471
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,600
- Me? 
 - How old are you this year?

472
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
You are twenty-two years old and already an adult.

473
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,500
Every day, you follow a woman around and chase her everywhere.

474
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,200
For what?

475
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,730
Do something promising, can't you?

476
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,510
Hold on.

477
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,210
Why are you raising your guard?

478
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,320
He just helped me. What could I do to him?

479
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,460
Speak. Why did you help me?

480
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,300
You clearly won back there.

481
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,620
As soon as I fall off the stage, everything in the Ling family will be yours,

482
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,540
but you insisted on pulling back at this moment.

483
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,330
I really cannot figure out what your reason for doing this could be.

484
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,290
Winning or losing is not important to me.

485
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,520
I have never thought of fighting with you.

486
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,260
So your motive for doing this was just that you wanted me to thank you?

487
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,260
I don't care how you think about it.

488
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,490
Eldest Brother.

489
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,580
Since this has already happened, just let it pass.

490
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,400
Don't overthink things.

491
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,990
I suddenly feel it's not very interesting anymore.

492
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,850
What isn't very interesting?

493
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,000
Your eldest brother, me, just experienced a roller coaster.

494
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,710
This is good, too. I'm suddenly relaxed.

495
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,400
Eldest Brother, where are you going?

496
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,980
Didn't Dad tell me to go on leave?

497
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm obeying him.

498
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,630

499
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,310
Go back to the company first. I'm heading out.

500
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,770
Okay.

501
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,820
Xin'er.

502
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,830
Why are you here?

503
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,520
I knew you would be working in the area today,

504
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,370
so I wanted to invite you to elope. Are you interested?

505
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,590
Eloping doesn't sound like something adults would do.

506
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,360
I'm just joking.

507
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,720
I've come to ask about the date you've promised me.

508
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Where do you want to go?

509
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,180
For a spring outing.

510
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,440
I know there's a huge themed music festival in the suburbs.

511
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,940
I think you'll definitely like it.

512
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,550
But I still have some work I haven't finished yet.

513
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,420
It's fine. I knew you would most likely reject me anyway.

514
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,600
Since you have to work overtime, eat more.

515
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,990
Replenish your energy and take good care of yourself.

516
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,390
Thank you.

517
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,130
So, do I have high awareness now?

518
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,020
But I really have work.

519
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,500
I know, you busy person! Go do your work.

520
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,200
Bye-bye.

521
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,830
Excuse me. Sorry for bothering you. Can I give this to you?

522
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,520
I just remembered... My company matters aren't that urgent.

523
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,320
Let's go out first.

524
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,570
Really? Then quickly, get in the car.

525
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,320
What's that?

526
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,590
I don't know either.

527
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,900
Can I have a sip?

528
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,350
Here.

529
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,360
What is it? It's so sweet. It doesn't taste good.

530
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,110
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

531
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,920
Awesome! Our comic has already exceeded 100,000 clicks.

532
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,230
Look, look, look. In the comments,

533
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,680
thousands of fans are begging for updates.

534
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,580
Anxin, why do I suddenly feel that this Xiao Ying looks quite like me?

535
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,220
I drew her based on you.

536
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,850
Wouldn't it be so wasteful to not make use of such a beautiful face?

537
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,440
I'm embarrassed.

538
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,520
You should be.

539
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,260
No way. Do girls give flattery so blindly?

540
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,040
Her pancake face can't come anywhere near a melon-seed shaped face! 
  (T/N: Melon-seed shaped face is one of the most sought-after face shapes in China)

541
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,060
Zhao Lei, why are you acting like it's your business again?

542
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,660
Sometimes, that mouth of yours was grown for no reason.

543
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,970
I think it's perfect.

544
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,740
You guys talk.

545
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,560
I wanted to scare you. What's up? Why are you spying on me?

546
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Get in the car.

547
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,120
Is there an occasion?

548
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,480
Celebrating you guys getting over 100,000 clicks.

549
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,340
But I still have a lot to do.

550
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,120
You've been working for so many weeks in a row.

551
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,880
Do you not even have the right to give yourself a break?

552
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,260
I see other bosses torturing their employees,

553
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,890
but when it comes to you, why are you doing it to yourself?

554
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,300
Where do I have any employees to torture? The boss is me and the employee is me.

555
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,780
The cleaning lady is also me. Everything is me.

556
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,700
Who else can I torture but myself?

557
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Then, where do you want to take me?

558
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,910
Camping. Didn't you say I'm not down-to-earth?

559
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,490
Camping?

560
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,010
You're quite good at understanding mistakes and correcting them.

561
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,460
Then... all right. I'm going back to get my drawing board.

562
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,380
My girlfriend is really a workaholic.

563
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,120
My goodness!

564
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,880
Isn't your long journey lacking a very cute, beautiful girl as your companion?

565
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,620
And this beautiful man here can reluctantly accompany you, too.

566
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,430
We...

567
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,830
No.

568
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:26,060
Anxin, we also need a break to prepare for the exceeding of one million clicks.

569
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,980
Right, let's pretend we're going together

570
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,920
to celebrate!

571
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,520
Let's go.

572
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,450
I won't be disturbing you, right?

573
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,800
Get ready.

574
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,050
♪  I encountered the girl in my heart on the street tonight  ♪

575
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,620
♪  My feet decided not to listen to my yells and went home with her  ♪

576
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,770
♪  She used her serene eyes, about to speak to me  ♪

577
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,720
♪  Slender, fluttering figure, turn around silently!  ♪

578
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,690
♪  She said, romantic lover, do you love me?  ♪

579
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,980
I told you so. You insisted on drinking those two huge bottles of water for beautification.

580
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,250
How could you not end up like this? You're about to explode.

581
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:25,960
By the way, Youyou. We are going camping today. Can we really see that galaxy of stars in the sky?

582
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,090
- Yes. 
 - Really?

583
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,720
I looked it up multiple times online.

584
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,410
It said there are many enthusiastic campers at the observatory point here. We will definitely see them.

585
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,520
Then since we can see it, we won't be disappointed.

586
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,600
Can we eat this?

587
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,920
What do you want to eat and drink?

588
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,870
- Are you thirsty? 
 - I want to eat this, but I'll get fat.

589
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,560
- You mean this? 
 - Xiao Sheng?

590
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,050
What a coincidence.

591
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,260
Second Brother. Sister-in-Law, you're also here.

592
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,930
What a coincidence. Where are you guys going?

593
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,500
- We're going camping. What about you? 
 - We...

594
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,590
We also happened to be finding a camping spot.

595
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,750
How about we go together?

596
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,630
Anxin, what a coincidence that you're here, too.

597
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,360
What a coincidence.

598
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,270
Right, we were planning on camping, too.

599
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,990
Since it's such a coincidence, why don't we go together?

600
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,650
Okay.

601
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,730
Then let's go together.

602
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,170
I'm ready!

603
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,560
Good.

604
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,450
I, Little Youyou, am so amazing.

605
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,300
This was my first time setting up a tent and it was so successful.

606
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,050
Help me take a picture.

607
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,560
Okay. Go ahead.

608
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,140
- Okay. 
 - Done? Let me take a look.

609
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,720
Am I cute?

610
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,990
Zhao Lei, I've never seen anyone as narcissistic as you.

611
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,340
You did today.

612
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,600
- Don't! 
 - You haven't taken the photo.

613
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,090
Stop messing around.

614
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,360
Is the reason why you're upset because I called everyone over to camp together?

615
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,810
I was thinking that rather than going to a music festival where we don't know anyone,

616
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,100
we would've been happier to come camping together with everyone.

617
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,620
It's not because of my second brother?

618
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,910
Anxin is here, too.

619
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,760
Look!  Everyone is here.

620
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,820
I won't be mad at you.

621
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,330
I just thought I finally had a chance to go on a date with you alone,

622
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,510
but who would've expected that everyone would be here.

623
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,330
This isn't considered us dating alone.

624
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,980
Really?

625
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,070
Then what you mean is... that there's a next time?

626
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,040
Why are you so cute?

627
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,870
Look!  Your hair is a mess.

628
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,360
What's wrong? Are you mad?

629
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,180
No.

630
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,520
Are you mad because my younger brother and Xin'er are both here?

631
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,870
Didn't Youyou and Zhao Lei also come?

632
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,200
Then, why do you look sulky and unhappy?

633
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,020
Are you on your period?

634
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,080
Anxin, the nail hasn't been nailed in.

635
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,680
You nail it then.

636
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,510
Besides, nothing will happen if a nail is missing.

637
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,450
It's so strong. What's wrong?

638
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,220
If you don't believe me, I'll lie in there for you. I'll sleep in there for you.

639
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,950
- I'll try it out for you. Nothing at all. 
 - Come out.

640
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,310
- It's not strong enough. Come out. 
 - It's very strong.

641
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,750
- It's very strong. 
 - Hurry.

642
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,930
If you want to play so badly, let's try it together.

643
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,700
I don't want to try it with you.

644
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,090
Didn't I say? It's not strong or safe.

645
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,310
It's safer than you at least.

646
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,560
My goodness.

647
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,870
Brother Yue, are you okay?

648
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,510
He's fine.

649
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,400
As long as you're fine, it's good. Be careful in the future.

650
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,680
He's so big and not made of paper. Of course, he's fine. Right, Ling Yue?

651
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,090
That's right. I'm fine.

652
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,810
He's fine.

653
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,600
Fan over here. It's dripping oil.

654
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,480
Smells good. He took them away so soon?

655
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,200
Xin'er, I just grilled these. Give them a try.

656
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,540
Xiao Sheng, let's go take a walk.

657
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,900
You're trying to go look for my second brother, right?

658
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,160
So, can I reject?

659
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,520
The meat is quite tender.

660
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,820
Smells good. Where's Anxin and Young President Ling?

661
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,660
Is there a need to say? They're obviously in their own two-person world.

662
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,100
Give it a try. I cooked them just for you.

663
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,890
 Anxin, are you home?

664
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,930
 I came looking for you.

665
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,800
 Brother, don't worry. I'm having fun with my friends.

666
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,350
 I see. Don't stay up too late. Stay safe.

667
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,090
Are we going down?

668
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,950
Be careful. Come on, slowly.

669
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,310
Why is there a tent here?

670
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,860
Didn't you say you wanted to stargaze?

671
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,280
I set up a tent here so we can stargaze together.

672
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,790
You even remembered this? So thoughtful.

673
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,310
It seems like we can't see stars tonight.

674
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,740
But it took me so long to find this place.

675
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,370
Then let's look at them next time, okay?

676
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,200
I'm sorry I couldn't let you see the stars.

677
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,780
What's there to be sorry about? Silly.

678
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,500
There are so many.

679
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:51,040
♫  Watching as the street lights flash on and off  ♫

680
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:59,900
♫  We can see how far away our future is just 
by turning our heads back  ♫

681
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,860
♫  We've yet to part but longing has already begun  ♫

682
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:15,370
♫   Hugging you like owning the whole world  ♫

683
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:20,750
♫   Too beautiful that I fear time is limited  ♫

684
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:29,390
♫    Promises are too superficial, 
 not even as good as one one-thousandth of you   ♫

685
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,070
Do you like it?

686
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,580
♫  Let me love you  ♫

687
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:46,250
♫  Let me use my sincere heart  ♫

688
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,700
♫  and learn to use warmth to cover up   ♫

689
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,280
♫  the cold memories of the past  ♫

690
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:02,310

691
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:08,100
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

692
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,660
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

693
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,320
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

694
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,440
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

695
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,270
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

696
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,890
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

697
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,280
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

698
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:42,180
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

699
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:48,450
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

700
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:52,740
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

701
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:00,820
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

702
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:06,850
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

703
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:12,900
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

704
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:19,270
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

705
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:25,370
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

706
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:29,600
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

707
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:43,310
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
