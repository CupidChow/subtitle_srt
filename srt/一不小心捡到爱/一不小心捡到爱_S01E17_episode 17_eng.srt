00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,500
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,640
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,460
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,100
♫  Your breath brushes up against my cheek  ♫

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,560
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,480
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,030
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,240
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,760
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,350
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

13
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,650
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,620
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,210
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,490
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,080
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,400

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,360

21
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,820
♫  Waiting to turn on this intersection  ♫

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,110
♫    What a beautiful accident  ♫

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,200
♫  I accidentally picked up love  ♫

24
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,750
♫  The first time I met you, 
 I never would've believed there would come a day  ♫

25
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,420
♫   We would become so intimate one day  ♫

26
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,970
♫  You are full of coldness. No way to get near  ♫

27
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,900
♫  Prepare for Plan B at any moment  ♫

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,430
♫    Follow me to fill in this blankness now  ♫

29
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,170
Are these limited edition mangas?

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,590
This one's so hard to buy!

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,980
♫    What a beautiful accident  ♫

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,510
♫   What I accidentally picked up  ♫

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,380
Do you like it?

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,290
I do.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Welcome home.

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,640

37
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,280
What's in that box? You've been holding it all this time.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,210
Youyou gave it to me. She said it's some sort of roommate's gift.

39
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,390
It's supposed to be the best equipment, but I don't know what it is.

40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,810
- Is it for a video game? 
 - Probably.

41
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,290
The best equipment?

42
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,300
Why don't you equip it?

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Why don't you equip it?

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,600
It suits you.

45
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm telling you! Even though we are roommates now,

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,200
but...

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,010
Are you hungry?

48
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,050
I'll go make you something good to eat.

49
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,080
No need. We can buy something at the convenience store.

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,780
My treat.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,330
Okay!

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,120
Buy two, get two free!

53
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,950
There are exactly four.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,710
The expiration date is okay.

55
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,190
Look around here. I'm going over there.

56
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,720
Go on.

57
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,540

58
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,460

59
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,040
0411.

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,960
The house's password is 0411.

61
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,680
If you find that inconvenient, you can record your fingerprint.

62
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,630
It's very convenient.

63
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,960
 Why is that the password? It's not either of our birthdays.

64
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,860
  Could it be... his mother's birthday?

65
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,110
All of this was bought at the convenience store?

66
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,560
Yes. What do you think? Can't it compete with Michelin's chefs?

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,270
From now on, I'll make dinner at home.

68
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,950
Just give me half the money it'd take for a Michelin restaurant.

69
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,760
It's worth it, right?

70
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,420
Tell me!  Between money and me, which do you love more?

71
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,600
Probably...

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,240
Perhaps... Maybe...

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,040
it should be you.

74
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,810
Where did you learn all this?

75
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,870
My brother taught me. I used to make this at home often.

76
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,080
Because it's so convenient.

77
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,370
The flavor is just average.

78
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,200
Average?

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,800
 No way. I just mentioned my brother.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,680
 Suddenly, he's angry enough to leave his position.

81
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,160
Let me look. Where did you get burned?

82
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,760
Clumsy. It's burned red.

83
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,500
- It's good now. 
 - Should I add some vinegar in your sukiyaki? 
  (T/N: Vinegar is the slang for "jealous")

84
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,560
I can tell you really like to eat it.

85
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,630
- No need. 
 - I think there is a need.

86
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,780
- No need. 
 - Yes, there is. 
 - No need. 
 - Yes, there is.

87
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,380
Hello?

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,280
- Youyou. 
   - Ansheng.

89
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,020
  Do you want to hear about Anxin?

90
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,800
I also want to know how you are.

91
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,590
  Don't worry. We're all good.

92
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,650
  Anxin is living very comfortably. She and Ling Yue are already living together.

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,550
  Did... I say something wrong?

94
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,600
They're living together?

95
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,950
That's nice. That's nice.

96
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,110
I've heard it personally, so I can relax.

97
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,630
  Then, we'll leave it there.

98
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,690
  I have to get to work. Contact me any time.

99
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,000
- Bye-bye. 
   - Bye-bye.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,750
I heard everything.

101
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,330
I still underestimated Anxin's tactics.

102
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,920
Xin'er, the matter between you and Ling Yue has nothing to do with Anxin.

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,830
Nothing to do with her?

104
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,730
If there were no Gu Anxin,

105
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,120
Brother Ling Yue and I would have been together a long time ago.

106
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,820
Then, there's you.

107
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,540
Brother, you're so outstanding.

108
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,800
How many are rushing to pursue you?

109
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,010
Why are you so stubborn for her?

110
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,000
What about you and Ling Yue?

111
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,560
Without Anxin,

112
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,400
Ling Yue and I wouldn't be the way we are today.

113
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,930
Xin'er, that's not love.

114
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,440
It's a refusal to admit loss.

115
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,890
In relationships, hard work doesn't matter.

116
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm an example of failure.

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,750
I won't fail.

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,170
I believe in Ling Yue.

119
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,920
I also believe in all the years of affection between us.

120
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,810
He will come to understand who has been standing by him all this time,

121
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,160
and who has the qualifications to stand by his side.

122
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,610
That person is definitely me.

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,030
Xin'er.

124
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,560
Feelings aren't a matter that can be measured by time.

125
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,590
I won't give up.

126
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,270
Hello.

127
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,250
  Who's he calling behind my back? He's acting so eager to continue it.

128
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,220
Now that we're living together, if you feel any uneasiness,

129
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,200
just tell me.

130
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,960
It's not the first time we've lived together. What is there to feel uneasy about?

131
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,330
Of course, since we've experienced it once,

132
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,730
I'll do better in the future.

133
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,930
What you gave me wasn't "experience."

134
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,920
It was called a demon experience.

135
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,390
Then let's take the things we didn't do well

136
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,940
and didn't finish back then,

137
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,420
and make up for it. Okay?

138
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,190
Wh-What is this?

139
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,020
This is a heart sensor.

140
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,120
Putting this on guarantees your safety while you sleep.

141
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,490
If something unusual happens, it will call

142
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,390
your close contact.

143
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,870
My close contact should be you, right?

144
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,060
If something abnormal happens to both of us, then what?

145
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,420
Then it will contact the hospital.

146
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,550
Why is your heart rate so fast?

147
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,950
Are you okay?

148
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,810
You can't think be thinking of all kinds of R-rated thoughts, could you?

149
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,850
I'm not.

150
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,450
I'm not.

151
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,670
What are you thinking about?

152
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,120
Can't you trust your man a little,

153
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,570
Miss Gu Anxin?

154
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,780
Then, from now on,

155
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,990
can you trust me more?

156
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,370
Let me be the source of your sense of security, not these things.

157
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,270
Okay. Go to sleep.

158
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,000

159
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,950
 Anxin, who is it?

160
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,420
Well, it's your delivery. I'll put it in the entryway.

161
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,040
 Okay. Thank you.

162
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,400
What kind of delivery needs to be sent home?

163
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,330
No, no, no. We just got rid of a misunderstanding.

164
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,960
We promised to trust each other.

165
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,060
You say, what kind of furniture should we buy?

166
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
The ones that are the safest.

167
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,060
We should buy the ones that are prettiest and cheapest.

168
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,820
Should we look at the double bed?

169
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,550
Sure.

170
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,830
What are you doing, Short Girl?

171
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,020
I am taking measurements.

172
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,760
You don't need to measure. I am the size of two of you.

173
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,790
 What do you think?

174
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,130
 Is this bed a little too small?

175
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,390
 No, I think it's perfect.

176
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,200
 I move around a lot while sleeping.

177
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,250
 You might not be able to catch me.

178
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,730
 Then, let's try it.

179
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,930
Mister, if you like this, I can ring it up for you. All you have to do is sign it.

180
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,070
Just pick the style you like. I already finished taking the measurements.

181
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,890
This one is very comfortable. You and your wife will definitely love it.

182
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,520
Please send it using the fastest method.

183
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,570
Got it, got it. There won't be delays.

184
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
Let's start.

185
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,510
You're placing them haphazardly and aren't even being sincere!

186
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,140
You have to make this cat move.

187
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,880
If it doesn't move, how will it attract fortune?

188
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,250
Come on. Over there.

189
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,140
Okay!

190
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,990
You can pray now.

191
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,230
You're actually going to?

192
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,750
Of course.

193
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,530
We are finally done.

194
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,090
Seeing all this makes it seem like we've returned to the very beginning.

195
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,330
It's just that there's no little cripple or large cockroaches.

196
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,680
But you have a good boyfriend who can make you feel at ease.

197
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,100
- What is this a drawing of? 
 - Armadillo.

198
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,230
I mean this guy.

199
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,440
Is it not obvious enough? It's you.

200
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,290
Me?

201
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,520
Am I that ugly?

202
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,400
Please!  It looks so much like you when you're curled up on the couch.

203
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,210
An armadillo is so cute, just like you.

204
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,370
It tucks itself into a little ball whenever it encounters danger.

205
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,430
Let me borrow your phone for a second.

206
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,090
Here.

207
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,440
Why didn't you set a password for your phone?

208
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
Why would I need a password?

209
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,990
If I lose my phone someday and a stranger picks it up, they'll know who to call.

210
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,560
Not having a password is risky!

211
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,800
What if your credit card password or other information gets leaked?

212
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,690
Then, you set one for me.

213
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,900
Then you... Then do you

214
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,320
have a lucky number or a date you like?

215
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,150
Then... 0411.

216
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,220
Okay.

217
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,530

218
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,240
Senior Iron-Walled Man.

219
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,720
Anti-finger hearts? I like it.

220
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,150
April 11th... Gu Xin'er's birthday is...

221
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,340

222
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,320
Thank you.

223
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,560
To celebrate your return,

224
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,320
Zhao Lei did something unprecedented and used company funds to buy this cake.

225
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,130
In your opinion, if a man uses a woman's birthday

226
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,240
as his entrance password, what does this mean?

227
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,890
It must mean that he cares about her very much.

228
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,280
No, why do I think you are acting weird?

229
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,900
If he has a dating history that I don't know about,

230
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,520
do you think I'm waiting for the day where I have to obediently make room for the returning ex

231
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,900
and give him back to her?

232
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,510
True.

233
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,130
Exes are the most discomforting creatures on earth.

234
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,990
Actually, I'm not sure whether or not it's true,

235
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,830
but... I rarely see him using that tone when he's on the phone.

236
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,820
He was so gentle and he was even smiling.

237
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,890
Pressure him. You have to ask him!

238
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,320
But... what if I get an answer that disappoints me?

239
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,020
That's even worse than keeping it inside. Everyone has a past, right?

240
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,100
Since you have doubts, you should raise your spirits and energetically protect your love!

241
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,730
Really.

242
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,310
Am I being too persistent about his past?

243
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,030
The truth is that I'm so afraid.

244
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,910
What if after we really start interacting, he'll think we really aren't very suitable for each other?

245
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,790
Everyone knows that you two are husband and wife. Who would dare to meddle?

246
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,020
Even if someone does dare to, we have to defeat her.

247
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,090
No matter who tries to meddle, I will never back down.

248
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,650

249
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,560
Hello.

250
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,370
Why have you come here?

251
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,690
Didn't I come here because I was attracted by your reputation here?

252
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,660
Don't I look oddly handsome without my white robe?

253
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,720
Then, I hope that after the team practice ends,

254
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,820
you can maintain this unique handsomeness.

255
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,530
We will now talk about footwork in boxing.

256
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,050
Maintain your balance, slide your feet out to strike.

257
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,670
Only when you are acquainted well enough with your footwork,

258
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,350
can you move your strength to your waist area.

259
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,530
- And to us, the waist area is very— 
 - Hey, Coach.

260
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,730
You say the waist can exert power,

261
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,560
but why can I never feel it?

262
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,330
- Is it here? 
 - This area. Yes, this area.

263
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,680
- Here? 
 - Yes.

264
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,360
Why can't I feel it?

265
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,060
Is it in the front of the waist or the back? Is it here?

266
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,660
Here? Why can't I feel it then?

267
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,750
What are you doing?

268
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,460
Who are you, you little punk? Who do you think you are? You have the guts to push me?

269
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,720
Why do you care about who I am, you creep?

270
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,390
Don't you dare touch Ai Li again.

271
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,620
I touched her. What are you going to do about it?

272
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,290
Coach, I request a practice round.

273
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,430
Okay.

274
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,020
Didn't I say it before? I will protect you.

275
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,660
 Coach, I request a practice round.

276
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,730
 Didn't I say it before? I will protect you.

277
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,620
Xiao Yishan? Xiao Yishan?

278
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,090
Get up.

279
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,740
Sorry, I still didn't beat him.

280
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,560
Winning or losing is not important. Why did you have to fight with him?

281
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,910
Do you know that you only trained twice?

282
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,270
There's a high chance that you could've gotten hurt badly.

283
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,920
I wanted to beat him. I had to beat him.

284
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,080
- Why are you so persistent? 
 - I did it for—

285
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,760
I did it for you.

286
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,610
For me?

287
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,160
I am just an amateur, but your abilities are outstanding.

288
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,870
If I don't do boxing, how would we have any similar interests?

289
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,370
Besides, you only like boxing.

290
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,570
Like? Who told you that I liked boxing?

291
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,560
You... You don't like boxing?

292
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,490
This is just what my job requires.

293
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,350
Expertise and enjoyment are two separate matters.

294
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,170
Why didn't you tell me ear—

295
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,840
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

296
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,030
Do you look down on me?

297
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,750
Today, you were the most powerful athlete

298
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,790
on the six-meter square boxing ring.

299
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,640
No matter what, I...

300
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,320
must make him apologize to you in front of everyone.

301
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,090
Otherwise, I will not give up.

302
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,030
Thank you.

303
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,170
You're suddenly so gentle that

304
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,410
I'm not quite used to it.

305
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,940
What are you thinking about?

306
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,880
I'm thinking about how

307
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,710
your reckless behavior today, which is comparable to smashing a rock with an egg,

308
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,760
might be true bravery.

309
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Even though what you're saying is the truth,

310
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,030
but you can slightly—

311
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,790
slightly be more euphemistic.

312
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,650
You should stop moving.

313
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,400
Isn't that the loser?

314
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,740
Coach Xiao Ai, why are you helping him rub?

315
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,980
Help rub me.

316
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,370
You're right.

317
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,880
Those who cannot return respect

318
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,260
should be taught a lesson.

319
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,790
Why are you hitting people, Coach?

320
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,140
Now, I'm neither in the boxing arena nor in the training center.

321
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,550
So, I'm clearly not your coach.

322
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,110
I'm just a normal person who got so angry after being harassed by you.

323
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,480
You were so cool just now!

324
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,490
Wasn't that super satisfying?

325
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,780
You should be like that in the future, doing whatever you want.

326
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,670
If anything makes you unhappy, lash out.

327
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,530
If you really don't want to talk about it, you still have me.

328
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm willing to be your tree hole 24/7 without rest. 
  (T/N: Slang that means person who will listen to secrets)

329
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,060
It was so satisfying. I'm just a bit regretful.

330
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,210
I should've beat him harder just now.

331
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,530
Don't worry. I'll do it next time.

332
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,870
Help me.

333
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,450
Here.

334
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,020
- Boss Gu. 
 - No.

335
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,890
I didn't even say anything yet.

336
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,220
- Usually, beginning with a title is never a good thing. 
 - No.

337
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,020
Listen to me. I've signed a big deal for our studio.

338
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,480
A big company is secretly recruiting company image designers.

339
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,760
Boss, I have a pile of work I haven't finished yet.

340
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,020
You must be trying to hollow me out.

341
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,010
Listen to me. If this order is fulfilled,

342
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,890
not only will there be no middleman profiting off of the differences in prices,

343
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,830
it will also allow our studio to achieve at least half a year of freedom to buy milk tea.

344
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,790
Okay, I'll do it.

345
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,590
- Working makes me happy. Overtime makes me prettier. 
 - Nice.

346
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,420
You two are the only ones who can make making money seem so refined.

347
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,400
You don't have to drink the milk tea.

348
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,110
- Boss Gu, in a moment— 
 - No.

349
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,460
Wait, listen to me.

350
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,640
What I mean is when you meet the buyer later,

351
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,600
don't let your surprise dizzy you.

352
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,660
We're all humans. Surely he doesn't have three heads...

353
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,430
The big company you're talking about...

354
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,730
It's New Way.

355
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,970
The big boss you mentioned...

356
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,280
- Young President Ling. 
 - Then, why didn't you say that earlier? 
 - No,

357
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,400
- I was afraid that you'd give up on the order to avoid suspicion. 
 - I—

358
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,210
In the case that you did, our sales performance this month would've been a zero.

359
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,360
Although it's a little bit ridiculous to call it "avoiding suspicion,"

360
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,070
I'm telling you!  This suspicion is too huge!

361
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,510
No, no. Let's leave immediately.

362
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,580
Boss Gu, Boss Gu, Boss Gu.

363
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,640
We're already here and I already helped you ask around.

364
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,510
The number of people in the company who know about your relationship with Young President Ling

365
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,760
is too little to count.

366
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,580
- Really? 
 - Really.

367
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,010
So, do it for the sake of the milk tea

368
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,140
and the money.

369
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,250
- For the money. 
 - For the money.

370
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,270
- For the milk tea. 
 - For the milk tea.

371
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,670
How cold, how ruthless, how charming.

372
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,360
What's even rarer is that he's been unwavering from the start, hardly smiling.

373
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,130
Forget that he doesn't have flocks of girls around him,

374
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,210
but he doesn't even have any gorgeously dressed male rivals in love.

375
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,440
Mr. Doom doesn't just distance himself from women.

376
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,570
He's even more resolute when it comes to men.

377
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,820
What kind of divine entity can make our Iceberg Prince surrender?

378
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,130
Who exactly is he waiting for?

379
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,830
No, it's an unfamiliar woman.

380
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,710
Turns out it's her! Dangerous person alert!

381
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,210
President Ling, please take good care of me in the future.

382
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,900
If there are opportunities, we must collaborate more.

383
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,750
Turns out she's just a supplier.

384
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,030
- Look at her. From top to bottom... 
 - There's nothing good to say!

385
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,310
- Her make-up and outfit... 
 - Are full of flaws! The probability of her being a love rival

386
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,660
is almost negative.

387
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,570
Zhao Lei tricked me into coming here.

388
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,980
I didn't know this work was related to your company.

389
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,380
I wasn't aware of this either. This collaboration was purely coincidental.

390
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,430
That's right. President Ling truly didn't arrange this.

391
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,630
Anyway, I don't want anyone to know I am your girlfriend.

392
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,310
I also don't want others to say that I used backdoor connections to be here.

393
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,490
I also don't want you to be partial to me. Understand?

394
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,450
Thank you, President Ling.

395
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,990
This way, please.

396
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,360
President Ling.

397
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,350
Control yourself.

398
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,690
What if I can't control myself?

399
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,760
Work hard to control yourself then.

400
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,470
Stop it.

401
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,960
Our company's specialty is the two-dimensional medium. However, in the current market,

402
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,790
it is not uncommon to see cases of internet companies and two-dimensional art colliding,

403
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,550
and we have done lots of research regarding such cases.

404
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,940
If you need it, I can make some analogies for your reference.

405
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,800
President Ling.

406
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,350
President Ling.

407
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,650
Frankly, you don't need to participate in contract signings with these small businesses.

408
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm here to spot-check the work of your marketing department.

409
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,340
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

410
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,770
- No problem. 
 - Okay, no problem. No problem.

411
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,170
Miss Gu, if there's no problem with the contract,

412
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,440
we can proceed normally with the proposal after the prepayment is given to you.

413
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,460
Okay, okay. We look forward to our collaboration.

414
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,050
Thank you.

415
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,590
Wait.

416
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,840
Are you Director Gu?

417
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,550
Yes.

418
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,240
Come to my office for a moment.

419
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,860
I have some ideas to convey to you privately.

420
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,120
We have never seen President Ling being so serious about our work.

421
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,500
You must do a good job this time.

422
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,890
Otherwise, given President Ling's code of conduct, we will all have to die.

423
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,650
Don't worry. We can't die.

424
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,050
What are you doing calling me, a woman, into your office?

425
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,830
Besides, why didn't you call Zhao Lei in?

426
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,790
Director Gu, close the door.

427
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,380
What are you doing?

428
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,940
Director Gu, how was my performance?

429
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,170
You... You performed very well, but if you do this, it...

430
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,730
will be easy for us to be discovered.

431
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,630
Don't scream.

432
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,310
If you scream, all of our previous efforts will be wasted.

433
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,370
What are you doing?

434
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,030
I can't control myself.

435
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,120
What do you mean, you can't control yourself? Don't scare me.

436
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,470
I can't control anything anymore.

437
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,260
♫  Prepare for Plan B at any moment  ♫

438
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,450
Okay. When there's no one around, you don't need to control yourself.

439
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,040
♫    I accidentally encountered love  ♫

440
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,020
♫  Waiting to turn on this intersection  ♫

441
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,350
♫    What a beautiful accident  ♫

442
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,050
♫   What I accidentally picked up  ♫

443
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,940
♫  Was love  ♫

444
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000

445
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,000
Did you return this

446
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,500
or did Gu Anxin return this?

447
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
Xin'er.

448
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
What?

449
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Nowadays, entertainment companies need their bosses to personally come out in order to discuss endorsement collaborations?

450
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,770
You're the buyer this time, after all.

451
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,400
Looks like we don't need to discuss any endorsement collaborations.

452
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
Don't we already have the spokesperson ready?

453
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Who is it?

454
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,900
Do you think there's someone more suitable to endorse Cai Niao Posting Station than you?

455
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Director Sheng, you're so humorous.

456
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,700
Xin'er, do you know?

457
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,000
The florist today told me the flower language of this bouquet.

458
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,400
It's called "I can be a good match for you." I hope we can have a happy collaboration.

459
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,200
As for me, I finally have the chance to spend the nights and days interacting with you.

460
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Seems like you are going to take full responsibility

461
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,600
for this endorsement activity.

462
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,200
For now,

463
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I can only give you next month's school anniversary invitation in exchange.

464
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,440
If you hadn't mentioned this, I would have forgotten about the time.

465
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,600
What is this?

466
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,200
Is he worth it?

467
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,300
You wouldn't understand.

468
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,400
How could I not understand?

469
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,200
Haven't I always been waiting for someone?

470
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,800
I also hope that one day, she can turn back and look at me.

471
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
What if she doesn't know to turn back?

472
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Then, I will keep standing behind her and protecting her.

473
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,000
I will keep waiting.

474
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,000
By the way,

475
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,600
what should we have for dinner?

476
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,600
Xin'er,

477
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,400
I just want to tell you that I will always love you.

478
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You can ask me for this confirmation over and over.

479
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,490
I'm hungry. Let's go for dinner.

480
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,600
Let's go.

481
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
How come you still haven't left?

482
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,700
You are here alone. Why did you switch on so many lights?

483
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
My water bills, electricity bills, my...

484
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
Mike found a girlfriend, too.

485
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,100
Well.

486
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,000
You still haven't gotten over it?

487
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
I'm performing my fan club exit ceremony.

488
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,400
You see, I've liked him for 7,421 days.

489
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
How could I simply forget this?

490
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
It's fine. You can use my stuff however you'd like.

491
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,300
Stop crying.

492
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,200
Tell me. How come no matter if it's online or in-person,

493
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,000
it doesn't matter how much I invest in it, there's no result at all?

494
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,400
This is...

495
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
No.

496
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,400
I think you are great.

497
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,800
It's true.

498
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,400
It could be that the direction in which you aim your efforts might be a little bit off,

499
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,300
but in fact,

500
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,600
you are a girl who really deserves to be loved by someone.

501
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,300
Really?

502
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,400
Definitely! ZQSG! 
  (T/N: Online typing shortcut for the words, "Those are my true sentiments")

503
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,400
 Today, BBC's documentary on rebuilding the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is being shown.

504
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
 This is a collaboration that was accomplished between many agencies within

505
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,400
 France, the United States, and Australia.

506
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,700
 Thus, the video has a strong sense of realism.

507
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,200
 Please enjoy the short excerpts.

508
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,940
Brother, what brings you here?

509
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,500
I got your address from Youyou.

510
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,000
These are some of the daily necessities that you left at my house when you stayed there temporarily.

511
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
I never brought them back to you.

512
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,800
The truth is that you didn't need to trouble yourself.

513
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,100
When did you start to be so courteous with me?

514
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,340
About what happened in the past...

515
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
I'm sorry.

516
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
When it comes to feelings,

517
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,200
there's no right or wrong. Let bygones be bygones.

518
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,600
We'll be just like we were in the past.

519
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,800
 The Rose Window in Notre Dame was burned into nothing. The raging fire lasted for about twenty-four hours.

520
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
 The historic relic that stood for 850 years...

521
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,000
How could anything remain the same forever?

522
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,200
Did you hear that?

523
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Did you hear? Even the Norte Dame Cathedral could be damaged.

524
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,190
If...

525
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
Quasimodo hadn't hidden his feelings,

526
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,000
would the story have been different? Would Esmeralda have been touched?

527
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,100
Would she love him?

528
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I don't know.

529
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,000
However, I think there aren't that many "ifs" in this world.

530
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,200
We must look forward to everything, Brother.

531
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,800
My Anxin has really grown up.

532
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
Don't be burdened by what happened in the past.

533
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Let's go back to the way we were.

534
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,200
I still have something to do. I'll get going.

535
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,000
Bye.

536
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,600
You're back? I will heat up the food for you.

537
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,850
Who was here before?

538
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,260
No one.

539
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,200
Gu Ansheng, right?

540
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
How did you...

541
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,800
You knew it, so why did you still ask?

542
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,000
I didn't tell you because I was worried you'd be upset.

543
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Why would I be unhappy?

544
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,400
What's wrong? Your older brother feels uneasy about you being here to warm me up?

545
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,000
No. He delivered the stuff I left at his home.

546
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,200
Don't we have delivery services?

547
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,600
I knew you would be like this.

548
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:27,380
Ansheng is just my older brother. That's where it ends.

549
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I am really tired today.

550
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,000
I have so much work to do and I even prepared a meal for you.

551
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Not only did you not praise me, you even threw a tantrum at me too.

552
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,200
You delivered this apology cake so quickly?

553
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm not like certain little troublemakers who have no conscience.

554
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,100
I don't have no conscience!

555
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,000
What's wrong? Did you run into some problems?

556
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,300
It's actually very common to hit a snag during the creative process.

557
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,200
Thus, the cake you delivered came in the nick of time.

558
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,000
Take it slow. You will find the solution.

559
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,920
In the future, when you meet your brother, you don't need to hide it from me.

560
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,600
That's not right. You'd best not see him at all.

561
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,300
Then, should I see him or not?

562
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,190
The point is that you cannot hide it from me.

563
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,150
Fine.

564
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Now that we are talking about this,

565
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,000
let's have a confession period.

566
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,200
There are a few things I wonder whether I should ask or not.

567
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,200
Please speak.

568
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,600
Who has been calling you every evening?

569
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,400

570
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,600
Xiao Yishan?

571
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
Why is he calling you?

572
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,000
He wants me to help him pursue Ai Li.

573
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,800
 - Hello. 
 - Help me, help me. I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up.

574
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
 I'm hanging up.

575
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,600
 I hurt my back. I even pulled off the handle of the door of the bathroom.

576
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,000
 I'm being locked up in the bathroom now.

577
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,200
 With only the toilet as my company, I'm going to grow old in loneliness.

578
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,800
 Shouldn't you call 120110 for the retirement center? Why call me instead?

579
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,000
 Why are you so heartless?

580
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,600
 Didn't I leave a spare key with you?

581
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,300
 Insert the handle in the doorknob again and see if you can open it.

582
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,300
 I'm going to try.

583
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
 It's opened. It opened. My brain has short-circuited.

584
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,400
 That's been going on for more than a few days.

585
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,000
 This is the first time in my life that I've ever felt

586
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,600
 I was so miserable, completely miserable. Really miserable.

587
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,200
 You shouldn't give me your spare key. You should give it to your girlfriend.

588
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,830
 It's not like I didn't want to leave it with Ai Li.

589
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,700
 But what can I do now?

590
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,400
 Go and find your Ai Li.

591
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,600
 Well...

592
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,000
 Okay, then. It's rare for you to come up with a good plan. Good buddy.

593
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,440
 By the way, when you go to work tomorrow,

594
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,700
 you should check with a neurosurgeon after you check your back.

595
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,800
 Get your brain checked properly.

596
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,000
So, you are saying that,

597
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,700
you are delightedly calling every night as if you can't get enough of it

598
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,400
because you're mocking him.

599
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes.

600
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,180
Xiao Yishan likes Ai Li

601
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,400
but he's pretty abnormal. Why would he find you for this kind of stuff?

602
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,000
How many people who fall in love are normal?

603
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,400
Who are you scolding?

604
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,700
You.

605
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,500
Don't change the topic.

606
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,600
Also,

607
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,700
let me tell you first. I was not purposefully prying into your privacy.

608
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,000
I was merely... helping you pick up your package.

609
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,400
Then, after I picked up the package, I just, I accidentally

610
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,100
took a glance and saw that it was from Gu Xin'er.

611
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,400
I returned it.

612
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,100
What was in there? So secretive.

613
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,200
I have no idea either. I didn't care.

614
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,000
You should have told me earlier.

615
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
If you had told me earlier, I could have opened it to take a look.

616
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,800
What if it's something expensive? What a waste. It's not cost-effective.

617
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:12,790
Since I'm with you, I must draw a clear line with other women.

618
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,300
One last question.

619
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,200
Why is the door password 0411?

620
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,800
You really don't remember?

621
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,700
What?

622
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,200
0411 is when we first met.

623
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,400

624
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,800
 Xiao Maodou.

625
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,000
 I will come back to find you.

626
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,000
 0411 is our first anniversary.

627
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000

628
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,200
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

629
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,800
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

630
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,400
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

631
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,800
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

632
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,400
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

633
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,000
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

634
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,400
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

635
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:13,600
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness, 
 for it has always been you  ♫

636
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:19,600
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

637
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,900
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,000
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,960
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

641
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,200
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

642
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:56,500
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

643
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,800
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:11,000
♫  Using love to slowly open up a lifetime  ♫
