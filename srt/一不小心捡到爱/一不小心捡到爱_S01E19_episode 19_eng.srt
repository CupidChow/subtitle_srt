- How come you're back? 
 - I forgot to take some materials.

27
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,630
I bought you breakfast on the way back.

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,410
I... I'm exercising.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,730

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,540

31
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,990
 It was that person showing up in your world that was an accident.

32
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,300
 I don't understand why you won't give yourself a chance to start over.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,850
 Must you run into a wall and get covered in bruises before you're willing to turn around?

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,720
- Come in. 
 - President Gu.

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,180
These are the fruits and snacks that Mr. Ling Sheng ordered for you.

36
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,980
- Did he order them today? 
 - No.

37
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,720
A few days ago, Mr. Ling Sheng bought you an annual subscription to the company's group order service.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,730
It provides you with exclusive snacks and fruits on schedule.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,570
He even drew up a full year's worth of sticky note messages.

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,060

41
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,020
Thanks for your trouble. You can go now.

42
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,060
I will work hard. See you next time.

43
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,290
Come in.

44
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,390
President Gu, this is yesterday's data report.

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,930
Got it.

46
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,460
- Will President Sheng be coming in today? 
 - He didn't come.

47
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,740
I was just about to tell you that before he left, President Sheng

48
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,490
asked me to give you this company publicity plan.

49
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,030

50
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,830

51
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,710

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
When were these pictures taken?

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
These were all taken by President Sheng himself.

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,830
In fact, President Sheng specifically told us

55
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,220
not to tell you. He was afraid it would disrupt your work.

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,820
Okay, I understand.

57
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,240
Once I've decided on the content, I'll let you know.

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,350
All right, you go ahead.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,110

60
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,150
President Wang, you looked it over quite quickly. This is not a small number.

61
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,540
President Ling, you must be joking. Who in this field doesn't know your capability?

62
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,020
Your interest in collaborating with us is our honor.

63
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,890
I would've been willing to pay even more.

64
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,540
President Ling, when you announce your Sky Soar Plan at an event as grand as the e-commerce summit meeting,

65
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,050
I'm sure it will be the focus of millions.

66
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,090
I look forward to seeing New Way's performance.

67
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,500
Thank you for your trust. Rest assured,

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,380
- I will not let you down. 
 - Of course.

69
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
Happy collaboration.

70
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,170
President Ling, I hear New Way has already received financing for its newest project. Is that true?

71
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,930
That's correct. For a project that New Way has not yet announced,

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,200
we have already received one billion yuan in the first round of financing.

73
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Included are distribution, property,

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,440
internet, and hundreds of other leading enterprises in different domains.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,020
New Way's new project will promote development in all areas.

76
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,120
Moreover, I have absolute confidence that our shareholders will receive generous compensation.

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,590
Did I wake you up?

78
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,900
Anxin, how come you're here?

79
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,440
I missed you, so I came.

80
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,050
I brought you a bento. Do you want to see it?

81
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,280
You made it so cute, I feel bad eating it.

82
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,580
If you perform well in the future, I'll give you a reward.

83
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,750
Because I have the only secret book.

84
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,510
Where did you learn this from?

85
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,570
When I was little, my brother and I would give each other rewards like this.

86
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,470
Then I want to eat this every day from now on.

87
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,460
It wouldn't be special if you ate it every day.

88
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
I didn't put any vinegar in it,

89
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,020
but some people seemed to have eaten vinegar out of the air. 
  (T/N: Eating vinegar means being jealous, and eating it out of the air means being jealous for no reason)

90
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,040
Why is that?

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,620
Don't be unhappy.

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,200
Is this that 5G+ distribution warehouse you spoke of,

93
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,070
the Sky Soar Plan?

94
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,630
It looks so advanced and convenient.

95
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,920
This is the original motive I had in establishing New Way.

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I always hoped that one day,

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,880
I could use real technology to make people's lives and ventures easier.

98
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,340
Your way of thinking is so awesome.

99
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,280
This has always been my dream.

100
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,040
But now that it's going to be released,

101
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,610
I feel a little nervous and uneasy.

102
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,960
Ling Yue, not everyone can find a goal to fight for.

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,440
But you've found your goal and you're fighting for it.

104
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,490
And you've done so well.

105
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,260
You are the star of good fortune itself.

106
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,620
So don't think about anything.

107
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,400
Just bravely go and do it.

108
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,310
At worst, I'll support you.

109
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,060
Then I'll count on you to support me.

110
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,820
Okay!

111
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,490
President Ling.

112
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,230
Look at this.

113
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,880
 Our Gu Group is currently reconsidering our B2C (business to consumer) operations.

114
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,520
 At the same time, we are in the process of remodeling our distribution value.

115
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,500
We have formed exclusive partnerships with many famous domestic companies.

116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,780
We will be the first in the country to register our 5G+ logistics warehouse business.

117
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,670
The An Star Plan we have put forward

118
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,530
 will lead the new structure of the e-commerce era.

119
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,730
This Plan An, whether considering the marketing standpoint or the central technology,

120
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,370
is exactly the same as our Sky Soar Plan.

121
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,160
Has there been any movement on the side of the Sky Soar Plan?

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
A majority of the investors have already begun to withdraw their investments.

123
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,580
Hold an urgent meeting. Start up the first-degree warning plan.

124
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,410
President Gu, after Plan An was implemented,

125
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,550
the Gu Group stocks have risen aggressively.

126
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,640
The closing rate has grown by 20%, and our posting station can benefit as well.

127
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,630
He's already made a risky move.

128
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,610
We'll have to see if the following effect can match predictions.

129
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,840
As of yesterday and today, we have lost 200 million yuan.

130
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,010
Of the companies under us, 20 face bankruptcy. The current situation is quite tense.

131
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,140
This is the lowest our stocks have been since 2015.

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,360
We've just received a large number of order cancellations from our distributors, including President Wang.

133
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,210
Many investors have decided to pull out.

134
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,020
Even the Ling Group's stock prices have suffered varying levels of decrease.

135
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,820
The Group's board of directors and board of supervisors have all arrived. Looks like things are not going well.

136
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,680
That's right. Overnight, our investors have withdrawn more than one billion in investments.

137
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,710
Stocks are plummeting now. So scary.

138
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,600
As the manager of the company, it was because of your incorrect judgment in the Sky Soar Plan

139
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,190
and improper management of potential dangers that led to great losses for the company.

140
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,720
The Group's board of directors have decided

141
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,880
to temporarily withdraw your authority over New Way.

142
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,130
This unfortunate decision was made in consideration of the company's future development.

143
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,860
After the meeting, the stockholders have the right to limit your company's inbox,

144
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,370
server permissions, access permissions, as well as the mobile data within your work.

145
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,590
New Way has not reached the point of no return.

146
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,050
You want me to throw away New Way to save myself. Was this the old man's orders?

147
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,850
No. This was the entire board of director's decision.

148
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,860
Moreover, it was made after a strict risk assessment.

149
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,350
We all believe this is the best way of decreasing risk at the moment.

150
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,120
President Ling, only by throwing away the small things can the greater situation be saved.

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,250
Don't hurt the entire Group's benefit for just New Way.

152
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,090
Anxin! Anxin! Quickly! Come look.

153
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,130
What is it this time? They're throwing shade at your idol again?

154
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,960
This time it's... your idol.

155
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,530

156
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,980
- Who exactly did this? 
 - Don't be upset yet.

157
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll use my side account to counterattack for you.

158
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,100
You can't respond to all these attacks one by one.

159
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,120
Conversely, you'll end up causing more negative consequences.

160
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,170
Right now, the most important thing is finding the source and goals of the haters.

161
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,350
That source could quite possibly be... be the Gu Group.

162
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,650
After all, if the Ling family falls, they receive the greatest benefit.

163
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:21,900
 Return money! Return money! Return money!

164
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,390
 Return money! Return money!

165
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,890
President Ling, let's go back to the company first.

166
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,740

167
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,090
 Return money!

168
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,510
President Ling! President Ling! Let's go back to the company first!

169
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,260
 Return money!

170
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,610
You've come back. You've worked hard.

171
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,570
You've waited for me this late again?

172
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,700
I haven't seen you in so many days. I wanted to wait and sleep together with you.

173
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,330
I'm sorry. I've been too busy recently.

174
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,850
Has the company run into a problem lately?

175
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,700
No. I'm just too busy.

176
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,870
There really isn't? You've lost so much weight.

177
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,760
Don't worry. It's really nothing.

178
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,440
Then go take a bath and sleep early.

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,110
Okay.

180
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,990
 That source could quite possibly be... be the Gu Group.

181
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,630
 After all, if the Ling family falls now, they receive the greatest benefit.

182
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,020
Hi, Brother, let's meet at Migrating Bird Coffee Shop we often go to.

183
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,650
Okay. See you then.

184
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,090

185
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,100
We... haven't come out to see each other in a long time.

186
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,520
Brother, are you really attacking New Way?

187
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,010
You only came to see me because of him?

188
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,390
To tell you the truth, yes. I do badly want to destroy New Way.

189
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,570
If it weren't for him, the person standing by your side would be me.

190
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,290
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Why?

191
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,320
Why do you think I wouldn't do this?

192
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,020
Because I trust that you aren't someone who would use any available method.

193
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Anxin, I don't want this kind of trust from you.

194
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,190
This kind of trust from you has pained me for too long.

195
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,080
I only want you to return to my side, okay?

196
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,620
Ling Yue cannot hang on for much longer. I will give you everything you want.

197
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,580
Brother, these are two separate matters.

198
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,910
Even if Ling Yue had nothing, I would still stay by his side indefinitely.

199
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,460
Do I not even have a chance?

200
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,290
In my heart, you've always been my closest relative, my elder brother.

201
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,400
It ends there.

202
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,270
Stop fighting with Ling Yue.

203
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,990
Anxin.

204
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,420
Moves that have already been made cannot be regretted.

205
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,090
Ling Yue's current situation can only be blamed on his incorrect judgment. No one else is to blame.

206
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,650
If that's so,

207
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,420
I hope you won't act impulsively

208
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,730
or become someone you eventually cannot even recognize.

209
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm leaving.

210
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,810
 So no matter how many times this person hurts you,

211
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,700
 as long as he needs you, you will run to him with reckless abandon?

212
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,450
 Then have you ever thought that

213
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,410
 I also need you.

214
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,690
 I'm sorry, Brother. I'm a little confused right now.

215
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,320
 Let's both calm down.

216
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,150
 Why are you always asking me to leave the person I love?

217
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,390
 I can't give you happiness?

218
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,190
 I'm also warning you. Anxin is my woman.

219
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,980
 I will take care of her.

220
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,950
 Brother!

221
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,260
Ling Yue.

222
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,220
New Way's current dilemma is a result of the market's survival of the fittest effect.

223
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,860
 I know you don't feel good losing,

224
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,350
but I never thought you would have Anxin come out to talk to me.

225
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,160
Anxin really went to find you?

226
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,230
You don't need to act dumb with me.

227
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,260
Ling Yue, I will use all of my strength to defeat you.

228
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,280
You can't win.

229
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,720
 I am Gu Anxin's brother.

230
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,890
 What do you want to explain?

231
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,350
 Explain how you're wavering between my two sisters?

232
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,980
 - Brother!
   -  Let's go.

233
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,700
 Don't—

234
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,550
 This President Ling claims he wants to see you.

235
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,310
 Whether it's creating something out of nothing or trying to cover up something obvious, you know it best.

236
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,180
 If you let her get hurt one more time,

237
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,160
 I will take her back.

238
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,320
Next, we have reached our e-commerce conference's climax.

239
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,440
Let us welcome the person who just pushed the Plan An forward,

240
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,250
the CEO of Gu Group, Mister Gu Ansheng,

241
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,690
to introduce this plan to us.

242
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,560

243
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,290
Everyone, I believe you have seen everything relating to our Plan An across all the media platforms.

244
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,460
I won't speak more of our plan's strengths and specialties.

245
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,480
All I can say now is

246
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,890
the opening for investments is no longer big. Very soon,

247
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,390
the Gu Group will become the largest company in this country's e-commerce business.

248
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,420
CEO Gu, you talk very boldly.

249
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,090
Ling Yue?

250
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,440
- Why did he come? 
 - I heard the crisis of withdrawing investments left New Way in danger,

251
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,060
but it doesn't seem so just looking at him.

252
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,300
Is there going to be a turn around?

253
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Young CEO Gu...

254
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
is indeed a polar opposite against

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the Gu Group's usual depressing style. I admire it.

256
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,100
Don't worry. I came today because I think New Way's innovation beliefs

257
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,200
and Gu Group's 5G logistics warehouse plan are identical.

258
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,300
Our New Way will wholeheartedly support Gu Group's Plan An.

259
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
And will open up an all-around collaboration both online and off.

260
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
President Ling, do you mean that

261
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,200
New Way will give up on their current 5G+ proposal

262
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
and invest in a similar proposal under the Gu Group?

263
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Earlier, it was rumored that New Way will sue Gu Group,

264
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,400
because Gu Group's Plan An violates the rights of New Way's unannounced project.

265
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Those are all rumors. You, the media, should be most clear about that.

266
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,200
Remember! In the market,

267
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
there are no everlasting enemies.

268
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,600
I have high hopes for Gu Group's Plan An. New Way will support it with all our strength.

269
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
A plan that even the Ling Group speaks highly of must have unlimited potential.

270
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,200
However, if we want to fight for this fresh piece of meat, we must speed up our steps.

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Ling Yue, what tricks are you playing this time?

272
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Speaking of tricks, you are the master.

273
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Since you've lost, isn't it better to leave the stage respectably?

274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,600
Won't acting like this make it embarrassing for you?

275
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,400
The final result hasn't been released yet, but you have already declared yourself as the victor.

276
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm afraid it's too early.

277
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Could you have a way to win everything back?

278
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
How do you know I can't? Besides,

279
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,300
even if New Way loses, it will be honorable.

280
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,400
As for you, you only used various excuses and changed the name.

281
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
You announced what was originally New Way's Sky Soar Plan in advance.

282
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Even the core technology is identical.

283
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Doing all of these things before New Way's announcement

284
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,400
means that you have indeed considered everything.

285
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,060
Hey, maintain a smile.

286
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,200
So many media companies are snapping.

287
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Don't worry.

288
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,940
As long as you have the will to work with me,

289
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,600
many people will believe your Gu Group.

290
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,510
Steal?

291
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
This word is more suitable for you, President Ling.

292
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Don't think there's nothing you, Ling Yue, are unable to steal.

293
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,500
If at the time I confessed my feelings to Anxin first,

294
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,200
do you think you'd still have a chance?

295
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,700
You have no right to mention Anxin.

296
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,200
If you think Anxin's rejection is because you were one step too late,

297
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
then you are insulting Anxin too deeply.

298
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,300
You have no right to have her.

299
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,800
From today on,

300
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,400
no matter if it is in work or in relationships,

301
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,320
I will not lose to you just because I was one step too late.

302
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
I will take back what is mine,

303
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
bit by bit.

304
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
Then you have to speed up,

305
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
or else...

306
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,600
you might not be able to withstand what's coming.

307
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,700
I'll stick to it till the end.

308
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,900
President Liu,

309
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,600
do you not owe me an explanation?

310
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,100
When you proposed this 5G+ logistics warehouse to me,

311
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't think you mentioned this was New Way's project.

312
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,200
President Ling, why didn't you directly say to the media that the Gu Group stole our plan?

313
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
We hadn't announced this plan yet.

314
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,800
The lawsuit would've been hard to win. The Gu Group hasn't entered financing yet.

315
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Even if we proved they violated infringement rights, there won't be any true impact.

316
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Then... It seems you already know how to make a true impact.

317
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Do you remember Snow Flight Technology who was in charge of Sky Soar Plan's high-frequency communication technology?

318
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,600
I remember.

319
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,020
At the time, we wanted to buy their technology at a high price,

320
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,000
but the discussion was never settled.

321
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
That's right.

322
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,800
The only reason he was never willing to sell us the technology was because he never planned on selling it.

323
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,400
He is someone who views his technological property rights as extremely important. He definitely won't sell it to anyone.

324
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Therefore, there's no way the Gu Group could've convinced them and implemented the plan so quickly.

325
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,200
 Unless Gu Ansheng doesn't know this technology belongs to Snow Flight.

326
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,500
That's right.

327
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,600
If President Liu wants to implement Plan An in a short amount of time, then he must withhold Snow Flight's situation from Gu Ansheng.

328
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Ling Yue can't threaten us.

329
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,200
You only need to welcome future profits.

330
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Our Gu Group only wants steady development.

331
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,600
We don't want to draw enemies, and we are even less inclined to invite trouble onto ourselves.

332
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
CEO Gu, I promise you.

333
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
The Gu Group will be the greatest winner.

334
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Right now, if New Way comes out to support them, it will definitely pique Snow Flight's interest.

335
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,600
Snow Flight will then sue Gu Group for patent infringement,

336
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,200
saying they stole business secrets. By that time...

337
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,400
By that time, it'll be hard for Gu Group to avoid others short-selling them.

338
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Counter someone with their methods.

339
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
I just don't want him to have the ability to counterattack.

340
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,200
CEO Gu, after the e-commerce conference we've received word from many investors.

341
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,500
They all hope to collaborate with us.

342
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
So quickly?

343
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,200
They've all seen the future of Plan An.

344
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
All right. Go arrange it, and I will see them personally.

345
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Yes.

346
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Hello.

347
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
 CEO Gu, bad news.

348
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,650
 One of the technologies within Plan An violates infringement rights.

349
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,800
 Last night, the related company has already sued us.

350
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 Also, the media has already reported it this morning, and irrefutable evidence has surfaced on the internet.

351
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,600
 It seems like a well-plotted chain of events.

352
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
Technology infringement rights violation?

353
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
How can that be? There shouldn't be a problem if we follow the plan.

354
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Where's President Liu right now?

355
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
 We haven't been able to contact him.

356
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 The investors are in the meeting room, all trying to withdraw investments, but these investments have already been placed into production.

357
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
 What do we do now?

358
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Wait until I'm there. I'll head over now.

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
 The Gu Group that relied on Plan An to garner its moment of glory

360
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 has suffered a plummet in stocks due to reports of fraudulent technology.

361
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,800
 Reports that surfaced as a result of this one, including deceiving consumers, leaks in supply protection,

362
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,200
 and the hidden problems with quality and safety have all brought Gu Group into danger.

363
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,400
- CEO Gu! 
 - The opposing company has revealed related evidence claiming that Plan An is involved in a large amount of technology stealing

364
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
and also claim Gu Group has copied their creation. Can you respond to this?

365
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,000
The Gu Group's stocks have suffered a sharp decline since this morning.

366
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,800
Is this because Gu Group will find it difficult to escape from this precarious situation?

367
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,100
- Then what about the money put in by investors? 
 -That's right, CEO Gu!

368
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,400
Please respond, CEO Gu!

369
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
CEO Gu! Does Gu Group... Does the Gu Group have a lawyer's statement? CEO Gu!

370
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,600
CEO Gu! CEO Gu, please respond! CEO Gu!

371
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
How will Gu Group face—

372
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
Where's my brother?

373
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,400
 Reporters and investors have surrounded the company entrance, requesting that the Gu Group repay their investments.

374
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,600
 Right now, CEO Gu can only live in a hotel and has no way of revealing himself publicly.

375
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,800
 - Madam Gu! 
 - No pictures! No pictures!

376
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 - May we ask CEO Gu to come out and respond? 
 - No pictures!

377
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
 No pictures! No pictures!

378
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,100
President Ling, the Gu Group's stocks have fallen to the bottom limit for five consecutive business days. Should we continue following?

379
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,600
Continue.

380
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,300
I understand.

381
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,600
Let's go and eat!

382
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,000
- Let's go! 
 - Time to eat...

383
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
We'll leave it to you.

384
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,040
What's wrong? Is there something you forgot again?

385
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Do you have business with me?

386
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Of course, I have business with you.

387
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
The Gu Group's stocks have hit rock bottom?

388
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,200
What? Something as major as this and you're together with Ling Yue every day.

389
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,400
You're pretending you don't know?

390
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Ling Yue's been busy recently, and I haven't seen him in many days. What's the situation?

391
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
New Way attacked and completely suppressed Gu Group.

392
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,200
My brother's been heavily damaged.

393
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,600
He's like a zombie every day and can't even return home.

394
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
Gu Group's almost over, too.

395
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
How is it? Are you happy now?

396
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
You've had your revenge. Are you satisfied now?

397
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
What revenge?

398
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
I told you I'm not aware of this matter!

399
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Stop pretending to be a good person.

400
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
If it weren't for you,

401
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
would my brother and Ling Yue be fighting like this?

402
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
If you hadn't rejected my brother,

403
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
would he risk everything to fight with Ling Yue?

404
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,400
This is all because of you.

405
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Gu Anxin, I advise you.

406
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Don't affect two businesses because of one person's feelings.

407
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
The Gu Group has lost so much market value overnight.

408
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,400
How many people's sweat and efforts have gone to waste?

409
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,300
You have no right.

410
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,800
 I'm sorry. The user you are dialing is unavailable at the moment.

411
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 Please dial again in a moment.

412
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,300
 Brother, how are you? Call me back when you see this.

413
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,370
What do we do now? People from Gu Group are chasing after me everywhere.

414
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,700
I don't even have a place to hide!

415
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,030
Boss wants you to lie low and hide from the spotlight.

416
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,160
Didn't we say this was a big slice of cake? How did it turn out this way?

417
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,890
It's indeed a big slice of cake,

418
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,180
but it must be eaten slowly to prevent choking.

419
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,650
President Liu, you are too anxious.

420
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,060
Boss, what do we do next?

421
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,010
 I originally wanted to use Gu Ansheng to kick New Way off,

422
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,870
 but I didn't expect that Ling Yue wouldn't fall into the trap and conversely brought down Gu Group instead.

423
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,330
 However, it wasn't completely without gain. Don't loosen up. Continue to keep a close eye.

424
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,070
Understood.

425
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,650
You are back.

426
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,620
I have been too busy lately and haven't come home often.

427
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,530
You won't blame me, right?

428
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,170
Why have you been so busy lately?

429
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,990
Is there a problem at the company?

430
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,940
It's fine. It's almost all taken care of.

431
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,350
What about your Sky Soar Plan? How is it going?

432
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,920
Not bad. Its progress can be considered smooth.

433
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,820
That's all?

434
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,520
What's wrong?

435
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,730
Even now, you're still hiding it from me?

436
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,390
Gu Xin'er came to see me.

437
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,160
If it weren't for her telling me,

438
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,040
I wouldn't have known that you were in such a serious stalemate.

439
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,200
This is common competition in the market. Things are not as simple as you think.

440
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,070
But you could have told me.

441
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,280
I didn't want you to worry.

442
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,670
I can worry about you. I'm willing to worry about you.

443
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:13,030
If I need to find out about all of your helplessness and hardships from another person,

444
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,230
who am I to you then?

445
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,700
Because the person standing opposite me is Gu Ansheng this time.

446
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,860
I knew this was what you were worried about.

447
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,760
How could I not care?

448
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,370
You are interrogating me right now

449
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,120
and starting to be partial to him? How could I not care?

450
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,270
Gu Ansheng brought this upon himself because he messed with me first.

451
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,480
Ling Yue, I think there must be some misunderstanding.

452
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,260
What right do you have to be so sure?

453
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,270
The fact that I have known and interacted with him for many years.

454
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,130
Yes.

455
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,390
You have interacted for many years.

456
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,340
Yes, I can't compete with him.

457
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,040
So, you think I'm asking you about this because I'm protecting him?

458
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,690
Isn't that so? Aren't you believing what others say and feeling bad for him?

459
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,880
If even after interacting with each other for such a long time,

460
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
there is still another person in between us,

461
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,830
and you don't have any trust in me at all,

462
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,130
there's nothing to be said then.

463
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,570
If this is what you think, I have nothing to say.

464
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,580
President Ling, Gu Group's shares have fallen to rock bottom.

465
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,510
The investors have withdrawn their funds one after another. The company assets have been devalued by around 40 percent.

466
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,250
Our plan to short-sell Gu Group is approaching.

467
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,330
It's always patients who try to make appointments with doctors but can't get one. I've never seen a family like yours.

468
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,840
You and Ling Yue delayed it until now before you finally came.

469
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,380
I wouldn't have come if I hadn't already paid.

470
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,790
You are unabashedly displaying your affections publicly.

471
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,620
What public display of affection? He hasn't been home for a few days.

472
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,250
You quarreled?

473
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,070
We didn't.

474
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,650
It's just that he's been too busy.

475
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,740

476
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,360
Why is this hospital file in your possession?

477
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,650
It's Maria First Hospital. It was the first hospital I interned at.

478
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,690
After I left, I kept many file folders.

479
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,650
Why are you asking this?

480
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,360
Many years ago, my father did the paternity test at this hospital.

481
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,580
But I think there's a problem with the paternity test.

482
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,960
Problem with the paternity test?

483
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,560
How is this possible? Tell me who the unscrupulous doctor was. See if I know him.

484
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,400
I actually did look into it in the past.

485
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,220
He specialized in hematology.

486
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,990
The specialist in hematology? Surely it wasn't...

487
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,230
Jiang Tao?

488
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,670
Yes, it was Jiang Tao. It was Jiang Tao!

489
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,490
There's no way.

490
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,910
He is the most brilliant professional and life mentor I know.

491
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,760
He has thirty years of professional work experience.

492
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,360
It could be that there was a problem during some step in the process or you remembered incorrectly?

493
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,180
I was also wondering which step went wrong.

494
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,680
Although things in the past should be let go of,

495
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,080
my mom left this world because of this.

496
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,380
Hence, I still want to get to the bottom of what happened.

497
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,610
How about this? Tell me the specific details

498
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,320
and the exact date and time of the test.

499
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,340
I will ask my mentor on your behalf.

500
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,870
- Can this be done? 
 - Yes.

501
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,390
This is very important to me. If it can be done, thank you very much.

502
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,670
Okay. I will call you once I have the results.

503
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,690

504
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,080
- Sister Xuan.
 - Xiao Xiao, here to see Doctor Jiang again?

505
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,800
He's making his ward rounds. Take a seat in his office now.

506
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
Okay, I'm going there.

507
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,930

508
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,700

509
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,530

510
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,830

511
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,150
It's you, Little Rascal. Which wind blew you here?

512
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,750
I'm making an inquiry on behalf of a friend

513
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,070
and since it was in the same direction, I brought you some nice food.

514
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,190
Thanks.

515
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,450
I'll say you have a conscience for knowing my taste.

516
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Mentor, were you always working at Maria First Hospital in the past?

517
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,500
That's right. Isn't that the place where I first met you, Little Rascal?

518
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,480
You were the most gifted intern in that group.

519
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,090
You were also the one who was most willing to take on hardships.

520
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,180
It's all because you taught well.

521
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,630
Mentor, I was entrusted today

522
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,350
to ask you about something.

523
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,960
Speak.

524
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,810
I have a friend, Gu Anxin.

525
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,640
She did a paternity test with you before,

526
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
but she feels there was a mistake.

527
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,050
Thus, I would like to ask if you recall anything.

528
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,840
Gu Anxin?

529
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,360
That's right.

530
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,090
Generally speaking, if there were any cases of

531
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,910
misdiagnosis, I would keep a record of it.

532
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,750
Gu Anxin?

533
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,270
I don't seem to have any recollection.

534
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,940
Okay. If... If you recall anything,

535
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,040
let me know because this matter

536
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,400
is very important to her.

537
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,950
Okay.

538
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,760
Mentor, I'm leaving now.

539
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,360
Goodness! You have over ten thousand followers now!

540
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,580
It's time to allow me, your agent, to take the stage. Is anyone taking secret pictures?

541
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,110
This is the charm of manga.

542
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,740
I think this is the charm of a good wife.

543
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,070
- He sure doesn't think so. 
 - Are you two still fighting?

544
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,680
What's up, Doctor Xiao?

545
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,260
 About the DNA test we talked about last time,

546
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,040
 I continued following up with it

547
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,060
 and discovered some suspicious points. Is Yu Guo your classmate who was injured then?

548
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,330
Yes. Her name is Yu Guo.

549
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,320

550
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,010

551
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,960
What's the meaning of this?

552
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,690
Yu Guo's injury wasn't due to a fall from a high place?

553
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,940
Part of the reason is external wounds;

554
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,930
however, the main reason that caused the patient's disability

555
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,860
was the detection of alprazolam in her blood 
  (T/N: medicine for anxiety and panic disorder)

556
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,380
which led to severe nerve damage in her hand.

557
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,920
Then... this is to say...

558
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,080
This is to say, my mentor, Jiang Tao, falsified Yu Guo's report.

559
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,960
I don't quite understand.

560
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,260
Why would he do this? I have no feud with him.

561
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,720
I didn't understand either.

562
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,850
Hence, when I found this case study of the patient's report,

563
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,330
I went to my mentor's office in secret.

564
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,470
He has a habit of recording his patients.

565
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,390
I found this audio file which is related to Yu Guo's report.

566
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,010
 Dr. Jiang, you must help me with Yu Guo.

567
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,780
 I can't.

568
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,190
 The matter of forging Gu Anxin's paternity test

569
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,740
 - was partly your fault. 
 - You forced me to do that.

570
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,990
 When it comes down to it, it was your negligence!

571
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,770
 If this were to be exposed, you know what the consequences will be.

572
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,140
 As long as you help me this time,

573
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,040
 I will make Gu Anxin's matter

574
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,380
 end up like a rock sunk into the bottom of the ocean.

575
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,340
Yang Hong.

576
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,210
 We are family. No need to be formal.

577
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,370
 Your mother was my good friend.

578
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,920
 Your ending up like this was partly my fault.

579
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,520
 It's normal for you to blame me.

580
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,740
Yang Hong and Mentor Jiang Tao were working together in the Department of Hematology.

581
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,030
She knew Mentor Jiang Tao was in charge of your paternity test.

582
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,740
So she secretly swapped the blood sample for another.

583
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,330
That was the problematic paternity test!

584
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,520
That's how my mom eventually turned out like that.

585
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,650
Yang Hong's father was Jiang Tao's mentor.

586
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,900
When Yu Guo had an accident,

587
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,980
it happened right as Mentor Jiang Tao was promoted to Associate Chief Physician.

588
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,790
Yang Hong used the error in the paternity test and his promotion to threaten him.

589
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,590
Thus, Jiang Tao falsified Yu Guo's case report

590
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,650
and pushed the reason for her disability entirely to the staircase incident.

591
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,180
Why did he do this to me?

592
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,360
Madam, Miss Anxin's looking for you.

593
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,990
Anxin is here? Let her in.

594
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,050
Anxin is here.

595
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,070
It has been a long time. I've missed you.

596
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,060
Come in and take a seat.

597
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,650
Auntie Hong, I don't have any other matters today.

598
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,620
I merely wanted to verify certain matters with you.

599
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,330
What are they?

600
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,300
Do you still remember Doctor Jiang?

601
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,280
I've known Dr. Jiang since a long time ago,

602
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,710
but we haven't been in contact in a long time.

603
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,150
The DNA report that he did for me

604
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,370
had a problem with it. Did you know about this?

605
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,620
There was a problem with the paternity report?

606
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,240
I really have no idea.

607
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,490
Because I trust my mother.

608
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,270
She wouldn't do anything to wrong my father.

609
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,960
However, if the paternity report is wrong,

610
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,430
it clearly means that someone forged the report.

611
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,340
Or perhaps, the blood sample was swapped.

612
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,600
This happened a long time ago.

613
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,730
Anxin, listen to my advice.

614
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,980
Who hasn't been young once? Who hasn't made mistakes?

615
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,770
That's right.

616
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,820
Why should the younger generation be embroiled

617
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,360
with matters that happened in the previous generation?

618
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,380
Your father is just being stubborn.

619
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,300
He misses you very much.

620
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,310
Ever since your mother passed away,

621
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:41,060
we both hoped to treat you as our biological daughter

622
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,460
and give you all of the good things.

623
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,240
We hoped you would live well.

624
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,410
Auntie Hong, I know

625
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,600
how good you've been to me for these past years.

626
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,850
Including all of the goodwill that Xin'er treated me with when we were in school.

627
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,010
I remember all of that.

628
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,330
By the way, Auntie, do you still remember Yu Guo?

629
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,780
I don't seem to have any recollection. Who is she?

630
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,940
Someone who got into an accident back then. My schoolmate.

631
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,310
Ever since the time she showed up at the Gu family's banquet and then disappeared,

632
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,000
I found some past schoolmates to do some investigating.

633
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,100
Some of them found video evidence in their cellphones

634
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,840
that can prove that that accident

635
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,730
had nothing to do with me.

636
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
Of course, it's good to have new evidence.

637
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,990
Moreover,  I have always believed that it was unintentional.

638
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,710
However, all of this happened too long ago.

639
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,360
Don't keep clinging onto this and not let go.

640
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,330
One should look forward instead.

641
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,420
If we can't even figure out the past,

642
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,480
how can we look forward?

643
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,090
This is not what I meant.

644
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,290
Aren't you and Ling Yue doing well now?

645
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,530
Of course, your relationship with Ling Yue is your freedom and I have no right to interfere;

646
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,000
however,

647
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,000
seeing as you and Xin'er are sisters at heart,

648
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,530
can you not make it too hard for her?

649
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,140
Of course, if you have problems,

650
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,240
I will still help.

651
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,510
I like you very much. I will still help you.

652
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,470
It's not easy for a girl to be out there alone.

653
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,680
Auntie, don't worry.

654
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,210
Ling Yue and I will be very well.

655
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:02,960

656
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,660
♫  Let's start the story from the rainy day where we met  ♫

657
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:13,270
♫  Memories are soaked in rain  ♫

658
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,890
♫  Fate works bizarrely  ♫

659
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:21,170
♫  The past that cannot be forgotten has received a response  ♫

660
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,970
♫  My heart suddenly beats abnormally  ♫

661
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:31,470
♫  Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you  ♫

662
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,950
♫  Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more  ♫

663
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:43,040
♫  Abandoning the token of happiness,  for it has always been you  ♫

664
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,030
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

665
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,200
♫  Yet the longing has never been able to stop  ♫

666
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,420
♫  Searching for the route to return to your side  ♫

667
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:07,470
♫  Our story has only just begun  ♫

668
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,690
♫  Using all of my most beautiful adjectives  ♫

669
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:19,940
♫  Is still not enough to describe your name  ♫

670
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,910
♫  Our story is exclusively ours  ♫

671
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,700
♫  Our palms hold onto the key to the future  ♫

672
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,930
♫  Using love to slowly open up   ♫

673
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:42,430
♫  a lifetime  ♫
