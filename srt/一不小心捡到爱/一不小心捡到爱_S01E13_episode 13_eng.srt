1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,530
♫  No longer panicking on the night of the blackout  ♫

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,660
♫  You're by my side, illuminating a beam of light for me  ♫

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,560
♫  Heartbeat increasing, oxygen decreasing as our eyes meet  ♫

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  Your breath  ♫

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
♫  brushes up against my cheek  ♫

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  With you warming up the stage, 
 happiness never comes to a close  ♫

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,560
♫  Boring jokes add some sweetness to the dinner  ♫

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,340
♫  Daily life is even more like a comic than comics themselves  ♫

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,100
♫  Happiness and sadness  ♫

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,370
♫  Make up the moments of life  ♫

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,770
♫  Rainy days become very special because of you  ♫

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,380
♫  Picked up a pitiful youngster off the street  ♫

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:10,600
♫  No matter when and where, you always appear  ♫

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,140
♫  Holding me tightly and spinning in circles  ♫

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,630
♫  Rainy days make me so nostalgic because of you  ♫

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,160
♫  Becoming some part of the memories  ♫

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,520
♫  Walking down a street with lights lighting up 
 one after another  ♫

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,050
♫  Warming up the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,480

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,200

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,520
 We're also currently searching for a camping spot!

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,790
 How about we go together?

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,300
 So many?

25
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,320
 Do you like it?

26
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,500
Why is my brother's car here?

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,120
He's asleep?

28
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,800
- Why are you here? 
 - Anxin.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,720
That's the man who you said had amazing visuals?

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
"That man"?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,110
A man like you can be called "that man,"

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,990
a man like Ansheng

33
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,850
cannot be referred to in that way.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,430
He's not that handsome. His beard is stubbly.

35
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,340
He's not as exquisite as I am.

36
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm joking. I'm joking. Just saying it for fun.

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,310
- Why did you come here? 
 - What does it have to do with you?

38
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,240
Why would you be here?

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,170
A single man is camping out downstairs from my girlfriend's house.

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,160
How does that have nothing to do with me?

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,810
Besides, this is my house.

42
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,050
What's wrong with coming to check out my house?

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,980
Brother, why are you here?

44
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,550
- I... 
 - My brother came to pick me up!

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,610
I'm sorry. I suddenly had some business at home,

46
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,420
so I had my brother come pick me up.

47
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,540
You guys have fun. Let's hang out next time.

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll be leaving first.

49
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,590
Let's go.

50
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,640
Brother.

51
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,650
You really waited for Anxin downstairs the whole night?

52
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,480
- I didn't. 
 - If you didn't,

53
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,360
how could someone as clean as you

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
not even shave?

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,600
I lost my razor.

56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,770
What's wrong?

57
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,140
You really can't lie.

58
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,350
Why are you so stupid?

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,340
Suffering a whole night for Anxin.

60
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't want to talk about that right now.

61
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,510
Brother, we aren't kids anymore.

62
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,520
Anxin is also an adult now, and she doesn't need you to watch over her every day.

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,140
Don't you think your kindness for her is already a little bit too much?

64
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,640
- It's not like a brother to a sister anymore, but like—  
 - How is it not like a brother to a sister?

65
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,970
Am I not good to you?

66
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,420
It's not even close. Hurry and shave after going back.

67
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,640
Don't let Mom see.

68
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,280
I got it.

69
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,610
As a new person, you've already achieved such great results.

70
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,130
Did you foresee this beforehand?

71
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,780
Absolutely not.

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,620
Actually, I only took my pure love for manga

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,300
and drew the world I saw in my heart to share with my readers.

74
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,570
To receive so much attention and love, I actually...

75
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,890
feel quite overwhelmed by flattery.

76
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,040
Now that you've been called the future of Chinese cartoons,

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,900
the readers' expectations for you are much greater than before.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,680
Would you feel a lot of pressure?

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,170
Right now, I indeed feel like compared to creating alone in the studio,

80
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,120
I definitely lost a lot of freedom.

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,050
There's definitely pressure as well.

82
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,850
But more importantly, I don't want to let down the people who like me.

83
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,640
I will try my best to turn pressure into motivation.

84
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,780
All right. Then our interview

85
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,250
- will end here today. Thank you for your cooperation. 
 - Thank you.

86
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,380
Then I will look forward to a happy ending for "Accidentally Picking Up a Prince."

87
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,580
- I will keep following its updates. 
 - Thanks for the hard work.

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,220
Good luck.

89
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,630
Take care!

90
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,290
It's getting late. I'll be leaving first.

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,770
You've finally come back, so stay for a few more days!

92
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,300
I see you've lost weight.

93
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,740
How can that be? I've even gained 1.5 kilograms!

94
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,320
Nonsense!

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,860
Wherever you gain or lose weight on your body,

96
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,960
I can see it all clearly.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,370
No, no, no. We must speed up

98
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,710
- finding a girlfriend for you. 
 - That's right!

99
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,160
I've never seen Brother bring a girlfriend home.

100
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,840
Mom, don't worry about this matter.

101
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
What do you mean, don't worry?

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,830
Look at your sister. Isn't she doing well with that Ling Sheng?

103
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,780
No, Mom! There's nothing between Ling Sheng and me.

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,170
- I just see him as a little brother. 
 - Quibbling! Quibbling again!

105
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,100
Little brother? His eyes are almost grown on you!

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,010
You still deny it?

107
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,820
Right! That Anxin and Ling Yue are pretty good as well.

108
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,420
Only you!

109
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,880
There's not even a hint of someone.

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,740
Do you have any friends that you could develop things with?

111
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,580
Your dad and I went from friends to husband and wife.

112
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,960
Mom, I'm really not interested in girls right now.

113
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,510
Not interested in girls?

114
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,200
You aren't...

115
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,620
No.

116
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,740
- What are you thinking? 
 - Then, why aren't you looking for a girlfriend?

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,350
Aside from Anxin, I've never seen you be close with another girl!

118
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,240
You can't possibly date her, right?

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,720
Mom! Brother's just returned from overseas. He still needs to adapt to life here.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,550
Also, girls from overseas and here act differently.

121
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,530
I know you are in a hurry for a grandson,

122
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,120
but you have to give him some time.

123
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Xin'er is right.

124
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm not going to deal with it anyway.

125
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,980
Your brother's dating life can't keep dragging on like this.

126
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm looking forward to being a grandma soon.

127
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,390
Last time, the Aunt Chen who did nails with me

128
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,450
has a daughter that also studied abroad like you.

129
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,050
She's really beautiful!

130
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,930
I have her picture on my phone. Do you want to see?

131
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,670
I really don't need to, Mom.

132
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,230
Just stop rushing me, all right?

133
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,120
I don't care! You must find time to meet her.

134
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,790
Hello?

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,420
 Youyou, I've planned a blind date for you.

136
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
 You must go this time.

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,850
I don't want to go.

138
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,590
 If you don't go, I'll end our mother-daughter relationship!

139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,280
Mom!

140
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,280
Move, move, move.

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Ever since my mom thought I broke up with Xiao Ba,

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,170
my phone is going to explode from the ringing!

143
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,480
Anxin, how about you do me another favor?

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,020
The one in the gray sitting there.

145
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,960
That's him.

146
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,140
Youyou, from his back view, he actually seems all right to me.

147
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,840
Why don't you go try it first?

148
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,750
What can you figure out from the back view?

149
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,010
Besides, what age is it now that parents still get to arrange marriages?

150
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm telling you. I definitely cannot yield!

151
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,970
Isn't everything still planned out clearly for you?

152
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,640
Or else, you wouldn't have come to us for help.

153
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,300
Let me tell you. We'll proceed with the plan in a bit.

154
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,040
Once I walk over,

155
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,610
 sit down, and pick up the water cup,

156
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,260
you guys will make your move.

157
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
- Okay. 
 - Don't worry, Youyou.

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,850
We'll definitely make him feel like today is...

159
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,590
exciting.

160
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,860
Yes!

161
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,560
My man, I've come!

162
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,290
- Youyou? 
 - It‘s you?

163
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,010
You're Aunt Chen's daughter?

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,500
The young talent my mom was talking about is you?

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
 My, Xu Youyou's, spring is here again! I love blind dates!

166
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,280
Thank goodness it's you today, or else I wouldn't know what to do.

167
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,650
Then since we've already come, let's just go through the motions of a blind date.

168
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,310
What do you normally like to do?

169
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,860
Just photography, traveling, and cooking.

170
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,250
I also like photography!

171
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,230
Let me tell you! I normally take artistic photos

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,060
- for my Mike. 
 - Water! Hurry and go!

173
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,220
Xu Youyou!

174
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,520
Didn't you say you were on a business trip?

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,320
You're going on a date with this wild man behind my back?

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,060
What do you take me for? A green turtle? You must give me an explanation today! 
  (T/N: "Green turtle" is slang for cowardly men whose wives/girlfriends are cheating on them)

177
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,830
That's not it!

178
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,500
It's my turn, my turn!

179
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,120
If you don't give me an explanation, I'll end myself here!

180
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,700
- Sir, put down that spoon first, and let's talk peacefully.
 - This isn't it! 
 - Sir? Who's your Sir?

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,440
Sit down first. I'll make you pay later.

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
Xu Youyou!

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,430
- How can you do this to me— 
 - Anxin...

184
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,380
- Anxin? 
 - Brother?

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,430
Don't you understand our signals?

186
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,540
It's not that. Didn't we agree that as soon as you raise your glass, we should rush over?

187
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,870
I gave new secret signals to you later on so many times.

188
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,280
"That's not it. That's not it." Besides, didn't you just meet?

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,450
I thought you were encouraging my acting and praising me!

190
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,470
Besides, Ansheng doesn't look much like he used to.

191
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,330
So that's how it is. That's fine too.

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,190
Before, I was worried about what I would tell my mom and dad about this.

193
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,730
If it's Youyou, it's easier to handle.

194
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,960
Since neither of us wants to do blind dates,

195
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,120
each of us can find an excuse and get it over with carelessly.

196
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,020
 This is a cooked duck that was brought right next to my mouth.  
  (T/N: A great chance)

197
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,710
 I can't let it fly away!

198
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,760
  Sister, you have to help me think of something.

199
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,200
Nevertheless, I think that you and Youyou truly are destined for each other!

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,980
Even this kind of thing can bring you two together. Isn't that right?

201
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,510
It is indeed quite a coincidence.

202
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,010
Brother.

203
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,160
No matter how you put it, Youyou is a top-quality female guest, isn't she?

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
How about...

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,260
Don't meddle in this kind of affair.

206
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,150
  He must be shy. Be more tactful.

207
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,380
  Use outflanking tactics.

208
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,860
  Received. Over.

209
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,590
I suddenly remembered something.

210
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,610
You are both being pressured to get married by your families. If this goes bad,

211
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,650
you'll surely be unable to escape from your parents' evil clutches. Right, Youyou?

212
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,140
I've thought about it.

213
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,030
Why don't you collaborate a little?

214
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,390
Completely exercise the freedom of marriage.

215
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,750
- How do we collaborate? 
 - Pretend to be sweethearts.

216
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,310
That's not really fair to Youyou.

217
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,430
That would be great.

218
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,180
No. What I mean is,

219
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,980
if you're here to help out, I won't have to be tormented by my parents anymore.

220
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Then...

221
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,430
- What do you think? 
 - It's excellent!

222
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,360
Okay.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
 So it was you.

224
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,080

225
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,800
Hello.

226
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes, Mom. I'm with Youyou.

227
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,540
From the moment I saw Youyou,

228
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,700
I felt that...

229
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,030
love had arrived.

230
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes. R-Rest assured, Mom.

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,490
Okay. I'll talk to you when I get back.

232
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,680
Okay, I'm hanging up for now.

233
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,750
Perfect. Thank you, Brother.

234
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,140
I also need to quickly send a Wechat Moment so my mom can see it!

235
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,480
You need to pair it with the type of caption that parents love seeing the most.

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,980
For example, there should be some expressions like this.

237
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,460
Smiling and that kind of thing.

238
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,700
- Roses? 
 - That works.

239
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,150
Hurry up!

240
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,720
Brother, I've suddenly remembered that Zhao Lei and I have something to talk about.

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,370
Why don't you help us escort Youyou home?

242
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,700
What thing?

243
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,550
Don't we have a project to discuss?

244
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,380
Yes. A project.

245
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,440
- You guys go on ahead. 
 - Anxin,

246
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,650
you've gotten thinner again. Are you not eating well?

247
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,010
I have been eating well!

248
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,400
How could a take-out girl like me have trouble eating well?

249
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,790
Hurry and go. Hurry and go.

250
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,760
How could you only eat take-out?

251
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,030
Brother, don't go on like a broken record. Worry about your marriage.

252
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,940
Hurry. Go on.

253
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,170
Are you really so determined to match Youyou with me?

254
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,360
I am just this determined.

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,700
Every windy, moonless night, I will think about how my utterly perfect brother

256
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,300
is somehow still alone in total isolation,

257
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,140
and my heart will quietly ache.

258
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,140
Hurry up and go. Go on.

259
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,860
Bye-bye!

260
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,110
- You got this! 
 - I'm afraid.

261
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,190
What's there to be afraid of?

262
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040
Isn't that The Northwest Watches Chang'an?

263
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,280
It really is. I've seen everything. Heavens.

264
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,550
It's The Northwest Watches Chang'an!

265
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,930
Can I get your autograph? I love your cartoons so much!

266
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,620
Me too. I love them, too.

267
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Okay.

268
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,360
Sister Chang'an, could you upload more?

269
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,620
It's definitely not enough to follow!

270
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,830
Exactly! You can't leave it unfinished.

271
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,670
What kind of nonsense is that? How could it go unfinished?

272
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,840
After the new technology was released, in as short as three months,

273
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,690
the revenue for Cai Niao Posting Station increased by over four points.

274
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,620
Cai Niao Posting Station will continue to introduce the most advanced technology

275
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,990
to focus on improving the experience for customers.

276
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,790
Being able to start the posting station from the ground up and build it into something so fruitful

277
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,180
is completely a result of your efforts, Xin'er.

278
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,790
Dad, it's all because you had the foresight.

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,730
It's also thanks to the technology introduced by New Way

280
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,430
combined with Cai Niao Station's original technology.

281
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,930
The feedback from our customers is also very satisfactory.

282
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,370
We are currently gaining users at a steady rate.

283
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,980
This means that youngster Ling Yue

284
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,120
does have some capability.

285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,250
Chairman, wasn't our company planning to develop payment software anyway?

286
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,830
Why don't we connect with some of the resources your Xin'er has?

287
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,150
Xin'er, I only want to ask you one question.

288
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,710
Is the database station for this in your own hands?

289
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,490
It's in the hands of New Way.

290
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,540
Those resources are so valuable. I'm afraid

291
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,930
he won't hand it over to someone easily.

292
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,800
The resources are indeed valuable,

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,000
but they are still not as precious as my daughter.

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,150
I firmly believe in the place Xin'er has in his heart.

295
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,180
Give him a call. Tell him

296
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,670
he can require whatever conditions he wants.

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,770
Dad, this...

298
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,330
Why are you embarassed? I'll do it!

299
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,650
 Hello, who is it?

300
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,140
President Ling, I'm Xin'er.

301
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,880
 Gu Group wants to talk with New Way

302
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
about the facial recognition technology collaboration.

303
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,020
This isn't an area included in our collaboration.

304
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,760
Dad, this might not be the best timing.

305
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,540
Xiao Yue, I'm your Uncle Gu.

306
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,180
Listen carefully. What Xin'er just said

307
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,640
is what I want. In all these years in the commercial world, our two families

308
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,300
have always been on good collaboration terms.

309
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,850
Helping each other out is our duty.

310
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,220
How about this? As long as you hand me the resources this time,

311
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,280
no matter what conditions you make, I will be willing to negotiate.

312
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,230
- What do you think? 
 - Apologies, Chairman Gu.

313
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,710
The information of customers isn't something that can be weighed with other conditions.

314
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,530
 I am still quite busy so I won't continue to bother you. Goodbye.

315
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,590
This Ling Yue is so disrespectful.

316
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,650
Dad, I'll tell him in person later.

317
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,980
No need!

318
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,330
He isn't accepting me playing nice and insists on waiting for me to do things the hard way!

319
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,390
I will wait until the day he begs me.

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,650
Ask the Technology Department to strengthen the security these coming days.

321
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,310
Understood.

322
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,300

323
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000
 Sister Chang'an, can you update more? There's not enough to follow!

324
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
 That's right! You can't leave it unfinished!

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,200
 What are you saying? How could it be left unfinished?

326
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
 You're being called the future of Chinese cartoons.

327
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,300
 The readers' expectations for you are much greater than before.

328
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
 Would you be feeling a lot of pressure?

329
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,400
What's wrong, Miss Main Author? You still don't have ideas?

330
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
I really don't know

331
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,100
what choice she should make.

332
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
It's all right. Take your time.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
By the way, your draft fee

334
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,100
should already be in your account. Go check it.

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands...

336
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,600
Oh my god! I've never made so much money before!

337
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,400
If you think it's too much, why don't you return some to me?

338
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Thanks, Boss.

339
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
How is it, Miss Main Author?

340
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,100
I think I've already reached my limit.

341
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,200
How could that be? Let me see.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,310
I'm telling you. It's from hunger.

343
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,200
Eat some fruit first.

344
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
How are you so caring?

345
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm telling you. These were all sent to my house by Ansheng.

346
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
What I'm eating isn't fruit! It's dog food! 
  (T/N: Slang for "Public display of affection)

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,800
My parents also said that we are fated for each other, and we look like husband and wife.

348
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,900
He's already met your parents? That fast?

349
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,000
The iron must be struck early.

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
Why are you always staring at me? I know I'm pretty.

351
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
That Ansheng has thick eyebrows and big eyes.

352
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,200
He has a high nose bridge, so the middle part of his face is quite plump.

353
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,600
As for you, you are 400 degrees nearsighted, and your eyes lack spirit.

354
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
If you think you look alike... then you do.

355
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
Wait... What do you mean?

356
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll stop talking. Protecting my life is most important.

357
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,800
- You better speak clearly! 
 - I won't!

358
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
- Speak! 
 - No!

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
- No, speak clearly! 
 - You're asking me to speak?

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Speak!

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,100
Abstract.

362
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,600
You look way too abstract. The Xinhua dictionary doesn't even have a word that can match it! 
  (T/N: Most popular dictionary according to Guinness World Records 2016. It is considered a symbol of Chinese culture.)

363
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Zhao Lei! You—

364
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm not talking anymore! Weren't you the one who told me to talk?

365
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Stop, stop, stop. I was wrong.

366
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,300
 I really like Sister Chang'an!

367
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,800
 These few chapters have way too much filler content!

368
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,100
 Could it be that she's been too busy with interviews and isn't in the mood to update anymore?

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
 I think Sister Chang'an drew very well.

370
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,200
 How tiring would it be to update every day? Can't everyone be more understanding to Sister?

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
What are you looking at?

372
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Nothing much.

373
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,600
Surely you aren't looking at something shameful, right?

374
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,100
Looking at what?

375
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,000
We're all adults. I understand.

376
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,210
What do you understand now?

377
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,250
There's no need to clarify it too much, right?

378
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't need that.

379
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Really? I see.

380
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,600
You're aware of my ability, aren't you? It seems it's been too long and you've forgotten.

381
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Should we review?

382
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,300
It's the middle of the day. Don't say something so embarrassing.

383
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So, don't you go encouraging me in the middle of the day.

384
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Right! Send me your Alipay account.

385
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Why?

386
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Don't I still owe you ¥82,000? I can pay you back now.

387
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,900
Because right now, however you put it, I can be considered as

388
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,190
a small, small, small upstart.

389
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,200
So I can afford to pay you back what I owe.

390
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm not in a hurry about getting paid back. It's not like you're going to run away.

391
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,700
How could that do? I need to turn the tables on my peasant identity as soon as possible.

392
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,000
How could you be a peasant now?

393
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,500
I can't just always owe you without repaying you.

394
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,400
If possible, I hope you will owe me for your entire life.

395
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
What did you bring me here for?

396
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
For a date.

397
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,800
A date? At such a hardcore place? It doesn't really suit me.

398
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Let's go. You'll find out soon.

399
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,800
This is where I first established New Way.

400
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
At the time, no one had high expectations for New Way.

401
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
In order to increase productivity and improve technology,

402
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I took root here without sleep or rest for a long time.

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,560
However, I still failed back then.

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,900
Failed?

405
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Because I overestimated the market's needs at the time,

406
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
so none of the products I produced could sell.

407
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,900
Only the company itself could take on the burden of this loss.

408
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
But you still succeeded.

409
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Otherwise, how could there be the New Way of today?

410
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Have you ever thought about

411
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
how if everything went smoothly for me then,

412
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I definitely would have become overly smug about my extraordinary innate talent,

413
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,000
and New Way wouldn't be where it is today.

414
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Every failure brings seed for success.

415
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,290
No step you take is right or wrong.

416
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,000
As long as your journey starts from the heart,

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,800
all of your setbacks will later become your treasures.

418
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,030
I won't give up.

419
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,600
President Ling, the Technology Department has a problem.

420
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,050
President Ling, this time we've learned from past failures

421
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,100
and added multiple layers of encryption to the facial recognition system.

422
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,950
Since you think you're not at fault,

423
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,200
speak louder and more clearly.

424
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Yes, President Ling.

425
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,600
The loophole that the internet refers to doesn't exist.

426
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,000
We've already added multiple layers of encryption to the facial recognition system as per your orders.

427
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,400
This is the detailed inspection report we created.

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,900
Do you think we should publicize the results of our inspection report?

429
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,960
Or else if this continues, I'm afraid it will

430
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,400
affect the preparation for our anniversary celebration event.

431
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Immediately publicize the inspection report. Other publicity methods will proceed simultaneously.

432
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Go work with the property manager and obtain security camera footage.

433
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Yes.

434
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Has Cai Niao Posting Station made a move?

435
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
No.

436
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,800
It seems this matter must be connected to the Gu Group.

437
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Immediately cut off all informational routes with the Gu Group.

438
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,900
Yes.

439
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,080
President Ling, there's trouble in America.

440
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Speak.

441
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,800
Many major brands that were to attend our preparatory anniversary event and already signed contracts

442
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,200
have just claimed they no longer wish to support New Way.

443
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,400
- How did this happen? 
 - How can they do that?

444
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
There's no loophole. Who reported that?

445
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,400
Also, the Gu Group suddenly decided to hold a website banquet.

446
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,600
It is said that they have already made contact with America.

447
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
They didn't even wait for us to start an investigation,

448
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,800
yet that old fox has already shown his tail.

449
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,900
Hello.

450
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,600
Hello, please give me a vanilla creampuff.

451
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,100
All right.

452
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,160

453
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,000

454
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,500
What's going on with New Way?

455
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,000
Immediately send an announcement denying it.

456
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Boss, the Chairman said we aren't allowed to respond to this matter.

457
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
All right. I understand.

458
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
 Then, what should we do now?

459
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Listen to the Chairman's orders for now.

460
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
 Yes.

461
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,800
Nice ball!

462
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
How's it going with Number Two's matters?

463
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Number Two has fallen pretty hard this time due to Gu Yuanchao.

464
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm afraid he won't be able to get back up.

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
What right do you have to call him "Number Two"?

466
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,390
Director Ling, isn't Second Young Master Ling's collapse

467
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,800
exactly what you wanted to see?

468
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,250
We can simply sit and wait for profit as those two dogs

469
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,600
fight it out.

470
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,000
Turn around.

471
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Turn around!

472
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
Is there something behind me?

473
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,400
Who are you calling a dog?

474
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,300
If he's a dog, then what am I? If he's a dog, then what am I?

475
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Director Ling, you've misunderstood! I didn't mean it that way!

476
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
- You're still saying it? 
 - No!

477
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,700
- You're still explaining? 
 - L-Listen to me!

478
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,400
If he's a dog, then what am I?

479
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,960
First, we need to stabilize things in America.

480
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,550
That brat Ling Yue brought me a promotional opportunity for free. If I don't take it, it would be a waste.

481
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,430
Our activities must still get released as planned.

482
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,670
Yes. Don't worry. We are not only willing to invest money in them, but will also pay liquidated damages.

483
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,420
There won't be a second company that can offer such good treatment.

484
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,020
Come in.

485
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,080
Chairman, then I'll take my leave.

486
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,020
Dad.

487
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,640
This attack on New Way damaged Cai Niao quite a lot.

488
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,470
Should we clarify that the posting station has no issues and find a different plan?

489
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,850
Xin'er, you've been treated unfairly this time.

490
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,780
I know your posting station has been very successful.

491
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,380
It's very outstanding in all aspects and got implicated unfairly.

492
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
However, this is only what it looks like on the outside.

493
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,110
If you want to be a good enterprise manager,

494
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,960
you must see the broader scope of things and take gambles continuously.

495
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,910
Think about it. New Way isn't just the company that that old man, Ling Tian, favors most.

496
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,540
It is even the key to the entire Ling Group's future development.

497
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,440
If we sacrifice a small posting station to knock it down,

498
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,350
wouldn't you think this sacrifice would be worth it?

499
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,880
- Dad. 
 - Don't say anything.

500
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,720
I know you're here to plead for that brat.

501
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm not here to plead for him. I'm here to discuss business with you.

502
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,230
What business?

503
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,010
Haven't you always wanted to take New Way?

504
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,120
Rather than killing 1,000 enemies with a sacrifice of 800,

505
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,710
why don't we think of a new tactic?

506
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,760
Continue.

507
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,190
The best way is to have a marriage alliance with the Ling Group.

508
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,900
Last time, that brat didn't give you face.

509
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I think his heart already belongs to someone else.

510
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,240
That's not important. What's important is...

511
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,330
he doesn't have anyone he can get help from now.

512
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,520
That is true, but doesn't he still have that Old Man Ling Tian?

513
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,200
He has always wanted to escape from the control of Uncle Ling,

514
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,210
so he definitely won't ask him for help.

515
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,150
What's wrong? Are you okay?

516
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,270
Don't look, don't look.

517
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,040
Let's go.

518
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,990
Thanks, Brother.

519
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,200
Why don't we call the police?

520
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,240
Forget it.

521
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,160
I don't want to cause a ruckus.

522
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,120
Do you know who did it?

523
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,410
It's most likely crazy fans.

524
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,930
I've stopped uploading for too long.

525
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,980
They must be using these prank methods to urge uploading.

526
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,400
Why don't you move back?

527
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,320
It's too unsafe to live alone.

528
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,900
Don't worry, Brother, it's really fine.

529
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,640
Right!  Why did you come over today?

530
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,330
I called you so many times, but you didn't pick up. I thought something happened to you.

531
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,710
Sorry, since I've been closing myself off, I've turned off all my notifications.

532
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,460
Closing yourself off?

533
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,410
It's to... find inspiration.

534
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,470
You look so haggard. Have you eaten yet?

535
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,080
I've eaten.

536
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,320
You... haven't been eating on time, have you?

537
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,400
It's not too late to eat now.

538
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,480
What do you want to eat? I'll order our takeout together.

539
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,070
That's enough. I'm here, so why would you order takeout?

540
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,270
I'll make some food for you.

541
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,160
What do you want to eat?

542
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,740
Anything.

543
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,470
Okay.

544
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,220

545
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,700
Brother.

546
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,370
What happened to New Way?

547
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,240
Being targeted by business rivals is very common.

548
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,480
Don't think too much about it.

549
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,720
You can't tell Ling Yue what happened today.

550
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,630
I don't want to cause more trouble for him.

551
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,380
How could you—

552
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,460
be a bother?

553
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,200

554
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,280
Why is she here?

555
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,260
In times like these, Miss Gu dared to come to New Way so overtly?

556
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,750
She must've forgotten who the instigator was.

557
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,410
I've heard that Cai Niao Posting Station has also taken a huge blow because of her.

558
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,970
This Chairman Gu. In order to beat us, he's willing to do anything. He really went overboard!

559
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,000
Didn't she have an ambiguous relationship with President Ling?

560
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,820
Could it be that this time...?

561
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,460
That's hard to say.

562
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,730
President Ling, can we talk in private?

563
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,870
Regarding New Way's current problem, I have a solution.

564
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,500
Why are you helping New Way?

565
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,080
Your surname is Gu, so shouldn't you be standing on the side of the Gu Group?

566
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,200
Anxin's surname is Gu, too.

567
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,940
Why aren't you even slightly suspicious of her help?

568
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,040
Anxin is different.

569
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,150
My current identity is not a member of the Gu family.

570
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,150
Rather, I am an entrepreneur who you once helped.

571
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,160
Cai Niao Posting Station's matters were a mutual collaboration. There's no such thing as helping and not helping.

572
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,350
Other people don't understand you, but I do.

573
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,410
You wouldn't rashly invest in a company before clearly understanding its ins and outs.

574
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,940
Did you really not know Cai Niao Posting Station was my company

575
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,730
before investing a lot of money in it?

576
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,460
What I placed importance on was its business value.

577
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,040
No matter how you put it, you've helped me before.

578
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,000
So this time, I won't just stand by and watch.

579
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,810
What is Gu Yuanchao's condition?

580
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,330
Marriage alliance.

581
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,470
 What benefits would our two families' marriage alliance bring you?

582
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,210
 Not only can it free New Way from its current difficult situation,

583
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,280
from a more far-reaching perspective, we could also collaborate on an ultra-powerful e-commerce platform.

584
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,400
It's such a win-win situation, why not go for it?

585
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Boss has been talking all day up there.

586
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,940
I don't even know what he's talking about.

587
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,290
A man and woman alone in an office. What else could they talk about?

588
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,160
But if Boss really did get together with Miss Gu, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

589
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,500
Then we wouldn't have to worry about the company's current danger.

590
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,820
 Miss Gu? Surely they couldn't be talking about Gu Xin'er, right?

591
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,440
 If you're worried about hurting Anxin,

592
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,970
I can tell her. I can clearly tell her that this is a tactic that benefits us all.

593
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,240
That this is just a publicity engagement.

594
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,870
When this storm blows over,

595
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,390
we will all return to how we were before.

596
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,410
Brother Yue, your tie is crooked.

597
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,110
Ling Yue!

598
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:50,570
