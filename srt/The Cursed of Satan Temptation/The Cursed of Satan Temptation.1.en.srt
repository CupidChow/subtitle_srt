1
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,125
PRISONER

2
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,541
All honor, grace, mercy, safety,
and goodness belong only to Allah.

3
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:19,666
May Allah’s peace, mercy, and blessings
always be upon you, O Prophet Muhammad.

4
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,333
May Allah’s peace, mercy, and blessings
be upon us and all His righteous servants.

5
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,250
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

6
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,375
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

7
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,041
I seek forgiveness in Allah…

8
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,583
Mr. Ahmad, someone is here to see you.

9
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:24,208
SEVEN MONTHS EARLIER

10
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,875
Praying is better than sleeping

11
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,333
Yasmin.

12
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,583
Are you awake?

13
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,958
Yes.

14
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,083
- Get ready, okay?
- Okay.

15
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,208
Nayla.

16
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,916
Sweetie, wake up.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,666
- Get ready.
- Okay.

18
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,750
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

19
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,500
Nayla.

20
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,666
Nayla.

21
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,875
Let's go.

22
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,083
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

23
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,583
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

24
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,375
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

25
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,708
Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

26
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:11,250
As explained in Surah Al-A'raf,
The Devil promised.

27
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,458
"Because you have led me astray,

28
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:19,458
I will surely sit in wait for them
on Your straight path.

29
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,166
Then I will come to them from before them

30
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,750
and from behind them,
their right, their left.

31
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:32,333
And You will not find
most of them grateful to You."

32
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,250
Let's continue.

33
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,625
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

34
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
Is everyone ready?

35
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,208
I'm sorry, kids. This is all
we have for breakfast for now.

36
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,375
Thank God.

37
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,458
We still have something to eat.

38
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,875
Thank you.

39
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,625
Try this.

40
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,458
In the name of Allah.

41
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,166
You'll like this.

42
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,875
Eat up.

43
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,416
Dear God.

44
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,250
This is the best cassava I've ever eaten.

45
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
Dear God.

46
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,125
Here.

47
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,458
Try it.

48
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,208
It's good while it's still hot.

49
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,458
It's warm.

50
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
- Try it.
- In the name of Allah.

51
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,583
Thank God.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,958
Now, I'll try the hot one.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,666
It's hot.

54
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,750
But it's good, thank God.

55
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,500
Thank God.

56
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
Mom.

57
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,916
Mom.

58
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,291
Mom.

59
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,708
Rani.

60
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,041
Mom.

61
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,416
Eat something first, okay?

62
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,041
- Mom. Please help me.
- Yes?

63
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,125
Let's wait for Dad.

64
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,541
He's out looking for help.

65
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,916
Be patient, okay?

66
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,708
But I'm in pain, Mom.

67
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,958
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why am I locked up?

68
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,708
This isn't your fault.

69
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,125
You didn't do anything wrong.

70
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,708
You have to eat, okay?

71
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,916
Mom, please help me.

72
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,125
Let me out of here.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,416
It hurts.

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,375
Help me, Mom.

75
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,250
Why did you stop?

76
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,875
Why did you stop, Mom?

77
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,500
Please open the door!

78
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,666
Help!

79
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,333
Open the door!

80
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,416
Help!

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,625
Help!

82
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Mom.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,166
Rani?

84
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,708
Rani!

85
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,875
Rani!

86
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:15,916
Rani!

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,041
Mom!

88
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Rani!

89
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
God help us!

90
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,291
Save my child, Ustaz!

91
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
God willing, your child will be saved.

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,166
Take your wife outside!

93
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,458
- Now!
- Rani!

94
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,000
Damned devil, leave this child's body!

95
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,916
I am not afraid of you!

96
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,000
I seek refuge…

97
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,583
Let me go!

98
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,958
Stop!

99
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,041
Damn it!

100
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,958
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

101
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,125
Since our child started
experiencing strange occurrences,

102
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,708
we had to confine her
in my boss's factory.

103
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,833
I see.

104
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:38,041
I want to thank you very much,
Ustaz, for saving my child.

105
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,833
And I apologize
that your clothes got ruined.

106
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,416
It's alright.

107
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Just thank Allah, sir.

108
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm just a mediator.

109
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,666
One moment, sir.

110
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,500
I have something for you.
Please accept it.

111
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,333
Why?

112
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,541
- No need, sir.
- It's okay, sir.

113
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,416
I do this sincerely. For Allah's sake.

114
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,375
You just take care of your child and wife.

115
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
- Alright.
- I'll take my leave now.

116
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,041
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too. Thank you.

117
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,125
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

118
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,375
I'm scared, Mom.

119
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,416
Don't be scared.

120
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,833
Mommy's here. Dad is here too.

121
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,416
It's okay, sweetie.

122
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,416
- So, how much is this?
- For you, just 75,000.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
- Seventy-five thousand, you say?
- Yes.

124
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,333
This thin material is worth only 20,000.

125
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,291
- It's more than 20,000, ma'am.
- Look at this.

126
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,333
The material is so thin.
As thin as my patience.

127
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,625
But it's a quality one, ma'am.
It's smooth.

128
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,958
It tears easily.

129
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't want it.

130
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,041
Let me see something else.

131
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,041
Peace be upon you.

132
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,666
Peace be upon you too.

133
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,916
Oh my God.

134
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,250
Why is your shirt like this?

135
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,416
Oh my.

136
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,708
I was performing ruqyah.
Just a small scratch.

137
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,708
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

138
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,333
It's nothing.

139
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,333
- I brought dinner.
- Okay.

140
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,041
Why do you look like that?

141
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,000
You refused money again, didn't you?

142
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,416
You know.

143
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,500
Ruqyah is a gift from Allah.

144
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,166
I can't use it for personal gain.

145
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,208
It's not like that.

146
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,791
But our sales are down.

147
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,666
And you know we'll have a lot of expenses.

148
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,000
Yasmin will be entering high school soon.

149
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,625
Nayla is also about to graduate.

150
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,833
She needs to go to college too, right?

151
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,125
I'm just confused. What should we do?

152
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,833
We need to be patient.

153
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,750
If we believe in Allah,

154
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,458
Allah will surely provide for us.

155
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,416
How's the tea? Is it good?

156
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,541
It's good.

157
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,791
It's sweet.

158
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,875
O Allah, bless the sustenance

159
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,500
You have granted us, and protect us
from the torment of the Fire.

160
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,916
- In the name of Allah.
- Amen.

161
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,166
Come on. Let's eat.

162
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,916
Here you go.

163
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,666
What do you want? You want some tofu?

164
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,666
This vegetable stew is good. Try it.

165
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,500
JAYAKARTA HIGH SCHOOL

166
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,333
Let's go to the canteen.

167
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,583
Let's go.

168
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,708
Girls!

169
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,958
Hey, Nay.

170
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,708
Are you alone?

171
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,416
No, it's crowded here.

172
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,291
Well, you're not wrong.

173
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,541
What's wrong with you, Nay?

174
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,125
Every time I ask you to go home together,
you always said you can't.

175
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,750
I'm sorry, Farhan.
It's not that I don't want to,

176
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,541
but I can't ride
on a motorcycle alone with you.

177
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,625
We're not mahram.

178
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,458
That girl acts so high and mighty.

179
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,125
Just once. I'm not going to do anything.

180
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,583
I just want to take you home.

181
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,666
I'm sorry, Farhan,
but I'll go home by myself.

182
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,958
Peace be upon you.

183
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,041
Oh my God!

184
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,750
Oh my God.

185
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,250
I'm sorry. Sinta, I didn't mean to.

186
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,833
- It's dead.
- Oh no.

187
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,458
Sinta, I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

188
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,541
What?

189
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,125
Sorry?

190
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,625
Do you know how much
this phone costs? Huh?

191
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,833
I didn't mean to…

192
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,291
Hey! Don't just say sorry. Replace it!

193
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,291
Your apology can't make
this phone work again, can it?

194
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,458
I don't care.

195
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,916
You have to replace this phone.

196
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,916
Or you'll have to deal with the police.

197
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,833
Understand?

198
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,750
- I'm sorry…
- You heard her, didn't you?

199
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,958
Replace the phone. Replace it!

200
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,041
How much does a phone like that cost, Nay?

201
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:01,375
I just checked. It costs tens of millions.

202
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,875
Oh my God.

203
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:07,708
I'm so sorry. I know I'm wrong.
I was careless. I apologize.

204
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,416
- Mom.
- It's okay.

205
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,458
It's okay.

206
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,083
It's alright.

207
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,083
Honey.

208
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,750
Can't this be repaired?

209
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,583
It should be possible, right?

210
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,583
Sinta doesn't want that, Mom.

211
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,791
She said if I don't replace it,
I'll be taken to the police.

212
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,208
Dad…

213
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh my God.

214
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,791
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,041
I'm sorry, Mom.

216
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,125
Be patient.

217
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,291
What's wrong?

218
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,875
Dad. Mom.

219
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,333
I also got a warning from school.

220
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,875
The exam fee needs to be paid quickly.

221
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,375
Or I won't be able to take the exam.

222
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,250
REMINDER FOR TUITION PAYMENT

223
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,833
It's okay.

224
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,125
Stay calm, okay?

225
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Calm down.

226
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,083
God willing, there will be a way out.

227
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,250
We can pay all of this.

228
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,583
So, what's the solution?

229
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,583
Our business is bad,
and our needs are increasing.

230
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,666
Dear God.

231
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,083
Be patient.

232
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,750
Have faith in Allah.

233
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
Allah is the Most Rich.

234
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,416
Should we look for a loan?

235
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,125
No.

236
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,166
Debt follows you to the grave.

237
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,041
What if we can't pay it back?

238
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,916
Then what should we do?

239
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,125
Peace be upon you.

240
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,958
Who is it?

241
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,500
Let me see who it is.

242
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
Peace be upon you too.

243
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,083
Oh, Mr. Anhar. What's the matter?

244
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,583
Excuse me, Ustaz.
This is Mr. Timur, my boss.

245
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,208
He needs to see you.

246
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,791
Ustaz.

247
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,875
Please help my daughter.

248
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,208
Several ustaz have tried
to help my daughter, sir,

249
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,333
but none of them succeeded.

250
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,458
What's the matter?

251
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,125
Please come inside.

252
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,083
Peace be upon you.

253
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,666
- Honey.
- How's Ratna?

254
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,750
- You didn't open her room, did you?
- No, honey.

255
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,000
Please help our child, Ustaz.

256
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,833
Of course, I'll try, ma'am.

257
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,125
- Please.
- Yes. In the name of Allah.

258
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,000
May Allah grant peace upon us
and His righteous servants.

259
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,833
Ahmad…

260
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,041
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

261
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:54,750
Don't interfere too much.

262
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,708
I seek refuge in Allah
from the cursed Satan.

263
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,375
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

264
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,583
Away, you evil!

265
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,625
Sir? Open the door, sir!

266
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:51,000
Allah is great.

267
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,041
There's no God but Allah.

268
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,958
There's no God but Allah.

269
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,208
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
In the name of Allah.

270
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,791
This child is mine.

271
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,791
How dare you, Ahmad?

272
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,125
Who are you?

273
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,833
Leave this child's body!

274
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,375
Ahmad.

275
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:07,541
I swear I will destroy you.

276
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:12,666
You will die and go to Hell!

277
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,250
Timur…

278
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,125
I promise.

279
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,625
I will collect on your promise!

280
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,625
Leave my daughter alone!

281
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:37,916
From Sulaiman, beginning with the name
of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

282
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,583
Do not be arrogant toward me

283
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:43,375
and come to me, fully submitting to Allah.
Do not be arrogant toward me

284
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,500
and come to me, fully submitting to Allah.

285
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:04,250
I swear…

286
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,208
I will destroy you…

287
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,541
and your family.

288
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:21,208
I seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
In the name of Allah.

289
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,791
Ratna!

290
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,125
Come on. Wake up, darling.

291
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,750
Come on…

292
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,125
Sir.

293
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,500
If I may ask…

294
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,833
What did the demon mean
by what it said earlier, sir?

295
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,125
About collecting on a promise from you?

296
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,625
It's nothing, sir.

297
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,250
As you know,

298
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,958
demons always speak
about misleading things.

299
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,208
But my family and I
are very grateful to you.

300
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,333
It's all through Allah's help, sir.

301
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,375
I'm nothing but a mediator.

302
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,625
But as fellow believers,
we must remind each other, sir.

303
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:35,875
Don't fall into the temptations of Satan.

304
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,458
Well then, I'll take my leave now, sir.

305
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,750
Wait a moment, Mr. Ahmad.

306
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,083
This…

307
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,583
This is from me
as a token of gratitude to you.

308
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,083
No need, sir.

309
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,208
Thank you.

310
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,333
I do this sincerely for Allah's sake.

311
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,375
You refused again?

312
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,833
You know,

313
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,125
ruqyah is not for making money, dear.

314
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:28,041
But that's honest money.
It's their way of showing gratitude.

315
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,333
Besides, there's nothing wrong with it.

316
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,500
We'll need it too, right?

317
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,125
I know.

318
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,375
Honey,

319
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,958
if we help people without
expecting anything in return

320
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,250
and sincerely,

321
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:59,375
I believe Allah will surely provide
a way out for our problems.

322
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,666
Allah has already given you a way.

323
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,416
But you didn't take that path.

324
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,750
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

325
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,000
Alright, I'm going to the store now.

326
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,125
PHYSICS - CHEMISTRY

327
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,125
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

328
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,500
Dear Allah, the Provider.

329
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:45,541
Hasten to salvation

330
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,958
Honey, I'm leaving now.

331
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,875
This afternoon,
Sinta's mother came to the store.

332
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,875
She asked for compensation
for the phone, giving us only a week.

333
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,250
God willing, there will be some income
from teaching the children tonight.

334
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,875
But it won't be enough.

335
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,500
How many students do you teach Quran to?

336
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,500
That will probably only be enough
to pay for Yasmin's exam.

337
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,166
God willing,
the problem will be solved soon.

338
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,666
Sure, God willing,
the problem will be solved soon.

339
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:46,291
If you could accept
the money given for ruqyah.

340
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,833
If you don't accept it, then what?

341
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,958
How are we going to pay for everything?

342
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,000
We're…

343
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,125
Where are you going to get the money from?

344
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,916
Be patient. Seek God's forgiveness.

345
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,708
Allah is the Most Rich.

346
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,958
You must believe.

347
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,458
Nayla, Yasmin, let's go.

348
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,958
We're leaving. Peace be upon you.

349
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,208
- Peace be upon you too.
- Peace be upon you.

350
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,375
- We're going, Mom.
- Peace be upon you too.

351
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,125
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

352
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,750
It is narrated from the earlier scholars

353
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:52,125
that at one time, a demon asked the Devil,

354
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:58,500
"How do we destroy
the faith of families of pious people?"

355
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,208
Then the Devil answered,

356
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,541
"First, ruin the mother.

357
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,333
Give her overwhelming fatigue.

358
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:15,500
And when she's weak
and has spent all her energy…

359
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,416
take away her gratitude

360
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,958
and give her a dead end.

361
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,083
Then, slowly,

362
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,125
you will witness

363
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:36,833
the faith of pious families
being destroyed.

364
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,000
Through the door of a mother."

365
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,708
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

366
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,625
MOM, CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY?
I REALLY NEED IT

367
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:04,958
Who is it?

368
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,375
What's the matter?

369
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:31,583
Is this Ustaz Ahmad's house?

370
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,083
Yes, that's right.

371
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,708
And you are…?

372
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:36,791
His wife.

373
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,791
I'm Ratna, Mr. Timur's daughter.

374
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,333
I'm the one he helped yesterday.

375
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:51,208
We seek forgiveness in Allah.

376
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,500
Now, let's pray.

377
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:58,166
May we never experience such a trial.

378
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,250
Amen.

379
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,000
God willing.

380
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:09,166
Thank God if you've recovered
and got back to your health.

381
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,708
Yes, that's why I came here
to say thank you, ma'am.

382
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:21,916
I don't know what would have happened
to me if Ustaz wasn't there yesterday.

383
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,250
You're welcome.

384
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,041
I'll make sure to tell my husband.

385
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,875
Also…

386
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,166
I want to give this to you.

387
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,916
I hope this money can help.

388
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,583
Please accept it, ma'am.

389
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,750
It's a token of gratitude
from me and my family.

390
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:04,708
I'll take my leave now, ma'am.

391
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,875
- Thank you, miss.
- Sure.

392
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,791
You're welcome.

393
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:02,250
Oh my God. That's a lot, Mom.

394
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,708
Of course.

395
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,791
For once, I want my daughters
to go to school with enthusiasm.

396
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,541
Nice.

397
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,708
Wow.

398
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,583
We're eating well today.

399
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:20,958
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

400
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,583
Dear God.

401
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:25,500
Yes.

402
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:30,083
Where did all this food come from, dear?

403
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,458
Turns out you were right.

404
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,083
Right about what?

405
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,833
Allah is indeed
the great provider of solutions.

406
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:40,208
- What do you mean?
- Haji Sanusi and his travel team

407
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,250
bought all our Muslim clothes
for their Umrah pilgrims.

408
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,625
Thank God.

409
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,416
- All of it?
- Thank God.

410
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,875
Yes. That's why I got a call last night.

411
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,041
After that,
they immediately transferred the money.

412
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,375
I need your permission.

413
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,666
This afternoon, I want to invite
the ladies to come to our house

414
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,708
to help with packing for the shipment.

415
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,791
Yes, go ahead, dear.

416
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,125
See? I was right.

417
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:04,458
If we believe in Allah,
there will surely be a way out.

418
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,583
Yes.

419
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:10,833
I'll call Mr. Sanusi later.

420
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,333
I want to say thank you.

421
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,333
I've already said it to him.

422
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,791
I told him when he called,

423
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,375
"Mr. Sanusi, on behalf
of the family, thank you very much."

424
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:25,750
It's done. Besides, he's busy
handling administration in Mecca.

425
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,791
So, it's all taken care of.

426
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,583
So, my issue is resolved now, right?

427
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,958
God willing, it's resolved.

428
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,416
And my exam fee?

429
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,416
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

430
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,041
Let's eat.

431
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,416
- Let's eat.
- Yes, come on.

432
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,916
- Do you want some fish?
- Sure.

433
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,333
- Here.
- Thank you.

434
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,666
You don't like vegetables?

435
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,166
We have oxtail soup.

436
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,500
What is that?

437
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,583
This is leg soup.

438
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,750
It's the same, but smaller.

439
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,000
I think we should make
this activity a regular thing.

440
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,416
Alright, Ustaz. My friends
are also helping with this.

441
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,583
That's great. Thank God.

442
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,583
- Fatih, please help later, okay?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,666
Ustaz!

444
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,666
What is it, sir?

445
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,583
- You have to come with me.
- Why?

446
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,083
Come on. It's about Mr. Timur, sir. Hurry!

447
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,833
Jok, I have to leave for a while, okay?

448
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,000
- Everyone, Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

449
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,833
Let's go, sir.

450
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,000
In the name of Allah.

451
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,791
Oh my God.

452
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,083
- There's an ambulance here?
- Yes, it is.

453
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,791
What happened?

454
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,333
Come on, Ustaz.

455
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,208
Let's go.

456
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,500
Excuse me.

457
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,791
Come inside, Ustaz.

458
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,750
Peace be upon you.

459
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,750
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

460
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,708
Microorganisms
and movements of the Eastern Sea.

461
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,416
Take notes and learn about it, okay?

462
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,916
Alright, children.

463
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,125
The lesson is over.

464
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,250
But remember,
the final exam is coming soon.

465
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,791
You need to be more enthusiastic
and study harder.

466
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,750
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

467
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:10,208
Alright, then I'll end today's lesson.

468
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,875
Good afternoon, everyone.

469
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,250
- Afternoon, sir.
- Afternoon, sir.

470
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,833
Don't go home right away.

471
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,666
Here.

472
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,500
Our problem is settled.

473
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,208
Is this real?

474
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,666
Where did you get the money from?

475
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:38,333
I thought you only sold clothes.
Turns out you're selling yourself too.

476
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:46,166
No wonder Farhan is interested in you.
You're such an easy girl.

477
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,250
Oh, Nayla.

478
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,916
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

479
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,541
Is this real?

480
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,500
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's fake.

481
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:11,875
Nayla!

482
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,791
Oh, you're home already.

483
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,541
Don't lie down like that.
You might miss prayer time.

484
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:41,250
I'm going out to deliver some goods.
Your father will be home soon too.

485
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,416
Okay.

486
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,291
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom. Be careful.

487
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,625
Finally, I can take you home.

488
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,583
So, will you be my girlfriend?

489
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,708
Why aren't you answering?

490
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,791
If you don't answer,

491
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,708
that means you agree.

492
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,083
Let's go out tonight, okay?

493
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,791
Hey.

494
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:23,083
If you stay silent again,
it means you agree.

495
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:48,833
There's still plenty of time
before Asr prayer.

496
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,333
Go to sleep.

497
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,500
Go to sleep.

498
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:13,625
Yasmin.

499
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:17,958
Yasmin.

500
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:48,708
Mom, help!

501
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,125
Mom…

502
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,041
Mom, help!

503
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,916
Mom, help!

504
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,208
Mom!

505
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:08,791
Mom!

506
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,458
Mom!

507
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,958
Mom, help!

508
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,375
Mom!

509
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,833
Mom! Mom, help!

510
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,583
Mom!

511
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,958
- Oh my God, Yasmin!
- Mom!

512
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,041
Mom!

513
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,291
What's wrong?

514
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:09,125
Mom!

515
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,708
Calm down.

516
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,875
Yes…

517
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:17,083
Mom, I'm scared.

518
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,083
Mom's here.

519
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,708
Peace be upon you.

520
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,125
Peace be upon you too.

521
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,041
Honey.

522
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,583
Yasmin was screaming
from a nightmare while choking herself.

523
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,125
I got really scared.

524
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,666
What's wrong?

525
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,708
Do you know Mr. Timur?

526
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,583
Yes.

527
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:01,791
Mr. Timur and his wife
passed away two days ago.

528
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,208
As well as their daughter Ratna.

529
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,125
They committed suicide by hanging.

530
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,708
I want to give this to you, Mrs. Sri.

531
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,958
And their bodies
were just buried this afternoon.

532
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:22,583
What's wrong?

533
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,208
That's so sad.

534
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,000
Honey…

535
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,583
If Ratna is already dead,

536
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,291
then who gave me the money last night?

537
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,083
Nayla.

538
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:59,291
Seduce him with your beauty.

539
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,583
Hi, Farhan.

540
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,833
Let's go.

541
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,000
Are you sure about this place?

542
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:51,875
Sis.

543
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,208
Want to go to school together?

544
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,250
I'll be late otherwise!

545
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,458
I'm going first. Peace be upon you.

546
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:13,666
Hi, babe.

547
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,500
Thank you.

548
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,125
You were amazing last night.

549
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,291
What did you do last night?

550
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:41,916
Sinta.

551
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:45,916
What?

552
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,250
Amazed by me?

553
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,416
Look at me.

554
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,625
I'm prettier than you.

555
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,625
And Farhan is my boyfriend now.

556
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,291
So…

557
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,500
Don't mess with me!

558
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,541
What's your problem?

559
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,708
You slut!

560
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,291
- What did you say?
- Slut.

561
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,333
Slut?

562
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,291
You're the slut.

563
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,916
You crazy girl!

564
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,583
Stop it!

565
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,000
You're crazy!

566
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,375
Enough, Sinta.

567
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,625
Are you okay?

568
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,583
You're alright, aren't you?

569
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:43,416
SUSPENSION LETTER

570
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,875
Why am I suspended?

571
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,833
Why is my skirt so short?

572
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,125
Nayla.

573
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:12,458
Nayla.

574
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,666
Wake up your sister.

575
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,750
Yasmin.

576
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:46,875
Wake up.

577
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,125
Let's pray together.

578
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,166
Okay, sis.

579
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,166
I bear witness
that there is no God but Allah,

580
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,208
and I bear witness that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah…

581
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:47,541
It hurts, sis!

582
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,333
- It hurts!
- Yasmin?

583
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,291
- What's wrong?
- Mom…

584
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:57,125
I was pushed by Nayla.

585
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,666
It hurts…

586
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,125
Nayla, what's going on?

587
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,041
I was praying.

588
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,875
May Allah grant peace upon us

589
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,166
and His righteous servants.

590
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,000
There is no God but You.

591
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,750
You are Pure,

592
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,083
and indeed I am among the wrongdoers.

593
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,083
How is it?

594
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't sense anything.

595
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,291
Are you saying I'm lying?

596
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:40,291
No, sweetie. I'm not saying you're lying.

597
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:44,958
If there were demons in this house,
I would be able to sense them.

598
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,583
I'm scared.

599
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:54,041
Sweetie, how about
if I open your spiritual vision?

600
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:58,416
You can point out where the demon is.

601
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,375
Are you brave enough?

602
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,208
- Is it safe?
- In the name of Allah.

603
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:06,625
God willing.

604
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,833
In the name of Allah.

605
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,708
O Allah, all praise is Yours.

606
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,375
To You alone

607
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,458
we complain of our hardships,

608
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:26,083
and You are our Helper.

609
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,791
There's the demon!

610
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,583
It's right there!

611
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:01,083
- That's your sister!
- That's Nayla.

612
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,416
Dad, close it again!

613
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,625
Allah is great.

614
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:07,000
Get some water for her. Now, Nayla.

615
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,416
Sweetie, that's your sister.

616
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,291
That's your sister. It's not possible.

617
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,458
Hurry up and bring the water.

618
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,458
Here you go.

619
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,708
That's not possible, sweetie.
That's your own sister.

620
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:34,500
- It's not possible.
- What do you mean it's not possible?

621
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:41,041
You yourself opened my spiritual vision.
The demon is in my sister.

622
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,375
I'm scared, Mom.

623
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,833
Yasmin.

624
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,541
You can go on ahead.

625
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,333
Okay.

626
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,583
Alright. I'll go first.

627
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,166
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

628
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:39,000
JANUARY 15 - MENSTRUATION
JANUARY 15 - NOT MENSTRUATING

629
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:57,166
NOT MENSTRUATING - TWO WEEKS

630
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm pregnant.

631
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,166
When?

632
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,125
Why aren't you answering?

633
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:35,666
BIOLOGY FOR GRADE 11

634
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,416
Bye!

635
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,208
You guys are a good match!

636
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:49,625
Bye!

637
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:15,916
Nay, are you sick?

638
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,000
Maybe just a little under the weather.

639
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,333
Have you taken any medicine?

640
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,333
Mom, Dad. I'm going to my room.

641
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,250
- Dad.
- Yasmin,

642
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,416
I've noticed you rarely pray these days.

643
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,333
Why?

644
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:45,000
I'm afraid that demon
will disturb me again.

645
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,875
Dear God.

646
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,208
If you pray, Allah will protect you.

647
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:58,000
Okay. I'm going to school now.

648
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,708
Peace be upon you, Mom.

649
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,458
- Peace be upon you too.
- Peace be upon you too.

650
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,833
And you too.

651
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:17,000
Please pay attention
to our daughters' worship.

652
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:21,416
Why are you getting angry at me?

653
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,416
The kids are grown up now.

654
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,125
Besides, they know
what's obligatory and what's not.

655
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:31,000
And if they miss it,
the sin is their own responsibility.

656
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:33,916
Why are you talking like that?

657
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,250
As parents, we need to remind them.

658
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,083
Before they get married,
we're responsible for their sins.

659
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,541
Yeah, I understand that.

660
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,208
I know.

661
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,916
Peace be upon you.

662
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:50,875
Peace be upon you.

663
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,208
Peace be upon you.

664
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,625
Peace be upon you too.

665
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,791
Mr. Iban? What's the matter?

666
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,416
Please help my child, Ustaz!

667
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,583
She's not here!

668
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:23,958
By Your name, we ward off foes
from all directions.

669
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,000
What's wrong, Ustaz?

670
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:29,291
Your recitations don't work anymore?

671
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,666
Striking them…

672
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,375
- What's wrong, Ustaz?
- with stones of baked clay.

673
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,875
- Are you not being heard anymore?
- And He made them like chewed-up leaves.

674
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:47,750
You will no longer be able
to disturb us anymore.

675
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:52,791
Your prayers now are no different
than the disbelievers'!

676
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,875
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

677
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,041
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

678
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:30,666
Peace be upon you, Ustaz.

679
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,833
Peace be upon you too.

680
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:37,750
I was just about to go to your house
to bring you some food.

681
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,500
Thank God.

682
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,916
I'm a free man now, sir. Please take this.

683
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:47,041
Don't worry, I bought it with halal money.

684
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:50,958
Thank God, I'll gladly accept it.

685
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:55,458
It'll be a blessing when we bought
our food with halal money.

686
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:00,583
What are the consequences if we eat
food bought with haram money?

687
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:04,125
When Allah forbids something,
there's surely a wisdom behind it.

688
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:11,708
What happens if we buy
our food with haram money…

689
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,166
Excuse me beforehand.

690
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:18,750
But all the food we eat
will not turn into flesh.

691
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:23,000
Instead, it will become
hellfire within us.

692
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,333
And lastly…

693
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,500
our prayers will not be accepted.

694
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,208
Peace be upon you, Ustaz.

695
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:43,125
- Peace be upon you too.
- Peace be upon you too.

696
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,166
I'll take my leave now, Ustaz.

697
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,875
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

698
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:52,125
- Mr. Ruslan, thanks again.
- You're welcome.

699
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,583
Just got back from Mecca, sir?

700
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,583
No, I did not.

701
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:03,625
But you bought all the Muslim clothes
from my shop, right?

702
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,291
Maybe it was someone else, sir.

703
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:09,000
I'll go inside now.

704
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,333
Allah is great.

705
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:17,333
There is no god but Allah.

706
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,208
Sri!

707
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,666
What is it, Dad?

708
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,083
Where's your mother?

709
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,375
Can you lower your voice?
Do you have to yell like that?

710
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,208
What have you done, Sri?

711
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,208
What do you mean?

712
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,750
Where did you get all that money from?

713
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:45,250
That money for Nayla's compensation.
For Yasmin's school.

714
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,875
To buy our food.

715
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:49,375
And money to buy your new phone.

716
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:50,916
Where did it come from?

717
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,291
Answer me!

718
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,250
- Don't just stay silent!
- It's…

719
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,833
What is it? Answer me!

720
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,916
Peace be upon you.

721
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,041
Answer me, Sri.

722
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,750
Sis!

723
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:07,916
Sis!

724
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:11,791
- Sis!
- Nayla!

725
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,125
- Nayla?
- Nayla.

726
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,958
- Wake up!
- Let's bring her to her room.

727
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,625
- Come on.
- Okay.

728
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:27,541
- Yasmin. Get some water for Nayla.
- Yes, Mom.

729
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,125
Nayla?

730
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,708
Nayla?

731
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,458
Honey.

732
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,791
Come outside with me.

733
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,458
You haven't answered my question.

734
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,625
I'm sorry.

735
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:26,500
That money wasn't from Haji Sanusi.

736
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,083
I received it from Ratna. I'm sorry.

737
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,291
I'm so sorry.

738
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,625
Forgive me.

739
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,666
I'm sorry.

740
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,875
Sorry.

741
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:06,958
I forgive you.

742
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,125
I forgive you.

743
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,500
I have to go now.

744
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,666
There's something I need to settle.

745
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,125
- Yasmin.
- Yes?

746
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:45,125
Take care of your sister and mother.

747
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,625
Yes, Dad.

748
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,583
Take care of the children, okay?

749
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,416
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

750
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:14,625
Sis.

751
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,666
- Mom…
- Sis?

752
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:25,833
Mom, Nayla's awake.

753
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,750
- Mom.
- Mom.

754
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,833
Nayla.

755
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,833
- What's wrong?
- Mom…

756
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:38,458
- Forgive me.
- Why?

757
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,416
I…

758
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:46,166
I'm pregnant.

759
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,208
Nayla.

760
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,750
Nayla.

761
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,583
Forgive me.

762
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:10,000
Forgive me, Nayla.

763
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,416
Forgive me, sweetheart.

764
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:27,916
Peace be upon you.

765
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,958
Mr. Anhar?

766
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,166
Mr. Anhar?

767
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh my God.

768
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:39,708
Dear God!

769
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,000
Ustaz…

770
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,208
Help…

771
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,875
Mr. Anhar?

772
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,833
Sir?

773
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,375
It's all my fault.

774
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,041
What do you mean?

775
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,958
All this mess is my fault.

776
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:41,916
Ever since I've started working
with Mr. Timur, I already knew, sir.

777
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:51,583
Mr. Timur's family got all their wealth
from a deal with the devil.

778
01:11:53,833 --> 01:12:00,458
In return, the devil would take
their child when she turned 18 years old.

779
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,083
I didn't know

780
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:24,375
that the money I received
would affect my family,

781
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:27,500
just like Mr. Timur's family.

782
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:42,291
Allah is great.

783
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:45,708
To Allah we belong,
and to Him we will return.

784
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,250
Next is you and your family, Ahmad.

785
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:56,583
Because your wife
has accepted Timur's money.

786
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:12,791
I have killed them all.

787
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,583
They all deserved to die.

788
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,208
Including you and your family.

789
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,416
In the name of Allah,

790
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,208
with whose mention nothing
on earth or in the heavens

791
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,083
can cause harm. He is the All-Hearing…

792
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,291
You are not being heard anymore, Ahmad!

793
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:41,041
Oh Allah, forgive
this negligent servant of Yours.

794
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:50,208
O Allah, the Almighty, indeed,

795
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,666
- Stop!
- I have been defeated,

796
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,000
so grant me Your help,

797
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,416
comfort

798
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,833
- Stop!
- this shattered heart.

799
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,041
Suffice me, O Self-Sufficient One,

800
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,833
for I am a servant in need.

801
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,583
And sufficient is Allah
as the One who helps,

802
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:18,583
and sufficient is Allah
as the Giver of aid.

803
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,416
And sufficient is Allah
as the Giver of aid.

804
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,458
And sufficient is Allah
as the Giver of aid.

805
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,041
Leave this place, you cursed being!

806
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,541
Allah is great!

807
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,166
Allah is great.

808
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,541
To Allah we belong,
and to Him we will return.

809
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,458
Dear God.

810
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:28,000
Yasmin.

811
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,833
I'm sorry.

812
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,958
I'm the one causing problems.

813
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,791
I've sinned.

814
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,583
Forgive me, please.

815
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,416
It's okay, sis, don't worry.

816
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:57,958
This is all your fault, Sri.

817
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,625
Hypocrite!

818
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,625
What's that sound?

819
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,250
What's that?

820
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,416
Come here.

821
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:45,750
Let's go.

822
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:19,125
Mom, what are you doing, Mom?

823
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:21,875
Yasmin.

824
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,791
Nayla.

825
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,791
Today is the day you die!

826
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,125
Sis!

827
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:36,000
No!

828
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,500
Sis!

829
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:38,750
Come on, Sis!

830
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:39,666
No!

831
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,291
Sis!

832
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:44,000
Let's run!

833
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:49,166
That way!

834
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,083
Mom…

835
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Mom!

836
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,708
A whore like you
doesn't deserve to call me mom!

837
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:13,833
Snap out of it, Mom!

838
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,583
Die, Yasmin!

839
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:21,916
Mom?

840
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,708
Nayla.

841
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:25,041
Mom?

842
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,375
Your mother is dead!

843
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:40,166
Sis!

844
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,666
Sis!

845
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:54,291
In the name of Allah. Say,
"I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind,

846
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,583
Master of humankind, God of humankind,
from the evil of the lurking whisperer,

847
01:18:56,666 --> 01:19:00,083
who whispers evil into the heart
of mankind, from among jinn and mankind."

848
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:11,500
Don't worry.

849
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:15,166
You won't die now.

850
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,166
I still need you.

851
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,625
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

852
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:15,875
To Allah we belong,
and to Him we will return.

853
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,250
Who did this?

854
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:33,625
The demon, Dad.

855
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,500
Dad!

856
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,708
Dad, that's Mom!

857
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,250
Dad!

858
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,541
That's Mom!

859
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:05,375
That's Mom!

860
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,208
That's Mom!

861
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:52,375
Mom!

862
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,708
Mom!

863
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,125
BRUTAL MURDER DUE TO SUPERNATURAL WHISPERS

864
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:17,041
The defendant
has been found guilty of murder

865
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,041
and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

866
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:21,000
CLAIMING TO RECEIVE SATAN'S WHISPERS
AND ENDED UP MURDERING HIS OWN WIFE

867
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,625
Mr. Ahmad, someone is here to see you.

868
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,500
Please come in.

869
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,583
- Yasmin.
- Your visiting time is ten minutes.

870
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,583
Thank you.

871
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,750
Are you healthy, Dad?

872
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:44,875
Thank God.

873
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:46,833
Thank God.

874
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,000
You've lost weight?

875
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,625
No, maybe it's because
I'm wearing Nayla's clothes.

876
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:06,875
I'm in high school now,

877
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:11,541
and today is my first day of school.

878
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm sorry that I can't take you
on your first day of school.

879
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:25,875
God willing, you'll be strong, okay?

880
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:28,291
It's okay.

881
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:33,583
I've already made many new friends today.

882
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,708
I'm so sorry.

883
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:50,958
Because of my mistake,
our family is ruined.

884
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,166
Because of my mistake…

885
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,416
you're living alone now.

886
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,375
I'm sorry, sweetie.

887
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:04,750
No.

888
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,916
No, Dad.

889
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:11,291
It's not just you, but me too.

890
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:16,583
I wasn't grateful enough
when our family was still complete.

891
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,375
But don't worry, Dad.

892
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:31,875
I always remember what you often say.

893
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,416
Allah will always protect
and guard His people

894
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,375
if we are pious and keep our faith, right?

895
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,666
God willing.

896
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:47,541
Dad.

897
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:52,041
When can we be together again?

898
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,750
Take good care of yourself, sweetie.

899
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,500
I have to go back.

900
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,791
Peace be upon you.

901
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,333
Peace be upon you too.

902
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,291
Ahmad.

903
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,458
How does it feel
to be ruined and defeated?

904
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:47,916
Left to rot alone here?

905
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:04,583
There is no power except with God.

906
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,875
In the name of Allah.
