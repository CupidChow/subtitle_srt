1
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Is anybody there?

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,060
Open the door quickly!

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,400
Open up!

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Yunniang!

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
Yunniang is missing!

6
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,759
Sister!

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
Sister!

8
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,960
I searched everywhere for Yunniang.

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,520
Sister,

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,010
but she was nowhere to be found.

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,840
Until one day,

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I saw Scholar Yang on the street.

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Why are you here again?

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,920
Weren't you forbidden to come?

15
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,120
That's when I learned

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
that the normally well-dressed scholar

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,640
was actually a gambling addict in private.

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,320
Yunniang's disappearance

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
must be connected to him.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,930
It didn't take long for me to figure out

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,480
it was him.

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,980
To get gambling money,

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,770
he sold Yunniang to the gambling house owner.

24
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
The gambling house owner, to bribe the county officials,

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,200
gave Yun Niang to Secretary Zhao.

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
My poor sister

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,040
survived only a few days under Secretary Zhao

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
before being tortured to death.

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,450
How could I swallow this anger?

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,810
They deserve to die.

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,440
But why use such means

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
and sacrifice yourself too?

33
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
As long as I can avenge my sister,

34
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,280
I don't care what happens to me.

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,600
This is the only keepsake my sister left me.

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
Sister.

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Niaoniao won't be with you anymore.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,320
Don't be afraid.

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Kill her.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
Kill her.

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
She's the real culprit.

42
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,540
Innkeeper,

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,020
what's wrong with her?

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Kill her!

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
She's the one to blame.

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,320
Kill her!

47
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,080
Watch out!

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,540
Innkeeper!

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
Are you alright?

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,540
Innkeeper!

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,480
Yunniang is already gone.

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
It's time for you to let go.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
What an adorable little pig!

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
Look how tiny it is,

55
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,960
and chubby,

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
and so delightful!

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
It's a good omen.

58
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,000
Why don't we keep it

59
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,250
and raise it at home?

60
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,400
This girl is really in trouble.

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
She's quite pitiful.

62
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,280
Let's help her.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
Silly girl.

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,050
You're still young.

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
You'll have to get married when you grow up.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
Sister.

67
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,800
Sister.

68
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,880
Sister.

69
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,840
Sister.

70
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,600
Sister.

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
Sister.

72
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,920
Boss,

73
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
you're back.

74
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,680
What?

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
Did I disappoint you?

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,680
Boss,

77
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,400
I was wrong.

78
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Who put you up to this?

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
How did you know?

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,320
As if your pig brain could come up with this.

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,930
Go back and get some rest first.

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,880
Boss.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,960
It's over.

84
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,660
The innkeeper wouldn't really let me die, would he?

85
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,440
Take a good rest.

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,480
Wait.

87
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Let me lean on you.

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,300
Are you still feeling unwell?

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,159
I'm tired.

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
This is Fengxin's favorite thing.

91
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
Fengxin.

92
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,800
Sister.

93
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Sister,

94
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,440
where are you?

95
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm so scared,

96
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Fengxin.

97
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Sister.

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,400
Fengxin.

99
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,080
Sister.

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,280
Sister.

101
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Sister.

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
What is this?

103
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,570
What have you prepared?

104
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Sister.

105
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,520
This is so beautiful,

106
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,800
I love it so much.

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Look, Sister.

108
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,360
Fengxin.

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
Fengxin.

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,720
Fengxin,

111
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,760
I can't find you anymore.

112
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Fengxin.

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Sister.

115
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,840
Sister,

116
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
I have never blamed you.

117
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
You need to be well

118
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
and live on.

119
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm sorry,

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,720
it's my fault for not protecting you.

121
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
You're awake.

122
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,210
Are you feeling better?

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm hungry.

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,970
Why are you wrapping so slowly?

125
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
You do it then.

126
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,490
It's delicious.

127
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Aren't you eating?

128
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Why are you grinning at me like that?

129
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,760
Boss.

130
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,770
You're actually being understanding of others now.

131
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm not holding a grudge against Zhu Niaoniao.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,380
It's because I know she was being used

133
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,200
and is not the real culprit.

134
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
Then who's behind her?

135
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Dugu Qiongqi.

136
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
Dugu Qiongqi.

137
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,520
The one from a thousand years ago

138
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,920
who turned us against each other.

139
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
What are you thinking about?

140
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,600
Don't worry.

141
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,180
I'll take care of everything.

142
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Let's eat now.

143
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,560
Qin Qi

144
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,400
Dugu Qiongqi

145
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,690
Dongfang

146
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,120
What brings you here?

147
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
We've been friends for so many years.

148
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Just came to see you.

149
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,640
Do I need an appointment?

150
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,700
At least you still have a conscience.

151
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,380
Have a seat.

152
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
What would you like to drink?

153
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,900
You've been quite busy lately, haven't you?

154
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,490
I have been rather busy,

155
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,700
but since you're here, I'll make sure to treat you well.

156
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,680
Busy using Zhu Niaoniao?

157
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Dugu Qiongqi.

158
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,490
What did you say?

159
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,560
Am I wrong?

160
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,170
What should I call you then?

161
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,320
Qin Qi?

162
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Or Dugu Qiongqi?

163
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Did you remember something?

164
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,060
Underestimating your enemy leads to disaster.

165
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,500
It won't happen again.

166
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,450
What are you talking about?

167
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,260
You really don't remember me?

168
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,770
You're the one in black who's been causing trouble, aren't you?

169
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
What exactly do you want?

170
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,280
So many years have passed.

171
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,180
How do you have one too?

172
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,650
This is the Huangquan Pendant.

173
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
In other words,

174
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,760
it is us.

175
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,090
So you don't need to hate me.

176
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,340
You think I would believe you?

177
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
There's only this much work every day.

178
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,210
Why should I do more work

179
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
while you just sit here?

180
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
You don't do anything.

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,160
I won't do it.

182
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,250
Why should I?

183
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
You're already so fat.

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,400
What's wrong with doing some work?

185
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Who's fat?

186
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,480
You are.

187
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,400
You are.

188
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,880
Only you are fat.

189
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,240
You're fat.

190
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,570
You're definitely fat.

191
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,920
Boss.

192
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,480
Boss.

193
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,880
Why are you dressed like a celebrity today?

194
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
The flatterer was right.

195
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,560
But if I wore this outfit,

196
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
I'd look as beautiful as a goddess.

197
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,360
Give me a break.

198
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
How annoying.

199
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,610
Where is Dongfang Zhaobai?

200
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,040
Sir.

201
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,930
Mr. Dongfang left early this morning.

202
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
He left?

203
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
Why didn't he tell me?

204
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,380
What are you thinking?

205
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,720
It couldn't be...
