1
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
So what do we do next?

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
Infiltrate their ranks.

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,600
How?

4
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,280
Aren't you the cautious one

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,400
who thinks of everything?

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
Think of something quick.

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Let me put my brilliant mind to work.

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,479
Let me think...

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Maybe I could apply to be a cook.

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
My culinary skills are exceptional after all.

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,930
Can't you be more original?

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,180
We're not making a cooking show here.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,280
You think of something.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,080
Let me know when you have an idea.

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
Hey! What are you doing?

16
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,250
You've dirtied my clothes!

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,130
What's the meaning of this?

18
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,800
Help!

19
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Help! Someone's beating me!

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,060
Innkeeper!

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Feiye!

22
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,540
Stop hitting me, husband!

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,360
You'll beat me to death!

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,760
What's happening?

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,360
Help me!

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
My husband is trying to kill me!

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,160
Feiye!

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,570
Ouch!

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,680
Alright, alright, take it easy.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,340
Wait, wait.

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,240
Li Wubai.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,920
Now both human and demon realms are in chaos.

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
You, a grown man,

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
not only refuse to serve your country,

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,320
but only know how to bully women at home.

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,650
What kind of man are you?

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,640
Hey, wait!

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,280
Hey, Feiye!

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,340
If you speak again,

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,120
I'll cut out your tongue.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,660
Sister,

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
where are you all going?

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Could you spare my life

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,329
and take me with you?

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
We're on a mission

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,640
and it's really not convenient.

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,240
Please, I'm begging you.

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,640
If I go back with him, he'll beat me to death.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Xiao Liu,

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
we came out here

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,650
to do something important.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
That's right.

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,040
Taking in such a burden,

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,660
what's that about?

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
Please.

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,520
Fine.

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,690
Get up first.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
You can ride in my carriage.

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,890
But you can't leave my side.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,260
We're on a mission,

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,260
and you can't move around freely.

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,500
Thank you, sister.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,400
Yiyi,

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,530
what should we do with this man?

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,330
Tie him up

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,320
and throw him in the carriage too.

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Out here in the wilderness,

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
he might get eaten by wolves.

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,980
Find a suitable place up ahead

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,060
to drop him off.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,050
Sister, you have no idea

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,460
I thought getting married

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
would give me lifelong support.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,860
But unexpectedly,

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,520
that's when the good days came to an end.

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,530
Don't worry.

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,620
Take your time.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,960
This scoundrel

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,410
is an expert at drinking, gambling, and womanizing.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Whenever he's broke, he comes home to clean me out.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm just a woman,

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,460
how could I have enough money to support him?

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,640
And now,

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,380
he beats me whenever he runs out of money.

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,680
You're such a good actor,

86
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,680
you should join Mei Jiulang's theater troupe.

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,640
My mother-in-law is no better.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have to wait on her every day

89
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,060
and she constantly makes me stand at attention.

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,530
Because I haven't given birth to a boy,

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,200
I've endured countless cold shoulders.

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,280
Why didn't you leave him earlier?

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
I wanted to!

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
That's why I ran away.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
But I keep getting dragged back,

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,960
and the beatings get worse every time they catch me.

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,600
Wu Hu.

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,530
You're way too timid

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
and unworthy of being one of the Four Masters.

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,860
Our job is already living on the edge,

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,120
yet you're afraid of ghosts?

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,600
This money isn't for wandering spirits.

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,880
This place is dangerous.

104
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,680
If I die in this foreign land,

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,720
I doubt anyone will pay tribute to me next year.

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,159
So,

107
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm leaving something for myself to remember.

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,159
Hahaha!

109
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,240
What's all this noise?

110
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,370
I'm trying to sleep.

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,020
Shut up, all of you.

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,970
If I hear such talk again...

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Get out now.

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,770
Mr. Chen,

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
we need to get going.

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Forget it.

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,700
Did I say something wrong?

118
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
In this business, we follow certain rules.

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,080
Don't wash your face,

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,940
be able to cook,

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
be good at weaving mats,

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,010
and avoid women.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,210
The first three rules are fine.

124
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,400
But now we're taking in this woman on our cart.

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,460
What's that about?

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
It's damn bad luck.

127
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,820
Chen Jiang.

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
You're beating around the bush.

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,570
If you think I'm not fit to lead you,

130
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,200
then fight me.

131
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,760
If you win,

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
I, Liu Yiyi,

133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,970
will be at your command.

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,210
Liu Yiyi,

135
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,260
let me tell you,

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,280
you're being too soft-hearted.

137
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
Keeping these two useless people...

138
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,380
They'll drag us down sooner or later.

139
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,600
Chen.

140
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,159
Stop it.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,520
Among the four of us, whether it's fighting skills

142
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,250
or strategy,

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
none of us can match Yiyi.

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,560
Delivering the tribute is crucial.

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,090
We can't afford any more internal conflicts.

146
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,410
Is Yiyi alright?

147
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,020
Don't take Chen's words to heart.

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
He's just a rough man.

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,690
This Chen Jiang may seem tough.

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,840
In fact, he's just a reckless, brainless fool.

151
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,120
As for this Li Wubai,

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,130
According to what you said,

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,730
he must be the one hiding the deepest secrets.

154
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,460
He's Liu Yiyi's lover,

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,640
using her trust to frame her.

156
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,140
We must be on guard.

157
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,560
To be honest,

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
I don't want Liu Yiyi

159
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,480
to suffer through that painful experience again.

160
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
But our purpose this time

161
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,220
is to uncover the whole truth.

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
We can only observe for now,

163
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,120
act when the time is right,

164
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
and not interfere with the outcome.

165
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,860
Then we can only take it one step at a time.

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
Shangguan Feiye, I'm warning you,

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
stop slandering my reputation.

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
All that talk about me being heartless and abusive,

169
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,370
stop labeling me like that.

170
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
That depends on your behavior.

171
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,760
After all, I now have Liu Yiyi

172
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,020
as my powerful backer.

173
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,080
She's not here now.

174
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,410
You'd better watch out.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,730
You're back.

176
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:18,920
Miss,

177
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
you're awake.

178
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
You heartless man,

179
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,890
you're still alive?

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,200
Thanks to your blessing.

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm still barely surviving.

182
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Miss.

183
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
Just call me Feiye.

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Thank you for taking me in yesterday.

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,820
I don't know your name yet.

186
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,920
I am Liu Yiyi.

187
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Yiyi.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,730
Sister Yiyi.

189
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,920
How much longer until we arrive?

190
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
My bones

191
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,160
are about to fall apart from all this bumping.

192
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,440
Just hold on for two more days.

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,320
We've already reached Hulu Ridge.

194
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Another 10 miles west is Mijin Pass.

195
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,800
Once we get there,

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,730
we'll be close to our destination.

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,640
However,

198
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm a wanderer

199
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,680
with no fixed abode.

200
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,260
After I deliver the goods,

201
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,570
After I complete the delivery,

202
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll be heading far away.

203
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,290
Following me isn't a good plan for you.

204
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,970
What are your plans for the future?

205
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,170
What did you just say

206
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
about Mijin Port?

207
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh no, I'm done for!

208
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
Mijin Port is my wife's hometown.

209
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,890
If I go there,

210
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,490
I'll be beaten to death!

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,040
Right.

212
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,480
Once we get there, I can find my way home.

213
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,480
For these few days,

214
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,140
I'll have to trouble you to take care of me, Yiyi.

215
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,890
However,

216
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
from what that gentleman just said,

217
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,290
it seems we've caused you quite some trouble.

218
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,120
It's fine.

219
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,560
Don't worry about it.

220
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm in charge here.

221
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Besides, we're just making a delivery.

222
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,560
One more person won't make any difference.

223
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,580
What's wrong with you?

224
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,890
Are you okay?

225
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,140
None of your business.

226
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,880
Yiyi,

227
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,570
are you feeling unwell?

228
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
It's nothing.

229
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
Probably just not used to

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
being away from home.

231
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
But forcing yourself like this isn't good.

232
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,500
The journey isn't urgent.

233
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,420
You'd better rest for a while.

234
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,960
Ouch!

235
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,560
Ow!

236
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
My butt hurts so much!

237
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,890
Oh, we've been walking for so long.

238
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,800
Miss,

239
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
can we stop for a moment?

240
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,160
I need to relieve myself.

241
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,820
Stop the carriage.

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,170
Set up camp here.

243
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,890
We'll continue our journey tomorrow.

244
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
I told you

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,690
traveling with women is such a hassle.

246
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,580
Enough.

247
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
We've been traveling for so long.

248
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,180
Everyone is tired,

249
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,780
we should take a break.

250
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,450
Yiyi.

251
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,730
How are you feeling?

252
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,040
Is your illness acting up again?

253
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Wubai,

254
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,520
please give me some more medicine.

255
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:37,880
No.

256
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,760
Taking medicine so frequently

257
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,420
will be too much for your body.

258
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
This is not the place to talk.

259
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,930
Meet me by the river after dark.

260
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,080
What?

261
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Didn't I tell you to wait for me here?

262
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,980
What are you doing?

263
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,840
Darling.

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,600
I understand what you mean.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Let's make up.

266
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,720
Are you crazy?

267
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,170
There's someone behind us.

268
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,380
What were you about to say?

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,130
I was saying that

270
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,680
Liu Yiyi wasn't having an attack.

271
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
She was poisoned.

272
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,240
Poisoned?

273
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,600
There's a wound on the back of her neck

274
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,800
caused by a Southern Red Spider needle.

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,060
It's normally a slow-acting poison,

276
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,440
but if the poisoned person happens to fight with someone,

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,320
their heart rhythm becomes chaotic

278
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,650
and the poison takes effect immediately.

279
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,400
Chen Jiang must have poisoned her.

280
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,860
He first provoked Liu Yiyi

281
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,660
and then seized the chance to poison her.

282
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
But Chen Jiang isn't a meticulous planner.

283
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,330
Someone must be behind him.

284
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,250
Could it be Li Wubai?

285
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,660
If it really is him,

286
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,980
Liu Yiyi is truly pitiful,

287
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,780
betrayed by the person she loves.

288
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,840
In that case,

289
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,570
you two make quite a good match.

290
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,600
Li Wubai plotted against Liu Yiyi,

291
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,060
and I...

292
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
Let's not waste time here.

293
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
We need to hurry back.

294
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,370
Who knows how Liu Yiyi is doing now.

295
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,400
Just tell me, do you still have feelings for her?
