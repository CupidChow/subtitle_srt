1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,289
Tickets are hard to get.

2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,810
It'll be tough for us to sneak in today.

3
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,080
Nonsense.

4
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,920
I, Shangguan Feiye, can go wherever I want.

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,690
Let's go.

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,660
Can't you fly anymore?

7
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
My spiritual powers suddenly stopped working.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Is that a problem?

9
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh no!

10
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Then we came here for nothing.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,730
What do you mean 'for nothing'?

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,020
As my subordinate,

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,200
you need to solve this problem

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,720
right now.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,760
I can't fly either.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,440
Useless.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,490
This useless person thinks

18
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
we don't necessarily have to fly in.

19
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
Look at this fabric.

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
How sturdy it is!

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't you think?

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,660
Yes, it's nice.

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,770
Let me check over there.

24
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
What?

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,130
Let's go.

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
Wonton noodles.

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,640
Sir.

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,080
Customer.

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Two bowls of wonton noodles,

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
one without green onions,

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,080
and one without chili.

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Coming right up!

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,890
Please have a seat, sir.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
This way, please.

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
So this is your brilliant plan?

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,280
First, leisurely shopping,

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,940
and then eating noodles here?

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,640
Well,

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,440
it's mealtime now,

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,900
so eating is the priority.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,480
Since we've come all this way,

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
we should definitely try these pure,

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
additive-free delicacies.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
I don't have time to sit here eating with you.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
If you can't think of a solution,

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,620
I'll figure it out myself.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,820
The best is yet to come.

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,640
After we finish eating, I'll tell you my plan.

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,079
Okay?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Hurry up.

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
This wonton noodle soup

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
should be enjoyed by two people together

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,860
to truly savor its flavor.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,400
I never expected the famous Dongfang Zhaobai

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
would actually cook by himself.

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,240
Cough cough.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,480
Is it that bad?

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,980
It's quite delicious,

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
just a bit...

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
You like wonton noodles

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,140
but not spicy food.

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,700
Dongfang Zhaobai,

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
are you secretly keeping track of my preferences?

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Don't talk while eating.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,700
Are you going to eat or not?

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,980
Have this bowl.

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,380
You should eat too.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Wonton noodles should definitely be enjoyed by two people together

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,530
to truly appreciate the taste.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,180
Try it quickly.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,960
Don't talk while eating.

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
I wasn't talking.

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
Why aren't you eating?

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,090
I'm full.

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,740
That was quick.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm done.

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,050
Now let's talk about your plan.

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,580
Be careful.

79
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,610
Watch your step.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,540
So this is your method?

81
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,400
I've already figured everything out.

82
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,040
The garden is hosting a big feast today and they're short-handed.

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,560
They've hired extra help from outside.

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
A couple buying vegetables could easily slip in.

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
No one would notice.

86
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,940
Who said I'm your wife?

87
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,980
Then father and daughter.

88
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,440
Take this.

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,700
Be careful.

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,400
Hey!

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,770
What are you doing here?

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
We're here to deliver vegetables.

93
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
Delivering vegetables?

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
Why do you look so familiar?

95
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,880
Sir,

96
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
Whenever there's a show here,

97
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,440
we always come to deliver vegetables.

98
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,970
That's why I look familiar.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Who is she?

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,680
My wife.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Your wife?

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,400
My spouse.

103
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,760
You've been working so hard lately, my dear.

104
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,890
You've lost weight.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,160
As long as you and our child can have a good life,

106
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,560
Alright, alright.

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

109
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,960
Get inside quickly.

110
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Come right back out after you drop it off.

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't offend the distinguished guests.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,860
Yes, of course.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,380
Innkeeper,

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
your acting skills are quite impressive.

115
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
Likewise.

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,220
Stop hitting me, senior brother.

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,060
I was wrong.

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Senior brother,

119
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,730
I really didn't mean to.

120
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
What kind of trash

121
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
do you dare give me to use?

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Senior brother,

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,530
when I got to Yunzhi House, they were already closed.

124
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,240
But these days,

125
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,960
your throat isn't well.

126
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,480
Why don't

127
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,800
I perform tonight's show

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
in your place?

129
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
So that's what you're after.

130
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
Senior brother!

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,919
Please don't!

132
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,970
Senior brother!

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,929
Senior brother!

134
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
It's okay.

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,700
It doesn't matter.

136
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,220
As long as I can stay in the garden,

137
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
someday,

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,680
eventually,

139
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
I will definitely perform on stage.

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
Let's follow and see.

141
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,940
Where is everyone?

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm hungry again.

143
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,610
Mind your own business.

144
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait a moment.

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,860
So you can cook too?

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Let me show you

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
the skills of a culinary master.

148
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,360
I may not be able to fly

149
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,080
or fight,

150
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
but when it comes to cooking,

151
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,180
I'm naturally gifted.

152
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,140
Innkeeper!

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,860
Innkeeper!

154
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,130
Fengxin!

155
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,200
Fengxin!

156
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Fengxin!

157
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Fengxin!

158
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Fengxin!

159
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
Fengxin!

160
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Wake up!

161
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,520
Feiye!

162
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,800
Feiye!

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,010
Innkeeper, wake up!

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
Innkeeper!

165
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
Innkeeper, are you alright?

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,580
There's something wrong with the water.

167
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,960
Excuse me.

168
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
It's you.

169
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,080
We're here to deliver vegetables.

170
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
We were passing by

171
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,120
and got terribly hungry,

172
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
so we made some food.

173
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,040
Young man,

174
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,600
would you like to join us?

175
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,360
Is that okay?

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
Of course.

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,120
By the way,

178
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,610
I forgot to tell you.

179
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,200
You can call me

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
Su Huasheng.

181
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,720
Su Huasheng.

182
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,130
Have you been training here since childhood?

183
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,320
All apprentices here are orphans.

184
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
I was five years old

185
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,940
when our troupe master took me in.

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
I do odd jobs and learn skills in the theater

187
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
just to get by.

188
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,130
What about Mei Jiulang?

189
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,340
He's a star performer now.

190
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,440
The entire Ruichun Theater

191
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,300
depends on Master Mei to survive.

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,800
Haven't you ever thought about performing on stage

193
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,530
and becoming someone like him?

194
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
I don't have that talent.

195
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,140
I just empty chamber pots,

196
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,680
run errands and make deliveries,

197
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,840
just to earn my keep.

198
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Is Mei Jiulang

199
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,440
good to you all?

200
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,440
He's my senior.

201
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,740
He used to be nice to me.

202
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,960
When I was too busy,

203
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
he would save food for me.

204
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,240
However,

205
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,700
after becoming a star,

206
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,960
he changed.

207
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,400
When he's happy, he gives us a few coins.

208
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,060
When he's upset, he has the troupe master beat us

209
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
until he feels better.

210
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Don't just stare at me.

211
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,260
Please eat too.

212
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,440
Boss,

213
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
when you stabbed him with your sword back then,

214
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,820
you let him off too easily.

215
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,980
This is really delicious.

216
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,200
I really hope you could stay and cook at the theater.

217
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,930
They would definitely love your cooking skills.

218
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,160
That's great.

219
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,650
Would it be possible

220
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,720
for you to introduce us to the troupe master?

221
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
That's fine.

222
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,560
However,

223
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,720
I don't have much influence.

224
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm not sure if he will agree.

225
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,500
What are you doing?

226
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Don't move.
