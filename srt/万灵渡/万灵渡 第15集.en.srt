1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
There are thick calluses on his fingertips.

2
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,120
Could he be a gambler?

3
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
Please let me in, young man.

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,320
This time,

5
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm sure I can turn the tables.

6
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,880
Get lost!

7
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,120
You still haven't paid back

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,400
the money you borrowed from our gambling house.

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll give you three more days.

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
If you don't pay up,

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,740
we'll take your daughter as payment.

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,960
Now scram!

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,880
Young master!

14
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,740
Please come in,

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
we have all kinds of entertainment inside.

16
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Please, this way.

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,460
Get out of here!

18
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Let's follow and see.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
This place is full of all sorts of people.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,660
I'll take the lead.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,360
Hurry up!

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
Place your bets!

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
This luck is killing me!

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,200
Ah, good!

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,400
So,

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,660
want to try a round?

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
You know how to do this?

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,079
What did you think?

29
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,680
How else would I have spent

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,600
my thousand years of boredom?

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
This is interesting.

32
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,240
Let's go.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,760
Impressive, innkeeper.

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,920
Honored guests,

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,520
the Silver Room is upstairs.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,329
What does Silver Room mean?

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
It's where they receive VIP customers.

38
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,610
This is our deputy manager.

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
Esteemed guests,

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,320
you were quite impressive downstairs,

41
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,440
making quite a scene.

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,260
So you're the innkeeper here?

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,320
To be precise, I'm the second manager.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,250
Where is your head manager?

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Tell me the truth.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Otherwise I might not control my strength.

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,200
This brush

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,460
will come down.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Please calm down.

50
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,520
I swear

51
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm not lying.

52
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,160
Our manager passed away three months ago.

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,760
This gambling house is running normally.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
You're saying

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,240
the manager is dead?

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Exactly.

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,290
Who would believe that?

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,800
I swear.

59
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,720
If I tell a single lie,

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,460
may I die a terrible death.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
A terrible death.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Three months ago,

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
the manager said he wanted to remarry.

64
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
He went back to his hometown for the wedding

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,930
and never returned.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,530
And then?

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,760
The messenger who came back said

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
on the wedding night,

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,850
he was found dead in bed,

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
before dawn.

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,000
So he just abandoned such a big gambling house?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm puzzled too.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,160
Our manager used to be obsessed with money.

74
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
To keep this gambling house running,

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
he often bribed Mr. Zhao from the county office.

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,200
But to remarry,

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,000
he gave up his business.

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
Mr. Zhao?

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,680
What?

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,210
You said Clerk Zhao is dead?

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
When did this happen?

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Just two months ago.

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,320
He kept a mistress in the south of the city.

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,650
A few days later, he died in her courtyard.

85
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,159
It's about a woman again.

86
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,170
Do you know what this mistress looks like?

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,060
I caught a glimpse of her once.

88
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,880
Oval face.

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,200
Big eyes.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Fair skin.

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,770
And quite young.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Could it be her?

93
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,560
Who?

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,160
No.

95
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,090
It's her.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,920
Who is it?

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,140
Innkeeper?

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Thank you.

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,860
Innkeeper.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Zhu Niaoniao.

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,690
I don't know you.

102
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,090
Get away from me.

103
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
For Yun Niang's sake,

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
you've suffered a lot, haven't you?

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Scholar Yang,

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,240
the gambling house manager,

107
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,490
and Secretary Zhao -

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,690
they all died because of Yun Niang, right?

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,770
What exactly happened?

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,290
Don't worry,

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,900
we're here to help you.

112
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
At first...

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,200
Hey!

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,960
I've been waiting forever,

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
why are you so late?

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,400
Ma'am,

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm sorry,

118
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,090
I was delayed on the way.

119
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,960
Didn't we agree on three pigs?

120
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
Why is one missing?

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
You must have miscounted.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
There are three right here.

123
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
Don't try to fool me.

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,040
Let me tell you,

125
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,500
I don't want the small one.

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
What a cute little pig!

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,060
Look at how small and chubby it is,

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
how adorable!

129
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
It's a good omen.

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,160
Why don't we keep it

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,410
and raise it at home?

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,640
Oh, daughter,

133
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,360
our family butchers pigs,

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
we don't raise them.

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Little pig.

136
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,490
Don't be afraid.

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
I won't let them kill you.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Please let me keep it.

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,360
Fine.

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
I'll take this small one too,

141
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,780
but you have to give me a discount.

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,460
Sure thing.

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,620
Thank you, Mother.

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,770
This silly girl.

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,780
Be good now.

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Who are you?

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,200
Sister, I'm your little pig.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
What's wrong?

149
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,680
Nothing.

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
You're so jumpy.

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,890
What did you say?

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
You're my little pig?

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,880
Sister,

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,200
Sister,

155
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,290
don't be afraid.

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
You saved my life.

157
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,960
I would never hurt you.

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,220
You really are the little pig?

159
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
Look at you,

160
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,010
keeping a pig at home was one thing,

161
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
but now you're bringing home a girl?

162
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,920
This girl is in real trouble.

163
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,400
She's pitiful.

164
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Let's help her.

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,920
You

166
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
are just too kind-hearted.

167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,370
Isn't that because you raised me well?

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
We don't keep idle people in the Zhu family.

169
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,530
Can you work?

170
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,480
I can wash clothes, chop wood, cook,

171
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,400
and also

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,520
feed pigs.

173
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Alright then.

174
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,570
You can stay for now.

175
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,760
[Coughs]

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,250
Sister, let me do it.

177
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,370
Hey, sister.

178
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,460
Let me do it.

179
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,560
You must be tired.

180
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
You stupid girl!

181
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Zhiyuan and I truly love each other.

182
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,020
Why can't you just give us your blessing?

183
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Oh my!

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,280
I've seen many men in my life.

185
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,560
That Scholar Yang

186
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,040
is not a good person at all.

187
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,820
He's slick and insincere.

188
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
He's not worthy of you.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,530
It's not like that, Mother.

190
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,760
Zhiyuan is a scholar.

191
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,760
It's I who am not worthy of him.

192
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,520
You're such a fool.

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,560
This marriage

194
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,440
I will never approve of it.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Get up now.

196
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
What if I insist on marrying him?

197
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Then don't consider me your mother anymore.

198
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
You're on your own.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,040
And you.

200
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,420
Go back to wherever you came from.

201
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Sister.

202
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,460
You wretched girl!

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
If you dare step out that door today,

204
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,740
I am no longer your mother.

205
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,020
I'm an unfilial daughter.

206
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,600
Sister.

207
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,410
Please take care of Mother.

208
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,080
Wait.

209
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Take this.

210
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,140
Don't suffer needlessly.

211
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,320
Open up!

212
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,370
Is anyone there?

213
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,180
Open the door quickly!

214
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Yunniang.

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,880
Yunniang is gone.
