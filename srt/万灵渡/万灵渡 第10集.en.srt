1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,080
My mom is very good to me

2
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,340
and loves me very much.

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,900
She loves me so much

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,520
that it suffocates me.

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,640
Haitang.

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,530
Where have you been?

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,580
Do you know what time it is?

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,889
Today is your birthday.

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
Mom has prepared a table full of delicious food

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
just waiting for you.

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
Today

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,079
my friends celebrated my birthday with me.

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
I've already eaten outside.

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
But I didn't eat much.

15
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,050
I'll wash my hands and eat right away, Mom.

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
This time since it's your birthday,

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I'll let it go.

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
But in the future,

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,960
you absolutely cannot eat that junk food outside.

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
Since you were little,

21
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,360
everything Mom has prepared for you

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,090
has been nutritionally balanced, healthy food.

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,650
This way,

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
you can have a healthy body.

25
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Go now.

26
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Why are you in such a hurry?

27
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm putting my backpack in the bedroom.

28
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
I'll be right out.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Wait a minute.

30
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
Well, well, Zou Haitang.

31
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
You've grown up now.

32
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Think you're independent, huh?

33
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Who gave you this?

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,760
Which bad boy was it?

35
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,100
It's not like that.

36
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
This is from my good friend.

37
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,570
She said I've graduated from high school.

38
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
And should look more like a young woman now.

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm grown up now.

40
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
It's time for college.

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,360
No matter how old you get,

42
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,940
you'll always be my child.

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,970
Dinner's ready.

44
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
Time to eat.

45
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
After dinner,

46
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,410
throw those shoes away.

47
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,760
And that friend who gave you those shoes,

48
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,090
don't see them anymore.

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,340
They'll be a bad influence on you.

50
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,640
You have your mother.

51
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,240
Mom is your best friend.

52
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,140
What are you doing?

53
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,280
She's crazy.

54
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
With a mother like that,

55
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
no wonder you once...

56
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Once?

57
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Boss,

58
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,900
do you know something?

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,540
There's no point talking about this now.

60
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,000
If I hadn't found Qin Qi's therapy center that day,

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
I wouldn't have made it this far.

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Combo set.

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,440
Thank you for setting it up.

64
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Combo set.

65
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,520
Aren't you afraid I might be crazy?

66
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,890
Emotions need an outlet for release and expression.

67
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,620
You must be carrying too much inside.

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,260
That's why you choose food

69
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,100
to fill the emptiness within.

70
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,280
All this time,

71
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,320
you've been struggling so much.

72
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,290
No one has ever said something like that to me before.

73
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
What do you do?

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm a therapist.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,330
If you ever want to talk.

76
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,410
Remember to come see me.

77
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,820
Take care of yourself.

78
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,120
But

79
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,360
I really can't face Mr. Qin again.

80
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
Something's wrong!

81
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,960
Boss!

82
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
There's a lady outside

83
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
who claims to be the victim's mother.

84
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,360
She's accusing our inn of kidnapping her daughter.

85
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,160
She's making a scene in the lobby

86
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,040
and breaking things.

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,300
Please go check it out.

88
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,640
I really don't want to go home and face my mother.

89
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm begging you

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
to help me.

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
How did she get here?

92
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,480
It seems this time we have

93
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,170
more than one guest.

94
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
Zou Haitang.

95
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,840
Running away isn't the solution.

96
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,770
You'll have to face it eventually.

97
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,560
Haitang.

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Zou Haitang.

99
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,720
Zou Haitang.

100
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,720
Innkeeper,

101
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,200
we've already packed everything

102
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,929
and now this crazy woman has...

103
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,490
Hurry up and bring my daughter out!

104
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,440
Zou Haitang is an adult.

105
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,100
She can go wherever she wants.

106
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,720
She doesn't want to come home.

107
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,400
She doesn't want to see you.

108
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,860
You're talking nonsense.

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,480
My daughter is the most obedient and sensible girl.

110
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
It must be people like you

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,740
who corrupted her.

112
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,130
Haitang!

113
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,250
Zou Haitang!

114
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,680
Zou Haitang!

115
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,370
Stop shouting. I've brought her back.

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,560
Let go of me!

117
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,620
What are you doing?

118
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,570
Zou Haitang!

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,060
Staying out all night.

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,060
You're going to be the death of me.

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,610
Good thing I set up location tracking for you on my phone.

122
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Why?

123
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Why won't you give me

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,580
even a little bit of your time?

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,660
Since you were little,

126
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
whatever you wanted,

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
I always made it happen.

128
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm really going to lose my mind.

129
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,540
Are you trying to drive me to my grave?

130
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,560
I am your mother.

131
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,800
I've suffered for 20 years.

132
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Do you think it was easy raising you?

133
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
I just wanted to be somewhere

134
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
where you couldn't see me, to have some peace.

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Just to catch my breath.

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Come home with me.

137
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,480
Haitang.

138
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,600
Haitang.

139
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Haitang.

140
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Haitang.

141
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm begging you.

142
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
Don't hurt her.

143
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll do anything.

144
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,490
Just don't hurt her.

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,840
Haitang.

146
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,280
Haitang.

147
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,520
Haitang.

148
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,320
Love is the deepest emotion in the world,

149
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
yet it hurts the most.

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,420
Finally some peace and quiet.

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
We haven't even started,

152
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
and I'm already exhausted.

153
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,920
It's all your fault

154
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,880
for bringing back this troublemaker.

155
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,280
When all is said and done,

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,140
you brought this on yourself.

157
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
A thousand years ago,

158
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
you acted recklessly.

159
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,760
Now

160
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,320
it's time to pay for your sins.

161
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
You killed the mother and daughter, didn't you?

162
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
Don't talk nonsense.

163
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,760
Then why do you keep refusing this case?

164
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,840
If we complete this case,

165
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,720
we might be able to extinguish the karmic flames.

166
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,480
Who told Zou Haitang to eat whatever she wants?

167
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,880
She ate

168
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
the wonton noodles you made.

169
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,340
Just because of a bowl of noodles?

170
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,250
You're jealous.

171
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,490
Shangguan Feiye

172
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,890
has never been jealous.

173
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
Now get out of here.

174
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,860
And you two,

175
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,410
take them

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,540
to the guest rooms.

177
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes, boss.

178
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,800
You are jealous.

179
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,720
Me? Jealous?

180
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,010
That's ridiculous.

181
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,480
It's all your fault for talking too much,

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,410
telling him about the karmic fire.

183
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,000
By the way,

184
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,880
I think

185
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
I saw Dugu Qiongqi again.

186
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,250
Perhaps he never disappeared.

187
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,520
He might even

188
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
be hiding among us.

189
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
You

190
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,340
are the one who needs to let go of your obsession.

191
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,620
It's time to leave.

192
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Let's go resolve Zou Haitang's obsession.

193
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,340
Come over here.

194
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,700
Put it here.

195
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,380
Go up there.

196
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,860
Set it up properly.

197
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Is this spot okay?

198
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,130
Higher, higher.

199
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
It's aligned now.

200
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,880
Why is this place so strange?

201
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Is this really where we're supposed to be?

202
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
This should be it.

203
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,570
This is Zou Haitang's home.

204
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,360
Jin Xiu Lou,

205
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,560
Lou Xiu Jin,

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,640
a Zou family daughter starved to death,

207
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,680
the master cries,

208
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
the master laughs,

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the coffin turns into a bridal sedan.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,040
What are they talking about?

211
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
What's all this about Jin Xiu Lou, coffins and bridal sedans?

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
The Jin Xiu Lou they're talking about

213
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,200
is right here in the Zou mansion.

214
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
They say Zou Haitang's father spent a fortune

215
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,060
to build it specially for her.

216
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,240
This story became quite famous throughout the city.

217
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,900
What exactly happened to Zou Haitang back then?

218
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,620
Could it be related to you?

219
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Back then,

220
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,000
I killed her.

221
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,080
Help!

222
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,800
Run!

223
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,840
When I rushed here to hunt down the man-eating demon,

224
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,960
Zou's mother had already been devoured by her.

225
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,560
In the end,

226
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,050
I only managed to save Master Zou from the demon's mouth.

227
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,040
Kids,

228
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,000
the Jinxiu Tower you just mentioned...

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,760
But this family...

230
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes, indeed.

231
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,440
What exactly happened to this family?

232
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,320
Why are there both red and white lanterns?

233
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,040
How can you know nothing about this?

234
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Mrs. Zou has died.

235
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,920
Miss Zou is getting married.

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,060
That's why they hung lanterns of two different colors.

237
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Hey, kid.

238
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,120
Are there any rumors about demons in the city lately?

239
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,040
Adults say there's a man-eating demon in the city.

240
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,520
So nobody dares to go out these days.

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Gou Dan! Xiao Hua!

242
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,320
Oh.

243
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
You little brats!

244
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
You've had me searching everywhere.

245
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,600
Hurry home now!

246
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,080
If the man-eating demon catches you,

247
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,540
I won't be able to save you.

248
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,000
The man-eating demon that woman mentioned,

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,330
could it be Zou Haitang?

250
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,780
It probably is.

251
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
When I arrived at the Zou residence back then,

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Zou Haitang had already become a demon.

253
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
As for why she turned into a demon,

254
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,359
and what happened before that,

255
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm not quite sure.

256
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
How are we going to sneak in there?

257
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Just like before,

258
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,480
we'll disguise ourselves.

259
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,400
Pretend to be a couple again?

260
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,079
Dream on.

261
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,010
Let's go.

262
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,800
Where are you taking me?

263
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,880
I just remembered someone

264
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,339
who might know something.

265
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,079
You have friends here too?

266
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,810
This person,

267
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
you know them too.

268
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,480
Why is he alone here?

269
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,080
Where is everyone else?

270
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,480
Isn't he afraid of being eaten by the man-eating demons?

271
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
What if he's not human?

272
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
He's a demon?
