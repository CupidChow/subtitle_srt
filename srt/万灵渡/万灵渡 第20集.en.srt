1
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,890
Li Wubai harmed Liu Yiyi

2
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,820
and I...

3
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,410
Stop wasting time here.

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,400
Let's hurry back.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,259
I don't know how Liu Yiyi is doing.

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
Just tell me if you still have feelings for her.

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,560
No.

8
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
There's nobody here.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,820
Where is everyone?

10
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,850
I don't know.

11
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,210
What's going on?

12
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't you feel

13
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,420
that this place

14
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,890
we've been here before?

15
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,720
Boss.

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
We're not caught in some kind of ghost maze, are we?

17
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,640
Boss.

18
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
What's going on?

19
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
I heard bells ringing

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,560
and suddenly we're here.

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Soul Bell.

22
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,960
The Spirit Lady at the inn

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,440
must have sensed we were in danger

24
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,170
and saved us.

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
Yuhu Manor.

26
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Isn't this...

27
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,900
Three years after Liu Yiyi disappeared,

28
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,130
it was right here

29
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,770
where Li Wubai and the other two appeared.

30
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,040
Welcome, honored heroes, to Yuhu Manor.

31
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,330
I am here on behalf of my master to receive you all.

32
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Cut the nonsense.

33
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,400
Isn't your master

34
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,440
holding some treasure appraisal event?

35
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Let us in already.

36
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,520
I've heard that

37
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,440
the master of Yuhu Manor

38
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
has obtained the legendary treasure

39
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
that was stolen three years ago and went missing,

40
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
the 'Fire Tree Silver Flower.'

41
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
Is this true?

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,720
The one that was stolen three years ago?

43
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,159
Yes.

44
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
We've all come here today

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
specifically to see this Fire Tree Silver Flower.

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
If you truly possess this treasure,

47
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
why not send it to the human-demon border

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,340
to ensure the safety of everyone in the city?

49
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
Exactly!

50
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,960
If it weren't for that wretched Liu Yiyi back then,

51
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
who for her own selfish interests,

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,000
took advantage of her escort mission

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
with no regard for peace between humans and demons,

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and stole the tribute meant for the demon clan,

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,400
humans wouldn't be struggling so much now.

56
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Yes, it was her.

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,500
She's the one who caused this.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,840
So selfish.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
Why didn't she take it to the border?

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,930
Look at Li Wubai's face.

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
He was the one who joined with the other two

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,530
to kill Liu Yiyi.

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Such a hypocrite.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
This Liu Yiyi deliberately gathered

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,480
heroes from across the land to this place.

66
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm sure we can slip in

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,180
without much trouble.

68
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,680
Everyone, please remain calm.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Since we're here,

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
we might as well go in and see for ourselves.

71
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,640
Let's go take a look.

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
What's going on here?

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,210
I want to see for myself.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Why aren't they coming out yet?

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll go check.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Innkeeper.

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,760
What?

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,640
The owner of Liuyiyi Manor.

79
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,680
And those three are our old acquaintances.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,010
We're too conspicuous.

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
What's there to fear?

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Don't get us exposed.

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,500
Innkeeper.

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,940
Don't get recognized.

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,820
Innkeeper.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,060
Excuse me, sir.

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,840
Do you happen to know

88
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,560
who the owner of this manor is?

89
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,290
I do not know.

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,760
I am

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Um, well...

92
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,000
just an ordinary fortune teller.

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
I came here only to

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
make a living.

95
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
I know nothing else.

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,740
You see?

97
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,820
Is he really not recognizing us or just pretending?

98
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,850
Could be either.

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm testing him because I'm betting that

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
perhaps when we return here,

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,450
all traces of our previous existence will be erased.

102
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,600
But even if he's pretending, it doesn't matter.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,860
We'll just play along.

104
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
Everyone stop right now!

105
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,850
Stop!

106
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,840
Where is your master?

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,260
It's already dark.

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
Such disrespect toward us.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
Hurry and call your master to greet the guests.

110
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
Please be patient.

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,400
The master will be here shortly.

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,460
Coming right away.

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,370
The manor lord has arrived.

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,570
The manor lord is finally here.

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,480
We've waited so long.

116
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,280
Finally showed up.

117
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,240
So this is the manor lord.

118
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,170
Indeed. Such impressive bearing.

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
The manor lord's body...

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,720
What's going on?

121
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,850
What does this mean?

122
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,560
Everyone.

123
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,010
Please remain calm.

124
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
The master has a plan.

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,880
The master has

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
hidden treasures throughout the manor.

127
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,760
You're free to search for them.

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Any treasures you find

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
will be yours to keep.

130
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,799
Really?

131
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,720
Such a good deal?

132
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,179
Can it really be like this?

133
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,450
This is our chance to

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,799
investigate the secrets of this manor.

135
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Could it be a trap?

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
This is a great opportunity to get rich!

137
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,520
What are you standing there for?

138
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,050
Let's go!

139
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,250
Let's go!

140
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,760
Why has Liu Yiyi gathered so many martial arts masters

141
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,090
for some treasure hunt?

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,860
What does she really want?

143
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
And back then,

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,720
when Liu Yiyi stole the Fire and Silver Flower,

145
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
didn't the Demon King go after her?

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
After the tribute incident,

147
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,480
the Demon King disappeared.

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Disappeared?

149
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,480
What's even stranger is that

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,720
the barrier between humans and demons was sealed again,

151
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,780
and no one knows the Demon King's whereabouts anymore.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,260
This can't be that simple.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,920
The Demon King was ambitious.

154
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
How could he just give up?

155
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,450
Perhaps he didn't just disappear.

156
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,600
You mean

157
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,260
perhaps something went wrong with the escort team,

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
and the Demon King never got the Fire and Silver Flower?

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,760
So he never became invincible

160
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
and was defeated by someone?

161
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,370
There must be some force

162
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,980
protecting humanity.

163
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,000
What's wrong with your hand?

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,860
Does it still hurt from last time?

165
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,520
It's fine.

166
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
You're willing to give up your life for her.

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,420
If that's the case,

168
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,960
then die in her place.

169
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,580
If we plant this Wujian Vine in your body,

170
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,320
it will gradually eliminate Shangguan Feiye's karmic fire.

171
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,380
However, by that time,

172
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,380
your death will also come.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Dongfang,

174
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,580
you must think carefully.

175
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,980
Let's proceed.

176
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,020
After this mission is completed,

177
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,180
the karmic flames on your body

178
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,080
will be completely eliminated.

179
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,700
Innkeeper,

180
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,770
what are your plans for the future?

181
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,820
I can finally become an ordinary person.

182
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,420
Of course I'll enjoy life to the fullest.

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
That sounds good.

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
Let the past

185
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
be the past.

186
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
In the days ahead,

187
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,300
make sure you take good care of yourself.

188
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
In the future,

189
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,660
won't I still have you?

190
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,320
I can be an absentee owner,

191
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,860
and you'll have to carry on my legacy.

192
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,280
Actually, for a thousand years,

193
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,520
I've been waiting for you

194
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,120
to return to the Monster Inn.

195
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,050
I hope to return the Monster Inn

196
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
to you in perfect condition.

197
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
So, Dongfang,

198
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
even if one day I'm gone,

199
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,860
you must continue to protect this place.

200
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,370
A butterfly.

201
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
In such cold weather,

202
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,890
why would there be a butterfly?

203
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
Innkeeper, are you alright?

204
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,890
Such powerful monster energy.

205
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,900
You two guests have good eyes.

206
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,820
This butterfly

207
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,160
is transformed from the pistil of the Fire Tree Silver Flower,

208
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,320
naturally incomparable to ordinary treasures.

209
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,000
No wonder there's monster aura.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,730
Your master has refined taste.

211
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,570
Dear guests,

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,260
the banquet has begun.

213
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,280
The master awaits everyone in the front hall.

214
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,940
Please follow me to the feast.

215
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,560
What is it?

216
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,780
There seem to be fewer people.

217
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,090
Something's not right.

218
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,050
The manor lord has arrived.

219
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,920
I am Lady Liu, the mistress of this manor.

220
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
Welcome everyone

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,040
to my humble abode.

222
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
If there are any shortcomings in my hospitality,

223
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I ask all of you

224
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,840
for your understanding.

225
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Yiyi,

226
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,610
it really is you.

227
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,420
Liu Yiyi is actually still alive.

228
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,100
That bitch!

229
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,220
I knew she wouldn't die so easily.

230
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,850
Did everyone enjoy the entertainment

231
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
I arranged for you?

232
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,000
Liu,

233
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,860
stop being so mysterious.

234
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,140
Where is the Fire Tree Silver Flower?

235
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,280
Don't be impatient.

236
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,570
During tomorrow's gathering,

237
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,800
you will naturally

238
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,600
get to see the treasure.

239
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,480
Yiyi,

240
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,920
where have you been these past three years?

241
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,400
This young man is quite handsome.

242
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
After the banquet,

243
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,970
would you be willing to accompany me to the garden

244
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,520
for a drink together?

245
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,120
No, I won't go.

246
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,000
A man and woman drinking alone together -

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,800
how improper!

248
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
Lady Liu is inviting you -

249
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
that's a great honor.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,440
You should go right away.
