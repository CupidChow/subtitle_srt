1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,838
Come on. To drunk Kai.

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,139
Wish him an early escape from misery.

3
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:04,507
Cheers.

4
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:11,281
He drank too much.

5
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,327
Don't you know that drugs
can't be taken with alcohol?

6
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:33,088
(In an unexpected place, I met the person
I thought I would never see again.)

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,807
(The further relationship
between people)

8
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,909
(is a matter of names, connection,)

9
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,311
(or how to call each other?)

10
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:44,414
My friend.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,251
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:50,386
You didn't come back,
so I'm here to find you.

13
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:52,989
Bai Lang, let your friend have a seat.

14
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,325
I'm not his friend.

15
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:55,792
I am his den...

16
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,594
Ah...

17
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:01,097

I'm not his friend.

30
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:56,412
I am his den...

31
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:59,215
Ah...

32
00:02:00,473 --> 00:02:01,126
My boyfriend.

33
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,666
(Use me as an excuse?)

34
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:08,448
Just kidding.

35
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:08,801
You...

36
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:15,608
It's my fault.

37
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:16,608
I'm not nice enough to him

38
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:17,777
and made him angry.

39
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,078
He's in a mood now.

40
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:24,250
We're gonna leave for a moment.

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,518
All right. Go on.

42
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:26,352
Enjoy yourselves.

43
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:27,720
Drinks are on me.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,554
All these are on me.

45
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:29,322
You said it.

46
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,492
You know your sister.

47
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:35,261
She'll bother me if you won't come back.

48
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,344
I've been there once.

49
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,432
I think that's enough.

50
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:40,704
I am your dentist.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,535
Your teeth are mine.

52
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:43,903
Well.

53
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,606
Whether it's a dentist,
a veterinarian or a medical examiner,

54
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,841
I never listen to them.

55
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,811
You are here in my bistro
and did that kind of thing.

56
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,945
That was too much.

57
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,413
Okay.

58
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,200
Explain your teeth thing

60
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:00,832
to your sister yourself.

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,424
Go.

62
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,057
I have something
to talk about with your friend.

63
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,559
A word, Dr. Jin?

64
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,460
This way.

65
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,228
This way.

66
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,736
Didn't you just say
that you don't listen to anyone?

67
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,405
Are you so afraid of your sister?

68
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:22,496
You can tell anyone.

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,712
Just don't tell my sister.

70
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,412
I shouldn't have gone there.

71
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,182
How did you know I'm here?

72
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:34,720
I...

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,422
I was taking my employee to dinner

74
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,824
and just stopped by here.

75
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,464
So you're not here to ask me
to check my teeth again?

76
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm here to visit Mr. Bai who was
like a kitten when sitting on the chair,

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,176
but became like a lion
after getting off.

78
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,437
I was not.

79
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,739
But he was taking medicine with wine.

80
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,832
How strange.
Why doesn't he know the thing?

81
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:57,920
Even elementary school students know it.

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,008
And his sister is a doctor.

83
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:00,064
Come on. How could I not have

84
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:01,113
this basic common sense?

85
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,581
Just a pill.

86
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,350
I can just swallow it without water.

87
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,186
And I was drinking sparkling water.

88
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,854
So you mean

89
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,358
you've taken
all the medicine I gave you,

90
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,959
but your teeth still hurt?

91
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,127
You bought more medicine yourself?

92
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,863
You're pressing me so hard.

93
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:19,498
Do you have a crush on me?

94
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,570
I don't really know why you are
so afraid of going to the dentist.

95
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,605
But the one who is suffering is you,

96
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,274
and the one who worries is your sister.

97
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,710
I want to tell you

98
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,813
that you have to overcome
what you are afraid of by yourself.

99
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,214
No one can help you.

100
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:36,816
You'll stay where you are.

101
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,188
Then you're not just a dentist now.

102
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,989
You also know psychology, right?

103
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,376
Trust me.

104
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,035
I have never let a patient down.

105
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:57,603
And...

106
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,605
Well...

107
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:02,775
That rice stew

108
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,212
is delicious.

109
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,384
Delicious, huh?

110
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,304
So angry that day.

111
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,122
Your hand...

112
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,391
Is your hand okay?

113
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,260
You care about my hand now?

114
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,461
You hit it so hard just now.

115
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:24,964
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,040
For the sake of my hand,

117
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,067
shouldn't you come back to check teeth?

118
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:31,103
I'll be waiting for you
at the clinic tomorrow.

119
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,339
Anytime.

120
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,179
What are you doing?

121
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,313
Nothing.

122
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,214
So,

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,936
he is your boy...?

124
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:44,483
I'm leaving.

125
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:45,851
I've ordered.

126
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,320
Are we leaving, Director?

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,628
(Dude.)

128
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,830
(Did you hear what you said
in front of Aggie yesterday? Boyfriend?)

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,599
(She's been asking me if it is true.)

130
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,701
(If you don't like her, make it clear.)

131
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,224
(And go cure your toothache)

132
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,738
(before it gets worse.)

133
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,104
(We're busy today.)

134
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:07,840
(Come early to help us.)

135
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,088
(Please.)

136
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,609
(Don't make a mess anymore.)

137
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,929
(Jin Xun'an's Profile)

138
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,198
He inherited his father's business
at such a young age,

139
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,070
so he must have good skills.

140
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,506
It must be okay.

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,417
Alright.

142
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:53,886
Can you two stop being like this?

143
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,822
Today is your mom's birthday.

144
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,390
Look at the bistro you choose.

145
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,961
You said you wanted
to know what I like to eat.

146
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,696
You can go to
a five-star restaurant now.

147
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,184
No need.

148
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:07,366
This is a good place. I like it.

149
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:08,901
Can you just stop?

150
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,624
My birthday only comes once a year.

151
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:11,937
It's rare that RJ treats me to dinner.

152
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:15,140
Baby, you'll be 19 next month.

153
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,248
How about throwing
a birthday party for you

154
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:18,592
to have some fun, okay?

155
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:19,211
No need.

156
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,180
Those people are not my friends.

157
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,017
Those important people
are worthy of you to make friends with.

158
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,852
About who he should make friends with
and where he should go,

159
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,288
how did you teach him those?

160
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,189
I know who I should be friends with.

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,657
Do you really care about me?

162
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,976
How can you say that?

163
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,672
Of course we care about you.

164
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:37,730
Care about me?

165
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,976
You're just afraid
that I'll embarrass you

166
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:44,512
and that you can't show everyone

167
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:45,696
how great your son is.

168
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,776
What are you talking about, He Qingtian?

169
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:50,576
All right, calm down.

170
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,048
We are both open-minded.

171
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,496
Don't we support you
in all that you want to do?

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,586
Support me in all that I want to do?

173
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:02,816
Of course.

174
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:05,056
Anything?

175
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,026
Here is your drink.

176
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:21,856
What are you doing?

177
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:27,947
How about this?

178
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:30,720
Do you support me liking men?

179
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,253
Look at the kid you taught.

180
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:39,616
What do you want to do?

181
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,920
You...

182
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,568
Baby, are you okay?

183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Sorry.

184
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:49,472
Sorry.

185
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:50,336
Are you okay?

186
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,296
Go get a broom.

187
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:55,708
Sorry.

188
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,504
Sorry, this is my business card.

189
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,336
Here you are.

190
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,104
I'll get back later.

191
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,544
I gotta go chase my husband.

192
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:01,312
Sorry.

193
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:02,016
He Qingtian, let's go.

194
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:02,656
We're going to chase your dad.

195
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,808
Hurry up.

196
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:06,919
So rude.

197
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
Are you hurt?

198
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,389
Nothing.

199
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:11,557
Sorry.

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,877
Boss, you are too late.

201
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,312
You didn't see that.

202
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,414
Your manager was kissed by a little boy.

203
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:38,283
A little boy?

204
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:39,552
Not that bad.

205
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,208
Maybe a young man?

206
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,756
A high school student?

207
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:44,223
A high school student?

208
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,758
Bad kid.

209
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:49,895
What happened?

210
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,766
He wanted to piss off his parents.

211
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,169
Where did he kiss him?

212
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,640
He really needs to
take the responsibility.

213
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:03,175
Of what?

214
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,736
So rude.

215
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:08,256
I just saw a boy at the back door

216
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:11,200
with a small bag on his chest,

217
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:14,119
and he seemed to have been beaten.

218
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,032
Beaten?

219
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,057
Red.

220
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:20,480
I'll take a look.

221
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:24,329
Sorry

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,265
for breaking your glasses.

223
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,464
Your face?

224
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,105
Got hit by it.

225
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:34,306
I'm fine.

226
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,608
Why did you annoy them on purpose

227
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:38,208
and did that in front of them?

228
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:41,080
Sorry

229
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:42,881
for kissing you.

230
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Forget it. Go back
and admit you were wrong.

231
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,155
They are your parents after all.

232
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:51,390
Parents?

233
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
Don't parents make mistakes?

234
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,216
I'm always wrong.

235
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,424
I was kicked out of the car

236
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,466
before I could even get my luggage.

237
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:01,533
Great.

238
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,616
Even my key was taken away.

239
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,405
They just didn't want me
to go back and embarrass them.

240
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:07,606
Then why should I go back?

241
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,243
Can you take
responsibility for your actions?

242
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:16,982
How old are you?

243
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,464
Are you an adult?

244
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm 18.

245
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,787
I've grown up.

246
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,712
Boy.

247
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,240
Everyone has
their own fear of something.

248
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,288
Learn to face them.

249
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,628
That's what makes a grown-up.

250
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
You have to overcome
what you are afraid of by yourself.

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,256
No one can help you.

252
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,984
You'll stay where you are.

253
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,540
Alex.

254
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,592
Let's have a talk.

255
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:43,342
About what?

256
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:47,360
What do you want to do?

257
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,080
I have an idea.

258
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,647
What idea?

259
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:49,920
Go there.

260
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,449
Again?

261
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:52,864
What do you want to do?

262
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,400
Think about it.

263
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,554
Shouldn't he take
the responsibility after kissing you?

264
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,440
Of what?

265
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
Look at how old I am.

266
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
Shouldn't he take the responsibility
for breaking the glasses?

267
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,561
Do you think he has the money
to pay for the damage?

268
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,872
He got kicked out.

269
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:04,480
Yes.

270
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,664
He got kicked out.

271
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:06,816
What a poor boy.

272
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,736
He is homeless now.

273
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,944
Didn't you always say
that we don't have enough employees?

274
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,640
How about giving him a chance

275
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,312
to work for us?

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,776
You don't even know him.

277
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,377
Look at his temperament

278
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:19,612
and his clothes,

279
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,247
he must be born into a rich family.

280
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:21,814
Right?

281
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:22,715
And

282
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,984
his eyes are so clear.

283
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,285
Seems he won't lie.

284
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:27,720
Think about it. He's angry now.

285
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,521
And he can't go back home.

286
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,323
What if he's in danger out there?

287
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,825
What do you do?

288
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,562
Just like we usually don't

289
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:38,831
let drunk guests drive home,

290
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,066
that's the same.

291
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,767
Right?

292
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,103
Why are you

293
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,105
so excited today?

294
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:46,939
Excited?

295
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,809
Am I?

296
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:50,910
Yes.

297
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,944
I don't think so.

298
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:53,779
Right.

299
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,881
Just be decisive and positive

300
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,115
before we

301
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,483
make every decision,

302
00:12:57,884 --> 00:12:59,152
especially this one.

303
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,553
I'm definitely right.

304
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:01,988
Just do it.

305
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:04,423
This is the real growth.

306
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:05,825
Right?

307
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,861
What exactly are you talking about?

308
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,430
Everyone has their own level to pass.

309
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm going to pass

310
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,569
mine.

311
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:19,305
Bai Lang.

312
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,340
You can do it.

313
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,074
Bai Lang.

314
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,843
You will be fine.

315
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:26,712
I will be fine.

316
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,516
You sure you are okay?

317
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,987
What about that boy?

318
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,190
I'll leave him to you.

319
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,393
Me again?

320
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,208
(Xunying Dental Clinic)

321
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,267
How about having
hot pot together after work?

322
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,502
Good. I am so hungry.

323
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,469
Let's go.

324
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:51,737
Do you want to have hot pot?

325
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:52,271
Yes.

326
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,272
How about a spicy one?

327
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:53,906
Good.

328
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm going to that one.

329
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,641
What do you want to eat?

330
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,142
Spicy hot pot.

331
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:57,076
Director, do you want to join us?

332
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:58,010
Sorry.

333
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,747
A, you stay here.

334
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:03,482
Why me?

335
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:04,850
There is no patient anymore.

336
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,120
Can you make sure?

337
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:09,388
No.

338
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:10,823
Goodbye.

339
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,358
Go to the dental impression room
to find me if there's something.

340
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,030
Director.

341
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:53,866
The patient won't come, right?

342
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,939
Or is the patient already here?

343
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:03,776
You can go home.

344
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:04,543
Okay. Bye.

345
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,224
Dr. Jin.

346
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:21,761
Am I

347
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,629
too late?

348
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:28,601
Yes.

349
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:38,477
Come in.

350
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:43,282
Do you think of a dental clinic

351
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:44,483
as a 24-hour convenience store?

352
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,688
I just wanted to take a chance.

353
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,824
Last time you said "anytime".

354
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,259
Put your things over there.

355
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,362
I wonder if you're
really willing to wait for me.

356
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,568
Take a chance?
You must be thinking that

357
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:04,537
if our clinic is closed,

358
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,738
you'll have an excuse

359
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:06,706
to come here another day.

360
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:13,913
Didn't you say
you wanted to listen to music?

361
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,915
Take your pick.

362
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,422
You prepared it?

363
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,361
Let me see.

364
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,665
Let me tell you a joke.

365
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:33,632
One day,

366
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:36,168
a dentist asked Ming,

367
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,304
"What would happen to you

368
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,705
if I cut off one of your ears?"

369
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:41,207
Ming replied,

370
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,742
"I would not be able to hear."

371
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:43,676
The dentist asked,

372
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:46,912
"What if

373
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,647
I cut off your other ear?"

374
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:50,516
Ming replied,

375
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:53,185
"I would not be able to see."

376
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:55,388
Why?

377
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,422
I don't know.

378
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:58,724
Ming said,

379
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,526
"Because I wear glasses."

380
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:04,764
Don't you think it's funny?

381
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,465
Okay.

382
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:07,867
It's really hard to make you laugh.

383
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,101
I'll tell you another one.

384
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,170
Anyway, you still have to
have your tooth pulled out.

385
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,240
Come and sit.

386
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:24,517
I am telling you.

387
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:26,519
You didn't use those instruments

388
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,020
last time,

389
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,021
so I made it.

390
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:30,122
I'm not sure

391
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:30,956
if I'll be in shock

392
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:32,158
if you use those this time.

393
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:33,692
I can do CPR. Sit down.

394
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:38,431
Put your feet on there.

395
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,900
CPR?

396
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,768
So confident.

397
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,474
I need to check to see

398
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,877
if I can get your tooth
pulled out today.

399
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,947
What do you mean?

400
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm struggling.

401
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,718
I want to get my tooth pulled out soon,

402
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:02,888
but I'm a little afraid.

403
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,957
Just like life,

404
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,327
it is really hard to make a decision.

405
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,029
It's not that hard for you.

406
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,730
It's me who is making the decision.

407
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,065
Hold on.

408
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:14,033
Dr. Jin, your hand is injured.

409
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:14,967
Are you sure you're okay with it?

410
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,570
My hand has recovered.

411
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,805
It's just used for fixing.

412
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:20,873
Are you sure?

413
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:22,641
Stay still.

414
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:30,616
Open your mouth.

415
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:35,588
Wait.

416
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm ready.

417
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,369
You don't need to make a sound.

418
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:51,937
Relax.

419
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,639
Just imagine you're not
on a dental chair.

420
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,207
How can I do that?

421
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,209
I'm j-just lying on it.

422
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:58,477
How about you look at something

423
00:18:58,477 --> 00:18:59,445
to divert your attention?

424
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,312
Anything.

425
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:32,745
Are you done?

426
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,880
What's the rush?

427
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,651
Didn't expect

428
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,119
my tooth is still with me.

429
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:41,854
Maybe your tooth doesn't

430
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:43,722
want to say goodbye to me so soon.

431
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,225
I'll prescribe you some antibiotics.

432
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:47,927
You didn't listen to me,

433
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,428
so there's still inflammation.

434
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:49,862
This time...

435
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:50,996
I'll listen to you this time.

436
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:54,633
What's that look?

437
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,135
I said I'll listen to you.

438
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,039
Hope so.

439
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,474
Remember.

440
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:03,576
Medicine can only be taken with...

441
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,877
Warm water.

442
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,011
I know.

443
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:09,648
I'm leaving.

444
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:17,056
Goodbye.

445
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,956

448
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,433
(Turn the TV up)

449
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,568
(and you won't be afraid.)

450
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:03,602
(Okay?)

451
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:15,280
Let's go to the dentist tomorrow, okay?

452
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,116
Aren't you afraid of this the most?

453
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:21,420

more than an hour to get home from here.

517
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,340
Are you going home?

518
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,011
Where do you want to live?

519
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:53,518
You haven't paid for the damage.

520
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,221
How about staying here?

521
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,557
We just happened to be short of people.

522
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,559
Do you have your ID card?

523
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,561
Give it to me.

524
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:10,469
He Qingtian.

525
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:15,507
Sleep on the sofa

526
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,109
at the back.

527
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,744
I'll bring you some clothes tomorrow.

528
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,413
I can really stay here?

529
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:23,915
Or what do you want to do?

530
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,251
Go wash your face first.

531
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,225
The bathroom is in the back.

532
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:55,647
Won't you ask me questions?

533
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:58,917
About what?

534
00:27:58,917 --> 00:27:59,885
About...

535
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,156
Aren't you curious about people?

536
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:05,824
I am.

537
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,231
I'm curious about dental impressions.

538
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,034
Dental impressions?

539
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,438
Did you mean this?

540
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:21,673
No.

541
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:24,376
Dental impressions
are similar to fingerprints

542
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,644
but vary from person to person.

543
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:28,680
They are easier
to keep than fingerprints.

544
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,449
Unless being burned
at an extremely high temperature

545
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:31,316
for a long time,

546
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,284
it won't melt.

547
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,387
Sorry.

548
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:35,987
Don't get me wrong.

549
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:37,022
I was not laughing at you.

550
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:38,528
I just thought it was funny.

551
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:41,560
Funny?

552
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:43,829
So do you need a lot of display racks?

553
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,034
When your treatment is over,

554
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,436
I can make a dental impression for you.

555
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:53,772
Me?

556
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,511
You have perfectly straight teeth.

557
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:00,712
Can be a teaching tool.

558
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,498
But you can refuse.

559
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:21,433
No problem. I accept it.

560
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,436
It's rare for anyone
to be interested in my teeth.

561
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:26,271
And I can do something for education.

562
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,474
What are you going to teach
with my teeth?

563
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,012
Impacted wisdom tooth removal.

564
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:34,813
Wait.

565
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,028
I'll return your clothes
after I wash them.

566
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:51,062
Okay.

567
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:52,197
Thank you for the ginger tea.

568
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:53,565
Never mind.

569
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,267
Thank you too.

570
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:57,068
Don't mention it.

571
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,003
I'll see you off.

572
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:58,937
No, thanks.

573
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:00,372
Take a rest early.

574
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,340
Take care of your teeth.

575
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,576
Don't go to bed too late.

576
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,061
It's...

577
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,565
I want to say it's a little late.

578
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:27,933
How about you stay here
and have some late-night snacks?

579
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,235
It's easier to cook for two.

580
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:32,370
Don't worry. I'm good at cooking.

581
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,673
Or you are not hungry?

582
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:35,392
If you are not,

583
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:36,608
I have some ice cream in the fridge.

584
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,934
Relax.

585
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,769
Just imagine you're not
on a dental chair.

586
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:54,937
How can I do that?

587
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,772
I'm j-just lying on it.

588
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,610
How about you look at something

589
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,545
to divert your attention?

590
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,612
Anything.

591
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:20,864
(I told you to look at something
to divert your attention.)

592
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,904
(But I didn't expect
that I was affected by you.)

593
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:29,856
(If I want to get closer,)

594
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,736
(and if I want you,)

595
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:35,488
(what does it mean?)

596
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:48,524
So you have the habit
of taking sleeping pills?

597
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:51,456
What's causing your panic

598
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:53,362
and insomnia?

599
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,231
Sorry.

600
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:57,088
Boy.

601
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,767
Treat others the way

602
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,128
you want them to treat you.

603
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,570
Are you collaborating with them?

604
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,024
You help my mom watch me?

605
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,275
All of you are the same.

606
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,776
Do you watch too many movies?

607
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,613
I don't need to see a doctor.

608
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,614
You do.

609
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,800
Is it better for you
to stay away from me?
