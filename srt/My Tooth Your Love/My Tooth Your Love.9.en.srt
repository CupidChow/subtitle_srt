1
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:10,791
(So you never had special feelings)

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,958
(for me?)

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,461
"Comfortable"?

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,966
Actually, I'm not comfortable at all.

5
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,106
(Everything will be fine.)

6
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,343
(Even if it's the end of the world,)

7
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:31,111
(the sun still rises.)

8
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:38,051
Sister.

9
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,823
Excuse me, is Bai Qing here?

10
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,324
No.

11
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:55,869
Are you okay?

12
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,307
Yeah.

13
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,609
Is there anything
that you want me to tell her?

14
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:23,363
Good luck. Go for it.

15
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:30,904
("Good luck"?)

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,242
(Was he talking to me?)

17
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,000
(Everything will be fine. Even if it's
the end of the world, the sun still rises.)

18
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,830
Where are you, sister?

19
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,931
I'm telling you, I just saw a guy

20
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,299
crying in your office,

21
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,468
so I gave him your dessert.

22
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:02,369
(Are you kidding me?)

23
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,271
(I've been waiting for it
for a long time.)

24
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,907
But he looked really pathetic.

25
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,176
I'll go home to make
another one for you now.

26
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,911
Remember to bring the box back.

27
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,045
Okay. Bye.

39
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,743
Is he working?

40
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,480
Boy.

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,549
Look again.

42
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,820
What is he doing?

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,855
He's hating himself.

44
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,992
He should've listened to me.

45
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,794
Replenish some wine.

46
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,851
I almost forgot. It's your job. Take it.

47
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,619
Wait...

48
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,424
How did you meet Alex?

49
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:05,959
Why do you care?

50
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,528
Boss, please tell me.

51
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,198
Well, that day I saw an artificial human

52
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,366
in the storage room.

53
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,634
So I pushed the button,

54
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,669
and it started.

55
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:16,703
By the way, his lives on machine oil,

56
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:17,938
so he has a poker face.

57
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,372
Come on. I'm serious.

58
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,840
Tell me.

59
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,978
He was already here
when I bought this place.

60
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,647
When you bought this place...

61
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:31,851
Then what is his Chinese name?

62
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,721
Chinese name. "Ai Li Ke Si".
[*Chinese Pinyin of Alex]

63
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,089
No.

64
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,824
The Chinese name

65
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:38,959
on the ID card.

66
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,793
You mean that?

67
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:40,894
Yes...

68
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:42,529
Zhou Chenghao.

69
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,297
Zhou Cheng...

70
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,933
What did he do before?
What about his family?

71
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,835
What's something
that he hates to eat the most?

72
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,437
You are really annoying, boy.

73
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,739
Why so many questions?

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,110
Well, I just think I should know more

75
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,312
about the one who teaches me mixology.

76
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:00,547
Oh, I see.

77
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,682
So curious about him?

78
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,451
Then don't you want
to know what I hate to eat

79
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,287
or what I did before?

80
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,357
Forget about it.

81
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:19,299
I know you don't just
want to learn mixology.

82
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,400
He looks cold,

83
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,369
but he's actually very soft-hearted.

84
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,871
As long as he doesn't push you away,

85
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,140
there's still a chance.

86
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,681
Right.

87
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,549
How can people

88
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:37,817
have no emotions?

89
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:41,121
And one can't stop loving
because of fear,

90
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,923
unless they dislike it.

91
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,828
Don't pretend to be a grownup.

92
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,697
Are you going to work or not?

93
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:51,698
Are you going to work or not?

94
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:52,799
Are you going to clean the glass or not?

95
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,067
Are you going to clean the glass or not?

96
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,338
I'll go to work. I'll clean the glass.

97
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:00,940
But Alex wants me
to replenish some wine first.

98
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,043
So I'll clean the glass later.

99
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,577
Little boy.

100
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:25,065
It was my fault.

101
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:28,601
I'm the one to blame.

102
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,171
What should I do?

103
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:43,616
How do I let him know

104
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,685
I'm sincere?

105
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,699
Just a human.

106
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,077
Forget him.

107
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:24,991
The beginning is the hardest.
Just sending a text message.

108
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:27,360
Bai Lang, you can do it.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,528
I can do it.

110
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:35,232
(I'm serious. Let's be together.)

111
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,704
What did I just do?

112
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,841
(You have recalled the message)
That was close.

113
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:44,811
Wait.

114
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,746
Why did I recall it?

115
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,423
You think it's too direct?

116
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:09,632
(You've cured my dentophobia.
Will you cure my emotional insecurity too?)

117
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,206
No one would send a text like this?

118
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:26,419
(Believe me, or I will have a toothache
and no one will treat me.)

119
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,988
He will believe me now.

120
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:34,861
If no one treats me,
that means he'll reject me.

121
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,798
Don't say that. It'd be a bad omen.

122
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,205
Ask him?

123
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,576
Right, it's useless to ask you.

124
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,884
What do you think I should do?

125
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,823
Good idea.

126
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,036
What's up?

127
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:21,007
A person who doesn't like
video chatting does that with me.

128
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,042
I heard you got back together
with Ye Qiran.

129
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,311
Where did you hear that?

130
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,713
I've never dated him,

131
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,047
let alone getting back together.

132
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,017
It doesn't matter.
Why are you calling me?

133
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,285
Langlang's teeth?

134
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,421
There's nothing wrong with his teeth.

135
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,558
I have a favor to ask.

136
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,465
Please let me date Bai Lang.

137
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,235
Right, Bai Lang is more...

138
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,272
What did you just say?

139
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,139
Date who?

140
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,541
Bai Lang.

141
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,944
Your brother, my patient.

142
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,479
Jin Xun'an.

143
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,447
Do you think I can't beat you
over the phone?

144
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,615
I only told you to check his teeth.

145
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,616
I didn't tell you to pick him up

146
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,751
or even challenge me.

147
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,185
I might punch you.

148
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,255
I wasn't challenging you.

149
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,758
I know you are the most important person

150
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,259
to him.

151
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,296
I want to ask for your permission,

152
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,865
so that he can pursue me

153
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,233
without worries.

154
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:23,670
Not you pursuing him,
but he pursuing you?

155
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,071
Are you kidding me?

156
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,406
Or shall I wrap him with a red bow

157
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,840
and send himself to you?

158
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,209
That would be great.

159
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,477
Can I pick a color?

160
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,614
Is that funny?

161
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,783
Jin Xun'an, what happened to you

162
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,584
and my brother?

163
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,186
I just asked you to check his teeth.

164
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:43,790
It's a long story.

165
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,526
Then make it short.

166
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:48,494
I'm listening.

167
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,096
No matter what you say,

168
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,064
I will never,

169
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,031
never,

170
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,599
never agree.

171
00:10:57,203 --> 00:11:00,940
Doctor, the patient will be here
in half an hour.

172
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,653
Hello, Mr. Bai.

173
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,288
Why are you here?

174
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,623
The director has gone out to study
and won't be here for a few days.

175
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,692
Didn't we have an appointment

176
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:20,927
to get my teeth cleaned?

177
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,997
Teeth cleaning?
You just had your teeth cleaned.

178
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,098
Be good.

179
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,133
Don't be so straightforward.

180
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,335
Sometimes you shouldn't pop it.

181
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,838
Am I right, Mr. Bai?

182
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:32,905
Or you want A to do it for you?

183
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:33,906
He is available now.

184
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,308
But I'm busy later.

185
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,376
Just one patient.

186
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:37,243
No...

187
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,445
Actually, I'm not here
to have my teeth cleaned today.

188
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,180
I made some biscuits.

189
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,748
Biscuits?

190
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:42,949
I just want to share them with you.

191
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,084
There're chocolate ones, blueberry ones

192
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,519
and strawberry ones.

193
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,087
They taste good.

194
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,323
But I want to ask you a question first.

195
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:51,591
Did your director

196
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,059
do anything unusual

197
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,861
after I left that day?

198
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:56,362
No.

199
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,297
Just as usual.

200
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,465
Alright.

201
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,668
What's something that he likes

202
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,338
or dislikes?

203
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:08,741
There's too much.

204
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:12,111
(He hates patients skipping the check.)

205
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,747
(He hates people cutting in line.)

206
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,216
(He hates hypocrites,)

207
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,285
(so I'm outspoken when talking to him.)

208
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:27,927
What should I do?

209
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,296
I've been touching a nerve on him.

210
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,397
Touching a nerve on him.

211
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,468
You had it coming!

212
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,004
You had it coming, Bai Lang.

213
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:51,143
(Choosing the recipe)

214
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:12,138
(Temporary Combat Center)

215
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,272
Complaining about this

216
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,740
from time to time.

217
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,875
Director.

218
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,044
Director, wait...

219
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,445
Here's something for you.

220
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,715
What is it?

221
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,218
Your lunch.

222
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:36,896
(The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach. Please enjoy.)

223
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,436
What are you looking at?

224
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,637
Your lunch.

225
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:49,876
I'm here to return the box.

226
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,110
How was his feeling?

227
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,545
He looked very happy.

228
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,480
Really?

229
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,948
Well begun is half done.

230
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,817
A said he would take photos
and text them to you.

231
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:58,584
Okay.

232
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,119
Then I'm leaving, bye.

233
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,554
Goodbye.

234
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,289
Next time I want tiramisu.

235
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,725
Okay.

236
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:06,259
Okay. Bye.

237
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,660
Goodbye.

No.

Enough. I don't believe it.

280
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,436
What happened?

281
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,340
Why the long face?

My mom

said my dad is sick.

284
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,258
This is not the first time.
They must be lying again.

285
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,095
Even if they were lying,

286
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,329
it was because they want you

287
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,897
to come home.

288
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,801
They're just too proud to ask.

289
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,373
If I give them an inch,
they'll take a mile.

290
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,342
They want me to go
on the path they arrange for me.

291
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,845
There's something
that I can't back down on.

292
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,215
After you learn to back down,

293
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,183
it means that you have grown up.

294
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,820
I have already grown up.

295
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:58,557
Boy.

296
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:15,975
I'm here for the appointment.

297
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,014
What appointment?

298
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,185
You forgot?

299
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,255
Dental impression.

300
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:32,691
Didn't you say that my teeth are neat

301
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:34,727
and suitable as teaching materials?

302
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,997
Don't tease me, okay?

303
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,703
I don't have time for that.

304
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,238
Do you really want to do it?

305
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,676
I thought it through.

306
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,244
I do.

307
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:55,614
Really?

308
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,454
I'm really worried
that you'll keep ignoring me.

309
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,055
Good for you.
Aren't you afraid I'll run away?

310
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,090
Just run.

311
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,128
Okay.

312
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,878
Let me tell you a fairy tale.

313
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,914
If the person you like
makes a dental impression for you

314
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:32,218
and engraves his name on it,

315
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:33,819
then you'll never

316
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,689
escape him.

317
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,092
Where did you hear that?

318
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,096
From a dental authority,

319
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,331
me.

320
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,440
Are you kidding me, Jin Xun'an?

321
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,643
(Xunying Dental Clinic)

322
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,744
If today...

323
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,279
There's no "if".

324
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:04,083
I was waiting for you to take the bait.

325
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,586
And after I engrave
my name and seal it later,

326
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,321
you won't be able
to run away even if you want to.

327
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,790
You can't turn back.

328
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:16,996
Then I want an impression of your teeth

329
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,398
and engrave my name on it too.

330
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:22,001
Maybe the person
who wants to run away would be you.

331
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,539
I never thought

332
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,009
I'd be so comfortable in the room

333
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,878
that I was so scared of.

334
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,281
Yeah.

335
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,516
And there was even an earthquake

336
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,884
when you first came here.

337
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,797
I admit

338
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,301
I have the same feelings
for you as you do for me.

339
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:00,072
But is it really okay?

340
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,641
I may not be a very good person.

341
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,114
Why not?

342
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,149
You're not a very good person,

343
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,718
and neither am I.

344
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:15,754
But as long as the two of us
face the problems together,

345
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,556
everything will be okay.

346
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,461
I am serious.

347
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,429
You know my parents died

348
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,463
because of my wayward behavior.

349
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:27,333
I won't say it was not your fault,

350
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,135
because it won't work.

351
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:33,305
You always think it was your fault,

352
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,474
and all I can do

353
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:37,343
is to accompany you,

354
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,945
protect you,

355
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,514
help you get past it,

356
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,316
and heal your wound.

357
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:45,618
That's it.

358
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,495
I always thought

359
00:21:56,495 --> 00:22:00,299
if you don't have it,
you won't be afraid of losing it.

360
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:07,006
But this time,

361
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:11,010
even if I'm afraid of losing it,
I still want it.

No?

375
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:51,910
Nothing.

376
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,747
I just want him to buy some night snacks

00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,181
Yeah.

378

I'm back.

Goodbye.

382
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:11,363
You are like the wisdom teeth in gums.

383
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,732
You can't tell if they are crooked,

384
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:17,236
or when they will come out.

385
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,008
Look.

386
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,077
Here's your impression.

387
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,414
This is my dental impression?

388
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:39,057
Are my teeth really neat?

389
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,730
I'll bag it for you.

390
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,369
According to scientists,

391
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:51,470
a simple kiss

392
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,139
helps you burn
about two to three calories,

393
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,709
while a passionate kiss

394
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:58,510
can burn

395
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,781
up to five to 26 calories per minute.

396
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:06,185
So we...

397
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:08,654
I'm hungry.

398
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,389

00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:14,059
What do you want to eat?
I will make it for you.

And?

403
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,575
Get off this chair.

404
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:33,011
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know
how to face it.

to preach at me anymore.

I can back down too.

433
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,492

436
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,870
You didn't go to the bistro.

437
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,505
Where did you go?

438
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:15,874
We were just at the clinic.

of going to the dentist

448
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,530
