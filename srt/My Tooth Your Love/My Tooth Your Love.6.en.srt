1
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:25,172
Dad, Mom.

2
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:26,340
Sister.

3
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,010
You're awake?

4
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,579
Did you have a good sleep?

5
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,252
You've made new friends recently, right?

6
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:41,188
What's on your mind?

7
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,691
I think it's not bad.

8
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,361
Making new friends,

9
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,229
and dating someone.

10
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,397
You've grown up.

11
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:53,567
It's time to do something like that.

12
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,769
But,

13
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,973
are you sure he won't leave you?

14
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,511
How would you know it
if you haven't tried it?

15
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,748
Yes, we should try it,

16
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:08,915
and then we'll be able to

17
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,752
know the feeling
of having it and then losing it.

18
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,453
I don't think it will feel good,

19
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:16,423
but I don't know
what you think about it.

20
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,458
Want happiness?

21
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,560
You think when you grow up
and become braver,

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,596
you can make up
for what you did in the past?

23
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,197
You can forget

24
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,266
that you caused the death
of your Dad and Mom?

25
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,638
I don't care what you want to do,

26
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,640
but do you deserve to be loved?

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,183
Let me tell you a story about Xiaoming.

28
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:46,253
Xiaoming was very dependent
on his parents when he was a boy.

29
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,922
He always wanted them to
be with him no matter what he did.

30
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:50,791
On a stormy night...

31
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,893
Stop it.

32
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:53,493
Stop it.

33
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,562
(My teeth hurt so much.)

34
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,231
(My teeth hurt so much.)

35
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,166
I said "stop it". I can't hear you.

36
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,934
(My teeth hurt.)

37
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,670
(Daddy, Mommy.)

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,639
(On a stormy night...)

39
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,440
(It was all your fault.)

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,009
(Xiaoming's teeth hurt so much.)

41
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,478
(His sister asked him to
go to the dentist as soon as possible,)

42
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:15,182
(but he insisted that his parents
came back home from work quickly.)

43
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,750
(He caused his Mom and Dad)

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,685
(to have a car accident.)

45
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,154
(It was all your fault.)

46
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:22,689
(I hate Dad and Mom the most.)

47
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,157
(I don't want to see a dentist.)

48
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,725
(I don't want my sister
to take me there.)

49
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:26,693
(I want Mommy and Daddy.)

50
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,128
I know I did the wrong thing.

51
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:28,962
(I want Mommy and Daddy.)

52
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:29,863
Please stop it. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,866
(It was all your fault...)

54
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:47,616
(He did wrong and is afraid of the future.
Will he still move on after this nightmare?)

=My Tooth Your Love=

66
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,102
I didn't expect you to
invite me to rock climbing.

67
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,904
It is a full-body exercise
that builds muscle, endurance

68
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:46,139
and agility.

69
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,141
And it helps you sleep better.

70
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,111
I will have a good sleep tonight.

71
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:54,614
But, why do you like it?

72
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,449
You can do it by yourself,

73
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:58,552
and it's very quiet.

74
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:04,057
So you like to do things alone?

75
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,995
Time shouldn't be wasted
on unimportant persons.

76
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,231
I only want those
who are important to me around.

77
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,250
Bai Lang.

78
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,786
Bai Lang.

79
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:33,587
Bai Lang.

80
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,657
Hi.

81
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,897
What a coincidence seeing you here.

82
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,098
Yeah, it is.

83
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,433
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

84
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,834
I can teach you rock climbing.

85
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,769
I didn't know you could do that.

86
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,638
She is my good friend, Xia Mingyan,

87
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:54,140
a technical engineer.

88
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,209
Come, he's Jin Xun'an,

89
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,178
a dentist.

90
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,147
Hi.

91
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,483
A dentist can be so young?

92
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,619
He's not only young but very skilled.

93
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,554
If you have a toothache in the future,

94
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,888
go to him for registration.

95
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,824
I'm not in charge of registration.

96
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,459
You should go to the front desk.

97
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,427
But you're in charge of
the treatment, right?

98
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,864
Please take care of me, Dr. Jin.

99
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:25,605
Let's have a game.

100
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,073
Okay. You two...

101
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,076
Me?

102
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,916
I'm not very good at it.

103
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,219
You can. You've been working out.

104
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,054
No. I'm not good at it.

105
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,455
This is my first time rock climbing,

106
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,658
so I'm not...

107
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,760
Didn't I tell you
to get closer to Jin Xun'an

108
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,694
and get to know him more?

109
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,562
Didn't you see that he was cold to me?

110
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,964
I have more to talk about with you.

111
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,666
He just looks...

112
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,267
Excuse me.

113
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,906
The bento box you forgot in my house.

114
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:03,076
No need. I have a lot at home.

115
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:04,844
Yeah, you have a lot.

116
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,947
Here are two.

117
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,449
Take them.

118
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,523
It's his first time here,

119
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,957
so I'll play with you.

120
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,871
Alex, do you know
what kind of person you introduced?

121
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,406
She's so light-minded

122
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,008
and falls in love with everyone.

123
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,377
How could she be worthy of Jin Xun'an?

124
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:41,248
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

125
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,802
What do you want to do?

126
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:04,270
Mixing drinks.

127
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,338
You know how to do it?

128
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,606
I'll know if you teach me.

129
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,774
If you don't, go out quickly.

130
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:08,675
Have you done all the work...?

131
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,977
Yes, I have.

132
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,545
The number of customers
coming to drink this week

133
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,881
increased by 15% compared to last week,

134
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,649
but you're getting slower and slower.

135
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,752
To solve this problem,

136
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,387
either hire another bartender
or teach me.

137
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,124
But I heard bartender's salary is high.

138
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,625
It'll cost too much,

139
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,261
so the best solution is to teach me.

140
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,998
Getting a mixologist with a pay
equivalent to that of a waiter.

141
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:32,966
Perfect.

142
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,902
Okay, you're getting
more and more ridiculous.

143
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,470
You don't even know the basics,

144
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,005
and you want to
make drinks for the customers?

145
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,473
I'll know if you teach me.

146
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:43,243
I'm a quick learner.

147
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,245
Stop it. Give it to me.

148
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,813
Or you don't know how to teach?

149
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:47,514
How can that be?

150
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,315
Then that's a deal.

151
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,953
I know this is liquor,

152
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:57,190
then red wine, another kind of red wine,

153
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,994
and what you just poured was whiskey.

154
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,266
What's wrong?

155
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:21,381
Okay, I'll go out.

156
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,351
Let's start with the basics first.

157
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,022
There are

158
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,157
six kinds of base spirits for Cocktails.

159
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:31,991
Tequila.

160
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,560
Tequila.

161
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,093
Whiskey...

162
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,662
How to spell "tequila"?

163
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,730
It's written on the bottle.

164
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,834
What do you think
of the coffee just now?

165
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,236
I don't know.

166
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,138
You really have poor taste in coffee.

167
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,573
Then what other hobbies do you have

168
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,708
besides rock climbing?

169
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,844
Horse riding.

170
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:51,678
Horse riding.

171
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,547
Your hobbies really
make it hard for you to be got close to.

172
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:57,350
I don't think you will be well-liked.

173
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,786
My hobbies

174
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,187
are really different from yours.

175
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:02,655
I like activities
that involve a lot of people,

176
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:05,225
such as singing with a group of people

177
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,027
and having delicious food.

178
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:08,628
How about this?

179
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,763
I'll take you to
have tasty food in the future.

180
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,903
So you are inviting me out

181
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,738
now?

182
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:23,409
Just kidding. You are very busy.

183
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,677
You don't need to
always take care of me.

184
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,845
Are you planning to be selected

185
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,147
as an exemplary dentist or what?

186
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:31,150
You take such good care of patients.

187
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,721
Actually, you're not

188
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:36,756
just a patient to me.

189
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:41,794
Although I am a boy,

190
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,596
you shouldn't do that casually.

191
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:47,767
What did I do?

192
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:51,738
Saying something romantic
without consideration.

193
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,641
You have to take the responsibility.

194
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:58,177
For what?

195
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,379
You heard that?

196
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,648
I'm not casual at all.

197
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,884
Gender doesn't matter to me.

198
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:07,020
The point is

199
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,090
that I only hold myself
responsible for the person I care.

200
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,058
So do you like...?

201
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,295
It's dangerous.

202
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,864
What was that person doing?

203
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,933
You okay?

204
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,901
Yes.

205
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,606
I'm okay.

206
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,708
Why did you brake suddenly?

207
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,945
It suddenly...

208
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:34,447
It suddenly reminds me of a joke.

209
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:35,248
You haven't finished just now.

210
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,617
When Xiaoming was in school, he once...

211
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,584
No... That's not what I wanted to say.

212
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,919
That's not...

213
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,787
He...

214
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:41,287
What's the matter with you, Bai Lang?

215
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:43,022
Right, the principal...

216
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,158
No, no. Then Xiaoming...

217
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,459
Calm down, Bai Lang.

218
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,427
Wait.

219
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,836
Was he with Xiaobao or with whom?

220
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,771
It came to me before.
It came to me before.

221
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,573
I remember he saw a...

222
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,874
Calm down, Bai Lang.

223
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:02,675
Calm down.

224
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,843
It's alright.

225
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,511
But then the professor...

226
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,248
He shouldn't come.

227
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:09,949
Bai Lang...

228
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,317
But he was preparing for the exam.

229
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,853
It's alright...

230
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:14,887
It's alright.

231
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,824
It's fine...

232
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,561
Relax...

233
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,286
Thank you.

234
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,962
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,264
You saw me like this again.

236
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,568
It was not embarrassing.

237
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:08,107
One of my previous patients went through
something even more embarrassing.

238
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,442
He had oral cancer.

239
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,344
When I opened his mouth,

240
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:14,013
I saw his upper and lower gums
were festering...

241
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,015
Dr. Jin.

242
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,351
Do you know the way you comfort others

243
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:20,820
is really scary?

244
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,898
Bai Lang.

245
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:38,304
I know a good therapist.

246
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,307
I can introduce you to him

247
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:45,144
if you want.

248
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:46,746
Why did you say that?

249
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,347
What do you mean?

250
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:53,019
Because I think you were

251
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,054
having physiological
and psychological reactions

252
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:57,957
caused by acute anxiety.

253
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,393
Your sister once told me

254
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:02,895
that your parents
died in a car accident,

255
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:05,198
so it seems to me

256
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,632
that there must be some reason

257
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:11,237
for your nervousness and anxiety.

258
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,072
Maybe that's one of the reasons

259
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,908
for your insomnia
and dependence on sleeping pills.

260
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,377
I think

261
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:21,314
maybe talking to a therapist

262
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,449
will be helpful.

263
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,488
Can you not tell my sister

264
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:31,724
about what happened today
and the sleeping pills?

265
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,427
I really don't want her to be worried.

266
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,597
Okay, but you have to

267
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,199
tell me what made you

268
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,035
overreact to it.

269
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:57,116
I thought of Xiaoming.

270
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,885
I don't want to hear
stories of Xiaoming anymore.

271
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,153
I'm serious.

272
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,989
Xiaoming didn't know
what he was doing when he was a boy.

273
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:06,759
He had a toothache
but was afraid to go to the dentist,

274
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,227
so he insisted
that his parents drove back

275
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:11,097
on that rainy day.

276
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:13,032
When they were trying to comfort him

277
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:18,171
by talking to him on the phone,
they had a car accident.

278
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,405
When will you be back?

279
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:23,209
Mommy, I'm not feeling well.

280
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,311
Don't annoy Mom and Dad.

281
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,380
(Be good, Langlang.)

282
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,247
(We're almost there.)

283
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,715
(Give me the phone.)

284
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,184
(Focus on driving.)

285
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,518
(I'll talk to him.)

286
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,220
I want Mommy and Daddy.

287
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,820
(Langlang.)

288
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,454
(I promise you.)

289
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:35,922
(Your mom and I...)

290
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:44,797
(On the other end of the phone
were the screech of the brakes,)

291
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,799
(the sound of the thunderstorm,)

292
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,834
(noises from the collision)

293
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,771
(and screams.)

294
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,823
(So Xiaoming is afraid
of going to the dentist,)

295
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,327
(afraid of the screech of cars,)

296
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:17,530
(afraid of rainy days,)

297
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,265
(afraid of being alone)

298
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,201
(in a room without lights,)

299
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:23,135
(and hates lying)

300
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,238
(on the empty bed alone.)

301
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,413
So Xiaoming

302
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,183
always thinks

303
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,919
it was all his fault?

304
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,928
Stupid.

305
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,164
It was not your own fault.

306
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:55,167
You don't have to
be too hard on yourself.

307
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,971
You don't have to
take it all on your shoulders.

308
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:05,278
That was Xiaoming, not me.

309
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:12,084
Alright.

310
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:14,920
Sorry.

311
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,124
I turned off the lights twice.

312
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,226
It's fine.

313
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,896
Anyway, it's only you
who can turn off the lights in my house.

314
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,737
Thanks.

315
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,223
Are you feeling much better?

316
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:52,491
Yes.

317
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,797
Okay, then I will ask you a question.

318
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,599
It was me who invited you out, right?

319
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,170
What was that all about this afternoon?

320
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,771
You were fixing me up?

321
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,174
Nothing.

322
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:10,876
Can you drive me back to my bistro?

323
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:15,448
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

324
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:18,384
Cheers.

325
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,985
You're so excited today.

326
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:24,924
Great.

327
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,168
So you already knew

328
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,904
that Bai Lang is not mentally stable?

329
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,807
I only know
when there is a thunderstorm,

330
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,043
he will be in a very bad mood.

331
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,646
I found him out of breath once,

332
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,347
but he refused to tell me

333
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,516
what happened.

334
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,618
No one can get answers from him.

335
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,790
How could you just see him
trapped like that?

336
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,760
You know

337
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,428
he is so stubborn.

338
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,930
Even his sister can do nothing about it.

339
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,068
If you can't, leave him to me.

340
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,039
So do you

341
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,508
feel for him

342
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,309
or fall for him?

343
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,884
The latter.

344
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:29,455
Will your family be okay with this?

345
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,826
Does that

346
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:37,229
have any conflict
with my relationship with him?

347
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,266
So you're here to ask for my proval?

348
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,470
Whether you agree or not

349
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,006
will not affect our relationship.

350
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,942
Why are you talking to me?

351
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,911
Because you are his best friend.

352
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,611
So,

353
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,547
I respect that.

354
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,617
If I say no...

355
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,692
I don't drink.

356
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,163
Xun'an.

357
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:12,064
Let me introduce him to you.

358
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:14,467
He's my good friend, Jin Xun'an.

359
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,734
He's a dentist,

360
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,069
a very skilled one.

361
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,038
If you have any dental problems,

362
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,006
just go to him, okay?

363
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:23,776
And he has many talents
like rock climbing.

364
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,512
You know what?
He's a super fast climber.

365
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:27,446
Nice to meet you.

366
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:30,082
I'll have a word with him.
Enjoy your drinking.

367
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,918
Go ahead.

368
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,153
I'll have a chat with him.

369
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,921
Okay, I'll leave you two.

370
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,723
(Finally,)

371
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:40,125
(there's someone
who's able to keep him in control.)

372
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,900
Alex.

373
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,768
Do you know what other customers

374
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:51,403
think of you and Bai Lang?

375
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,738
What is it?

376
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:54,206
Well, a classic story

377
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:57,009
of a boss and a bartender.

378
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,611
Who told you?

379
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm not like you who's
always hiding behind the bar.

380
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,383
Maybe because I was forcibly kissed

381
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,185
when I was serving food,

382
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,654
I still got it in my mind.

383
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,023
I can't get out of it.

384
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,860
You were forcibly kissed?

385
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,564
What a bad person.

386
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,332
How could he do that?

387
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,200
We shouldn't learn
from that person, right?

388
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,603
We shouldn't...

389
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,241
Have some water.

390
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,184
Thanks.

391
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,322
Why did you start
speaking in English after drinking?

392
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,058
Happy.

393
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,595
You're not drunk?

394
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,498
Of course not.

395
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,037
People who are drunk
will always say they are not drunk.

396
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,439
Then will you be like this

397
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,409
when you're drunk?

398
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:05,578
I don't drink.

399
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,279
You know that.

400
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:14,653
I heard that doctors
are very good at drinking,

401
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,723
because they often inhale anesthetics.

402
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,393
Is that true?

403
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:24,463
You can invite me for a drink alone.

404
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,932
I don't mind it.

405
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,200
Sure.

406
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,136
Why not?

407
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,838
Alright, I'll send you home.

408
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,007
Rock climbing this morning
and drinking this evening.

409
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,442
You'll definitely have a good sleep.

410
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,887
You really like pulling me down.

411
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:53,325
Really? I don't remember.

412
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,495
Yes.

413
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,298
The first time you came to my clinic,

414
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:01,200
there was an earthquake.

415
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,202
You pulled me down

416
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,138
and got my hand hurt.

417
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:09,241
Later, your sister
asked me to tuck you in.

418
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,976
You pulled me down

419
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:14,246
and got my hand hurt again.

420
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,749
And,

421
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,917
when I was having a fever,

422
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:25,891
did you want to change my clothes?

423
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,661
Do I bring you misfortune

424
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,330
when I'm by your side?

425
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,000
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

426
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,703
I will start to teach you
how to mix drinks from now on.

427
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,139
How much do you know about wine?

428
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,207
Not much.

429
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,143
Like,

430
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:45,744
Martini has a strong flavor.

431
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:48,547
Margarita is mixed with
sweetness and sour.

432
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:49,348
The one with aroma

433
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,549
is Between the Sheets.

434
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:51,750
The one with a fruit flavor

435
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,085
is Sex on the Beach.

436
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:56,588
And Pink Lady with a dense texture.

437
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,957
Okay, you've searched for them all?

438
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,194
And also the language of wines.

439
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,863
Like, Martini is
wanting to talk to you more.

440
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,232
Others are waiting for love,

441
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,201
inviting you to have a one-night stand,
spending a passionate night together,

442
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,570
and Pink Lady,

443
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:16,275
I am into you.

444
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,116
Why do you want to learn these?

445
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:30,956
Because these are
the best sellers in our bistro.

446
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,624
What's wrong?

447
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,293
Pick one.

448
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:40,699
Pink Lady.

449
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,868
Not today.

450
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,636
I'll teach you Gin Tonic first.

451
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,672
Starting with the basics.

452
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,073
But the meaning of Gin Tonic...

453
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,008
Do you want to learn it or not?

454
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:55,981
Alright.

455
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,217
This is called Hendrick's.

456
00:23:58,217 --> 00:23:59,017
Hendrick's.

457
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,320
A kind of Gin that is commonly used.

458
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,287
It's Gin.

459
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,424
Basically, Gin Tonic...

460
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:07,559
Director.

461
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,294
(Xunying Dental Clinic)
Mr. Bai wants to see you.

462
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:12,197
What's the problem, Bai Lang?

463
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:13,232
Not me.

464
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:13,799
It's her.

465
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,501
This is my friend, a vintner.

466
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,202
This is Director Jin Xun'an.

467
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,971
Hello, I'm Jinli.

468
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,405
Langlang often tells me about you.

469
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:21,140
I didn't expect you

470
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,575
to be so handsome even with a mask on.

471
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:26,912
Your clinic looks very good.

472
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:30,215
Do you manage it yourself?

473
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,451
How can I help you?

474
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,220
Jinli, your teeth feel bad, right?

475
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,055
Yes, they feel bad.

476
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,424
Langlang recommended you to me
and said that you are meticulous

477
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,626
because I'm a bit afraid of pain.

478
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,361
I've been under a lot of stress

479
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:43,929
and had a lot of sweet food recently,

480
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,898
so I feel a little bit...

481
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,065
Sorry, my day is full.

482
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:49,568
You can go to other dentists.

483
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,238
Wait a second.

484
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,276
Just help her.

485
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:58,644
She came all the way from the south.

486
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:00,445
That's none of my business.

487
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,247
You're a doctor.

488
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,849
She's not feeling well. Just help her.

489
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,217
She looks good.

490
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:05,884
She doesn't.

491
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,953
And you're free until five o'clock.

492
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:08,854
Who told you that?

493
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:09,922
Apple.

494
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,591
She said you have
no patients coming until five o'clock.

495
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,662
Apple.

496
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:18,764
Yes.

497
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,801
Take that patient to Room 7.

498
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:23,936
Yes.

499
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,574
I'll see her first.

500
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:31,376
I'll deal with you later.

501
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:36,715
Deal...

502
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:37,783
Deal with what?

503
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:42,020
Is everything okay?

504
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,090
Your friend is really nice,

505
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,360
but he's slow
to warm up to strangers, right?

506
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,529
He looks cold.

507
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,599
He is slow to warm up to people.

508
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,801
Or did you have a quarrel?

509
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,369
Or I accidentally blacked out again

510
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,538
after drinking that day?

511
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,875
Actually,

512
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:06,211
when I first met you,

513
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:11,283
I thought you were
like an uncontrollable

514
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:15,587
and spoiled child.

515
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:19,925
But later when I was with you,

516
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,662
I found that some of your reactions

517
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,999
were actually very cute

518
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,800
and I wanted to tease you.

519
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:35,440
So,

520
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:40,345
except for being a doctor to you,

521
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:45,250
I want to

522
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,819
be your

523
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,955
life...

524
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:53,091
He's gone.

525
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,626
He's gone?

526
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,795
He looks like this

527
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,398
when he blacks out.

528
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:02,434
He looks sober,

529
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,903
but he'll remember nothing.

530
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,539
If you were saying something important,

531
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,176
I suggest you
tell him again another day.

532
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,417
You're so cute when you're drunk.

533
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,852
You'll be like this.

534
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,722
I would be like this.

535
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:25,357
It's also right.

536
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:26,658
How long will it still take?

537
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,394
Haven't you seen
the patient has waited so long?

538
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,030
I'm sorry.

539
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,966
Thank you so much for today.

540
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:37,002
I feel much better now. We're leaving.

541
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,437
Let's go.

542
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,006
Thanks for today.

543
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:42,941
What do you want to do?

544
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,077
I need to talk to you.

545
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:46,311
I got things to do.

546
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:47,913
See you next time.

547
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:48,547
Okay.

548
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:49,181
Bye.

549
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:50,248
Bye.

550
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:54,886
What do you want to say?

551
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:01,293
What's wrong with you today?

552
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,229
You're so weird.

553
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,165
I'm weird?

554
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:08,166
Yes.

555
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,068
Sure. I'm not like you,

556
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,004
chatting so happily
with your romantic friends.

557
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,407
It's not like that.

558
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,777
She's just a friend.

559
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:20,112
What are you thinking about?

560
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,448
That's great.

561
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:26,018
She sells wine, and you drink wine.

562
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,820
Why did you invite her to come here?

563
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,357
Well. Isn't it normal to go to a dentist
when having a toothache?

564
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,861
And what does that have to do with wine?

565
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:41,233
Yeah. Going to a dentist
when having a toothache.

566
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,836
But my clinic is not a place
where you can cut the line for others.

567
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,705
That was only because of you.

568
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,939
And I've told you

569
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,941
to stop introducing people to me.

570
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:53,111
I'm sending a patient to you.

571
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,780
Why the long face?

572
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,014
Why?

573
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,054
I don't need you to do that.

574
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:02,921
Are you playing dumb

575
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:03,989
or did you really black out?

576
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,857
I'm like an idiot...

577
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:07,559
Apple.

578
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,527
Yes.

579
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,596
Leave the stuff there.

580
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:13,031
You and Orange go out to take a rest.

581
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:13,999
Director, you have other...

582
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,467
Out.

583
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,802
I'll leave it here.

584
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,474
Jin Xun'an.

585
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:25,277
You mentioned "black out".

586
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:28,313
Did I do something that roasted you

587
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,849
the last time I was drunk?

588
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,486
Otherwise, why are you so unhappy today?

589
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:43,428
I only remember

590
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:46,264
I drank a lot last time,

591
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:48,400
and...

592
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,968
you and Alex were chatting.

593
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:53,505
Then...

594
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,907
Did he speak ill of me?

595
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:58,743
Definitely.

596
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,078
No wonder you became upset

597
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,746
when you saw me bring a woman here.

598
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,152
Then what bad things
can he say about you?

599
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,789
He could only tell you

600
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,126
that I asked him to
help fix you up at the most.

601
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,996
It was really a misunderstanding.

602
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:18,663
I have promised you

603
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,899
that I won't fix you up again,

604
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,033
and she's really my good friend.

605
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,101
I brought her here today

606
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,837
because she had a toothache.

607
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:28,540
Look.

608
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,075
I've texted you before.

609
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:31,843
Did you see it?

610
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,019
Okay.

611
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,454
I admit that I arranged them
without telling you beforehand

612
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:46,825
because I'm nosy.

613
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,693
It was a genuine mistake, okay?

614
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,999
But I really think
you deserve to be treated well.

615
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,640
Am I that good?

616
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,782
People who don't know you
would think you're picky,

617
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:14,052
indifferent and hard to get along with.

618
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,954
It is hard indeed.

619
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,756
Alright.

620
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,593
But after getting to know you,

621
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,429
they'll find you meticulous

622
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,065
and caring.

623
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:29,134
So I think you should
find the right person

624
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:32,771
who understands you, cherishes you

625
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,473
and is willing to be by your side.

626
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,985
Then have you ever thought

627
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:52,490
that maybe I've already found
the right one?

628
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,494
Our director

629
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:57,529
was very close to a senior

630
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,030
whose surname is Ye at that time.

631
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,465
He helped that guy every time he needed.

632
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,434
Everyone said

633
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,835
that they would end up together.

634
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,438
Look how cute our director was.

635
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:07,339
But that senior

636
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:09,274
married someone else in the end.

637
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,709
(Don't tell the director
that I told you this.)

638
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,477
(I'm not a gossip at all.)

639
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,246
(I know...)

640
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:16,248
Yes.

641
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,483
That person

642
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,421
is your senior, right?

643
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:29,194
But you deserve
someone better, Jin Xun'an.

644
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,161
Don't waste your life waiting

645
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:32,564
for someone who won't come back.

646
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,432
Everyone's life is limited

647
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:35,233
and unique.

648
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,901
Where did you hear that?

649
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,637
Listen to me.

650
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,779
Hello.

651
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,056
Don't sacrifice yourself

652
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,225
for anyone.

653
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:01,393
It would be a shame to miss it.

654
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:02,927
You should seize the day.

655
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,296
I'm telling you.

656
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:06,464
That was in my college days.

657
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,900
I don't know where you heard that.

658
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:12,103
Excuse me.

659
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,841

You are a regular customer here?

672
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:16,801
No.

673
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,836
I heard the coffee here is pretty good,

674
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,104
so I just want to try it with you.

675
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:20,905
Do you often drink coffee?

676
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:23,108
This coffee shop is small,

677
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,410
but the owner is awesome.

678
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,679
Here's your Americano,
and your coffee tonic.

679
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,747
Please enjoy it.

680
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,181
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

681
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,985
Why did you order that? So weird.

682
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:35,887
Try this cake.

683
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:36,721
It's limited.

684
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,923
I don't like sweet food.

685
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,326
I don't want too much sugar.

686
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:43,328
That would make it easier
to get cavities.

687
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,464
This is my self-discipline
and principle as a dentist.

688
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,999
Are you sure about this?

689
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:49,067
Fine. I'll have it.

690
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,042
(This sweetness is mixed
with bitter and sour tastes.)

691
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,812
(It's not to my usual taste.)

692
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:22,033
(Stop thinking about why he did it.)

693
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:25,103
(It's a code violation after all.)

694
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:29,274
(He obviously should have stopped
outside the boundary.)

695
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,445
Thank you.

696
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,117
Is it still hot?

697
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,852
No.

698
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:49,327
(Other people's love stories
look romantic,)

699
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:52,297
(but,)

700
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,999
(do I have the courage to set foot)

701
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,469
(on that desolate wasteland myself?)

702
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,307
Xun'an's first love came back.

703
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:03,441
He chose to leave

704
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,477
for some reason and felt regretful.

705
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,278
But after losing it,

706
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:08,379
he will cherish it even more

707
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,849
once he gets it back.

708
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,650
You said we should
get through all problems together.

709
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:15,253
How nice of you.

710
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:16,588
I have to be nicer to you.

711
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:17,622
He's mine.

712
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:18,623
Don't try to take him away.

713
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,325
That's why you've been avoiding me

714
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:21,226
lately?

715
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,695
Why do you keep talking
about the senior?

716
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:24,929
Stop it.

717
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,965
I don't want to mess up the friendship.

718
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:29,400
I am divorced.
