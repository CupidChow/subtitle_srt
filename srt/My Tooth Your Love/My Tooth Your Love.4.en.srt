=My Tooth Your Love=

19
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,691
You like cooking so much?

20
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,393
Not exactly.

21
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,663
You are doing it really well.

22
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:06,666
Thanks.

23
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,369
Actually, I just wanted my sister

24
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,605
to eat healthier at first.

25
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,173
Later, I graduated
but I didn't know what to do.

26
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:14,174
She said to me,

27
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:15,976
"How about opening a restaurant?"

28
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,611
I thought

29
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,778
it would be not bad.

30
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,413
I would have someone
eat with me every night.

31
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:21,548
How nice.

32
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:25,118
But you can't keep

33
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,754
regular hours.

34
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,290
I'm used to it.

35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,926
Every day, I go home
and immediately fall asleep.

36
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:34,160
How nice.

37
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:36,730
So you have insomnia?

38
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,101
Not really.

39
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,636
I just don't sleep well sometimes.

40
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:44,137
Are you full?

41
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,605
I'll go make two more dishes for you.

42
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,044
These are enough.

43
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,479
We're not having dinner.

44
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,180
I'll get you some water.

45
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,355
So you have the habit
of taking sleeping pills?

46
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,090
I'm not addicted to it.

47
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,991
Just

48
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,394
when I don't sleep well...

49
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,962
Don't worry about me.

50
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,931
I'm a heavy sleeper.

51
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,732
I can sleep through the entire night.

52
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,305
Then when can't you fall asleep?

53
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,543
When you don't drink enough?

54
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:24,878
Come on.

55
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:25,979
Do you think

56
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,013
every bistro owner is an alcoholic?

57
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,415
We drink

58
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,449
just to enjoy the atmosphere.

59
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,450
Just to relax.

60
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,484
OK?

61
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,356
You look tense.

62
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:39,092
Are dentists like you all stressed out?

63
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,226
Me?

64
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,394
Yes.

65
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,364
- No.
- No?

66
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:50,770
I'll ask you a question.

67
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,039
Why don't medium-rare steak

68
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,307
and medium-well steak

69
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,675
talk to each other

70
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:56,977
every time they meet?

71
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,248
Because

72
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:03,817
they don't know each other.
[*"Well-cooked" and "know" sound the same in Chinese]

73
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:05,518
It's because

74
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,020
steaks can't talk, okay?

75
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,021
It's a knowledge question.

76
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,556
Did you think I was telling a joke?

77
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:10,724
One more.

78
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:12,359
Okay.

79
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,894
Xiaoming is in math class,

80
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,096
and the teacher asks him,

81
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,797
"Xiaoming, you have 12 apples.

82
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,033
If you give some of them to two friends,

83
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,068
how many apples do you have now?"

84
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,666
How come Xiaoming is so busy?

85
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,236
You got a nice smile there.

86
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:57,937
You should smile more often.

87
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:58,972
Your face

88
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,340
is always taut.

89
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,175
I smiled because of the way
you told those jokes.

90
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,377
Yeah.

91
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,578
OK.

92
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:06,813
Your turn now.

93
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:07,981
Tell a joke

94
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:09,816
about Xiaoming.

95
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,552
Is it a bit difficult?

96
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,226
Come on, I'm waiting for you.

97
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,529
Tell a joke.

98
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,397
I'm going to the bathroom.

99
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,566
Are you gonna run away?

100
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,368
No.

101
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,037
Be quick.

102
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,172
I'll give you some time.

103
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,507
Don't let me down.

104
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,443
It must be about Xiaoming.

105
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,716
Xiaoming.

106
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:43,717
Xiao...

107
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,486
Xiaoming's mother...

108
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:53,159
Xiaoming's mother
asks his father to take out the trash.

109
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,295
His father says,

110
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,164
"I am not

111
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,501
voice-controlled."

112
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:30,530
Do you want to go to bed?

113
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,765
I'll tell it another day.

114
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:32,766
No, no.

115
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,400
I've just waited too long for you.

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,069
Come on.

117
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,303
I'm ready.

118
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:45,378
Then I'll start.

119
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,850
Xiaoming's mother

120
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,519
asks his father to take out the trash.

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,122
His father says,

122
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,590
"I'm not voice-controlled."

123
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,260
Then she hits him and says,

124
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,929
"You're touch-controlled."

125
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:38,398
The clerk says it is a drink.

126
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:14,934
(What's causing your panic)

127
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,337
(and insomnia?)

128
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,623
I didn't mean that.

129
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,730
Sorry.

130
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,865
I didn't know.

131
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,853
Sorry.

132
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,048
Morning, Andy.

133
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,938
Turned off the lights for me again.

134
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,379
Why do you always think I'm the bad one?

135
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:07,380
No matter what I do,

136
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,816
you never want to know the reason.

137
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,651
I just want to...

138
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:12,452
Hello.

139
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:14,687
Hello.

140
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,129
What's wrong?

141
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,368
The phone is innocent.

142
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:29,335
Don't take it out on it.

143
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,570
It's them who don't want...

144
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,904
What is it?

145
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,207
You won't understand.

146
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,475
Boy.

147
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,843
Treat others the way

148
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,378
you want them to treat you.

149
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,389
Thanks.

150
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:51,791
See?

151
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,658
It's that easy.

152
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,495
And your clothes

153
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,430
and other stuff.

154
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,598
Thanks.

155
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:05,938
Dr. Huang.

156
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:07,373
Please.

157
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,976
The director really
can't work this afternoon.

158
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:10,610
I'll help you

159
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,511
ask him for a pay raise.

160
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:12,278
Please.

161
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:12,879
Okay.

162
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,346
Only this time.

163
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,380
Thank you for your help, Dr. Huang.

164
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,314
Thank you.

165
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:17,984
Mr. Bai.

166
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,318
What happened to your director?

167
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,388
He looked ill when he arrived today.

168
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:23,923
He must be having a fever.

169
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,324
He refused to go home

170
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,859
and insisted on staying upstairs.

171
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:29,462
What's wrong?

172
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,263
I'll go have a look.

173
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,065
Mr. Bai.

174
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,032
You haven't made an appointment.

175
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:53,286
I said I'm just having a fever.

176
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:55,054
Don't be dramatic.

177
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:56,055
You okay?

178
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,992
You're burning up.

179
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,362
Why are you here?

180
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,466
I was gonna ask you
about the end of that joke

181
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,601
and I've brought you lunch to thank you.

182
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,169
But now,

183
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,871
I'll take you to see a doctor.

184
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,173
Wait.

185
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:15,775
I don't need to see a doctor.

186
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,043
You do.

187
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,912
Fever is human body's
self-protection mechanism.

188
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,581
I'm a doctor and I know it.

189
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,783
But you are a dentist.

190
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,618
Let's see a physician.

191
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,054
Let's go.

192
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:29,722
Be quick.

193
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,492
Be careful.

194
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,894
I just have allergies.

195
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,796
Did you bring your insurance card?

196
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,731
Hey.

197
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,765
He'll leave the clinic to you.

198
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,901
I'm taking him to see a doctor.

199
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,035
Don't leave it to him.

200
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:43,870
Be quiet.

201
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,104
I'll tell you if anything happens.

202
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,005
Don't worry.

203
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,006
Take care of the clinic.

204
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:47,773
OK?

205
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,142
No problem.

206
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:50,810
Let's go.

207
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,845
The director looks very ill.

208
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,649
You should have faith in others.

209
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,521
It's really unlucky to be your dentist.

210
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,990
You two have a special relationship.

211
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:08,861
Alright.

212
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:09,929
Go take care of it.

213
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:12,031
Bye.

214
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,299
Talk to you later.

215
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,103
The boss

216
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,171
is engaged today.

217
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,772
You two need to work hard today.

218
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:20,706
What?

219
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,608
Does he really have something to do
or just want to skip the work?

220
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:25,645
Get used to it.

221
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,015
Sorry.

222
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:30,082
We are not open yet.

223
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,584
I'm just looking for someone.

224
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:40,092
Look at yourself.

225
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,028
I'm working.

226
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:42,962
Enough.

227
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:46,232
I'm here now. Can we go home?

228
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,467
Look at you.

229
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:49,936
Running away from home

230
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,837
and working in such a place.

231
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:55,141
What would other people say
about us if they see this?

232
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,676
It'd embarrass your father.

233
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:58,744
Come on.

234
00:14:58,744 --> 00:14:59,712
Pack things up and come home with me.

235
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,680
No.

236
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:02,748
No?

237
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,252
Your father canceled your bank card.

238
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:07,853
I'm fine.

239
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,623
I can support myself.

240
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,458
You can go back home.

241
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,193
How can you say that?

242
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,428
Excuse me.

243
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,730
May I chat with you

244
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,799
about He Qingtian?

245
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,140
Just treating her to coffee.
Seems like you're hitting on her.

246
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,942
What's wrong with him?

247
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:33,779
Okay.

248
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,348
Thank you for taking care of him.

249
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,550
Never mind.

250
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,087
I'll show you out.

251
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,855
Alright. No need.

252
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,460
Qingtian.

253
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,128
I'm going home.

254
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,464
Take care.

255
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,905
Why did you hide in there?

256
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,542
Where's my mom?

257
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,681
Did my mom agree that I could stay here?

258
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:09,749
Yeah.

259
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:10,983
Your mother

260
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,151
is a nice and sensible person.

261
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,352
Not true.

262
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,488
Wait.

263
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,990
Are you collaborating with her?

264
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,127
You help my mom watch me?

265
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,128
All of you are the same.

266
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,397
Do you watch too many movies?

267
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,898
I told you.

268
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,366
Treat others the way

269
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,735
- you want them to treat you.
- You want them to treat you.

270
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,537
You've told me that.

271
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,705
They're the ones
who are making problems.

272
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,206
Did you tell my mom this?

273
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,110
One of the two sides
must learn to concede.

274
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:40,813
So...

275
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,615
My mom agreed that I could stay here?

276
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:45,818
Thank you.

277
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,987
If you really want to thank me,

278
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:48,921
just work hard.

279
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,156
Okay.

280
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:52,858
Wait.

281
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,594
Why do you dress like this?

282
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,764
Manners

283
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,834
maketh

284
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:03,536
man.

285
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,538
Good.

286
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,273
I'll teach you what to do first.

287
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,176
Copy that.

288
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,612
First, wipe the tables

289
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:14,947
with that.

290
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,015
This one?

291
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,084
Okay.

292
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:24,924
Watch out.

293
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,303
Then I'll

294
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:38,571
leave the dessert here.

295
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,473
Eat it when you get better.

296
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,508
You okay?

297
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,278
Yeah.

298
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,880
Alright. I'll get you inside.

299
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,881
This way?

300
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:50,983
I'm not feeling well.

301
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,418
Alright.

302
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:05,765
Take a rest.

303
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,832
I'll stay outside.

304
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,434
Tell me when you need me.

305
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,766
Jin Xun'an.

306
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,437
Wake up.

307
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,873
Get up and eat something
before you take the medicine.

308
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,044
I'm not hungry.

309
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,484
Get up.

310
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,319
Be quiet.

311
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:03,722
Come on.

312
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,760
You ask your patients
to take their medicine.

313
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,228
You're a patient now.

314
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,029
Get up.

315
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,035
You're well-built.

316
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,305
Sit still.

317
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,077
Get up.

318
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,814
Be a good boy.

319
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,283
Sit and have some porridge.

320
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:32,885
Then take the medicine, okay?

321
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,654
You're having a high fever.

322
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,356
You must take the medicine
as soon as possible.

323
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,176
♪Write down our list♪

324
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:44,327

326
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,637
I said no.

00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:58,444
Come on.

328
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:01,580
Just like when you go to the dentist.

329
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,748
Let me see your teeth.

330
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,450
Open your mouth.

331
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,856
You must brush your teeth

332
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,224
and floss every day.

333
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,692
They look healthy.

334
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,529
Is it okay?

335
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:22,092
♪If it's okay♪

336
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:27,940
Wait a second.

337
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,642
This porridge is hot.

338
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:30,543
Very hot.

339
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:34,413
Ah.

340
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,251
Yeah. Ah.

341
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,257
Here. Ah.

342
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,370
Here is the storage.

343
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,872
Those things that are not used

344
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,340
are put in here.

345
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,542
Why did you bring me here?

346
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:07,680
Watch out.

347
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,581
I'll help you.

348
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:09,615
Here is the bed.

349
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:11,517
No need.

350
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,119
The sofa here is very comfortable.

351
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,388
This one is more comfortable.

352
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,263
Blackout?

353
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,731
The wiring here is old,

354
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:26,966
so it often happens.

355
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:28,767
It's okay.

356
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:29,702
What else are you looking for?

357
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:30,970
Let me help you.

358
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,805
What are you looking for?

359
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:33,639
Can you see it?

360
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,009
Watch out.

361
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,956
Are you alright?

362
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:51,557
Yeah.

363
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:57,963
Here you are.

364
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,164
When you are at work...

365
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,233
You are bleeding.

366
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,234
I'll rub ointment for you.

367
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,068
Just a scratch.

368
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,336
You need to rub ointment on it.

369
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:05,237
Come on.

370
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:08,440
Hurry up.

371
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,874
No need.

372
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:09,908
No way.

373
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,076
No need, really.

374
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:11,977
We're opening soon.

375
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:12,811
Just a small one.

376
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:14,580
I'll help you. It's more convenient.

377
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:16,181
The medicine chest.

378
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,249
- No need.
- Where's it?

379
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,184
The cabinet over there.

380
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,190
Just a small one.

381
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,360
Come over here. I'll help you.

382
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:34,133
I'm really fine.

383
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:34,867
I can do it myself.

384
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:35,401
No.

385
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:39,805
Disinfect it first.

386
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,707
This is the ointment.

387
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,308
Not this one?

388
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:47,813
This one?

389
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:56,955
One second.

390
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:09,334
What are you thinking?

391
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:13,472
I...

392
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:15,674
I kissed you last time.

393
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:16,775
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,512
You have already apologized.

395
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,880
Why did you mention it again?

396
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:25,117
You take it so seriously.

397
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,122
Was that your first kiss?

398
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:31,957
No.

399
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,058
I was right.

400
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,428
Chill.

401
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:39,665
Take it easy.
You still haven't had your first kiss.

402
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,334
But didn't we

403
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,502
do this?

404
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,538
If you

405
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,140
do this without love,

406
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,742
it's just a touch of lips.

407
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:50,976
It doesn't count.

408
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,813
So it is...

409
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,317
You will understand one day.

410
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,685
Boy.

411
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,356
Next up is...

412
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,826
You obviously don't know how to do it.
Why did you insist?

413
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,528
I will know it after I learn it.

414
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:18,637
Are you alright?

415
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,072
I'm good.

416
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,009
What do you want to do?

417
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:25,410
I'm going to the bathroom.

418
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,519
It doesn't look like a bathroom.

419
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,386
Yeah.

420
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:39,792
- Watch out.
- I can do it.

421
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,826
Can you?

422
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,199
Get up.

423
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,200
I'll wipe your sweat.

424
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:55,641
Stay still.

425
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,510
I'm not feeling well.

426
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,078
I know.

427
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,951
I'll change your clothes.

428
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,287
I'm not feeling well.

429
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,064
Change your clothes

430
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:20,132
yourself.

431
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,533
I'll go get your clothes.

432
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:23,368

443
00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,905
my task is complete.

444
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,574
Take a rest early.

445
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,576
I'm leaving now.

446
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:24,116
Take a rest early.

447
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,151
I'm leaving now.

448
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:29,488
Wait.

449
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:34,993
What are you saying?

450
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,495
What's the problem?

451
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,636
You took care of me
and didn't have a good rest.

452
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:49,074
(He suddenly approached me again.)

453
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,179
(Was it involuntary)

454
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,014
(or on purpose?)

455
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:02,187
(I can't tell the difference
between being tempted and heartbeat.)

456
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,995
Would it be better
for you to stay away from me?

457
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,598
(Actually, it feels good
to have you around.)

458
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,133
Like Alex said,

459
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,637
it's not good to be close to me.

460
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,338
(But it seems like a good thing)

461
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,240
(to meet you.)

462
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,075
The hand.

463
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,409
Okay.

464
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,118
Alright.

465
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:37,856
(Only this time,)

466
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,691
(- I don't want to leave you alone.
- Don't leave me alone.)

467
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,427
You fall for him?

468
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,529
What does that feel like?

469
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,765
Loving someone is not that complicated.

470
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:48,667
Isn't it a good thing
to be brave and tell your feelings?

471
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,202
But you may not

472
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:51,837
get the love you want.

473
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,905
Leave your teeth to me.

474
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,243
I will be with him

475
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,478
as a friend.

476
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:00,545
It's better for him.

477
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:02,547
I'm a big trouble myself.

478
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:04,516
Sometimes I don't even know what I want.

479
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,218

480
