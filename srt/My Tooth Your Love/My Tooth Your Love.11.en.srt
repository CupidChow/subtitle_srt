1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:02,049
I'm just going to buy
some daily necessities.

2
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,817
Why did you come with me?

3
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:05,385
Don't you go to your...?

4
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:09,589
I just want to go shopping with you.

5
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,826
I'm not the kind of man who ditches
his friends to be with his boyfriend.

6
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:18,699
What?

7
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,567
Are you going to make mulled wine?

8
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,969
That's romantic.

9
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:26,973
You're my best friend and know me.

10
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:30,477
Is this one suitable?

11
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:32,112
Basically, red wine with low tannins

12
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:34,915
can be used to make mulled wine.

13
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,249
This one is okay.

14
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:41,121
Would you like to buy one by the way?

15
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,390
It's boring to drink it alone.

16
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:49,262
I think that's enough.

17
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,731
I need something else.

18
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,233
Chocolate.

19
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,668
Chocolate?

20
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,342
Excuse me.

21
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,814
Little busters.

22
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:10,984
So rude.

23
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,388
RJ is much cuter than them.

24
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,989
Right?

25
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:22,629
What are you doing?

26
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,967
Eating.

27
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,604
How can you eat Bai Lang's chocolate?

28
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,239
I don't know that.

29
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,374
I found it in the cabinet.

30
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:36,209
Did you ask his permission?

31
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,212
He's your boss anyway.

32
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:42,215
I didn't know it's his,

33
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:45,185
and it's going to expire tomorrow.

34
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,620
Look at the date.

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,258
Even if it expires,
you can't eat it without permission.

36
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,260
I know.

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,495
So I bought a few more boxes.

38
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,697
I'm not that impolite,

39
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,867
and I like this brand too.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,307
RJ.

41
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:15,048
Stop spacing out. Come to pay.

42
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,653
What's wrong?
You're not used to shopping

43
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:21,388
with people other than RJ?

44
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:23,757
Don't think you are in a relationship

45
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:27,561
and the whole world
will follow along, okay?

46
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,729
Just take care of yourself.

47
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,601
Did you bring money?

48
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,569
No.

49
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,238
Sir, card or cash?

50
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,940
Card.

51
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:42,375
What are you doing?

52
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:45,812
This card.

53
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,380

00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,570
and bring me that spoon.

69
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,206
The wooden one.

71
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,045
The biggest one.

72
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,414
Hurry up.

73
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,316
This one?

74
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,686
Stop.

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,727
What's the matter?

76
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,563
Are you in a bad mood?

77
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,731
Yeah.

78
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:13,667
I changed my shift

79
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,935
and was very much
looking forward to this little trip.

80
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,670
But there's only one night.

81
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,941
Sorry.

82
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,244
I forgot school was going to start.

83
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,946
We have to cooperate with schools

84
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:31,051
to do some dental health publicizing,

85
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,986
so we are on a time crunch.

86
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,325
You have to because of your busy work.

87
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,427
What am I supposed to do?

88
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,462
I have no other choice.

89
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,764
You're really angry?

90
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,932
Or what?

91
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,704
I was teasing you.

92
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,840
It's a happy thing to hang out with you.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,841
I'm not angry at all.

94
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,142
Hurry up and sit down.

95
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,313
It's such a creative idea,

96
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:01,948
urban camping.

97
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,550
I think it's very good.

98
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:07,187
Really?

99
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,788
I really like it.

100
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,826
It's done. Try it.

101
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,928
It's a little hot. Be careful.

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,803
You know I don't drink,

103
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,839
but you made this for me.

104
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,474
What do you want to do?

105
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,676
I wonder if a person
is really more truthful

106
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,245
when inebriated

107
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:35,181
or if alcohol really provides people
with liquid courage?

108
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,984
Or drunken...?

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,530
Where do your parents live?

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,201
What do you want to do?

111
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,637
To meet my parents?

112
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:02,008
No.

113
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,244
I've just been really thinking lately,

114
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:07,480
what if they

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,482
disagree?

116
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,520
I think it's better for you

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,155
to feel them out first.

118
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,389
After all, they're the elders.

119
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:21,361
Don't make a family revolution

120
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:23,730
and get kicked out of the clinic.

121
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,503
What if I do it

122
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,139
and am left with nothing?

123
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,809
Will you still be by my side?

124
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,185
I won't.

125
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,290
What did you say?

126
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,759
I won't leave you.

127
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,696
My sister used to say

128
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:00,533
it would be hard
for people to be with me.

129
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,369
Why?

130
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,239
Because I'm difficult.

131
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,008
Are you?

132
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,211
Always pretending to be cool.

133
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,679
I don't think so.

134
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,949
And like posturing.

135
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,717

00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,152
Hey!

137
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,889
And she said

138
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,924
when I was young,
I liked to pretend to be an adult,

139
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,127
so I lacked innocence,

140
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:31,064
and I may become more naive
as I grow older.

141
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:35,235

146

but we must solve it together.

the other will be patient and wait,

00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,966
Mr. Jin Xun'an.

175
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,402
You have the right to remain silent.

176
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,038
Any statement can be used

177
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,740
against you in judicial proceedings.

178
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,678
Some people say

179
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:35,248
eyes and hearts are connected.

180
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,217
It was these eyes

181
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,587
that made me not afraid.

182
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:46,559
Slowly, my love for them

183
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,796
spread to my heart.

184
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,867
Do you agree with the above?

185
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,573
I'll take your look as a yes.

186
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,343
Hand out. Hurry up.

187
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:05,345
Left hand.

188
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,316
Be gentle.

189
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:11,751
Don't move.

190
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,288
Stay still.

191
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:24,998
From now on, you will be my man.

192
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,699
No resistance.

193
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,534
No complaint.

194
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,370
Did you hear me?

195
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,810
The play is over?

196
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,481
Childish. Go cook quickly.

197
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,483
(My love, my heart.)
What? Childish?

198
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,885
(My love, my heart.)
This is romance, okay?

199
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,689
You're so boring.

200
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,307
♪With you, there are no regrets♪

201
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,261
Boring.

202
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,865
What are you doing?

203
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,700
Nothing.

204
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:05,196
♪I like simplicity♪

205
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,110
It was romantic when I sent that to you.

206
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,680
Why did it turn into a gangster movie
when you sent this to me?

207
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,782
Come on. Take a closer look.

208
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,151
I carved every word on it by hand

209
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,452
and spent three days and three nights.

210
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:20,586
I didn't even sleep.

211
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,822
Take a closer look, okay?

212
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:38,471
Where did this cute policeman come from?

213
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,773
Arrest me.

214
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,209
I already did.

215
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,946
This criminal, you can't escape.

216
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,622
Wait. It's itchy.

217
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,925
It's itchy, Xun'an.

218
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,301
Wait.

219
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:09,335
You're hungry, aren't you?

220
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,570
I'll cook something for you first.

221
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,904
I'm not now.

222
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,213
Phone's ringing.

223
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,581
Forget it.

224
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,716
No.

225
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,085
Maybe there's
something urgent in the clinic.

226
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,622
Pick up.

227
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:32,458
Hurry up.

228
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,733
Who is that?

229
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:44,971
Who is that, this criminal?

230
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,440
Wait a minute. Let me get this.

231
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,941
Get my coat for me.

232
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,512
Wait for me.

233
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,580
Wait for me.

234
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,792
(Why do you go there
to answer the phone?)

235
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,794
(In addition to "Sure Enough",)

236
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,164
(is there "As Expected"?)

237
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,736
(It's a good thing
I got him handcuffed.)

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,110
There's no food here.

239
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,546
What does he eat?

240
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:40,326
What's wrong?

241
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,563
Hold on.

242
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:51,571
Xun'an, will it be much longer?

243
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,006
I'm still on the phone.

244
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,741
Wait a minute.

245
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,110
Then I'm going back to my bistro.

246
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,346
There's an emergency.

247
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,515
Okay. Be careful.

248
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:05,218
Hold on for 20 minutes.

249
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,018
I'll be right back.

250
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,553
Okay. Bye.

251
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,411
(I'm going to
White Dark Bistro & Flavor.)

252
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,647
(RJ is not there and Alex is swamped.)

253
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:35,781
(Eat sandwich)

254
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,216
(for your stomach.)

255
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,384
(Your refrigerator)

256
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,619
(is so empty.)

257
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,349
(You better not go home.)

258
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:53,443
(I will still go back tomorrow.)

259
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,362
I'm telling you,
the French toast here is super tasty.

260
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:24,864
I'll bring it to you later.

261
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,433
Thanks.

262
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:34,057
(Sorry. I was in surgery just now.
The clinic is a bit busy today.)

263
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:45,792
(SA BAI TIAN)

264
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,823
Hello. Can you tell me about these?

265
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:51,857
Our specialty is milk mochi.

266
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,026
(It's famous. You will love its food.)
It has 12 in a box

267
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,328
and three flavors,

268
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,963
peanuts, sesame and Oreo.

269
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,165
You can dip it.

270
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:02,034
It can be kept until tomorrow night

271
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,303
at room temperature. No need to freeze.

272
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:04,837
Yes.

273
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:05,971
Okay.

274
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:07,506
Thanks.

275
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,574
Thanks.

276
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,477
Hello. Do you need an introduction?

277
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,713
One specialty.

278
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:15,448
One specialty?

279
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:22,221
(I am not in the clinic.
Let Apple and A take it for me first.)

280
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,756
Our turn, finally.

281
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:30,596
Try it...

282
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:31,263
It tastes so good.

283
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,732
- Good?
- You try it.

284
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,072
Sir.

285
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,942
Are you done?

286
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,586
So much. Are you sacrificing?

287
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:57,323
I bought it for Jin Xun'an.

288
00:17:57,323 --> 00:18:00,526
But he said he was not free.

289
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,795
Is he so busy
that he has no time to see you?

290
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:03,629
He's busy,

291
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,332
but he just said
his employees could eat for him.

292
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,235
No.

293
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:12,238
He said he wasn't free.
I don't want to play up to him.

294
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,208
Why do you have to
keep score in a relationship?

295
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,945
I must,

296
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,914
or I will be restless.

297
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,918
Stop playing with food.

298
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,753
Gao.

299
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,588
No.

300
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,992
If this goes on,

301
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,227
I feel like I'm going to be dumped.

302
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,964
Jin Xun'an said he wanted
to break up with you?

303
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,566
When?

304
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,302
No.

305
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:44,904
He said nothing.

306
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,440
I was just talking to myself.

307
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,175
But...

308
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,343
But what?

309
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,412
But we have only seen once

310
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,514
these ten days.

311
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,830
Hello.

312
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:13,132
(What are you doing?)

313
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,868
Nothing.

314
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,304
I didn't open up today

315
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,272
and spent the whole day hanging out.

316
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,009
You have time to call me?

317
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,846
(I miss you.)

318
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:31,116
Come to me.

319
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:33,786
Show. Don't tell.

320
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:39,191
(I'm in the park below your house.)

321
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,228
Wait for me.

322
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:51,971
Xun'an.

323
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,576
I miss you so much.

324
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,311
What happened?

325
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,847
Alright.

326
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,149
I just worked late
and I'm a little tired.

327
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,085
Tired?

328
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:07,353
I am telling you,

329
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,658
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,927
Why?

331
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:18,531
I've been too busy lately
to have time to accompany you.

332
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:20,866
I'm not a kid.

333
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,434
You don't need
to accompany me all the time.

334
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,403
I'm busy, too.

335
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:27,273
You should take care of yourself.

336
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:28,574
I do.

337
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:30,976
Have you gotten any sleep lately?

338
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,344
You have deep dark circles
under your eyes.

339
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,812
No.

340
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:35,981
What's wrong?

341
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,516
Are you coming on to me?

342
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,884
I'm not.

343
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,554
You get skinny.

344
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,489
No.

345
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,128
It's raining. Do you want to go
to my house and sit for a while?

346
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,597
No. I still have things
to do in the clinic.

347
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,165
I have to go back later.

348
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,267
Go back and don't get wet.

349
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,835
I've been busy lately.

350
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,471
I don't have time to take care of you
if you're out of your temper.

351
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:00,739
I won't lose my temper
with you by my side.

352
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,041
I'll go with you.

353
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,281
How about this?

354
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,187
After I'm done,

355
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,523
and when we both have free time,

356
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,759
you make food for me.

357
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,362
Of course.

358
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:29,435
But you're not hiding
anything from me, are you?

359
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:35,774
No.

360
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,879
I almost forgot.

361
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,657
I bought your favorite cookies.

362
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,692
It's a new flavor.

363
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,261
Thanks.

364
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,067
Fine.

365
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:04,670
But remember...

366
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,339
I'm not alone.

367
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,444
Then I'm going back.

368
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,712
Go back.

369
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:38,637
Go back.

370
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,808
Tell me when you're done.

371
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,143
Goodbye.

372
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:45,244
Goodbye.

373
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,384
It's strange, isn't it?

374
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:55,054
Seems like he's going
to fight somewhere far away.

375
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,593
I'm very worried, sister,

376
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:03,095
but you're laughing.

377
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,329
No.

378
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,131
You're serious about this relationship,

379
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,132
and I'm happy for that.

380
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,935
I'm the only one who is serious, okay?

381
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,204
He doesn't even have time for dating.

382
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,272
I said I wanted to see him,

383
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,908
but he said he was busy with work.

384
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,144
What do you think Jin Xun'an means?

385
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,147
Do you think he's the kind of man

386
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,550
who doesn't cherish
after he gets something?

387
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,953
I don't think so.

388
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:29,922
That's why it's more annoying.

389
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,325
Did he encounter some difficulties?

390
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,526
And he doesn't want me to know?

391
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:36,695
Do you think I should ask?

392
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,166
If you were him,

393
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,469
what would you want the other one to do?

394
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,472
If I were him,

395
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:49,475
I would want the other one
to believe in me

396
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,744
and wait for me

397
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,546
until I'm done.

398
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,185
I got it now, sister.

399
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:01,887
It makes sense.

400
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:02,688
But that's okay.

401
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,189
If Jin Xun'an is not the right person

402
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:05,891
in the end,

403
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:06,658
I'll "kill" him

404
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,460
and introduce a new one to you.

405
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,962
Trust me. The next one will be better.

406
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,565
What are you talking about?

407
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,033
I'm serious.

408
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:21,173
What about you?

409
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:24,309
You're still alone.

410
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,011
I think it's good.

411
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,848
Everyone defines happiness differently.

412
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,451
If you are happy, I am happy.

413
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,418
Because then

414
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:35,487
I can leave home.

415
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,289
What does it mean? Where you're going?

416
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,290
It doesn't matter.

417
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,259
I want to eat garlic pasta this evening.

418
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,059
I miss it so much.

419
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,462
Where are you going?

420
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,198
I'll tell you after you make it.

421
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,601
Okay. Lots of garlic and little oil?

422
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:50,936
Yes.

423
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,745
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

424
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:00,712
Look at the tables.

425
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,281
Let me do it.

426
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:04,149
We're not open yet.
They'll sort them out later.

427
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:05,617
The menus are so untidy.

428
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:06,885
That's because Gao...

429
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,520
Gao didn't tidy them up yesterday.

430
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,655
Take a look at this table.

431
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:10,455
Look over here,

432
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:11,323
and here.

433
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:12,124
Okay...

434
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,725
It's clean and shiny now, isn't it?

435
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,694
Thank you.

436
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:16,528
Thanks, Yun.

437
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:17,496
Try it.

438
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:20,032
This rice stew is created by Yun.

439
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,466
Yeah?

440
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,401
Okay. Let me try it.

441
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:24,736
Does it taste good?

442
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,840
Yes, even better than what you make.

443
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,508
Say it again.

444
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:31,710
It's on par with...

445
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,912
The best is what I make.

446
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,488
Aren't you the son of "Sure Enough"?

447
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,557
What are you doing here?

448
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,392
The pasta last time is so delicious,

449
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,728
and I want to have it again today.

450
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:52,264
Okay. Where's your dad?

451
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,465
Here.

452
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,534
"Sure Enough".

453
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,102
Come in together.

454
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,738
Ye Qiran.

455
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,442
Bai Qing? Why are you here?

456
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:05,177
This is my brother's bistro.

457
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,612
Oh, yes.

458
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,747
It's been a while.

459
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,315
Say hello.

460
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,183
Hello, beautiful lady.

461
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,252
My name is Ye Zhanyang.

462
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:15,687
So cute.

463
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,157
You are so beautiful.

464
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,560
Really? You're so sweet.

465
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,263
He's... your son?

466
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,597
Yeah. Is there a problem?

467
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:27,065
No.

468
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,734
I'm taking you to eat
delicious rice stew, okay?

469
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,302
Okay.

470
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,070
It's a waste to be your son.

471
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,839
Any drinks?

472
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,140
Yeah.

473
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,344
Yummy.

474
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,513
Do you prefer to eat chicken or beef

475
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,782
or pork?

476
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:44,850
Mutton.

477
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,251
You like mutton?

478
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,987
Are you really here for pasta

479
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,589
or for something else?

480
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,692
Zhanyang kept saying

481
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,761
he wanted to eat your pasta.

482
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:57,596
That's it?

483
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:58,764
Yeah.

484
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,235
That day I went to Xun'an

485
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:06,071
just to say goodbye. Don't get me wrong.

486
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,572
I don't.

487
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,974
Are you sure?

488
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:10,142
If you are sure

489
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:11,944
you just want to stay in his past,

490
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:14,513
then stay in the history textbook.

491
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,114
Don't come out to play pranks

492
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,550
or bring trouble to Xun'an.

493
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,690
You want to know why I came back, right?

494
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,625
I'm listening.

495
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,231
I was too young at that time.

496
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:37,369
I would love to be close to him

497
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,938
but I was also jealous of him.

498
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,340
He was so good

499
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,743
that he made me feel inferior.

500
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:50,515
So I chose to go to America
to start a business, live

501
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,518
and start a family.

502
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:57,189
I thought it was the best arrangement

503
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,191
for myself and my family.

504
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:04,329
I thought that was happiness then.

505
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,069
I seem to understand you suddenly.

506
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:14,506
Your family background
made you feel inferior,

507
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:18,110
and my past made me feel guilty.

508
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,144
Yes, Xun'an is so good

509
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:22,881
that we don't know what to do.

510
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:27,386
So, in the process of moving forward,

511
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,821
people gain and lose.

512
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,256
The point is to find happiness

513
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,191
in our own choices.

514
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,495
You're a good person,

515
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:37,229
different from your sister.

516
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:39,564
Here's to you.

517
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:40,866
Of course.

518
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:50,675
I admit that I went to Xun'an

519
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:53,945
when I came back

520
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,181
just because I wanted to find

521
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:59,551
that piece of driftwood in the vast sea.

522
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,953
Fortunately, you

523
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,991
let me know I should rely on myself.

524
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:10,662
I'm telling you,

525
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:13,932
tell him what you have in mind,

526
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:17,769
or you will feel frustrated

527
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,472
by what he does in private.

528
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:22,474
What does that mean?

529
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:24,943
You'll know when you
spend more time with him.

530
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:41,193
Has this lady shouted at you?

531
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:41,760
No.

532
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,861
No?

533
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,663
I'm telling you, this lady

534
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:47,199
used to be super cranky.

535
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:47,966
At school,

536
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,035
no man dared to approach her.

537
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,837
You know what? She was a "grim reaper"

538
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:53,171
and was ferocious.

539
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,139
I'm still ferocious.

540
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,741
Do you wanna have a try?

541
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,076
No. Thank you.

542
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:01,613
Because we're going to move.

543
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:02,848
Move?

544
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:05,584
I'm going to teach in Hualian.

545
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:13,125
It doesn't matter. Anyway...

546
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,227
Blessings to you and Xun'an.

547
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,064
Thanks.

548
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,401
Does this rice stew
taste good, Zhanyang?

549
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,402
Yeah.

550
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,404
Which one is better,

551
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:27,172
this one or the pasta last time?

552
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:28,773
They're both good.

553
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,809
How sweet of you.

554
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,044
What if I can't eat it in the future?

555
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:34,779
I'll make it for you.

556
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:36,314
Yours tastes bad.

557
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:38,216
I'll make it for you, okay?

558
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,451
Okay.

559
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,629
What exactly is your owner up to?

560
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:54,032
He doesn't reply
to my messages or miss me.

561
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,736
Does he get bored with me this fast?

562
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,810
Didn't we say to reassure each other?

563
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,580
Is that hard?

564
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:37,375
Alright.

565
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,177
I forgive you.

566
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,046
It's not your fault.

567
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:04,800
(Xun'an: Sorry. I'm busy and have no time
to accompany you. Get rest. Miss you.)

Why are you back?

590
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,689
Your dad is coming home from work.

591
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,958
How is your injury? Let me take a look.

592
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,227
It's no big deal. Just a bruise.

593
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,095
It looks worse than it is.

594
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:12,130
Bruise. You were beaten
like this last week.

595
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,165
What will happen this week?

596
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,568
Dad just...

597
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,269
He was told about me and Bai Lang,

598
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:20,171
and it was a bit much for him.

599
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:22,374
How can you still defend him?

600
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,977
He beat you so hard. I worry about you.

601
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:27,379
Go... You go back first.

602
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,747
I'm going to talk to him.

603
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:29,781
Talk?

604
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:31,449
You and your father are really the same.

605
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,817
Stubborn.

606
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,088
Did Bai Lang

607
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:39,524
ask you to do this?

608
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,993
No. He doesn't want you to know.

609
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,795
He worries you won't accept it.

610
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,897
I just don't want to lie to you

611
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:50,602
and want him, who had grown up
without his parents' care,

612
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:53,071
to have a complete family.

613
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:54,205
I'm going up.

614
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:57,175
You know your dad's temper. Be careful.

615
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,143
And,

616
00:34:58,143 --> 00:34:59,778
if you have to kneel all night,

617
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,212
I'll get you a cushion.

618
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:02,814
Don't be that stupid
and kneel directly on the floor.

619
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,883
Okay... Don't worry.

620
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,722
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

621
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,957
No. I've eaten.

622
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,098
What are you doing?

623
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:23,768
(Nothing. I didn't open up today)

624
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,637
(and spent the whole day hanging out.)

625
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:27,338
(You have time to call me?)

626
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,610
I miss you.

627
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,549
(Come to me.)

628
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,018
(Show. Don't tell.)

629
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:45,957
I'm in the park below your house.

630
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:48,793
(Wait for me.)

631
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,582
(Love)

632
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:14,385
(makes people afraid of losing.)

633
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:18,256
(Protect each other in my own way...)

634
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,257
(Love)

635
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,660
(makes people afraid of losing.)

636
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,362
(Keep waiting for the other one)

637
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:26,998
(without wavering...)

638
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:30,768
(So that you can come
to me without worry.)

639
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,770
(So that I can go to you)

640
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,440
(without worry.)

641
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,581
How are things with you and Jin Xun'an?

642
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:45,383
What have you been up to?

643
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:46,618
I'm afraid

644
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,586
I'll lose my courage when I see you.

645
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:50,154
That's so sweet.

646
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:50,989
Do you miss me

647
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:52,123
these days?

648
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,992
Miss me? I don't think so.

649
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,627
Not what I pictured.

650
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:57,195
Unless I die...

651
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:59,364
