Do customers like this batch of baijiu?

2
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:03,417
They really like it.

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:06,253
(I have a great time
in White Dark Bistro & Flavor,)

4
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:08,755
(with lots of people playing with me.)

5
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:11,158
(It is always lively here,
day and night.)

6
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:13,327
(I won't be alone anymore,)

7
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,696
(and I don't need to fear)

8
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:18,532
(somebody will disappear.)

9
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:20,500
(The customers coming and going,)

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,601
(I don't need to know them all,)

11
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,338
(just some casual chat.)

12
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,807
(You won't feel sad)

13
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,476
(as long as you don't have
strong ties with other people.)

14
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,845
(Just watch them having fun there.)

15
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:33,213
(I don't need to compromise)

16
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:35,749
(or to be understood.)

17
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:38,051
(Just being alone.)

18
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:42,089
(It's okay)

19
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,124

=My Tooth Your Love=

31
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:38,311
I just thought you and the senior...

32
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,546
Wait.

33
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:46,653
Why do you keep talking
about the senior?

34
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:47,721
Have you heard anything?

35
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:48,422
And what are you thinking?

36
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:50,424
I haven't heard anything.

37
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:51,291
So that's why

38
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,360
you've been avoiding me.

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,095
I'm not.

40
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,830
Didn't we see each other this afternoon?

41
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,865
I'm not avoiding you.

42
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,400
Look at me.

43
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,371
Look at me.

44
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:09,376
Bai Lang, the right one
who I've found...

45
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,111
Stop.

46
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:12,446
Stop talking.

47
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,047
I don't want to mess up the friendship.

48
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:19,853
I think for the relationship
you're expecting...

49
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:20,787
Your senior is really good for you.

50
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,556
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,858
Listen to me...

52
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,159
Sorry, I just asked

53
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,361
about your college life before,

54
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,130
and your senior was mentioned.

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,866
That guy, right?

56
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,134
Right?

57
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:34,601
That's all in the past.

58
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,402
So...

59
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,604
A senior does exist, right?

60
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,206
Right?

61
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,808
First love is the most unforgettable.

62
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,009
He is back now.

63
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,311
The person you missed is back.

64
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,047
You should cherish him

65
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,082
and don't make the same mistake again.

66
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,652
I mean it. I think...

67
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:56,957
It's rare to meet
someone I can hit it off with.

68
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:57,924
I really cherish the friendship.

69
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,459
So,

70
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,361
I'm sorry

71
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,897
if there's any misunderstanding.

72
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,966
I didn't mean that.

73
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,376
Don't be like that, Bai Lang.

74
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,018
Be honest with me.

75
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:26,953
I know it.

76
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:27,587
We have

77
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,355
the same feeling for each other,

78
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,524
right?

79
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,495
No.

80
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,466
It's different.

81
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,504
We are just the doctor and the patient.

82
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,573
It just so happens
that you know my sister,

83
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,309
and your clinic
is very close to my bistro.

84
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,511
So we often eat, drink

85
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,847
and talk with each other.

86
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,248
I'm happy and I like the way it is.

87
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:58,518
But...

88
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,720
But we're just

89
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,257
friends.

90
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:06,793
Sorry.

91
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:07,894
I'm really busy today,

92
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:10,497
so I gotta go.

93
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,232
I slept well this afternoon.

94
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,034
A good sleep.

95
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,559
(Xunying Dental Clinic)
So he's the senior's son.

96
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,994
So you just came back from the US

97
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:41,795
with your dad, Zhan Yang?

98
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:42,262
Yes.

99
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,664
Judging from his teeth,
he must be six or seven.

100
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,766
He's not a horse.
Let me take a look at your teeth.

101
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:47,867
So cute.

102
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,869
His face is so cute.

103
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:50,971
How cute. Your teeth are super healthy.

104
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:51,938
Can I pinch your face?

105
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,975
Does your clinic offer a franchise?

106
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:00,880
Of course. You can
never have too many friends.

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,316
But are you sure?

108
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,218
It's a way.

109
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,654
I have a son to raise.

110
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:09,756
The point is

111
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:12,225
that you still treat me as a friend.

112
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,496
Isn't it a good thing?

113
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,368
Yeah. It's good.

114
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:24,270
(Stop talking.)

115
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,439
(I don't want to
mess up the friendship.)

116
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,708
(We are just
the doctor and the patient.)

117
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,343
(It just so happens
that you know my sister,)

118
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,113
(and your clinic
is very close to my bistro.)

119
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,614
(So...)

120
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,724
I hope Jin Xun'an won't be stupid

121
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:46,593
and be used by him.

122
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:47,560
Be used?

123
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,563
Yeah, that's what they said
at school, but I'm not sure.

124
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,533
Weren't they good friends?

125
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,035
Why did other people say that?

126
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,203
They really had
a good relationship at that time,

127
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:58,705
and Jin Xun'an helped Ye Qiran

128
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,107
get an internship
at Xunying Dental Clinic.

129
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,909
But after the internship,

130
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,644
he left and started his own business.

131
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,479
Not long after that,
he got married and went to the US.

132
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,848
Everyone was surprised.

133
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:23,797
Is "Sure Enough" a good choice for him?
[*Ye Qiran's nickname]

134
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,699
Or just the opposite?

135
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:29,335
Why do you keep asking about Xun'an?

136
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,871
You care so much about him.

137
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:34,140
Well, isn't it normal for friends

138
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,909
to care about each other?

139
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,611
And he healed my teeth.

140
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:41,548
What kind of person do you think he is,

141
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,983
the "Sure Enough" guy?

142
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,686
Who is "Sure Enough"?

143
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:49,222
Well, Ye Qiran.

144
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,591
Him?

145
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,159
Hard to say.

146
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,662
Life is not easy for him.

147
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,697
His sister is sick

148
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,333
and his father was paralyzed
by a construction accident,

149
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,669
so it's a good thing
that he's still a good man.

150
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,137
In normal terms,

151
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:08,374
he's a hard-working, motivated,

152
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,009
kind and patient young man.

153
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,478
He specializes in pediatric dentistry

154
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,446
and has a good reputation.

155
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,489
So he's good for him.

156
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,459
But I'm not sure.
I've only met him once.

157
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,863
I'd better see him
and check again some time.

158
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,837
I've told you
not to offer weekday lunch.

159
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,273
You don't think you're busy enough?

160
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,576
I just want to earn more money

161
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,012
so that we can go out to play.

162
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,081
These are for the clinic?

163
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:52,418
Okay, you can spy on him then.

164
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,754
I'm leaving.

165
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,590
Did you make some for me?

166
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,992
Of course not.

167
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,630
Manager, let's eat.

168
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,564
Where did you get those?

169
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,398
The boss made them.

170
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,400
He made some for us.

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,135
This guy.

172
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,470
He just won't admit it.

173
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:12,806
It looks delicious.

174
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:13,573
What is this?

175
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,208
Spaghetti, I think.

176
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,677
What do you want to eat? My treat.

177
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,513
Your treat? Then I will
eat something expensive.

178
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,048
How expensive could it be?

179
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,184
Director, thank you for treating us

180
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,119
to lunch again today.

181
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:26,886
Let's get ready.

182
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,289
You can share it.

183
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,256
Thank you.

184
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,760
Kuan, can you help me with the cutlery?

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,128
Okay.

186
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,265
Bai Lang, why are you...?

187
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,434
I've been taken great care of
by you before,

188
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,537
so I brought some new dishes

189
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,806
created by me here for you to try.

190
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,210
Since you're here,

191
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,278
would you like to...?

192
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,647
I... Have your lunch first.

193
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,016
We'll talk later.

194
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,119
Everybody.

195
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:04,023
Thank you for the delicious food.

196
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:08,061
We hope we can have it every day.

197
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:10,997
I'm not sure if it tastes good,

198
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,365
but you can just let me know

199
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,133
what you think.

200
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,235
Be honest with me.

201
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,036
Tell me the truth
whether it's delicious or not.

202
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:19,205
Of course.

203
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,407
Orange, pass that to me.

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,109
Okay.

205
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,744
Thanks.

206
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,013
Your taste hasn't changed.

207
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,148
You still like this.

208
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:30,950
You really have a good relationship.

209
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,619
You still remember this.

210
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,355
When I was young,

211
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:37,924
I was busy every day.

212
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,627
He looked after my sister for me.

213
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,264
How is your sister?

214
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,267
She's fine, and she always ignores me.

215
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:47,734
Director.

216
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,003
I never heard you talk about this.

217
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,671
Would you like to share it?

218
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,538
You love to listen to stories so much.

219
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,807
Should I tell you about it clearly

220
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,142
so that you don't need

221
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,011
to embroider it?

222
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,945
Yeah.

223
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,980
Last time when we hung out together,

224
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,482
you kept asking about it.

225
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,417
I'm just curious. Why is it wrong?

226
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,318
Right, Jie?

227
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:06,085
You're one to talk.

228
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,587
Last time when I went out with my mom,

229
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,888
you stalked us.

230
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:09,689
See?

231
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,525
I wasn't stalking you.
We just met by chance.

232
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,327
By chance.

233
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,996
I'm watching the legendary scene now.

234
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:19,899
So do you want my autograph?

235
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,402
What does that mean?

236
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:26,172
The legendary pair, "Comfortable".
[*Jin Xun'an and Ye Qiran as a pair]

237
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,874
"Comfortable"?

238
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,044
When your director
was a college student,

239
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:33,079
he always kept a poker face

240
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,714
and turned down anyone
who asked for his help.

241
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,816
Do you remember the time
we played the piano together?

242
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,351
Shu and your classmates
kept begging you,

243
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,987
but you refused immediately.

244
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,088
If I hadn't helped you,

245
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:42,855
the whole world would never know

246
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,190
our wonderful pair.

247
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,358
I helped you, didn't I?

248
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,826
The dean asked you to do it.

249
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,295
I helped you, okay?

250
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,631
Who do you believe, everyone?

251
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,232
A, tell me, who do you believe?

252
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:54,100
Who?

253
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,779
Who is the king?

254
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,249
I am the king.

255
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,319
No.13

256
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,222
and No.15 hug each other.

257
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,023
Stupid.

258
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,224
Senior.

259
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,325
Stupid.

260
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,660
Come on.

261
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,695
Then No. 3 and No. 5 kiss each other.

262
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,797
Who's No. 3?

263
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:25,365
Who's No. 3?

264
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,034
Who's No. 3? Show yourself.

265
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,338
Who's No. 5?

266
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,007
I'm No. 5.

267
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,711
This is so cool.

268
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,447
Kiss...

269
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,216
Wait.

270
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,518
Let's do it.

271
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,189
No, senior.

272
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,240
(I heard you did a lot of crazy things.)

273
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,043
(Everyone was crazy at that time.)

274
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,083
(You...)

275
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,853
(Should I stop indulging)

276
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,689
(in what you've done for me?)

277
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,388
You are up so early.

278
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,125
You okay?

279
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,628
Go take a shower to sober up.

280
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,096
You smell like alcohol.

281
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,603
Thanks for throwing
a graduation party for me.

282
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,477
If No. 3 wasn't me last night,

283
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,846
would you still kiss him?

284
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,351
Why are you asking this?

285
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,954
I have no idea.

286
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,556
Probably not.

287
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:15,001
Senior.

288
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,003
Let's be together, okay?

289
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,952
Have you ever thought

290
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:35,988
that you are nice to me

291
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,024
probably just because you feel for me?

292
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,892
Just like doing charity work,

293
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,361
the kind that makes you addicted
after you keep doing it for a long time.

294
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,230
How can it be?

295
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,233
Aren't we happy together?

296
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,235
And that's enough.

297
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,604
What were you talking about?

298
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,173
You know what?

299
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,677
Actually, I'm always envious of you,

300
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,512
even jealous of you.

301
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,249
Because you have everything,

302
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,184
and I have nothing.

303
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:09,388
Sometimes I am very angry with myself.

304
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,357
How can I accept everything you give me

305
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,025
so naturally

306
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,927
and let everyone know

307
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,530
how differently you treat me?

308
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:22,335
Being with you

309
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:25,371
sort of gratifies my vanity

310
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,807
and makes up for what I don't have.

311
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:31,244
You don't have to think

312
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:34,347
about the problems after dating me,

313
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,784
because you are perfect,

314
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,152
but I am not.

315
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,727
You know how hard my life is.

316
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:52,031
If we get together,

317
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:53,432
have you ever thought

318
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,934
about what I'm going to face?

319
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,502
You don't have to work hard
if we get together.

320
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:59,205
Yeah.

321
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,341
And then?

322
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,111
People would say

323
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,613
that I live off my junior at school

324
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:12,351
and live off a man after graduation.

325
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,755
"Comfortable"?

326
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:19,292
Actually, I'm not comfortable at all.

327
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,773
So

328
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:39,712
you never had special feelings for me?

329
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,903
Just forget about what I said.

330
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,908
(Maybe you'd be more comfortable)

331
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,045
(without me in your life.)

332
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,918
Come in, please.

333
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,022
Are you full?

334
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,024
Yeah.

335
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,194
Don't shut the door.

336
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,507
Let me ask you.

337
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:45,311
Are you using me

338
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,948
to see how Bai Lang feels about you?

339
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,189
Am I?

340
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,127
I think you are.

341
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:06,465
You seem to have changed.

342
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,102
Isn't it normal?

343
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,071
It's been so many years.

344
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,541
People change.

345
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,048
After so long,

346
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,084
do you still have feelings for me?

347
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,857
Will it still work

348
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:36,429
if I tell you now

349
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,098
I regret turning you down?

350
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,907
Senior.

351
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:48,674
Everyone

352
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:51,544
should be responsible for their choices,

353
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,513
including us.

354
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,283
When I was young,

355
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,151
I didn't know what love is,

356
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:04,156
so I always wanted
to hold on to everything I had.

357
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:07,326
But when I grow up, I understand

358
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:12,498
love is about companionship
and protection.

359
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,468
So,

360
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,236
actually, I've always wanted

361
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:20,272
to apologize to you
for being selfish at that time,

362
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:21,874
and thank you

363
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:25,678
for letting me know those things.

364
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:33,853
Looking back, I said those things to you

365
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,454
just because I didn't want

366
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,790
to let myself go on like that.

367
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,727
Maybe I was just trying
to prove something. I don't know.

368
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,296
I was rejected by you,
but I came around later.

369
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:52,471
I'm the one who should say "thank you".

370
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,009
You helped me so much before,

371
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:00,012
but I had nothing to give back to you

372
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,448
and made you so sad.

373
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,384
Sad.

374
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,454
Was I sad?

375
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,459
I think it was just a habit,

376
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:17,530
a habit of putting
your needs on top of mine.

377
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,770
Anyway, I didn't know
what I wanted at the time.

378
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,411
I thought you were still waiting.

379
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:39,418
Yeah.

380
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,587
But not waiting for you.

381
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,090
Can I have baked rice?

382
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,826
- Creamy baked rice.
- And dessert...

383
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,628
Hope there will be dessert next time.

384
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,330
I want to eat some brownies.

385
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,364
Have you written it down?

386
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,333
Can I? Let me write it for you.

387
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,634
Okay, you can write down

388
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:56,101
all your opinions.

389
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:56,802
Okay...

390
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,137
Alright.

391
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,639
I'm gonna say bye to your director.

392
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm going back.

393
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,855
Excuse me.

394
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:21,560
I just want to say goodbye.

395
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,661
Goodbye.

396
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:34,273
He didn't take it.
Remember to give it to him next time.

397
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,109
Director, where are you going?

398
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,677
Director...

399
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:39,778
What?

400
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:42,081
That way.

401
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,332
Are you still afraid
of seeing a dentist?

402
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,768
If you are the dentist,

403
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:03,869
I will not be afraid.

404
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,571
Actually, you're not

405
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,439
just a patient to me.

406
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,648
You always think too much.

407
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:16,548
No.

408
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:17,516
No?

409
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:18,717
Why are you always afraid

410
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:20,152
to take the first step?

411
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,621
You're always stopped by yourself.

412
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,456
Hold on.

413
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:25,891
Have you heard of YOLO?

414
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,526
You only live once.

415
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,228
There is only one life.

416
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,963
Do whatever you want to do.

417
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,898
Don't hesitate.

418
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:37,102
Maybe I've already found the right one.

419
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:51,650
Leave your teeth to me.

420
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,120
Nothing bad will happen.

421
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,222
Here you are.

422
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,464
So I'm not one of the "others".

423
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,801
You have to overcome
what you are afraid of by yourself.

424
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,069
No one can help you.

425
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,103
You'll stay where you are.

426
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,305
Okay, calm down...

427
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:14,540
Alright...

428
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,909
It's fine...

429
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,612
You're pretty reliable.

430
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,181
Call me if you're in need.

431
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,486
Bai Lang.

432
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:28,153
We have

433
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,956
the same feelings, right?

434
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:45,571
Bai Lang.

435
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:46,472
I can explain.

436
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,240
My relationship with my senior
is not what you think it is.

437
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,375
- Believe me.
- Listen to me.

438
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,011
He's not the point.

439
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,447
What does that mean?
"He's not the point."

440
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:58,817
Don't you mind?

441
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:02,454
I'm sorry I lied to you that day.

442
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,594
What did you lie about?

443
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,830
I said

444
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,067
your feelings were different from mine.

445
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,668
That was not true.

446
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,974
I have

447
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,309
the same feelings for you.

448
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,412
Same?

449
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,382
I don't understand.

450
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,222
We are just the doctor and the patient.

451
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,158
It just so happens
that you know my sister,

452
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,960
and your clinic
is very close to my bistro.

453
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,429
So we often eat, drink

454
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,398
and talk with each other.

455
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:47,733
I'm happy and I like the way it is.

456
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:51,036
But...

457
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,771
But we're just...

458
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:07,452
You pushed me away
when you didn't want me.

459
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:12,624
And now you want me back as you wish.

460
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:15,427
Is that what you call "the same"?

461
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:21,733
But Xun'an, do you...?

462
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,536
Did I ever push you?

463
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,772
I don't know if you ran back on impulse

464
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,574
or if you really thought it through.

465
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,675
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

466
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,510
Who are you to say in front of me

467
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,311
that you feel the same way

468
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,981
as I feel about you?

469
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,349
I just wanted to say...

470
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,151
I... you...

471
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:42,221
Do you know what you're saying?

472
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:43,722
Oh, my God.

473
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,294
Since the first time I sent you home,

474
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,562
can you really not feel

475
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:55,734
my feelings for you?

476
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,302
When I was explaining,

477
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,338
you never heard me out

478
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,140
and only cared about yourself.

479
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,376
I can feel it all.

480
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,078
I'm just afraid.

481
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,616
Afraid?

482
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:11,183
You're afraid.

483
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,919
Then have you ever thought
about how I feel?

484
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,420
Yeah, and that's the reason.

485
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,523
I'm worried that you'll get hurt
because you like me.

486
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,658
I have my own problems.

487
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,561
Your problems are not mine.

488
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:23,829
Fixing me up without telling me,

489
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,397
pushing me to my senior,

490
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,635
and threatening me.

491
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,203
You threatened that
if we kept going like that,

492
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:32,671
we couldn't even be friends.

493
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,539
Do you know you've gone too far,
Bai Lang?

494
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,107
I like you,

495
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:37,409
but it doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want to me.

496
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,378
I didn't mean that.

497
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,313
Jin Xun'an, I know I'm a coward

498
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,282
in relationships.

499
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:44,349
But that's because if I love someone,

500
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,285
I would become self-willed,

501
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:49,688
which made me lose my family.

502
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:50,722
So I never thought

503
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,125
I deserve to be loved.

504
00:26:56,028 --> 00:27:00,432
Then don't you think it's self-willed

505
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:02,601
for you to suddenly run back

506
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,371
and tell me that you like me?

507
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:07,906
Should I be happy now,

508
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:10,342
kiss you and give you a hug?

509
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:13,145
And that's the happy ending?

510
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,881
It's not like that, Bai Lang.

511
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:19,751
Love is not only up to one person.

512
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,087
And the way

513
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,456
you treat my affection,

514
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:27,092
do you think...?

515
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,561
Do you think you're
the only one who's uneasy?

516
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,262
I'm really sorry.

517
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,464
I didn't mean to hurt you.

518
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:33,165
I...

519
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:35,434
You ran back today because of Ye Qiran.

520
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,404
You panicked.

521
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,006
But do you really know

522
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:43,742
what you want?

523
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,011
Can you take the responsibility

524
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:49,214
for your saying "I like you"?

525
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,055
Xun'an...

526
00:27:57,055 --> 00:28:00,225
What exactly do you want to say?

527
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,995
I'm really sorry.

528
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,363
I don't need your apology.

529
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:07,733
You still don't know what I want.

530
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:11,703
Okay, so what do I have to do

531
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:13,905
to let you believe me?

532
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,350
I always believe in you.

533
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:31,656
But the point is,
do you believe in yourself?

But not waiting for you.

549
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,670
You've really changed.

550
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,071
You become

551
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,074
more comfortable and confident

552
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,076
and know more clearly what you want.

553
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,579
I'm wondering if...

554
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,448
There's no "if".

555
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,883
I think I have made it

556
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:07,085
very clear.

557
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:13,091
Do you really understand me?

558
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:19,397
So,

559
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,433
you understand him?

560
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,635
And he understands you?

561
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,037
Does he like you?

562
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:28,607
Yes.

563
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:29,841
How can you be so sure?

564
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:31,877
I'll let him know

565
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,012
who he really wants.

566
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,953
Now I'm here.

567
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:46,458
Are you sure he will believe you?

568
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,094
Yes.

569
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,497
Excuse me.

570
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,469
I just want to say goodbye.

571
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:58,370
Goodbye.

572

00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,152

576
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,921

00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:18,089
(The rest)

578
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,625
(is up to you now.)

579
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:22,194
Good for you.

580
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:23,428
Aren't you afraid I'll run away?

581
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:24,996
Just run.

582
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,132
(Temporary Combat Center)
The beginning is always the hardest.

583
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,099
I can do it.

584
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,968
(The way to a man's heart is through his stomach)
Here's something for you.

585
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:30,769
Lunch.

586
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,438
No one beats me.

587
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,140
He looks cold,

588
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,508
but he's actually very soft-hearted.

589
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:38,310
This is my first kiss.

590
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:40,912
Okay?

591
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,582
Please let me date Bai Lang.

592
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:44,983
