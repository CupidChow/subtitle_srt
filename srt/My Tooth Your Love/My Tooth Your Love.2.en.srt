00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,485
You'll stay with me from now on.

2
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:11,954
What did you buy this time?

3
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:14,457
I didn't buy it.

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:15,825
It was given

5
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,027
by a dental clinic.

6
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,595
You went to the dentist?

7
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,296
Yeah.

8
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,897
My sister forced me.

9
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:24,934
Why are you so afraid of
going to the dentist?

10
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,703
I used to have a toothache

11
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,072
and it took a long time
before I saw the doctor,

12
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,474
so...

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,075
Forget it.

14
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,011
What about this time?

15
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,913
Wasn't there an earthquake just now?

16
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:42,351
Earthquake.

Go back and rest.

Don't get in the way.

I've taken medicine today.

Boss.

50
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,606
If you've taken the medicine,
just go back to rest.

51
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,708
You haven't had a good sleep
for many days because of your toothache.

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,450
How can an employee
treat his boss like that?

53
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:19,586
Okay.

54
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,587
We won't care about you.

00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,956
Won't you?

56
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,225
My sister isn't home.

57
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm lonely.

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,894
I feel cold.

59
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,063
Stop it.

60
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:30,997
Are you going back or not?

61
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,332
No.

62
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,400
Are you sure?

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,901
Yes.

64
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,636
Okay, then I'm leaving.

65
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,839
Alright, I'll go back and you stay here.

66
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,974
Good boy.

67
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,944
You two are sure about this?

68
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,613
Sure. It's not the weekend.

69
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:47,247
Yeah.

00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,583
Tell Bin that I have
all the ingredients ready.

71

(He's not a good patient.)

77
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,516
Hello.

78
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,085
Mom, what's wrong?

79
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,519
Your dad wanted you not to be so busy.

80
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,655
Make friends if you have time.

81

The guild chairman's daughter
just returned to China.

84
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,662
Mom.

85
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,331
I'm focusing on work now.

86
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,967
Don't worry about me.

87
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,569
I have to work hard

88
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,037
so that you and dad can enjoy your life.

89
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,006
Didn't you say you want to go to Spain?

90
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:46,906
Right?

91
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:49,109
How can you say that?

92
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,144
Sounds like we're holding you back.

93
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:52,779
You're thirty.

94
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,181
I didn't mean that.

95
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,683
Don't put pressure on me.

96
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,418
I know what I want.

97
00:03:58,418 --> 00:03:59,019
Okay?

98
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,854
Someone else is calling me.
I'm hanging up. Bye.

99
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,460
Hello, senior.

100
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,194
Junior.

101
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,030
Can you come to my house
to see Langlang's condition?

102
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,232
Please.

103
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,234
What are you talking about?

104
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,135
Do you know

105
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,703
how hard it is raining?

106
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,471
You're a good person.

107
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:21,207
You saw that he was very scared today.

108
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,343
And he rarely takes medicine.

109
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,112
I'm afraid he's allergic to some drugs.

110
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,248
He's already your patient anyway.

111
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,416
Treat me as your VIP.

112
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,818
Imagine you're doing customer service.
Do me a favor.

113
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,028
I'm there.

114
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:42,929
You there?

115
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,230
On the third floor.

116
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,909
Was there any response?

117
00:04:56,776 --> 00:05:00,313
Excessive worry is one of the symptoms
of generalized anxiety disorder.

118
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,082
It's the love between siblings.

119
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,483
I've called him so many times,

120
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:04,117
but he didn't answer,

121
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:04,784
and he isn't in the bar.

122
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,119
Shouldn't I be worried?

123
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:09,856
Bai Lang opened the door?

124
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,326
No. Someone else just came out.

125
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:14,761
I'm going up now.

126
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,262
Your brother is not a child anymore.

127
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,564
Don't be so dramatic.

128
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,301
I have to do that.

129
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,438
Our parents passed away so early.

130
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,574
Langlang was only eight at that time.

131
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,243
Just a little boy.

132
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,145
In the last week,

133
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,748
he was crying because of his toothache.

134
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,984
But only after one week, he told me...

135
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,029
Sister.

136
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,465
Let's go to the dentist tomorrow.

137
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,100
Aren't you most afraid
of going to the dentist?

138
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,769
It's okay. I'm brave.

139
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,440
Are you sure?

140
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,110
Have it.

141
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,146
The result of his sudden growth

142
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,114
is that he doesn't
tell me anything about him.

143
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,016
He doesn't want me to be worried.

144
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,085
He says he's alright,

145
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,255
but it's actually not like that.

146
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:19,559
What he fears the most
in his life is a toothache.

147
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,127
And I'm not with him now.

148
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,696
Teeth are his weakness,

149
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,698
and he is my weakness.

150
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,599
You...

151
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,301
You refused to join
the student union to help me.

152
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,636
You owe me much.

153
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,205
Take this chance
and take care of him for me.

154
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,541
Where is the key?

155
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,475
Don't you be that stupid,

156
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,111
thinking it's
in the mailbox or by the door?

157
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,280
It's in the transformer box
next to the door.

158
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,320
Smart.

159
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,425
Yes, no one else will find it.

160
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,894
How is it? Have you gone in?

161
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,333
Don't worry. I'm in there.

162
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,048
Is anyone here?

163
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,683
Is he there?

164
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,924
His TV and lights are on.

165
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:25,925
Didn't see him.

166
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,127
He must be in the room. Go there.

167
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,531
Go straight down?

168
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,198
No.

169
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,633
Go to the left side after you enter.

170
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,287
Is he there?

171
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,390
There's no response.

172
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,325
Open the door.

173
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,127
That's rude.

174
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,730
His life may be at stake.
Just open the door.

175
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,306
Is Langlang there?

176
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,942
Yes. Take it easy.

177
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,944
His life isn't like
what you said, at stake.

178

Let's video chat.

179
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,147
He's alright. He's sleeping.

180
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:22,582
Cute, right?

181
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,951
He sleeps like an angel.

182

Let's video chat
so that I won't be worried.

Shush what?

184
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,524
What happened?

185
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,625
Is there something wrong with him?

186
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,360
- What happened?
- Wait a second.

187
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,063
How is he?

188
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,299
Sir.

189
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,133
Did he wake up?

190
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,435
Sir.

191
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,736
Is he in a coma?

192
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:45,471
Langlang.

193
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,539
Langlang, are you okay?

194
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,575
Go wake him up.

195
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:49,742
How is he?

196
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,276
Is he allergic to some medicine

197
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,945
- or what?
- He's sleeping like a pig.

198
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,247
That means he is in a coma.

199
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,882
Please. Let's video chat.

200
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,417
Let me take a look at him.

201
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,787
- Please.
- I'll take a picture of him for you.

202
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:02,789
Sent it.

203

208
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,563
Isn't it too much?

and don't help me either.

No.

345
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,523
Bai Lang.

346
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:31,924
Hello, Aggie.

347
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:32,892
I didn't see you.

348
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:33,726
Sorry.

349
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,860
I just sat down over there with Alex.

350
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,095
Let me introduce new friends to you.

351
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:37,796
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)
Director.

352
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,732
What would you like,
Japanese food or Thai food?

353
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,634
There're many restaurants around here.

354
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,574
White Dark Bistro & Flavor.

355
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:49,241
Director.

356
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,809
I've heard of this from Apple.

357
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,878
Their stew is delicious.

358
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,481
Shall we go in it?

359
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:00,486
Welcome.

360
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:02,688
Do you have a reservation?

361
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:03,489
No.

362
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,190
How many?

363
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,024
Two.

364
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:06,058
This way.

365
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,293
Do you have stew today?

366
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,060
Stew?

367
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,961
That's our signature dish.

368
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,363
But if you can eat it
depends on our boss's mood.

369
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:12,865
Come here. Please take a seat.

370
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:13,632
Thank you.

371
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,501
Here is the menu.

372
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,105
Sir, are you looking for the restroom?

373
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,374
Turn left and go straight.

374
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,444
Drinks are on me.

375
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,045
Great.

376
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,947
Come on. To drunk Kai.

377
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:29,114
Wish him an early escape from misery.

378
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:29,548
Cheers.

379
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,083
I'll drink for him.

380
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,017
OK.

381
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,119
Wish him an early escape from misery.

382
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,343
Don't you know that drugs
can't be taken with alcohol?

383
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,939
(Thank you for coming over
for my sister last night.)

384
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:36,308
(It's)

385
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,911
(Bai Lang's Exclusive Paella)

386
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,946
(to energize you.)

387
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:41,847
(Hope you like it.)

388
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,216
(Good luck with your work. Come on.)

389
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:44,883
(Wait.)

390
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,353
(Lost and found.)

391
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,521
(Did you notice
that you lost your earphone?)

392
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,533
(Sincerity)

393
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,703
(needs to be understood.)

394
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:07,172
(Those you take for granted,)

395
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,742
(those you think are easy,)

396
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,678
(once you give it a try,)

397
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:14,546
(there will be a gap.)

398
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,684
(A certain emotion is awakened)

399
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,919
(unconsciously)

400
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,955
(and gradually)

401
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:24,857
(grows out.)

402
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,324
You didn't see that.

403
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:32,293
Your manager was kissed by a little boy.

404
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,128
You should take the charge.

405
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:35,830
Of what?

406
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,131
So rude.

407
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,802
My teeth hurt.

408
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:42,970
Bai Lang.

409
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,642
Maybe your teeth don't want to say

410
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,310
goodbye to me now.

411
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,180
Trust me.

412
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,316
I have never let a patient down.
