(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

23
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,144
Why don't you go to the dentist

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,669
as you have a toothache?

25
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,224
Don't you think

26
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,094
it'll be fine later itself?

27
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:14,848
Bro.

28
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,088
It'll only get more serious.

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,464
Go to the dentist.

30
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,434
No, no.

31
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,080
I'll never go to the dentist

32
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:24,544
as nothing good will happen.

33
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:25,772
Boss.

34
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,008
Why don't you
have all your teeth pulled out

35
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,224
since you can get insurance anyway?

36
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:31,328
Good idea.

37
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,148
What about this?

38
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:34,976
Wearing dentures?

39
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:36,864
Seriously?

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,552
You want all your teeth pulled out?

41
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:39,720
But you don't even
dare to have one pulled out.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
So funny.

43
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,592
Don't try to provoke me.

44
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,536
I admit I'm a coward.

45
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,366
Hey, I just wiped it.

46
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,184
Thanks.

47
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,400
What do you want to do?

48
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:04,344
Don't worry.

49
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,379
I'm not drinking it.

50
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:06,176
It is...

51
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,832
narcotic.

52
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:11,968
You're wasting money.

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,168
My own bar. It's not a waste of money.

54
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,229
Since you have the money,

55
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,680
why don't you recruit more employees?

56
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,824
We're too busy.

57
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:26,784
OK.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,869
Remember to close
the front door when you leave.

59
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:29,703
Leave it to you.

60
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,637
I'm leaving. Bye.

61
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,320
Boss, when will we get a pay raise?

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,740
Talk about it later.

63
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,464
Bye.

64
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,320
Do you think it's possible?

65
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:37,978
I may have to keep waiting

66
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,328
even after I lose all my teeth.

67
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,678
Didn't close the window again.

68
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,496
What if it rains?

69
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,112
We're having hamburgers today.

70
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:35,936
Langlang.

71
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:38,080
Have breakfast with me.

72
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,260
Langlang.

73
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,432
Didn't I tell you?

74
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,608
I'm on a diet and can't eat these.

75
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:52,906
But it looks delicious.

76
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:55,296
Langlang.

77
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,848
Langlang, did you hear me?

78
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,832
So delicious.

79
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,864
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

80
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,624
Bai Lang.

81
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,432
We won't be able
to see each other for a month.

82
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,416
Bai Lang.

83
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,816
Wish you a good trip.

84
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,448
Goodbye.

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
What?

86
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:23,648
Bai Lang.

87
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:25,504
What did you say?

88
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,777
I said

89
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:34,881
I didn't sleep until this morning.
I'm really sleepy.

90
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,284
Go have your breakfast.

91
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,688
Your voice sounds weird.

92
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,296
Why did you lock the door?

93
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,826
Bai Lang.

94
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:47,994
Open it.

95
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,312
Are you sick?

96
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:50,848
Bai Lang.

97
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:52,608
What happened?

98
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,392
Bai Lang, open the door.

99
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,856
Hurry up.

100
00:07:59,005 --> 00:07:59,872
Bai Lang.

101
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:01,675
Bai Lang.

102
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:03,510
Coming.

103
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,008
Can I have some privacy, please?

104
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,587
I'm really sleepy.

105
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:14,688
I'm fine.

106
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,656
Hualian is so far away.

107
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,557
You go there quickly.

108
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:19,616
Doctors and patients
there are waiting for you.

109
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:23,697
Come here.
Let me take a look at your face.

110
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,048
Let me take a look.

111
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,488
Let me take a look.

112
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,037
So swollen.

113
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:31,972
Did you fight?

114
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,507
No, I didn't.

115
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:35,200
Let me see.

116
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,210
I said let me take a look.

117
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:39,446
Don't touch me.

118
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:40,320
You have a toothache?

119
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,649
Why don't you just tell me?

120
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,320
You're no longer a kid, okay?

121
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,852
I'll give you five minutes.
Change your clothes.

122
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:46,528
We're going to the dentist.

123
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,622
No, no.

124
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:49,823
I know some dentists.

125
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:50,590
Hurry up.

126
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,458
I don't want to go to the dentist.

127
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,527
Ye Qiran has not yet returned
from the United States.

128
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,494
I don't want to go to the dentist.

129
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,544
Got it.

130
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,531
Hurry up.

131
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:58,431
No, I don't.

132
00:08:58,431 --> 00:08:59,296
Quick.

133
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:02,435
Are you Xunying Dental Clinic?

134
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,070
I want to speak with your director.
My name is Bai Qing.

135
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,296
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

136
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,388
Does it hurt?

137
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:22,556
No.

138
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:24,991
Please.

139
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,259
You go to Hualian now.

140
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,361
I can really do it myself.

141
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,362
Yourself?

142
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,964
No, you'll run away.

143
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:31,765
I am your sister.

144
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:33,300
I won't. I've already grown up.

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,167
I will be responsible for myself.

146
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,101
You've grown up?

147
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,636
Look at the big lump on your face.

148
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:37,871
It's not big.

149
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,296
It's small.

150
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,807
It's just I went to bed late lately.

151
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,509
I haven't had a good rest.

152
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,476
Go to Hualian now.

153
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,211
- Here we are.
- We are?

154
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,379
Already?

155
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,648
I...

156
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,449
You go to the train station now.

157
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:50,383
The safety belt.

158
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:51,418
What are you doing?

159
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,521
What do you want to do?

160
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:55,155
Get off the car.

161
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:56,423
Why do you get off the car?

162
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:59,008
Hurry up.

163
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,093
No.

164
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,995
Don't act like a child. Come.

165
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,532
Excuse me, can you wait a second?

166
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,333
I told you

167
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,801
I've just been staying up late lately.

168
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:08,268
My liver...

169
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,235
I know.

170
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,437
There must be
something wrong with my liver.

171
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,205
Your liver and your whole body, right?

172
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,006
I know.

173
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:14,608
And my stomach.

174
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:15,842
Hello, I'm your director's friend.

175
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:16,376
Just now...

176
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,510
Miss Bai?

177
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:17,911
Okay.

178
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,979
Please sit and wait a minute.

179
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:19,813
Thank you.

180
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:20,864
My...

181
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,083
My head hurts badly.

182
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,751
Can I get another dentist?

183
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,186
Your director is too serious.

184
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,088
I won't recommend it.

185
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:29,689
- What did he do?
- I'm gonna change my ticket.

186
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:30,557
He's technically good.

187
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:31,625
Sorry, Mr. Chi.

188
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,993
The director is busy.

189
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,527
Can you wait a little longer?

190
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,629
Then give me painkillers.

191
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:36,863
I have a hockey game later.

192
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,465
I can't prescribe you painkillers.

193
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,064
Only doctors can do that.

194
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,868
Alright, I'll be here another day.

195
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,003
But considering your condition, Mr. Chi,

196
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,537
you'd better see the doctor today.

197
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:45,071
Yeah.

198
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,373
- How long will we have to wait?
- Don't worry.

199
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,288
They seem to be in pain.

200
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:50,076
Oh, I forgot to bring my phone.

201
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:50,777
It's at home.

202
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:51,678
I have to go back to get it.

203
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,176
I brought it.

204
00:10:58,318 --> 00:10:59,104
Look.

205
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:00,192
Here you are.

206
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,568
Come and sit.

207
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:29,792
From now on,

208
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:31,552
your code name

209
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:34,336
is 1140727.

210
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,455
Yours

211
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:36,448
is 5566.

212
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,952
Go up.

213
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:41,152
Am I going up?

214
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:47,296
Sister.

215
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,208
Don't be afraid,

216
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,352
though I'm afraid too.

217
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,496
Sister.

218
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,000
Remember to come to see me later.

219
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:57,760
Quick.

220
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,912
Go up quickly.

221
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:04,224
Go up.

222
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,985
Give me what's on you.

223
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:07,328
Hand it over.

224
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:09,984
Give me.

225
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:12,448
And you.

226
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:15,072
Go up.

227
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:16,448
Hurry up.

228
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:19,968
Quick.

229
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,504
Go quickly.

230
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:23,360
Don't look back.

231
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:24,768
No chatting.

232
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,704
What's your reason for coming in?

233
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,968
My gums get sore
as I have a game and a lot of stress.

234
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,296
What about you?

235
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,376
I love eating candy.

236
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,544
What about you?

237
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,432
I'm just afraid.

238
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,032
I'm afraid.

239
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,976
Your teeth are mine now

240
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,496
since you don't brush your teeth well.

241
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:07,213
Though we don't know each other,

242
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,832
fate brings us here.

243
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,144
Guys.

244
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:11,584
We have to hold on.

245
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,219
Come on.

246
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,187
Okay.

247
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,096
We must survive.

248
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:23,329
Jin Xun'an.

249
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:26,599
Director.

250
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,808
This is Mr. Chi.

251
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,570
Senior, wait a second.

252
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,371
Mr. Chi.

253
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:33,640
He's my brother.
He's afraid of seeing a dentist.

254
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,541
Can you help him?

255
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,210
Senior, you can't cut in line.

256
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,545
This is a matter of principle.

257
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:39,179
Okay?

258
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:42,215
I sorted out the photos

259
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:44,288
from my college days the other day.

260
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,352
Some of them are very interesting.

261
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,264
Take a look at this.

262
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,255
Does it look a bit like you?

263
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:50,924
Seems there are many others.

264
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,292
I don't think it's time

265
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,059
to consider the principle.

266
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,527
Should I post these

267
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:56,029
on Facebook?

268
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:57,856
So he has dental phobia

269
00:13:58,231 --> 00:13:59,776
or any bad experience?

270
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:00,800
DAS?

271
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,334
No.

272
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:02,464
Or PTSD?

273
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,608
He said he doesn't.

274
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:07,807
How about you use TCI
to make him more comfortable?

275
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,075
How long has this been going on?

276
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:09,952
Sister.

277
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,078
Can you who have studied medicine
speak the language I know?

278
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,180
I really don't think
I need to go to the dentist

279
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,488
for this little toothache.

280
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,750
What type of doctor do you want?

281
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,185
An orthopedist,
a physician, or a surgeon?

282
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:19,919
Mr. Chi.

283
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,753
Director.

284
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,522
I think that bro was right.

285
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,357
There's no need to go to the doctor

286
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,358
for a little toothache.

287
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:26,392
Just give me painkillers

288
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,424
or give me a prescription.

289
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,862
Let me explain.

290
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:31,231
We can't give
a prescription directly to you.

291
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:32,665
A.

292
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:33,900
Yes, director.

293
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,369
Take this mister to do an examination

294
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,888
to see what treatment is needed.

295
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:38,938
Can I?

296
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:40,608
I usually treat children.

297
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,472
Jin Xun'an.

298
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,845
Get up now.

299
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,146
Come with me.

300
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,015
This is Director, Jin Xun'an.

301
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,304
This is my brother, Bai Lang.

302
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,640
I give my brother to you.

303
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm going to Hualian for a surgery.

304
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,356
You treat him carefully.

305
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,504
And you, don't run away.

306
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm watching you.

307
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,159
Thank you.

308
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,240
Behave yourself.

309
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:03,968
I know.

310
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,944
Thanks.

311
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,088
Come in, please.

312
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:26,720
Wait.

313
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm telling you.

314
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,923
I really take good care of my teeth.

315
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,958
I brush and floss after every meal.

316
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,793
Who is the doctor here, you or me?

317
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,128
You.

318
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,608
But I know my teeth best.

319
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,564
Just give me a prescription.

320
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,312
We need to check your teeth.

321
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,552
How many days have you had
tooth pain and can you bear it?

322
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:46,639
It's okay.

323
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,907
It doesn't hurt very much.

324
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:48,928
Mr. Bai.

325
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:51,277
Since you cut in the line,

326
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,152
I can just simply treat it.

327
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,948
That's not what I wanted to do.

328
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:57,568
I said it's not serious.

329
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,086
Alright. Just tell your sister.

330
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,344
I would be happy that I don't
have to waste energy.

331
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,224
Apple, help him put his coat there.

332
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,128
Okay.

333
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:10,368
I can do it myself.

334
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,776
Have a seat, please.

335
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,178
Mr. Bai, please be quick.

336
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,446
There are other patients outside.

337
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,381
Tough.

338
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,136
Please turn around.

339
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:41,327
What are you doing?

340
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,229
I've already lied down.

341
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:44,832
You can do the check now.

342
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:57,824
Open your mouth.

343
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,213
I have opened it.

344
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:03,583
Apple, come to help me.

345
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,856
Sir, can you work with us?

346
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,544
See a doctor when you are sick.

347
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:10,528
Are you happy that you
make your family worried?

348
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,832
My teeth hurt.

349
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,944
I'm not feeling well.

350
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:29,809
My teeth hurt.

351
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:30,943
Come back.

352
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,178
My teeth hurt.

353
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,012
Go to the dentist with me.

354
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:36,816
I want mom and dad.

355
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,217
Let's go to the dentist tomorrow, okay?

356
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,584
It's okay. I'm brave.

357
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,768
Mr. Bai.

358
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,464
Did you see this needle?

359
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,032
Do you want to be stabbed by it?

360
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,624
Of course not.

361
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:56,436
Then don't move.

362
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:57,728
It's dangerous to do
something like that.

363
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:03,616
I can just let you go now.

364
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,568
Your teeth would still hurt,

365
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:07,104
your sister would still worry about you,

366
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:08,832
and I would still be disturbed by her.

367
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,072
It does no good to all of us.

368
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:16,448
Just a check.

369
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:18,891
Right?

370
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,880
Open your mouth.

371
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,612
Your teeth don't hurt, right, Mr. Chi?

372
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:41,856
It's getting a little better.

373
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:43,382
Wait.

374
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:44,768
Didn't you just trick me

375
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,152
into opening my mouth,

376
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,120
do a simple check,

377
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,721
and prescribe me some medicine casually?

378
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,391
You got TMJ arthritis.

379
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:53,860
Modern people
are under a lot of pressure,

380
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,928
and their teeth are easily damaged
by their involuntarily clenching.

381
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,297
You look young,

382
00:18:58,297 --> 00:18:59,488
but your skill is good.

383
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,069
Your clinic is not that scary.

384
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,280
Many things are not scary at all

385
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:06,848
as long as you take the courage.

386
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,544
Remember to come back later.

387
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,809
I need to come back?

388
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:10,810
Yeah.

389
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,545
Okay.

390
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,013
Talk about it later.

391
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:15,481
Wait.

392
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,449
It suddenly reminds me

393
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,650
that I'll be very busy
during the next two weeks.

394
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,718
I have games on weekends,

395
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:20,253
and I need to train on week days.

396
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:23,040
How about you give me more painkillers?

397
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:27,093
You have an impacted wisdom tooth
which causes gum inflammation.

398
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:28,227
I'll clean it for you

399
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:29,395
and then apply
an anti-inflammatory drug to it.

400
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:30,296
Hey.

401
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,598
Don't you play some music

402
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:35,200
to soothe the mood?

403
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,384
My name is not "hey".

404
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:38,240
Your sister has introduced me to you.

405
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,352
Jin Xun'an.

406
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:43,584
We don't know each other.
There's no need to remember it.

407
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:44,512
Open your mouth.

408
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:47,580
Since that, whether I play music
or not has nothing to do with you.

409
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,888
Move your head up and open your mouth.

410
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,032
It's right here.

411
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,261
It suddenly started to hurt recently.

412
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:04,297
But I couldn't
figure out which tooth it is.

413
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:06,165
I was wondering

414
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,266
if it is a stomach problem.

415
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,152
I just told you.

416
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,448
You have an impacted wisdom tooth
which causes gum inflammation.

417
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,528
Can't you understand?

418
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:16,475
But that is possible.

419
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:19,200
Chlorhexidine.

420
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you doing?

421
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,280
An injection?

422
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:28,032
This is an anti-inflammatory drug.

423
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,248
Open your mouth.

424
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:44,960
It's done for today.

425
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,848
I'll go downstairs to get you
an appointment later.

426
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,672
Get up and gargle.

427
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,112
The wisdom tooth on your left side

428
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:54,580
is growing horizontally.

429
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,982
This is the tooth surface.

430
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,216
If it is okay,

431
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,624
we're going to
have a surgery to remove it.

432
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,366
Earthquake.

433
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,266
Apple, open the door.

434
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,240
Earthquake.

435
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,797
You got my hand.

436
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:39,835
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,104
Are you okay, Director?

438
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,736
Are you alright?

439
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,096
You take him downstairs.

440
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,449
Earthquake.

441
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,744
Are you okay?

442
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,336
This way, Mr. Bai.

443
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:04,352
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,606
(Sterilization Room)
Like the teeth on the left side.

445
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:19,508
You can gently brush up and down

446
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:20,909
25 times.

447
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,744
Then do the same for the teeth inside.

448
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:25,247
Make an appointment
for him at 4 pm in three days.

449
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:26,176
Okay.

450
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:27,904
I need to come back?

451
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,620
Your impacted wisdom tooth
is causing severe gums inflammation.

452
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:33,121
I want you back to know about the effect
of the anti-inflammatory drug on you.

453
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,200
Then I'll know
when to have your tooth pulled out.

454
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:38,126
Pulled out?

455
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,808
Yes.

456
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:53,312
Is there anything else you want to say?

457
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,520
I won't give in.

458
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,176
Your teeth

459
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:01,248
are mine.

460
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,008
You can get my life,

461
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,344
but never get my teeth.

462
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,201
Open your mouth.

463
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:08,288
No.

464
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:16,096
Teeth!

465
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,448
Is it that surprising?

466
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,192
It's alright.

467
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,552
Wait.

468
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,621
What?

469
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:36,960
There is something.

470
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:40,800
Thank you.

471
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:43,537
For your sister's sake,

472
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:44,416
I'll do it for you.

473
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:45,600
Don't worry.

474
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,488
Check back in three days.

475
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,928
Every doctor says they are very skilled

476
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,232
before some medical malpractice happens.

477
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:00,608
This is our giveaway.

478
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:03,840
Here you are. It's a reward.

479
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,416
No need. I'm not a kid.

480
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,368
Leave it to them.

481
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:14,720
Trust me.

482
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:16,416
Nothing bad will happen.

483
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:27,174
You treat him carefully.

484
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:28,384
And you, don't run away.

485
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,376
I'm watching you.

486
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,880
Thank you.

487
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,504
(I thought about it later.)

488
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:40,654
(Why was I stopped)

489
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:41,920
(by him so easily?)

490
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:48,928
(It turns out)

491
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:50,816
(that I couldn't resist)

492
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:53,024
(from the very beginning.)

493
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,091
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)
Let's start working.

494
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,654
You went to the dentist?

495
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:03,584
Yeah.

496
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:04,824
My sister forced me.

497
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,168
Why are you so afraid
of going to the dentist?

498
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:08,952
Go back and rest.

499
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:10,272
I'll leave now.

500
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,703
Will you?

501
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,472
You'll stay with me from now on.

502
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:14,752
Dr. Jin.

503
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,256
Anything I can help you?

504
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,112
That's just a little gratitude

505
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
for what you did last night.

506
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,464
It was just me.

507
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,576
Wish him an early escape
from misery. Cheers.

508
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,351
