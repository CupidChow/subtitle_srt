1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:03,317
Restock coke for me, okay?

2
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:06,253
Do you think it's okay
to place the plates like this?

3
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:08,455
Of course.

4
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:09,589
The plates seem a little dirty.
Should we clean them?

5
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,191
Okay, let me wipe it.

6
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:12,526
Hello.

7
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:13,927
You're a senior
but still come to orientation.

8
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:15,228
Shouldn't I come?

9
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:15,996
Sorry.

10
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,998
Don't drink it. I've counted them all.

11
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,099
I bought them.

12
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,200
You just put it over there, okay?

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,335
Thank you.

14
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,102
Thank you.

15
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:23,370
What would you like to drink?

16
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,707
It's alright. There are many freshmen.

17
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:27,374
Wait a second.

18
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:28,041
Okay.

19
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,144
Hi, buddy.

20
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,749
Ye Qiran, senior year of dentistry.

21
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,150
What about you?

22
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,556
I'm a med student.

23
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:44,691
I'm just passing by.

24
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,628
Dentistry freshman, Jin Xun'an.

25
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,397
Nice to meet you.

26
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,102
We dress so alike,

27
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:56,603
so I thought we could
get to know each other.

28
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:58,972
But you lied to me.

29
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,874
No. It's not okay.

30
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,045
Smile.

31
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,713
Grin, okay?

32
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,681
This is the orientation party.

33
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,117
Do you think these seniors
will be happy if you don't smile?

34
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,618
Come on, smile.

35
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,692
Still want to study together?

36
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:23,764
I'm telling you, I was just like you

37
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:25,332
when I entered school,

38
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:27,934
always trying to look cool.

39
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,236
But...

40
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:33,673
It doesn't do you any good at all.

41
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,277
What are you looking at?
You don't believe me?

42
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:39,045
We'll work together as interns.

43
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,448
It's a small circle.

44
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,417
You'll often see me.

45
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,652
What kind of drink do you like?

46
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,554
How about coke?

47
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:50,824
Here you are.

48
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,726
By the way, I'm also
in the student union.

49
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,628
Come to me if you're in need.

50
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,536
You have a nice smile.

51
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:05,572
Smile more, okay?

52
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,441
Can I go now?

53
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,310
Of course

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,378
not.

55
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:13,046
Come here, Shu.

56
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,114
What's the matter?

57
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:15,315
Get to know your junior.

58
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:16,783
You're good-looking. Come here.

59
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:17,517
Come on. Don't be shy.

60

who gets on the bus at a certain stop)

62
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,525
(will get off immediately)

63
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,961

=My Tooth Your Love=

75
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,109
I'm telling you,

76
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,211
that was in my college days.

77
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,779
I don't know where you...

78
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,416
Excuse me. I have made an appointment.

79
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,763
When did you come back?

80
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:37,531
Shouldn't you be in America?

81
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:39,466
(That is the senior)

82
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:43,336
(I've been hearing about, right?)

83
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,307
(The scene of meeting after many years)

84
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:49,910
(is really a bit cliche.)

85
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,911
(Luckily,)

86
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,546
(I'm just a spectator.)

87
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,348
Dr. Jin.

88
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:57,083
I think we're done talking.

89
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,984
Then I'm leaving.

90
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,520
Thank you for today.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,622
You can bring him

92
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,157
to my bistro for dinner.

93
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,592
My treat.

94
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,027
Bye.

95
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,461
Bai Lang.

96
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,568
Is he your friend or your patient?

97
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:17,771
Both.

98
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:19,673
Okay.

99
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,775
(Xunying Dental Clinic)

100
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,009
How are you doing recently?

101
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,211
I'm fine. How about you?

102
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,616
I...

103
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,751
How about your family?

104
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:34,788
It's a little too sweet.

105
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:45,365
You still remember my favorite coffee?

106
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,937
Of course.

107
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,840
Why didn't you call me
before you came back?

108
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,011
I wanted to give you a surprise.

109
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,314
You came here especially.

110
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,350
Do you need any help?

111
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:08,622
No.

112
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,760
You used to...

113
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,229
I reject.

114
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,032
Please.

115
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,367
Our college doesn't have
a music department,

116
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,003
but the dean asks me
to find someone to play the piano.

117
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:23,937
Xun'an.

118
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,840
I hardly know anyone
who can play the piano.

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,907
Please.

120
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,376
Please, Xun'an.

121
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,477
Please.

122
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,746
I'm your senior and I'm begging you.

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,949
No problem.

124
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,251
Senior.

125
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,020
Piano four hands, right?

126
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,354
Yes. Yes.

127
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:44,424
Let's get through it together.

128
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,826
Did the dean ask you to do it?

129
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:52,332
You know, he has something on me.

130
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,704
I've skipped so many lessons,
so I need to make up for it.

131
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,439
Let's welcome

132
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,875
the senior and the junior
who are in sync most.

133
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,446
(You really helped me a lot)

134
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,882
(at that time,)

135
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,316
(whether at school,)

136
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,618
(at work)

137
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:12,619
(or at home.)

138
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,319
Sorry, I'm late.

139
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm gonna say, last time...

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,556
It's alright.

141
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:17,590
I wanted to eat this.

142
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,124
I'm telling you,

143
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,059
you have to call from here, okay?

144
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,126
And I'll buy it for you.

145
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,861
No. You sit.

146
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,530
Remember to be gentle.

147
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,231
I'm leaving, thanks, bye.

148
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:26,966
Senior.

149
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:36,409
The person at Table 85 wants to see you.

150
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,077
Who is it?

151
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,211
I don't know. You go there.

152
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,814
I'll do this for you.

153
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:41,715
Thanks.

154
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,492
Why are you here?

155
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,729
I'm sick and An took me to see a doctor.

156
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,064
The doctor said
she has a fever caused by a cold.

157
00:06:58,064 --> 00:06:59,666
She's already had an injection

158
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,868
and only needs to
take the medicine on time.

159
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,838
An.

160
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,741
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

161
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,677
Come here to sit and eat.

162
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,245
Eat what?

163
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:14,647
I got you a packed lunch.
Guess what it is.

164
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:21,654
Ye-Style Rice Stew in Super Simple Way.

165
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:22,522
Open your mouth.

166
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,424
I'll do it myself.

167
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,926
Come on.

168
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,363
Is it delicious?

169
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:30,864
If it is,

170
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:33,099
I'll cook it for you next time, okay?

171
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,902
(But,)

172
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,371
(it tasted bad.)

173
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,851
I'd almost forgotten.

174
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,888
When will you leave?

175
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,991
I'll treat you to a meal before that.

176
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,163
I won't go back.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,568
I am divorced.

178
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,237
I'm back.

179
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,588
If your former crush

180
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,457
suddenly came back to you,

181
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,493
would you be with him immediately?

182
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,031
Xun'an's first love came back?

183
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,166
How did you know?

184
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,870
It depends on why they weren't together.

185
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,872
What do you mean?

186
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:47,740
Did he choose to leave for some reason

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,142
and feel regretful

188
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,710
or did they break up

189
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,546
because something bad happened?

190
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:54,781
What difference does it make?

191
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,951
Yeah. Does it make a difference?

192
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,586
Of course it does.

193
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,555
If they broke up, they would
become just friends again.

194
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:06,159
But if not, they will
cherish it even more

195
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,261
once they get it back.

196
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,201
Maybe I've already found the right one.

197
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:19,372
(He's already found the right one.)

198
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,074
(Who)

199
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,876
(would it be?)

200
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,879
♪I shouldn't indulge myself♪

201
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,581
So what are you going to do?

202
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,017
I'm gonna do nothing.

203
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,518
I'm just gonna see what happens.

204
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,393
Okay, let's make

205
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:43,930
a Love Come Back Pasta tonight.

206
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,833
You come so early today, boss.

207
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,635
Buster.

208
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,341
Alex.

209
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,311
So have you ever been in a relationship?

210
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,680
When and with whom?

211
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:04,984
So have you finished
sweeping and wiping?

212
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,886
Don't eavesdrop.

213
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,655
I didn't.

214
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,762
(Xunying Dental Clinic)
Do you still cook?

215
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,597
Are you getting any better at cooking?

216
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,132
I've given it up.

217
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,401
My son hates rice stew the most.

218
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,372
See you next time.

219
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:34,647
I'm leaving.

220
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,598
This is Xunying Dental Clinic.

221
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,701
Miss Chen.

222
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,570
You like doing it?

223
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:03,109
You had a long chat with the senior.

224
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,311
What are you talking about?

225
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,815
We're talking about the employees
who're getting less serious lately.

226
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,451
Is it time to hire new ones?

227
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,422
He must be joking, right?

228
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,224
Stop acting.

229
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,826
He must be joking, right?

230
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,206
Wait a second.

231
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:35,241
Excuse me.

232
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:49,455
Hello, what's the matter?

233
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,258
I haven't finished then.

234
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,793
Why did you...?

235
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,529
I'm done,

236
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,765
and I'm busy.

237
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:01,768
I'm taking one day off
the day after tomorrow.

238
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,337
If you are free...

239
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,406
I've been working on a new menu lately,

240
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:11,444
so I might be busy for a while.

241
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,616
Or I'll go to you when I'm done.

242
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,885
Okay.

243
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,253
Okay.

244
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:44,710
(Maybe I've already found
the right one.)

245
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,045
Shouldn't you be abroad?

246
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,613
When did you come back?

247
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,492
(But if not, they will
cherish it even more)

248
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,394
once they get it back.

249
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,166
It's better to get rid
of the causes of insomnia

250
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,968
than to rely on sleeping pills.

251
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:11,337
If you still can't sleep,

252
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,773
hold...

253
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,042
- Hold you?
- the pillow I gave you.

As I expected,

270
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,072
it is always hard
to forget the first love, right?

271
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,458
(He's your right one, right?)

272
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:23,769
Xun'an.

273
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,339
Why do you always listen to him?

274
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,241
You've done so much for him.

275
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,376
Don't you feel like he's been using you?

276
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:32,878
I don't like to use people

277
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,480
or to be used.

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,182
If he was that kind of person,

279
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,017
I wouldn't be by his side.

280
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,420
Then why did you do so much for him?

281
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,626
Because I want to do it.

282
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,263
Is it not okay?

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,735
I ordered chicken soup for her

284
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,204
to warm her up.

285
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,241
Thank you.

286
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,710
Eat some soup.

287
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,212
Eat it slowly.

288
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:13,686
What's wrong?

289
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,889
I know it would be too much to say this,

290
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,491
but she is my sister

291
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,326
and it is my responsibility
to take care of her.

292
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:25,031
Don't you think you are too concerned?

293
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,099
No.

294
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,969
You're working three jobs.

295
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,537
Your sister
had been lying at school all day

296
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,638
and she didn't let the teacher call you

297
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,874
because she knew you are busy

298
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,976
and didn't want to stress you out.

299
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,745
I think it's a good thing

300
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,280
to have someone you know

301
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,782
to take care of your sister for you.

302
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,518
And I don't have anything to do.

303
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,019
I have enough time.

304
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:50,723
Sister.

305
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:53,693
An will accompany you home.

306
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,227
I'll be right back after work, okay?

307
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,729
Okay.

308
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,166
An.

309
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,801
Can you put a cold compress
on her forehead when you go to my house?

310
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,069
Okay.

311
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,437
If the fever doesn't get down,

312
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:04,937
go to the kitchen...

313
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:06,605
Okay.

314
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,809
Fill in for me tomorrow.

315
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,177
Okay.

316
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,745
Why do you always say "okay"?

317
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,713
I'll beat you up, okay?

318
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:15,781
No, An is mine.

319
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,883
You can't beat him.

320
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,019
You don't love me anymore, do you?

321
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,854
I love you both.

322
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,789
Alright, go on with your work.

323
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,258
Okay, eat it slowly.

324
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,894
Thanks. I gotta go.

325
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,934
You said we would
get through all problems together.

326
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,470
You promise to let me fill in,

327
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,538
and I will play the piano with you.

328
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,043
How nice of you.
I have to be nicer to you.

329
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,578
Let me bite you.

330
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,713
Xun'an only listens to you.

331
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:50,950
Right.

332
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,284
You envy me?

333
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,587
He's mine. Don't try to take him away.

334
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,322
Okay.

335
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,358
We're going to

336
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,327
multiply them first,

337
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,729
and then we can...

338
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,135
(We should make it clear)

339
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,470
(before we move on)

340
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,806
(to the next step.)

341
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,442
(It's because of you)

342
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,615
that I'm lying here.

343
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,688
So do you like...?

344
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,228
(Maybe)

345
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,763
(I'm not active enough)

346
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,434
(in this relationship.)

347
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,610
White Dark Bistro & Flavor
now has workday lunch,

348
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,279
and delivery is available.

349
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,014
Are the dishes there good?

350
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,515
Yes.

351
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,751
The food is delivered by the owner.

352
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,219
So we'll see Bai.

353
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,654
I want to eat it too.

354
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,189
But can we reach

355
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,557
the minimum fee for delivery?

356
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,192
Maybe.

357
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,461
I think we can.

358
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,395
There are so many of us.

359
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,229
Kuan.

360
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:14,934
This is not good enough.

361
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,370
Sorry.

362
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,606
Alright. Just do it again.

363
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:24,276
Didn't you just say you want to
order White Dark Bistro & Flavor?

364
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,378
Order whatever you want to eat.
My treat.

365
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,782
I'm hungry now.

366
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,084
Thank you, director.

367
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,722
What did he mean?

368
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,691
Then I'll order this one.
It's the most expensive.

369
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:39,925
This looks good.

370
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:40,359
Look.

371
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,897
Salmon is running out.
Order some for me.

372
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:45,698
Okay.

373
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,667
Recently we've gotten in
two boxes of wine.

374
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,069
Taste it for me later.

375
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:50,836
Okay.

376
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:53,539
We're all already busy.

377
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,608
Why do you want to offer weekday lunch?

378
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,677
You deliver the food yourself.

379
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,179
Won't you be tired?

380
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,347
Okay.

381
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,352
I'm talking to you.

382
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,853
Are you listening to me?

383
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,856
Yeah. Didn't you say

384
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,592
the refrigerator is too small
so it's not cold enough?

385
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:14,360
What?

386
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,761
No. I was talking...

387
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,296
We got another order.

388
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,497
Three servings of pasta,

389
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:19,932
one serving of seafood noodles,

390
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,034
one serving of truffle fries,

391
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:24,303
delivered to...

392
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,108
boss, Xunying Dental Clinic.

393
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,142
It's on you.

394
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:32,711
Alex.

395
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,680
Do you need my help?

396
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,215
Can you take inventory
of the seafood for me?

397
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,249
The seafood.

398
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,584
Tell Bin to prepare
the ingredients for me.

399
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,519
Go and talk to him yourself.
Take inventory of the seafood.

400
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,387
Tell Bin to prepare
the ingredients for me.

401
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,454
Go and talk to him yourself.

402
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,560
Mr. Chi, do your teeth feel bad again?

403
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,728
No. I'm delivering food.

404
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,430
By the way, is Little A there?

405
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,998
What's the matter?

406
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,466
I'm delivering to him.

407
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,036
Chi Renmin?

408
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,804
Aren't you a hockey player?

409
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,406
Why are you delivering food?

410
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,641
I'm doing a part-time job
to earn some money.

411
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:05,344
These are for you from the restaurant

412
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,513
and have already been paid for.

413
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,316
Director.

414
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,584
Director, the takeout's here.

415
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,052
I'm not hungry.

416
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,590
What happened to him?

417
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,292
Someone paid for him.
Why is he unhappy?

418
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,528
It's hard to say.

419
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:25,431
It's alright. Thanks anyway.

420
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:26,231
No worries.

421
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,100
I was coming to see you anyway.

422
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,735
You said you'd come to my game.

423
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,037
Here is the ticket.
The time and address are all on it.

424
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,741
See you then.

425
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:37,343
Chi Renmin, I did not promise you.

426
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,044
Hey!

427
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,713
What ticket... Is it for a concert?

428
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,349
Ice hockey tournament.

429
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,817
What is this?

430
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:47,686
Are you going to watch it?

431
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:48,554
No.

432
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,510
Why are you here?

433
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,512
I'm coming to pay.

434
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:17,583
You don't need to pay for us.

435
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,991
I thought you'd deliver it yourself.

436
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:27,993
But...

437
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:32,197
I think we are very familiar.

438
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,566
Yes, we are. So I paid for you.

439
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,003
What are you doing?
Keep your hands to yourself.

440
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:38,971
I'm going to work.

441
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:39,738
Wait a second.

442
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,042
(What should I do)

443
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,043
(next?)

444
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,478
Keep your hands to yourself.

445
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,715
What's wrong?

446
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,117
You have a toothache.

447
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:56,155
No, I don't.

448
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,157
You do.

449
00:22:58,157 --> 00:22:58,657
I really don't.

450
00:22:58,657 --> 00:22:59,491
Go to the clinic with me.

451
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:02,594
Alex, help me.

452
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:05,264
Go.

453
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:06,432
What are you doing?

454
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,234
His teeth feel bad,

455
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,669
so I'm gonna take him
to the clinic for a check.

456
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,871
Come back soon, bye.

457
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:14,940
What's wrong?

458
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,342
I didn't feel bad.

459
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,877
- You did.
- Where is he going?

460
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,279
You finished checking?

461
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,747
Yes.

462
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:24,283
Sweep the floor. I'm gonna take a nap.

463
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:26,085
My teeth are really fine today.

464
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:28,721
Many problems have to
be found out by ourselves.

465
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:30,923
It is better to prevent them
in advance than to treat them afterward.

466
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,191
I don't have a toothache.

467
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,759
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

468
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,728
Play along, okay?

469
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,763
Wait, it's you who dragged me here.

470
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,632
I just said
there's no problem with my teeth.

471
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:41,700
What exactly do you want?

472
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,402
I have been taking
the medicine regularly

473
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,970
and rinsing my mouth.

474
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,806
What do you want to do?

475
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,875
You didn't sleep well, did you?

476
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,580
Are you still taking sleeping pills?

477
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,182
I've told you I am not.

478
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,584
What do you want to do?

479
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,852
Take off your coat.

480
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,788
Sit on it and I'll check it for you.

481
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:06,692
You're serious?
What exactly are you gonna check?

482
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,495
I won't let you go without checking.

483
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,331
You're treating me like a prisoner.

484
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,233
You won't let me go without checking?

485
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,536
Then how long will it take?

486
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:18,804
I gotta go back to work then.

487
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,906
It won't take long.

488
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,242
Sit here.

489
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,277
Geez.

490
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,451
You'll let me go after the check, right?

491
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,620
From now on,

492
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,589
you have to come
for a dental check-up every week.

493
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,992
We regularly help check
the condition of patients' teeth.

494
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,160
How humorous of you, Jin Xun'an.

495
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,095
Every week?

496
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:44,429
Do you really think I have time for it?

497
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,931
Are you kidding me?

498
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,400
It won't take long.

499
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,336
Don't you lie down?

500
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:59,378
10 minutes. I'll give you 10 minutes.

501
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:04,783
Hurry up.

502
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:11,657
Open your mouth.

503
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:15,594
I've told you

504
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,296
you don't need to make a sound.

505
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,164
I know.

506
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,633
I told you my teeth are fine.

507
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:27,873
Jie, do you know hockey?

508
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,875
How could I know
such an unpopular sport?

509
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,343
You work out, don't you?

510
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,145
You must know this.

511
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,214
That has nothing to do with hockey.

512
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:35,914
But you're so into workouts, aren't you?

513
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,616
You.

514
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:38,851
Director.

515
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,653
Keep your voice down

516
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,456
when you pass here, okay?

517
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,658
What's wrong?

518
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,760
Don't disturb Mr. Bai.

519
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,195
Mr. Bai?

520
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:50,863
Director, do we even provide

521
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,398
services for patients to rest?

522
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:13,408
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

523
00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:54,192
Alex.

524
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,553
What are you doing?

525
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,289
I'm sweeping.

526
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,257
Look, there's so much rubbish.

527
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:02,227
The boss is not at work
and the manager is dozing off again.

528
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,396
Are you really running it?

529
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,031
The boss hasn't come back yet?

530
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,265
No.

531
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,700
I haven't finished tidying up the bar.

532
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,901
Call the working student.

533
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,938
It's almost the weekend
and we will be busy.

534
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:14,573
I know it.

535
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,875
So I've already told him to come over.

536
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,083
I dozed off.

537
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,652
Quite a long time.

538
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:03,655
Did I delay you?

539
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,459
Am I

540
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,695
more useful to you than sleeping pills?

541
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,103
Is the check over?

542
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:20,238
I'm gonna go back to the restaurant.

543
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,607
I'll go with you

544
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:25,210
and by the way, have a meal.

545
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:38,056
Bad habit.

546
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:49,367
I've told you
to keep your hands to yourself.

547
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,970
It's not far.

548
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,739
You don't have to walk me back.

549
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:56,675
But I want to.

550
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,643
Xun'an.

551
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:00,145
A businessman must know

552
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:01,680
how to make good use of time.

553
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,282
I just slept in the room for so long.

554
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:06,318
It was a waste
of the clinic property, isn't it?

555
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:08,787
This is my place. It was not a waste.

556
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:11,490
Yeah, it's your place.

557
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,092
I'll just rest at my place.

558
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:22,567
But you had a good sleep,

559
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,402
didn't you?

560
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:44,800
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

561
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,393
RJ.

562
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:51,630
Take this to Dr. Jin.

563
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,631
Dude.

564
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:54,499
Take it to him yourself.

565
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,802
Face up to it. You can't escape it.

566
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:00,839
Go.

567
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,512
Here is a mojito without alcohol.

568
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,980
Dessert will come later.

569
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,249
You are tired.

570
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,451
Sit down and have a rest.

571
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,722
I'm busy. The chef is not here today.

572
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,057
So I'm going into the kitchen.

573
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:21,293
Leave it to them.

574
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,596
I'm not with you these days.

575
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,231
No one helps tuck you up,

576
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,033
so you don't sleep well.

577
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:29,034
Don't mistake it, everyone.

578
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:31,036
He is my doctor.

579
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:32,671
Doctor? Good.

580
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,506
It's fun now.

581
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,442
Have you finished eating, Xun'an?

582
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,843
Yeah.

583
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,845
Then let's have a talk.

584
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,464
Let's go there.

585
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:01,633
Has something happened to you recently?

586
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,336
You've been acting weird.

587
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:05,937
Don't do that.

588
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:11,209
If I've done something
to make you angry,

589
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,311
you can tell me.

590
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,881
No.

591
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:24,823
I just thought you and the senior...

592
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,157
Wait.

593
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:33,198
Why do you keep talking
about the senior?

594
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,332
Have you heard anything?

595
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:34,899
And what are you thinking?

596
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,002
I haven't heard anything.

597
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:37,836
So that's why

598
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:39,904
you've been avoiding me.

599
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:41,640
I'm not.

600
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,408
Didn't we see each other this afternoon?

601
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,243
I'm not avoiding you.

602
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:48,280
Look at me.

603
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,216
Look at me.

604
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,887
Bai Lang, the right one
who I've found...

605
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,088
Stop.

606
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:01,092
Stop talking.

607
