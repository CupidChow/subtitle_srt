1
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,430
(When you see the person)

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,534
(who is staying by your side...)

3
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:23,170
(No matter)

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,506
(it was unintentional or on purpose...)

5
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,875
(I finally realize)

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,144
(why some people say)

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:33,647
(that the body is more honest)

8
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:34,981
(than the heart.)

9
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:58,739
Your fever's gone.

10
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,108
That's great.

11
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:10,617
Be good.

12
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,421
(That morning,)

13
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,323
(my fever was allayed,)

14
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:20,594
(but my heart seemed to be burned out.)

15
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,639
(His unguarded attitude)

16
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,674
(toward me)

17
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:38,345
(made me)

18
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,281

=My Tooth Your Love=

30
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,040
I've told you that a fever
is just a self-defense mechanism.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,708
But thank you anyway.

32
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,076
This is the third time.

33
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,512
Aren't you going to pull my tooth out?

34
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,646
Hurry up.

35
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,584
Do you know

36
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,052
why it only takes an hour
for a phoenix to reach the earth?

37
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,487
Relax.

38
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:57,524
What are you doing?

39
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:10,470
Rinse your mouth.

40
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,179
I heard

41
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,680
that the face will be smaller

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,448
after wisdom teeth extraction.

43
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:22,148
Is that true?

44
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,252
No.

45
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:26,620
It will only decrease your appetite.

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,021
Wisdom teeth have nothing to do

47
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,956
with the size of the face.

48
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,560
How's your feeling?

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,561
Disappointed?

50
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:40,367
Everyone wants a V-shaped face.

51
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,610
Just stay the way you are.

52
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,549
You just said...

53
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,418
What?

54
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,721
Nothing.

55
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,889
Nothing.

56
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:09,763
Apple.

57
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:10,297
Yes.

58
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,365
I can do this alone.

59
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:14,000
Can you?

60
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,504
Yes. Thank you.

61
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:18,605
Okay.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,921
Orange.

63
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,323
What's wrong?

64
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,491
Guess what I just saw in the room.

65
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,426
What did you see?

66
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,261
You seem so happy.

67
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,264
I saw bubbles
between the director and Bai.

68
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,699
What bubbles?

69
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,233
Just bubbles.

70
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:47,867
Hey.

71
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,169
Can you make it clear?

72
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,905
The director looked at Bai very gently.

73
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:52,706
Gently?

74
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,640
A.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,674
What's wrong?

76
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,509
Didn't you say the director doesn't
want to go into a romantic relationship?

77
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,644
What's going on

78
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,912
between him and Bai?

79
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,213
What do you mean?

80
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,916
No matter who fixed him up before,

81
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,817
he refused.

82
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:04,217
What?

83
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:05,518
No matter if it is a woman or a man?

84
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:07,621
If the director

85
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,255
finally recovers
from the emotional damage

86
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,325
and is looking for his next romance,

87
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,693
should I strongly support him

88
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,462
as a junior

89
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,631
or just be a bystander?

90
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,699
No.

91
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,401
I'll guard his happiness.

92
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:22,702
What emotional damage?

93
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:23,803
I didn't mention it.

94
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:24,170
You did.

95
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,038
I won't tell you.

96
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,306
You did. Tell me.

97
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,140
I won't betray him

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,441
even if my teeth are all pulled out.

99
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,477
How about we treat you to your favorite?

100
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,211
No.

101
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:32,646
I'll treat you to hot pot.

102
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,047
I can go eat it alone.

103
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,050
You must bite the gauze
for 40 minutes before spitting it out.

104
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,185
Don't eat within the next two hours.

105
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,121
Avoid spicy food.

106
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,657
And don't lick the wound,

107
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,891
as it'll affect the healing.

108
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,094
OK.

109
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,498
Do you want to keep your wisdom tooth?

110
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,567
Of course.

111
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:00,073
Are you still afraid
of seeing a dentist?

112
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,743
If you are the dentist,

113
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,311
I will not be afraid.

114
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,483
Then your teeth are mine.

115
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,622
Okay.

116
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:17,557
I'm leaving.

117
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:21,728
Yours.

118
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,298
Here you are.

119
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:27,867
Mine?

120
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,419
What did he mean?

121
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,887
Why did he give you to me?

122
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,589
To tell me that I was holding the pillow

123
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:50,990
like a little boy

124
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,192
and I'm childish?

125
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,461
Or did he want me

126
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:55,862
to treat the pillow like him?

127
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,332
It's quite baffling.

128
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:06,172
It's better to be with me
than with that weird boss.

129
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,041
Do you think so?

130
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,009
Deal.

131
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,716
The director is human too.

132
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,618
I don't know if they ended up together.

133
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:19,252
But at that time,

134
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,220
everyone thought

135
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,021
that they would be together.

136
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,057
However, they separated in the end.

137
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:26,259
It's been seven years.

138
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,861
He has never had a romantic relationship
with anyone during this time.

139
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,562
It's been a long time.

140
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,564
Something must have happened.

141
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,033
Could it be that he was hurt badly?

142
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,235
So...

143
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:36,836
And,

144
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,571
you know he's a very cold person.

145
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,273
Can you imagine him smiling at others?

146
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:41,708
Go do your work.

147
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,176
You even have leisure time

148
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,778
to have snacks and gossip here?

149
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,079
Aren't you afraid of
being heard by your director?

150
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:46,980
I got things to do.

151
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,914
Hey, you two.

152
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:48,348
Wait.

153
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,115
I got a thing too.

154
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:49,816
Wait, I have something to ask you.

155
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:50,316
Doctor, wait.

156
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,518
I have patients.

157
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,419
Doctor.

158
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:02,228
This is your prescription.

159
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,830
Please go to the pharmacy
next door to get the medicine.

160
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,597
Thanks.

161
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,766
Was that given by the director?

162
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,301
So cute.

163
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,303
I think so too.

164
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:11,671
You were just saying

165
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,373
that your director
has been emotionally hurt,

166
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,441
so he hasn't been in love
for a long time.

167
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,209
We were not.

168
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,545
You were.
That male doctor just said that.

169
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,746
Weren't you guys

170
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:20,446
having snacks

171
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:21,681
and chatting?

172
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,816
We didn't have any snacks.

173
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:23,750
You did.

174
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,284
And you said,

175
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,451
"Can you imagine him

176
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,286
smiling...?"

177
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,321
You just had your tooth pulled out
and you're talking so much?

178
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,164
What did I just say?

179
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,167
Try not to talk in the next 40 minutes

180
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,036
and bite the cotton ball.

181
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,539
Make an appointment
for him to come back next week.

182
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,173
Why?

183
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,641
Why should I come back?

184
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,043
To remove the stitches.

185
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,313
Did you stitch it?

186
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,350
I didn't want you to freak out,
so I didn't tell you.

187
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,019
How's your feeling?

188
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,857
I said you wouldn't feel pain, right?

189
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:09,095
You were right.

190
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,967
Don't take the medicine

191
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,902
with sleeping pills.

192
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,170
I know!

193
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,406
It's better to get rid of
the causes of your insomnia

194
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,075
than to rely on sleeping pills.

195
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,080
If you still can't fall asleep,

196
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,186
just hold...

197
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:35,154
Hold...

198
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,856
The pillow I gave you.

199
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,497
Thank you.

Annoying.

202
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,318
Are you done?

203
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:05,885
Yes.

204
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,702
The giveaways
are getting bigger and bigger.

205
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,571
It's not a giveaway.

206
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,973
It was given

207
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,542
by Jin Xun'an personally.

208
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,511
Then you just took it?

209
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,979
You get tempted?

210
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:34,881
Tempted?

211
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,351
What does that feel like?

212
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,854
It doesn't happen that easily.

213
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,425
I don't know

214
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,693
if it is easy.

215
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:49,862
But the feeling of being tempted...

216
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,231
Come here.

217
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,536
It is

218
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,037
like

219
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,506
no matter how many people there are,

220
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,275
I will find him immediately.

221
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,845
When I see him,

222
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:08,348
I feel tightness in my chest,

223
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,984
my heart beats faster,

224
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,285
and I even feel like

225
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,953
time stops.

226
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,889
Loving someone is not that complicated.

227
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:19,959
Little one, you know it?

228
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,161
He's just a kid. What does he know?

229
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,296
I know.

230
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,567
He called you.

231
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,067
Me?

232
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,140
He called you.

233
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,910
What do you want to do?

234
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:39,412
You...

235
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,213
Shh.

236
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,954
If you're tempted,

237
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,822
you will feel it.

238
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,660
You will want to box him in,

239
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,162
get close to him,

240
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,365
touch him,

241
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,870
and the touch

242
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,176
will be like electric shock.

You can't make it up, right?

245
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,956
I was not making that up.

246
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:25,658
Get ready to work.

247

Here's the material
for next week's workshop.

00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,107
Put it here.

Shall we have a meal together?

Yeah.

Good to see you here.

256
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:24,217
Hello.

257
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,651
Here is our menu.

258
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,553
I highly recommend

259
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:28,855
our handmade kiln baked pizza.

260
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,623
It's a thin-crust one.

261
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,591
Probably

262
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,659
you would think the size is too big.

talk less.

and you'll have the other half.

No.

Just call me Bai Lang.

322

You can call me A.

A.

325

This afternoon, I heard you saying

326
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,702
that your director
was once emotionally hurt.

327
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,903
What exactly happened?

328
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,338
You heard that?

329
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,007
I heard from others

330

By walking.

The noodles are tasty.

340
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,803
But I still love stewed rice.

341

Next time...

342

He's always with you.

344
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,779
I'll make it for you next time.

345
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,847
What's wrong?

346
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,618
There's something.

347

Thanks.

348
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:48,654
Maybe I got it

349
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:49,755
when I was making dessert.

350
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,990
Excuse me.

351
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,659
Between the Sheets.

352
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,795
I didn't order it.

353
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,165
The customer at the bar
treated you the drink.

354
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,133
And her phone number.

355
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,069
Take it back.

356
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,503
Say thank you to her.

357
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,538
And

358
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,839
her drinks are on me.

359
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,940
Take it back?

360
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,309
I'll pay.

361
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,010
Okay.

362
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,317
Do you often get drinks

363
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,452
from others?

364
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,387
How is that possible?

365
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,289
It's always me who treats others drinks.

366
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,226
I don't accept others' offers easily.

367
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,864
So I am not

368
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,165
one of the "others".

369
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,267
What?

370
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,972
Didn't you accept my pillow toy?

371
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,480
Enjoy yourselves.

372
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,280
I have to go now.

373
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,428
I didn't see anything.

374
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:12,128
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

375
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:21,947
Alex.

376
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:23,249
Can I ask you a question?

377
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,183
No.

378
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,285
Please, just one question.

379
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,920
What question?

380
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,588
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

381
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,390
It's nothing to do with you.

382
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,092
Have you?

383
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,160
No.

384
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,128
Hurry up. We're closing.

385
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,364
What if a customer wants to treat you

386
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:39,398
Between the Sheets?

387
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,066
Do you know what that means?

388
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,168
I just searched.

389
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,669
I'll reject it.

390
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,471
Why?

391
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:46,772
Wouldn't it be nice

392
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,641
if someone likes you
and tells the feelings to you bravely?

393
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:49,208
RJ.

394
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,610
There's a fine line

395
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,845
between bravery and recklessness.

396
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,914
You may not

397
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,849
get the love you want.

398
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:58,684
Understand?

399
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:01,720
So you haven't?

400
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,290
Fine.

401
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,458
If you think I have had
a crush, then I have.

402
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:05,991
Alex.

403
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:09,261
Seriously, have you?

404
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,863
Don't forget to take the board in.

405
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,933
If I do it, catch me up on that.

406
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:14,834
No.

407
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:17,303
Then I won't do it.

408
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:19,572
Alex.

409
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,841
Have you?

410
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:54,006
Can you introduce me to some people?

411
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:55,741
No.

412
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:57,810
Why?

413
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,678
Please.

414
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,213
What kind of people?

415
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,114
What do you want to do?

416
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,283
That's a secret.

417
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,919
Doesn't sound like a good thing.

418
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,121
It is.

419
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,090
You just do it.

420
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:13,325
Okay, let me think about it.

421
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,562
But,

422
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,764
haven't you been getting along well

423
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:19,899
with that director lately?

424
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,604
Yeah, but...

425
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,909
♪If you are destined to be my love♪

426
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,888

429

430
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,457

00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:37,792

432
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:41,271

433
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:44,878
♪And forgotten♪

434
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:05,571
I think he must have suffered

435
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,473
from severe emotional damage.

436
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,941
Why?

437
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,144
I heard about it from A.

438
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,379
Our director

439
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,013
was very close to a senior

440
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,148
whose surname is Ye at that time.

441
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,017
He helped that guy every time he needed.

442
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:18,751
Everyone said

443
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,320
they would end up together.

444
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,388
But that senior

445
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,056
married someone else in the end.

446
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,024
Later...

447
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,859
That guy had been using him,

448
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,127
and they didn't even
start dating officially

449
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,628
when the guy left him.

450
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:32,364
No wonder he hasn't been
in a relationship for so many years.

451
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,535
But didn't that happen a long time ago?

452
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:37,636
Maybe

453
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,071
he has already let it go.

454
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,840
You don't understand.

455
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,742
I'm a big trouble myself.

456
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:44,810
Sometimes I don't even know

457
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,211
what I want.

458
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,415
He has been hurt once.

459
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,617
I'll probably bring him another damage.

460
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,487
I will be with him

461
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:56,655
as a friend.

462
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,290
It's the best for him.

463
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,391
Bro.

464
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,794
Have you heard of YOLO?
[*Sounds like indecisive in Chinese]

465
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:02,895
I know

466
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:03,862
I'm indecisive sometimes.

467
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:05,164
No.

468
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,932
YOLO.

469
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,735
You only live once.

470
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,837
There is only one life.

471
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,706
Do whatever you want to do.

472
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,641
Don't hesitate.

473
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,245
I'm serious.

474
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,848
You always think too much.

475
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,118
Or do you have any concerns

476
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:26,952
that you haven't told me about?

477
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:27,853
No.

478
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:28,854
No?

479
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,155
Why are you always afraid

480
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,490
to take the first step?

481
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,058
You're always stopped by yourself.

482
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:38,530
Relax.

483
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,932
Don't think so much.

484
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,266
Follow your heart.

485
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:42,835
Alright.

486
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,570
Don't forget to
introduce me to some people.

487
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,841
Is the pickle spicy?

488
00:23:58,848 --> 00:23:59,744
So spicy.

489
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,756
You are still eating it?

490
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,557
It's so spicy.

491
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,492
It burns.

492
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,159
Sir.

493
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,594
I don't think so.

494
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:10,829
More soup.

495
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,554
You're still awake?

496
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,356
I'm adapting myself to your timetable.

497
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:40,993
What's the matter?

498
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,929
Well,

499
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,565
my clinic will be closed
the day after tomorrow.

500
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,233
If you are free...

501
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,068
You want to go out with me?

502
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,504
Yes.

503
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,406
We can go out to play.

504
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,509
Play what?

505
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,244
Do some workouts.

506
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:00,279
Or what?

507
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,681
Send me

508
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,583
the time and address.

509
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,853
Do you

510
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,389
want to do something exciting

511
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:11,623
or less exciting?

512
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,826
I don't exercise. I have no idea.

513
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:16,962
Just give me something.

514
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,764
Outdoor or indoor?

515
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:20,399
Both are okay.

516
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,567
Up to you.

517
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,472
Don't put your hand
on your lips anymore.

518
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,610
Text me later.

519
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,678
Have a good night.

520
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:33,879
Hold on.

521
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:35,547
Remember

522
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:36,882
not to take sleeping pills anymore.

523
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:41,553
Alright.

524
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,222
Bye.

525
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,909
Momo, Patrick, Ray,

526
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:06,545
Happy, Duffy, Shark,

527
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:08,313
Turtle, Andy,

528
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,282
Teddy, Sammi,

529
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,150
I'm telling you.

530
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,885
This is

531
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,887
your new friend.

532
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:16,955
Do you have any advice on its name?

533
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,224
I have no idea.

534
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,060
I should have left you in my bistro.

535
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,562
You're so big

536
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,963
and take up too much space.

537
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,605
Why should I hold you when sleeping?

538
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,107
I'm a man.

539
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,942
How can I hold a toy when sleeping?

540
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,379
And I already have so many good friends.

541
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,455
But you are cute

542
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:52,991
and comfortable

543
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:55,227
to touch.

544
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,697
Don't want me to name you.

545
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,966
I don't want to invest emotion.

546
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,236
If that happens, it'll be sad

547
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,805
to see you get dirty or lost.

548
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:24,489
Smells good.

549
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,658
Alright.

550
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,393
From today on, your name

551
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:30,162
will be Xun'an Pillow.

552
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:32,564
Guys,

553
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:34,032
this is Xun'an Pillow.

554
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:34,933
OK.

555
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:37,803
Let's go.

556
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:39,271
Time to sleep.

557
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,339
Come one by one.

558
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,859
The man you treated last time

559
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,494
wants you to be his dentist,

560
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:04,162
so you have
an extra patient this afternoon.

561
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,998
Who?

562
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,134
Mr. Chi.

563
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:11,670
I come back.

564
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,939
You were originally
the director's patient.

565
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,007
He just went out

566
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:15,974
and will come back soon.

567
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,142
Just a moment.

568
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,910
But...

569
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,379
But last time your director said...

570
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,213
Director.

571
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:23,682
Director.

572
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,418
Mr. Chi was originally your patient,

573
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,186
so today...

574
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,121
He's your patient now.

575
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:30,956
Wait, director.

576
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:32,524
I just treated him for you last time,

577
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:33,392
and

578
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:33,992
you know

579
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:36,695
most of my patients are children.

580
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:38,597
It's better for a patient like him

581
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:39,498
to be treated by...

582
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,533
You should finish the job,

583
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,335
no matter if it's an adult or a kid.

584
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:47,506
Okay.

585
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:52,544
Mr. Chi.

586
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,615
A is the youngest dentist

587
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,150
in my clinic.

588
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,418
He's young,

589
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:02,387
but he's very patient and careful.

590
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,822
He is most suitable for patients

591
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:06,425
who are lively

592
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,595
and like to show that they are brave.

593
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,064
I agree.

594
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,598
I felt it last time.

595
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,167
I felt no pain at all

596
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,568
the last time he treated me.

597
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:17,536
Little A

598
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,203
is impressive.

599
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,042
Little A.

600
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,644
I'll give you

601
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,045
a "best employee" sticker later.

602
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,914
Room 3 is empty.

603
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,282
Go check it.

604
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:31,216
Director.

605
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,984
Why did you call me Little A?

606
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,287
Room 3.

607
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,424
Apple.

608
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:41,026
Is Room 3 really empty?

609
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:41,993
Yes.

610
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,361
Just go.

611
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:56,241
It doesn't hurt now.

612
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:58,143
Are you free later?

613
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:58,577
I'll treat you dinner.

614
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:00,745
No need. I'll have some bread.

615
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,748
Bread is not nutritious enough,

616
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:04,449
and I heard

617
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:06,952
that doctors often
don't have meals at regular time.

618
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,386
How about this?

619
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:09,888
I know a secret place

620
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:10,889
right next to the clinic.

621
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:11,923
I'll take you there.

622
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:14,192
I don't know
if I have other patients coming.

623
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,294
The next patient will come in two hours.

624
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,196
Just go there.

625
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:21,299
Little A.

626
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,535
Call me A.

627
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:25,570
A.

628
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,472
My teeth count on you now.

629
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:28,607
You are much better

630
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:29,608
than the director.

631
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:30,809
Is that true?

632
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:31,743
Tell me,

633
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,211
in what way?

634
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,081
Well,

635
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,917
at least I dare to see a dentist.

636
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,120
Thank you for your comment.

637
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,356
Do you want to watch my game?

638
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,291
Okay, if I'm free.

639
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,069
I didn't expect you to
invite me to rock climbing.

640
00:30:58,069 --> 00:30:59,938
It is a full-body exercise
that builds your muscle, endurance

641
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,040
and agility.

642
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,009
And it helps you sleep better.

643
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,978
I will have a good sleep tonight.

644
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:08,346
But,

645
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:10,182
why do you like it?

646
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,785
You can do it by yourself,

647
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,320
and it's very quiet.

648
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,857
So you like

649
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,992
to do things alone?

650
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,436
Time shouldn't be wasted
on unimportant persons.

651
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,972
I only want those
who are important to me around.

Yes.

677
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,170
I can do this alone.

678
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,705
Can you?

679
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,342
Yes. Thank you.

680
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,610
Okay.

681
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,555
What are you doing?

682
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:34,759
Hold this if you're nervous.

683
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:38,730
What is this?

684
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,031
It's specially prepared for you.

685
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,669
Thanks.

686
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,573
Relax.

687
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:49,774
I'm your dentist.

688
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,512
I know.

689
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:55,980
Just because of you,

690
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:59,150
I would like to be here.

691
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,389
Just for that,

692
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,192
I won't make you feel pain.

693
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:08,893
I'm not that timid.

694
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:10,562
I can bear a little pain,

695
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:12,931
but only a little.

696
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,640
Leave your teeth to me.

697
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,221
(I am no longer afraid)

698
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,556
(not because I have overcome my fear,)

699
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,126
(but because of that guy.)

700
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:46,030
(But)

701
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,832
(what if he disappears one day?)

702
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,502
(Will I)

703
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:52,871

00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,947
A classic story
of a boss and a bartender.

707

I am into you.

I'm sending patients to you.

709

Why the long face?

710
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:11,623
Are you playing dumb

711
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,557
or do you really forget it?

712
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:13,792
I'm like an idiot.

713
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:16,694
Do I bring you misfortune

714
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,497
when I'm by your side?

715
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:20,932
(My teeth hurt.)

716
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:23,835
(It's all your fault.)
