(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,220
What a coincidence.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,522
Here you are.

4
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,057
One, two, three.

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,193
Lang.

6
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:14,394
Guys...

7
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:15,295
Thanks for coming

8
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:17,831
to the White Dark Bistro & Flavor
5th anniversary party.

9
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:19,866
We finally made it through!

10
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:25,672
I want to especially thank my sister.

11
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,675
Let's toast to my sister.

12
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,711
Come on. Cheers.

13
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,612
Cheers.

14
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,653
You're all here.

15
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:40,087
How strange.

16
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,922
I chose

17
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:43,256
your day off.

18
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:44,991
Why isn't your director here yet?

19
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,026
I don't know.

20
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,128
Maybe he's a little tired these days.

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,428
Bai.

22
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,264
You must have taken
our director somewhere.

23
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:54,401
They're in love.

24
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,002
Wow.

25
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:56,837
Cheers.

26
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,372
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

27
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,373
Enjoy yourselves.

28
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:00,640
Okay.

29
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,977
I just ordered a Long Island.

30
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,045
It's been a while.

31
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,513
Yeah.

32
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,184
How are things with you and Jin Xun'an?

33
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:18,992
How are things with you and He Qingtian?

34
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,297
None of your business.

35
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,373
(Jin Xun'an.)

36
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,208
(It's the third week.)

37
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,744
(Don't show up anymore.)

38
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,548
(How dare you hang me out to dry.)

39
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,020
(The Chinese character of "man"
consists of two strokes.)

40
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:51,558
(It's wrong if one stroke is missing.)

41
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,095
(I'm not scared of being alone,)

42
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:58,031
(but sometimes
in a room full of people,)

43
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,634
(I feel more lonely.)

44
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:13,216

which do you choose?)

Stop saying you're sorry anymore.

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,208
I'm tired of hearing it.

62
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,610
(I'm done.)

63
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,946

You're done?

65
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,884
What are you working on these days?

66
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,552
(It's over, anyway.)

67
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:27,587
(Just tell me)

68
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,756
(what you've been hiding from me.)

69
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:30,657
(Tell me,)

70
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,026
(or I won't talk to you.)

71
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,596
Won't you?

72
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,232
Are you free tomorrow at noon?
I'll go to see you.

73
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:42,435
(I may not have time for you tomorrow.)

74
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,338
Then you go to bed early.
I'll take a shower.

75
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,840
Don't forget to think about me.

76
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,737
Bai Lang.

77
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,179
You've been hanging me out for so long.

78
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,147
And you tried hard

79
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:30,617
to let me come here to hear the reasons.

80
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,152
I'm listening.

81
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,087
What have you been up to?

82
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:38,592
Change into an equestrian outfit
and I'll tell you.

83
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,327
Have you ever ridden a horse?

84
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,029
No.

85
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,131
Let me teach you.

86
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:52,305
I want to, but I don't dare to see you.

87
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm afraid

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,376
I'll lose my courage when I see you.

89
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,912
I will want to stay around you.

90
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,428
Didn't we say each of us
wouldn't carry it alone

91
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,530
but go through it together?

92
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,566
I'd worry about you.

93
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,842
Jin Xun'an.

94
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,977
I am angry.

95
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:35,715
What am I supposed to do?

96
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:38,952

00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,530
Home?

108
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,798
Whose home?

109
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,233
Home of my parents

110
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,569
and your future in-laws.

111
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,338
My in-laws?

112
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:34,808
Yes.

113
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,576
Call them as you like.

114
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,845
They're gonna be your parents anyway.

115

Jin Xun'an.

116
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,221
Will your parents be okay

117
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:51,024
with me being your boyfriend?

118
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,527
The point is you're the one I want.

119
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,098
Jin Xun'an.

120

124

I've only been home a while

125
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,777
and now you're going to put my bed away.

126
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,379
- Can't you...?
- Come back?

127
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,949
I went back and found out
my dad was really sick.

128
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,519
So I took time off
to help my mom at home.

129
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:56,089
Bai Lang didn't tell you?

130

This guy.

131
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,761
I miss you a lot these days.

132
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,763
Do you miss me?

133
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,386
I'm out of breath.

134
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,025
The light.

135
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,359
I don't know how many times
I've told Bai Lang to fix it,

136
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,762
but he never did.

137
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,097
I really need to get it fixed.

138
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,166
So you miss me?

139
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,236
If you say so.

140
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,737
Tell me.

141
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,382
(FAMILY)
No way...

142
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,118
unless I die.

143
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,160
Please agree to us being together.

144
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,695
I can make sure

145
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:12,398
that no one can give him
more happiness than I can.

146
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,200
What are you talking about, young man?

147
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,668
You are so arrogant.

148
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,205
It's not about arrogance.

149
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,107
It's the truth.

150
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,617
Relax.

151
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,795
Hi, son.

152
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:43,730
Xun'an.

153
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,797
Hello.

154
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:45,999
This is my mom.

155
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:46,566
Hello.

156
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,567
You are Bai Lang?

157
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,067
Yes.

158
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,168
I'm Xun'an's mother.

159
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,136
Welcome to our home.

160
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:51,237
Here is a small gift.

161
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,906
Thank you very much.

162
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:53,740
I hope I am not intruding.

163
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,607
No.

164
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,009
Let me introduce you.

165
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,744
She is Xun'an's aunt,

166
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:58,778
a university teacher.

167
00:09:58,778 --> 00:09:59,445
Hello.

168
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,381
This is her son, Drake,

169
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:02,482
and her daughter, Mita.

170
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,451
This is his aunt too,
who's in the clothing business.

171
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,120
His uncle-in-law, a photographer.

172
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,587
Hello.

173
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,321
Hello.

174
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,822
Sit down. Do you want any drinks?

175
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:10,924
Don't bother, really.

176
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:11,557
I'll do it.

177
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:12,392
Okay. Get him some juice.

178
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,593
Take your seat.

179
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:13,927
Please.

180
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,061
Take a seat.

181
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,131
He's Xun'an's dad.

182
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,666
Hello.

183
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,668
We are making dumplings.

184
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,236
Xun'an said you're a good cook.

185
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,871
Can you make dumplings?

186
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,306
I haven't done it yet.

187
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:26,906
Really?

188
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:27,974
I'll teach you.

189
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,176
Are you sure? You teach him?

190
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,644
My sister is in the clothing business.

191
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,379
She makes pretty dumplings.

192
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,548
It's called art.

193
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:36,182
I don't think so.

194
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,717
I heard you're running a pub.

195
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,419
Yeah, I have a bistro.

196
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,053
Perhaps you can

197
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,888
go to my bistro to eat dinner

198
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,323
and drink some sometime.

199
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,958
Just some?

200
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,858
Bottles.

201
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,993
Bottles. Your treat?

202
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:47,493
My treat.

203
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,628
You'll be too drunk,

204
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,863
because they are good drinkers.

205
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:51,998
My sister can drink a lot.

206
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,333
She has trained herself.

207
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,334
We can go there together.

208
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,134
Don't let her drink anymore.

209
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,036
Don't let her drink anymore.

210
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:58,771
Why? Is there a story?

211
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,039
What story?

212
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,007
I want to know.

213
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,742
Well, I see.

214
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:05,912
That's why you all came back to see me

215
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:09,115
when I said Xun'an was coming back.

216
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:10,016
You said you missed me.

217
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,317
We missed you a lot.

218
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:14,687
Missed me? I don't think so.

219
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,389
It was just me.

220
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,858
Not what I pictured.

221
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:19,926
How could you say that?

222
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,195
Do we have to pick
a time to get together?

223
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,629
It's so nice
to have the family together.

224
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,198
Yeah, we're all so busy.

225
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:26,666
But I don't go the university today,

226
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,101
and the sister just got back

227
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,802
from her busy schedule.

228
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:33,139
Fine. I can't win with you.

229
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,273
The dumplings are almost finished.

230
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,808
Take some of them if you want.

231
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:36,275
Aren't we going to eat together?

232
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,911
We don't usually have many people here.

233
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,080
There are too many now

234
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,749
and the noise gives me a headache.

235
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,017
I'll go have some rest.

236
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,685
My brother.

237
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,253
Don't be unhappy.

238
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,324
I'm not.

239
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,027
So noisy.

240
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,195
We're not noisy at all.

241
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,197
Didn't you just...?

242
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,402
Sorry.

243
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:05,304
That's it for today.

244
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,939
Distribute the dumplings

245
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,408
and take them back yourselves.

246
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,009
Okay.

247
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:10,743
Help me clean it up.

248
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,678
I'll help with it.

249
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,114
- Next time.
- Okay.

250
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,482
There will be a next time.

251
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,651
It's not easy for you.
My brother is so difficult.

252
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:19,652
It's alright.

253
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:20,420
Okay. We are leaving.

254
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,921
Okay.

255
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,823
Okay.

256
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:24,624
Take care of him.

257
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:25,591
Okay. Bye.

258
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:26,893
Bye, aunty.

259
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,828
Goodbye.

260
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,930
Sorry. It was really embarrassing.

261
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,531
No.

262
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,266
But his dad is a simple man.

263
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,967
Just forget it

264
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,469
if he doesn't say he's unhappy.

265
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,937
Leave him alone.

266
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,072
Would you help me in the kitchen?

267
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,174
I'll cook more for dinner.

268
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,475
Okay.

269
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,976
I'm good at cooking.

270
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,711
Good.

271
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,099
Give me a hand here.

272
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:06,966
Okay.

273
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:14,207
Do you eat onions?

274
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,942
Yes.

275
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,310
Is there anything you don't eat?

276
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,344
I eat anything

277
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:20,279
except spicy food.

278
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,614
- You don't eat spicy food?
- No.

279
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,883
But we eat.

280
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,118
It's okay. I...

281
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,986
I can eat a little.

282
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,921
We just happen to be out of chili.

283
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,656
Lucky escape.

284
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:31,791
Would you like something to drink?

285
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,593
No. Water is okay.

286
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:34,160
Don't bother.

287
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,495
Okay.

288
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:36,929
What do you eat

289
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,598
with Xun'an?

290
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,366
I make some simple rice stew

291
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,100
or pasta.

292
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,602
That's it.

293
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:45,104
Cook whatever I see in the kitchen

294
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,140
or fridge.

295
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,774
Well...

296
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:52,178
Xun'an didn't like to eat eggplant,

297
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,847
yam and the like since he was a child?

298
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,382
He got it from me.

299
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:57,550
I don't like them either.

300
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,152
Really?

301
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,368
I'm sure Xun'an didn't tell you

302
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,202
how he solved

303
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,437
your concerns.

304
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,773
No. I...

305
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,476
I asked him but he didn't tell me.

306
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:29,282
What matters to me
is only his happiness,

307
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,951
but his father is different.

308
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,653
In the last few weeks,

309
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:38,124
they've done all the hitting,
swearing, breaking and kneeling.

310
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,459
Are you trying to piss me off?

311
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,028
What exactly is wrong with you?

312
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:43,729
You're so ridiculous.

313
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,498
Don't hit our son.

314
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:29,842
He said he wanted you

315
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,778
to have a complete family.

316
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,315
He wants you to be not just his partner

317
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,984
but our family.

318
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:42,355
There's nothing wrong with him

319
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:46,892
except his lack of passion for anything.

320
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:48,194
I ask him what he wants,

321
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:51,163
and he says he's okay with anything.

322
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,632
He doesn't care whether he gets it

323
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:54,600
or even gets nothing.

324
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,071
It's the first time
I've ever seen him that persistent.

325
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,379
The chances of meeting
someone you like and being together

326
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,114
are very small.

327
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,182
Now that you found each other,

328
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:11,784
let your happiness prove to everyone

329
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,886
that it is all worth it.

330
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,423
I invited his aunts and the others

331
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:21,627
just to cheer us up,

332
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,928
lighten his father's mood

333
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:24,864
and make it less awkward.

334
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,766
However...

335
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,437
Actually, I think

336
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:33,472
it would be nice to have another son.

337
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:39,545
You can think of me as your mother.

338
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:40,813
As for his dad,

339
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,915
wait till he gets a little softer.

340
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,963
You don't need to cook.

341
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,768
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

342
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:03,969
Restaurant?

343
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,038
The spicy food restaurant you like.

344
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,546
I made a reservation for four.

345
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,848
Come on.

346
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,717
Get ready to go.

347
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,588
What's wrong with you?

348
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,391
Your chess skills
have not improved at all.

349
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:33,299
Bad. You're eating spicy food with us.

350
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,937
It doesn't matter. I can eat more rice.

351
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,205
Good.

352
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,864
(Jin Xun'an's trophies)

353
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:03,963
Water.

354
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,831
Thanks.

355
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:07,666
Or you want ice water?

356
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,068
That's enough.

357
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:16,308
What's wrong?

358
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,623
I feel bad for you.

359
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,961
Don't worry.

360
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:38,597
I inflicted injury
upon myself on purpose.

361
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,032
You promise...

362
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,837
You care too much about it.

363
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,775
You won't carry it alone again.

364
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,811
At least tell me.

365
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:53,946
I can help you with the dressing.

366
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:58,417
There isn't "again".

367
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,386
There is.

368
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:04,323
Your mom said if you bully me,

369
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,225
you'll get beaten again.

370
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:11,063
Well, I'd like to give it a try.

371
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,271
Then I have to do it first.

372
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,278
Xun'an.

373
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,648
Your dad asked if Bai Lang plays chess.

374
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,652
Is your dad gonna play chess with me?

375
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,221
I guess so.

376
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,357
Go with me.

377
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:38,891
Go.

378
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:39,892
Go.

379
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,228
Hurry up and don't keep him waiting.

380
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:43,329
I know.

381
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,920
(Everything will be fine. Even if it's
the end of the world, the sun still rises.)

382
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,903
It's the only time you're like a woman.

383
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,811
Why are you here?

384
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:37,016
I'm going to Hualian.

385
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,183
Today?

386
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:41,353
Yeah, I'm going
to do research in Hualian.

387
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:43,022
Oh, right.

388
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,758
You worked overtime again?
You look so tired.

389
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:46,759
Would you like some coffee?

390
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,594
I really need it. Thank you.

391
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:50,529
I've made sandwiches.

392
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,164
I want.

393
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,939
Why don't you wait inside?

394
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:03,075
Photosynthesis. To get more sun.

395
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,213
You go to Hualian alone?
What about Zhanyang?

396
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,882
Who will take care of him?

397
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,550
He will go with me.

398
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,451
So where is he?

399
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,653
A little boy.

400
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,522
His classmates insist on seeing him off.

401
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,357
He'll be here in a minute.

402
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,229
You know what?

403
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:28,667
Zhanyang likes you very much.

404
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,435
I know it.

405
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:31,670
I like him very much, too.

406
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,674
Actually, his mother

407
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:40,279
didn't hold him much,

408
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,916
so

409
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,719
maybe the warmth you gives him

410
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,387
helps make up

411
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,423
for his lack since birth.

412
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:08,073
That woman will regret

413
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:10,275
for not cherishing you.

414
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,862
There is something.

415
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,664
There is something.

416
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:32,898
Where is it?

417
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:34,933
Where is it?

418
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:52,785
Daddy.

419
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:56,789
Come here.

420
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,826
Why are you here?

421
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:02,428
Are you here to see us off?

422
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:04,596
I'm going to Hualian with you.

423
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,632
I'll work there.

424
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,033
Would you like a sandwich?

425
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:08,667
Yeah.

426
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,603
Your dad made really good ones.

427
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:14,106
Does it taste good?

428
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,108
I want more.

429
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,610
Come on. What's the use of going to her

430
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,479
instead of your father
when you are hungry?

431
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,214
She's just like you and can only eat.

432
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:28,987
Mr. Ye.

433
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,223
I think you can

434
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,459
take her home.

435
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,829
Just one more person.

436
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,897
You taught him to say that?

437
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:41,667
Look, she can't take care of herself.

438
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,436
And you're gonna be working

439
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,772
in the same city.

440
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:49,842
I'll have one more person to play with.

441
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:53,345
Turn.

442
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,813
Turn.

443
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,482
What are you doing?

444
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:58,283
Turn. Do what he did.

445
00:23:58,283 --> 00:23:58,817
What is it?

446
00:23:58,817 --> 00:23:59,852
That's it.

447
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:00,486
It is...

448
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,320
I don't quite know either.

449
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,021
But that's it.

450
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,823
What were you doing, Zhanyang?

451
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,724
What is it?

452
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,992
Kamen Rider.

453
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,861
Kamen Rider.

454
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:22,176
(Eight months later)

455
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,472
(Xunying Dental Clinic)

456
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:28,432
(Trouvaille Dental Clinic)

457
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:31,583
(Live well, laugh often,
and find yourselves.)

458
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,186
I didn't order food.

459
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,387
Someone canceled his order,

460
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,623
and I'm right around here,
so I carried it here.

461
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:41,560
But there's too much.

462
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,995
So many people here.

463
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,164
You can share it.

464
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:47,566
Thanks, Renmin.

465
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:50,068
All right. I'm leaving.

466
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:51,003
Bye.

467
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:51,670
Bye.

468
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,437
Bye, Mr. Chi.

469
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:53,505
Bye.

470
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,143
He brought so much.

471
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,278
Cherry, come here.

472
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,648
Such a feast.

473
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:04,283
It's all your favorite food.

474
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,185
So much. Would anyone really cancel?

475
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,687
How could that happen?

476
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,122
Look.

477
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,256
I'll go out for a minute.

478
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,658
Don't eat it.

479
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:15,227
Wait.

480
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,431
Wait a minute.
I want to ask you something.

481
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,166
What's the matter?

482
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,002
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

483
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:25,070
Weird.

484
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,205
I'm sorry.

485
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,610
Are you looking for me?

486
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,284
Our clothes are so different.

487
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,453
How could you mistake him for me?

488
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,162
So...

489
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,463
Well,

490
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,565
are you available on Sunday?

491
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,141
I won't go to practice this Sunday.

492
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,143
Fill in for me.

493
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,814
I haven't told you
what we're going to do.

494
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:10,849
I'll do whatever you say.

495
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,285
Tell me the time and place later.

496
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,863
Anything more?

497
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,798
No. Be careful when you work.

498
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:28,533
Ride safe.

499
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,135
I'm gonna go back. Bye.

500
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:31,336
Goodbye.

501
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:45,150
Jin Xun'an, where are you?

502
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,152
(Hurry up.)

503
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm coming.

504
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,121
I'm already here.

505
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:51,089
W-W-Where are you?

506
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,424
(I see you.)

507
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,493
(Keep going.)

508
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:56,328
- I don't see you.
- (Go on.)

509
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,195
Where are you?

510
00:26:57,195 --> 00:26:58,931
(Look up.)

511
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,367
Oh my...

512
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,706
You're really naughty.

513
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,074
Why don't we meet
at my bistro instead of here?

514
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,476
Do you remember this place?

515
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,477
