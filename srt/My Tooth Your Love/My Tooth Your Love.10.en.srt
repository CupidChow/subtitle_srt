1
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,204
What are you doing?

2
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:25,772
One more punch and I'll forgive you.

3
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:27,941
You're not that magnanimous.

4
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:28,875
One more punch from you

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,911
is just one more punch.

6
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,586
Jin Xun'an.

7
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,922
There's more to Langlang
than meets the eye.

8
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:43,724
If you don't have
enough confidence or hearts,

9
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,759
please stay away from him.

10
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,262
You know his situation

11
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,098
but leave it alone?

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,934
You are his sister.

13
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,971
I leave it alone?

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,473
You know that.

15
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:03,310
Doctors can't save patients
who don't want to be saved.

16
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,411
I know it but I can't do anything.

17
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,246
How do you think I feel?

18
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:09,716
Sorry.

19
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,154
Because I'm his sister,
I can't interfere.

20
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,957
Have you seen his baby tooth marbles?

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,328
They give him strength,

22
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:22,295
but also remind him

23
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:26,199
he caused the death of our parents.

24
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,034
He blames himself

25
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,771
and can't get past it.

26
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,376
Can you shoulder the burden with him?

27
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:38,779
Or you just see him as another Ye Qiran?

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,482
Here we go again.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,184
(What exactly did they say?)

30
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:46,420
(He's just my senior.)

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,821
(That's it.)

32
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,122
(Bai Lang is just Bai Lang.)

33
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:49,790
(You can test me,)

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,159
(but don't compare him to anyone else.)

35
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,228
Can you stand him?

36
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:56,630
He's my brother.

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,764
I know how sensitive he is.
He needs lots of...

38
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,299
You're not the one

39
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,368
I should make a promise to.

40
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:06,273
You just need to watch us.

41
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,674
From now on,

42
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:08,775
he won't be afraid of the dark,

43
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,877
he won't be afraid of loneliness.

44
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,612
Because I'll be by his side.

45
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,861
I told you I'd do it again.

46
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,663
I'm over it.

47
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,836
You...

48
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,771
It's okay. I'm not angry anymore.

49
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:38,839
We are fine.

50
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,141
I'm so hungry. Hurry up and cook.

51
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,143
Okay.

52
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,078
Xun'an.

53
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,446
Did my sister do anything to you?

54
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:49,783
No. I'm hungry.

55
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,287
Dinner's almost ready.

56
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,056

(Xunying Dental Clinic)

69
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:54,414
Morning.

70
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:58,418
Why are you here, Renmin?

71
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,287
I was just passing by,

72
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,924
and I brought you breakfast.

73
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,159
So nice. Thanks.

74
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:12,198
Why didn't you come to watch the game?

75
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,266
Sorry.

76
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,969
My director asked me to do something,

77
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,771
so...

78
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,107
Right. Doctors are busy.

79
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,810
Then are you free next Friday

80
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,246
or next weekend?

81
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,981
Next week?

82
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,283
Sunday. I have next Sunday off.

83
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,319
Sunday...

84
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,790
Friday, Saturday, Sunday...

85
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:40,493
I happen to get a game next Sunday.

86
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,066
Don't forget to come.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,935
So you came here so early

88
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,137
just to bring me
breakfast and a ticket?

89
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,639
Not exactly.

90
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,808
I was just passing by

91
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:58,311
and wondered
if you had time to watch the game.

92
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,680
We can go skating together next time.

93
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,748
No, I really can't.

94
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:02,382
I have a bad sense of balance.

95
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:03,516
I... Renmin.

96
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,352
When I first came to this clinic,

97
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,487
someone told me
seeing a dentist wasn't scary.

98
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:08,822
Who was it?

99
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:10,223
It was you.

100
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:11,591
Me?

101
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,364
There's a first time for everything.

102
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,133
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

103
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,201
I'll text you later.

104
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,804
Remember to eat breakfast.

105
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,242
Renmin, bye.

106
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:30,243
Bye.

107
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,457
Yesterday my sister
gave you a hard time.

108
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,393
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,128
You don't need to.

110
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,096
That was a piece of cake

111
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,364
compared to what she did
to me in college.

112
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,299
Piece of cake.

113
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,501
That's good.

114
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,079
- Do you want to listen...?
- Do you want to listen...?

115
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,589
What are you laughing at?

116
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:22,996
No. I just have a special feeling.

117
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm laughing,

118
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,670
because I'm driving you
to work for the first time

119
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,773
after we started dating officially.

120
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,508
I am a little nervous.

121
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,244
I haven't felt this way before.

122
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,413
Me, too.

123
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,282
It was normal before,

124
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,384
but...

125
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:47,253
but today it seems a little strange.

126
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,425
What's strange?

127
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,262
I suddenly felt we were like schoolboys.

128
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:57,964
Schoolboys?

129
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,000
No, they beat us.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,570
At least they dare to hold hands.

131
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:11,077
(Be careful when dating
and don't be distracted while driving.)

132
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,613
Keep your eyes on the road...

133
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:16,516
Can we beat schoolboys now?

134
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:17,283
There's no car.

135
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,152
Do you keep your eyes
on the road, Jin Xun'an?

136
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:27,712
(Please be patient and do public displays
of affection after getting off.)

137
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,835
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

138
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,370
I can just walk over by myself.

139
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,339
Can't I walk you here?

140
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,079
Okay, we are here.

141
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,981
You can go back now.

142
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,016
I want to see you walk in.

143
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,985
You want a ticket?

144
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,553
I don't care.

145
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,288
You are more important.

146
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,524
So sweet.

147
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,331
How about skipping work

148
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,966
and staying with me today?

149
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,508
Bad habit.

150
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:22,015
Alright. Don't miss me too much.

151
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,149
I'll try not to.

152
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,888
I have something for you to eat.

153
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,466
Go in.

154
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,268
Hurry up, or your car
will be towed away.

155
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:46,432
(I kissed a mister out of anger.)

156
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,434
(His name is Alex.)

157
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,416
(Actually, he is young,)

158
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,785
(but very preachy.)

159
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,388
(But he doesn't force me to listen.)

160
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:14,160
(Today, Bai Lang asked about love.)

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,796
(I found myself having a crush)

162
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,398
(on that man.)

163
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,045
(I decided to learn mixology.)

164
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,180
(I don't want him to be so busy.)

165
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:49,529
(He knows the meaning of Pink Lady,)

166
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,031
(but he returned me
a glass of Gin Tonic.)

167
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,967
It's not okay today.

168
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,635
I'll teach you Gin Tonic first.

169
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,603
Starting with the basics.

170
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,473
Alright.

171

Thanks.

What are you doing?

188
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,135
What's the matter?

189
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:04,604
Do you need help?

190
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,240
No. I'm going up.

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,840

(Xunying Dental Clinic)

Dr. Jin.

195
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,348
How much longer?

196
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,219
I've been waiting for you for so long.

197
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,557
Behave,

198
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,526
or there will be consequences.

199
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,496
Okay.

200
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,731
Change your shift to get leave.

201
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,734
Let's go out for two days and one night.

202
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,871
Does that mean we'll have a sleepover?

203
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,906
You tell me.

204
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,843
Good.

205
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,778
I'm flexible with work hours anyway.

206
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,646
I'll do it.

207
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,854
Director, we're leaving.

208
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,325
Don't stay so late anymore.

209
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,626
Got it?

210
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,394
Okay.

211
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,496
Goodbye.

00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,030
Goodbye.

Can I?

214
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,672
You tell me.

Jin Xun'an.

216
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,639
What are you doing there?

217
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,907
Come up.

218
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:21,874
You come down.

219
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,809
Hurry up, you come up.

220
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:27,213
Come on... I've been waiting
for you for a long time.

221
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,382
I've been waiting for you
for a long time, and you're late.

222
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,118
Am I? I've been up here.

223
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:35,788
What exactly are you going to do?

224
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,123
- I've waited so long for you.
- Come up and you'll know it.

225
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,959
You're 30 minutes late.

226
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,295
Now 31 minutes.

227
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,663
So accurate.

228
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:44,764
Time moved more slowly

229
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:48,367
when you were waiting for me, right?

230
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,069
Did we make an agreement

231
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,972
that there would be punishment
for the one who was late?

232
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:53,606
Punishment?

233
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:56,809
You're 31 minutes late.

234
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:00,346
Maybe I'll like this punishment.

235
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,615
Hold on.

236
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:03,849
Look.

237
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,655
Does it look good?

238
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,924
Yeah.

239
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,259
Does it?

240
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,827
I said "yeah".

241
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,230
You're 30 minutes late for that.

242
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,365
Here you are.

243
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,033
They...

244
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,670
They're a pair.

245
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,939
You were hypnotized by me.

246
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:32,278
Piggy... You are my piggy.

247
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,747
Piggy.

248
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,618
You're not angry now?

249
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,586
No.

250
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,755
How could I be mad at you?

251
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,458
Then I'll put it on for you.

252
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,033
I hope you'll have

253
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,569
countless dental impressions.

254
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:00,573
Patients won't show up late or act up

255
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,908
except I can be late.

256
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,088
Do you like it?

257
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,823
I think

258
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,760
it's better this way.

259
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:24,940
Slow down.

260
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:26,766
Renmin.

261
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,200
You're as good as your word.

262
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,568
You do take me skating.

263
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:29,969
So we can get closer

264
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,937
to our dream of playing ball together.

265
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,239
Playing ball?

266
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,874
I'm a dentist, not a player.

267
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,076
It's a terrible sport.

268
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,044
I'll teach you.

269
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,278
Turn.

270
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,346
No. Ouch...

271
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,752
Are you okay?

272
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:51,924
Are you hurt?

273
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,126
I'm fine.

274
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,961
Let me help you up.

275
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,900
I used to practice the same way.

276
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,735
Perhaps I was too hasty.

277
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,871
I really want to play ball with you.

278
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,239
Let's go there.

279
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:15,114
Here you are.

280
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,387
Wait.

281
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,856
It's enough to watch you play.

282
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,991
But you want me to play ball with you?

283
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,793
I don't like it at all.

284
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,803
I mean, you spend
a lot of time inside the clinic

285
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,505
and don't get out much,

286
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,574
so I want to take you out.

287
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:44,543
And all my other friends
play ball and skate.

288
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,277
I think

289
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:47,046
we can play together.

290
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,054
But,

291
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,623
I don't think it's possible

292
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,292
for me to play with you like this.

293
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,700
Or I can treat them to dinner.

294
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,701
We don't have to play ball.

295
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,069
I can buy them dinner.

296
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:13,406
You're right.

297
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,249
Sorry.

298
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,118
No one

299
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,354
can spill water

300
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,089
on me.

301
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,891
I... I didn't mean to.

302
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,025
I'll buy you a new one.

303
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,261
I'll...

304
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,229
Only you can.

305
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,864
You have the privilege, Little A.

306
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:40,366
You're not angry?

307
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,500
What did you call me?

308
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,835
Little A.

309
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,203
What did I tell you last time?

310
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,438
Call me A, A.

311
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:46,806
So what? Little A.

312
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:47,606
How dare you?

313
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:48,674
How dare you splash me?

314
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:49,542
You will die.

315
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:49,975
Call me A.

316
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,977
Let's go skating.

317
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:53,412
Wait.

318
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,780
Come on.

319
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,548
You can do it.

320
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,649
Wait. I'm gonna fall down.

321
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,053
Time to turn. Watch out.

322
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,321
I think I got the hang of it.

323
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,290
Yeah. You did.

324
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,624
Should I keep the weight low?

325
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,326
Right, keep the weight low.

326
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:11,664
You really got the hang of it.

327
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,309
Hello, could you give me a basket?

328
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,376
Okay.

329
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:25,978
Thank you.

330
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,614
This one costs 50, right?

331
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:29,648
Yes.

332
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:39,492
Xun'an does not eat coriander.

333
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:42,495
Hello.

334
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,696
Hello.

335
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,538
You don't want to see me, right?

336
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:56,141
I just didn't expect

337
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,010
to see you do grocery shopping.

338
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,379
I always have my kid eat at home.

339
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,251
300, okay?

340
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,785
Fine...

341
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:07,386
Thanks.

342
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,420
No problem.

343
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,555
In addition to coriander,

344
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,323
Xun'an does not eat bok choy.

345
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,526
He doesn't like the bitter taste.

346
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,530
Gooey food like yams and okra.

347
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,165
He doesn't like it.

348
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:20,966
How much is the celery?

349
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,601
30.

350
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:23,969
He just doesn't like the earthy taste.

351
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,938
It doesn't mean
he doesn't like bok choy.

352
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:29,208
Here you are.

353
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:29,808
Thank you.

354
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:30,876
Thank you.

355
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,284
Thank you.

356
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,685
No problem.

357
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,258
You're trying to provoke me, right?

358
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:51,997
I just want to help you know him better.

359
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,300
Sure enough,

360
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,734
what is lost cannot be regained.

361
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:57,603
I am well aware of this,

362
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,472
so I cherish
my present relationship with Jin Xun'an.

363
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:03,142
You are his past. I am his future.

364
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:06,545
I know my man.

365
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,317
That's good.

366
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:15,988
I thought I knew him well too.

367
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:18,490
We all do it in our own way.

368
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,726
What does it mean?

369
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,830
At that time,

370
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,400
I was trapped inside my head.

371
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,070
We didn't give
each other what we wanted.

372
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,537
I don't know

373
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,138
what was going on with you.

374
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,607
But I'm sure I can give him

375
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,141
what he wants.

376
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:39,111
You're so sure.

377
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,781
Yeah.

378
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:46,852
Have you ever thought
about what Xun'an really wants?

379
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,489
I forgot to buy shiitake mushrooms.

380
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:57,888
(White Dark Bistro & Flavor)

381
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,438
Try this, RJ.

382
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,109
RJ is not here.

383
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,044
Can Bai Lang try it?

384
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,315
How is it?

385
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:19,785
It's too sour.

386
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,286
Too sour?

387
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:26,558
Do you worry about him?

388
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:28,994
No.

389
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,563
You sure?

390
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,466
You've seen his parents.

391
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,601
Will he get beat up

392
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,003
or even grounded

393
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,905
this time?

394
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,273
Either way,

395
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:43,308
that's what he has to face.

396
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,010
We don't need to worry.

397
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,745
I don't worry,

398
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:50,549
but you... I'm not sure.

399
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,317
I said I didn't.

400
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:56,922
But this kid is so heartless.

401
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,023
Since he left,

402
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,392
he hasn't even called us.

403
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,496
Or you take the initiative

404
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:05,998
to call him?

405
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:07,099
No.

406
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,201
Why should I contact him first?

407
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,302
He'll come to me

408
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,237
if he's in need.

409
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,276
You said "no",

410
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:20,512
but I think you're actually very eager.

411
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,354
Go deliver the lunch.

412
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:31,623
Listen,

413
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,859
you have to speak out your love.

414
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,761
How about singing it?

415
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:39,565
♪How do I speak out my love♪

416
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,301
You've really changed a lot.

417
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:18,403
You don't like sweet food, do you?

418
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:23,342
It used to be that way.

419
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:26,178
But after I fall in love with someone,

420
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:29,248
I realize that

421
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:31,650
people really change.

422
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,919
I think I can

423
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,555
change my principles a little bit.

424
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:43,128
Every time I think of him
taking care of me when I am sick

425
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:44,062
or making me lunch

426
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:48,167
when I am at work,

427
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,235
I am really happy.

428
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,739
So I'm eating these for him.

429
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,908
When I bring him here,

430
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,610
I can tell him which one he might like.

431
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,887
Well...

432
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,692
when do you go to Hualian?

433
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:15,460
After the Spring Festival.

434
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,532
Would it be okay
to take Zhan Yang with you?

435
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,601
Sure.

436
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,071
What I've gained these years

437
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,372
is only Zhan Yang.

438
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,208
Just a little hard.

439
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:33,412
Maybe for me and my son,

440
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,247
we're both waiting for the right person

441
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,082
to show up at the right time.

442
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:42,921
Hi, Orange and Dr. Jie.

443
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,056
Hi.

444
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:45,891
Why are you here, Mr. Bai?

445
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,161
I brought your director's lunch.

446
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,563
Director...

447
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:55,968
Mr. Bai.

448
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,336
Can you come here to take a look?

449
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,404
Do me a favor.

450
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:01,740
Help me straighten it.

451
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,908
Okay.

452
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,009
Yeah... That's it.

453
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:04,843
Is it okay?

454
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:06,044
It's you on it.

455
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,246
Yeah.

456
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:07,980
So pretty.

457
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,547
What's that?

458
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:09,314
Invisible braces.

459
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,549
I just had had my braces removed
when you first came.

460
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:11,250
I wore it for two years.

461
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,485
Do my teeth look good?

462
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:15,187
And I'm telling you, it's awesome.

463
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:16,688
It is comfortable to wear without pain,

464
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,056
and it can be taken down at any time.

465
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:20,525
I was really happy
not to wear metal braces.

466
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,494
And look at Orange.

467
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,495
Look...

468
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:25,464
She started wearing braces
just three months ago.

469
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:27,199
You don't see it, right?

470
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,867
Really, I didn't see it

471
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:29,768
before you told me.

472
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:30,836
Of course you can't see it.

473
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,971
They're invisible.

474
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:33,739
Wait.

475
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,375
Unless it's a wet kiss

476
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,943
or something.

477
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,044
If I'm going to kiss,

478
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,013
should I take them off?

479
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:42,781
Look at this.

480
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,149
We just need to put them

481
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:48,153
in this specially-designed container.

482
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,388
It looks nice.

483
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,155
Right?

484
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,557
You both really became prettier

485
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:54,126
after wearing these invisible braces.

486
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:54,893
Great.

487
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,161
Wait.

488
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,830
Are you here for our director, Mr. Bai?

489
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,665
Yeah.

490
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,934
He's in a cafe with his senior.

491
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:03,535
His senior?

492
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:05,804
"Sure enough"?

493
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,606
Yeah.

494
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,208
I'll handle it.

495
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,176
Handle?

496
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,744
Why did you tell him?

497
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:13,679
What do you mean?

498
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,646
Are you an idiot?

499
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:15,814
Why didn't the director pick up?

500
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,149
What were you doing?

501
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,053
It's about time.

502
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:27,459
Give me a hug.

503
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,231
A hug? Let me give you one.

504
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:36,969
Hug...

505
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:46,745
Thank you for taking care

506
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,181
of my man before.

507
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,687
Actually,

508
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:58,590
you're really a good cuddler.

509
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:06,565
What are you afraid of?

510
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,166
You're not my type.

511
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,534
Little kid.

512
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:10,635
You are not my type, either.

513
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:11,970
Thanks.

514
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,271
Weird.

515
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,740
Have a good trip.

516
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:19,211
"Have a good trip"?

517
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,078
Am I not enough for you?

518
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,714
You want to hug someone else?

519
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,683
I tried this for you.
I think you'll love it.

520
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,851
No.

521
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:26,952
Come on!

522
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,354
You must be alert.

523
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,710
Ye Qiran, senior year of dentistry.

524
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,778
What about you?

525
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:00,452
I'm telling you,

526
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:01,453
you can come
to my house for dinner later.

527
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,388
I'll make rice stew for you.

528
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:04,156
It tastes good.

529
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:04,956
Don't bother.

530
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:05,590
You've worked all day.

531
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,691
I'm telling you,

532
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,828
you will be the first friend
to come to my house.

533
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,797
I went last time.

534
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,267
As a guest.

535
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,349
Ye-Style Rice Stew in Super Simple Way.

536
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:32,284
Again.

537
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,418
Let me feed you.

538
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:37,089
Does it taste good?

539
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,804
(I hope you're)

540
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:03,842
(truly comfortable now.)

541
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,013
You're jealous.

542
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,950
I don't want to have heartburn.

543
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,191
I think I'm the one
who should be jealous.

544
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:21,092
Someone

545
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,827
hangs out with Alex at the store.

546
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:27,999
And those girls around.

547
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:34,306
I'm the one who needs to worry.

548
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,409
Someone else will take care of Alex.

549
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,077
I'm gonna put a notice
in the store tomorrow

550
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:41,179
saying this Bai is taken.

551
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,348
Am I sincere enough?

552
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:57,495
To show my exclusive affection for you,

553
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,564
I specially made

554
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,400
a delicious lunch today.

555
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,969
Try it.

556
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:06,805
Chinese yam with sesame sauce.

557
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:08,106
Healthy and good to stomach.

558
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:10,542
And coriander, the most important thing
to enhance the aroma.

559
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,911
And this hand-carved bok choy,

560
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,813
Italian eggplant

561
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,916
and "See you tomorrow".
[*Another name for enoki mushrooms]

562
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:21,419
What's wrong?

563
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,356
I forgot to tell you.

564
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:25,557
I happened to meet your senior

565
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,426
when I was shopping a few days ago,

566
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:32,464
and I listened to some
of his suggestions.

567
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,835
Or you feel uncomfortable

568
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:40,138
with these dishes?

569
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:41,339
It's okay.

570
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:42,474
I'll have it...

571
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:43,041
You really don't have to.

572
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:43,775
I'll have it...

573
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,443
I'm telling you...

574
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,244
I'll have it.

575
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:47,445
You really don't have to.

576
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:48,913
I really didn't spend
a long time chopping.

577
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:49,447
I really didn't

578
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,583
spend more than three hours
preparing the ingredients.

579
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,184
I made it all with my own hands,

580
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,786
and I made all these sauces myself.

581
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,055
It's really okay.
You don't have to eat it.

582
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,826
Shall I have dessert first?

583
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,161
Dessert?

584
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:05,632
I didn't make dessert.

Alex.

609
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:28,606
(Animals fear nothing
when they are little.)

(take it?)

618
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:02,974
We need to learn
how to reassure each other

619
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:04,542
and stay together.

620
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:05,143
