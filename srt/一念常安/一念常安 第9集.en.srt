1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Fu An.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,160
Is that you?

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,120
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,120
Here.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,840
Sit down.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
Sorry.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,960
You were out of control just now.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,760
I just touched you.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,160
I was out of control.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,760
Did I hurt you?

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
No.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,640
Xiaodie.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,400
Can you forgive Qing?

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,200
I heard

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,360
that night.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
I know

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,640
you hate Qing.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,800
But it has come to this.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
If you keep pestering each other,

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,400
it's just a waste of each other.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,280
He did hear my dream.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,240
But he misunderstood

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,200
I abandoned Fu Qing

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,280
because of Fu Qing.

25
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,320
Should I take the opportunity now?

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Your brother swore to me.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,600
And then he hooked up with Wang Xiaorui.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
How can I put up with this?

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,960
Xiaodie.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,479
I know you feel sad.

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,440
But how can you

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
you can't force yourself.

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,800
If you don't cut the knife,

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm sure you don't know it hurts.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,320
Bad news! Something happened to Master Wang!

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,960
Qing, does it hurt?

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,199
Let me blow on it for you.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
Why didn't you let me take my blood to save my father-in-law?

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
instead of killing my father-in-law?

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,280
You still hold a grudge against him,

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,560
right?

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,520
Even if I want you to bleed,

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,400
the one in your body won't agree.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Besides,

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Fu can stay at home

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,760
he can stay at home.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,360
It's a win-win situation.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,280
You haven't answered my question.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,560
But don't worry.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,040
He saved my father's life.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,760
We're even now.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
I won't bother him anymore.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,320
Really?

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,960
It's more real than real gold.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,040
Then,

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,360
If you need anything,

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
just tell me.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,000
I know.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,440
Don't keep anything to yourself.

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm not.

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,440
You...

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,480
I'll say it one last time.

63
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm not targeting anyone.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
Stop asking.

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
Understand?

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
Why didn't you pick a place to flirt?

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
Shameless.

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Why are you so arrogant?

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Mother.

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,280
Mother!

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Mother.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,320
Brother Qing saved my father this time.

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,360
We should thank him.

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,960
Mother.

75
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
Got it.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,560
[Mr. Fu, I'll be back soon.] Okay.

77
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
Mr. Fu.

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
Thanks for your help today.

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,680
If you need anything,

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
if you need anything.

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,160
I heard

82
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,480
you lack capital for business.

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,200
How about...

84
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
You're welcome.

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,200
Since my brother is the son-in-law of the Wang family,

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I have some connections.

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,760
It's nothing to save Master Wang.

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,920
No need to thank me.

89
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,320
Besides, he's the father of the dragonfly.

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
In that case,

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,519
let Uncle Sheng rest in the mansion.

92
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
and go back after he recovers.

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
What do you think?

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes.

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,800
Mother.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
Qing is injured.

97
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,240
It's not suitable for you to travel.

98
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Who are you to speak in this house?

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640
She seems

100
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,720
she can do something

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
unexpected things.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,800
It feels like

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
It's indeed unfair.

104
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
But for our big plan,

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,159
for our big plan.

106
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,320
Now that I've entered the mansion,

107
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
You and I will cooperate in the future.

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
it will be more convenient.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
I heard that

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
the seal might be hidden in Lady Liu's study.

111
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,280
That's right.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
But the study

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
seems loose,

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,960
but it's hard to get in.

115
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
I have a plan but I need your cooperation.

116
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,560
[I'll take the initiative and get hurt.]

117
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,920
In the dark,

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
kill Fu Qing

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,240
and go back to Mount Guo.

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,400
Why is Fuâ€™an here?

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,560
What happened?

122
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,000
This sinner is not so aggressive.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
when he's not so fierce.

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,680
It's not the time to fall in love.

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm leaving.

126
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,080
It's dark and windy.

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
What are you doing here?

128
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
I...

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
I'm blind. I can't see.

130
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
I took the wrong way.

131
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
Since you're here,

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,159
do something with me.

133
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
With...

134
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,960
How?

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,600
Fu'an lied

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,520
he didn't go back to the bridal room tonight.

137
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,760
but went to Fu Qing's room

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,120
to cover for him.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
Their relationship

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
are really weird.

141
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,640
You called me out in the middle of the night

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
to show me this?

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,680
What kind of special hobby is that?

144
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,120
I have something to do.

146
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,600
For example?

147
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
I want to go to that study.

148
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,840
When Fu'an was arrested by Uncle Li,

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,920
because he was close to the study.

150
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,200
What's the secret in this study

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,960
in this study?

152
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
Fire!

153
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Put out the fire!

154
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Help!

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Wait for me here.

156
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,800
I'll wait if you tell me to.

157
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,640
I won't.

158
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
Fu seems to be scheming.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,400
How could he really like

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
a loser like Little Dragonfly?

161
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,040
Then why did he approach Wang Xiaorui?

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,800
It's also related to the secret in the study.

163
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Did you do it?

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Village...

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,640
Male.
