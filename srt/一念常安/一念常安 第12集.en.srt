1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,880
What a coincidence. We meet again.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Didn't I tell you

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,720
to suck up your blood next time we meet?

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,960
We've met many times.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,160
My Lord.

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,160
You are already in such a state.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,400
Stop showing off, okay?

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,520
I saved you just now.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,120
You really don't know what's good for you.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,400
You want to kill Fu Qing?

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
not because of Wang Xiaodie.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
but because you thought

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,400
the holy fruit is with Fu Qing, right?

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Yes.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,800
No.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
I have the holy fruit.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,120
You have it?

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,760
As a sinner,

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
how can you bear the holy fruit in your body?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,680
Itâ€™s because Fuâ€™an

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,200
He is a kind person.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,960
It's his favorite fruit.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,000
If that's the case,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,440
I can't let anything happen to Fu An.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,560
We'll find a place

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,520
to recuperate first.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
Look at you.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,160
You used my body

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,000
and fight every day.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Donâ€™t worry.

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
Fu An will be fine.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,800
He's protected by the holy fruit.

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,479
My wound won't affect him.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,560
That's good.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,880
I know a place

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,080
for a while.

37
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,200
Take a good rest here.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll also think who can help us.

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
I can't count on Constable Xing.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,240
Now,

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,920
we only have this coat stained with medicine.

42
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,080
Otherwise, we'll be convicted.

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,880
Leichi from Guatian Village

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,840
is an old friend of the Fu family.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,320
He's the magistrate's uncle.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
Maybe he can help us

47
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,560
Something is wrong with this medicine.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
I knew it.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,640
In this medicine,

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,400
in this medicine,

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,520
there is also a special medicine.

52
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
Bloody Shadow.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,640
This kind of grass can be used separately.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
If it gets blood on it,

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,880
it will immediately produce poison and die.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
I see.

57
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,079
Why is Concubine Qiao so cruel?

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
What do you think?

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
People die for money.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Please help us.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,960
There is such a vicious woman in the world.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,120
Your father and I have known each other for years.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,520
I'll write a letter to the county magistrate

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
and ask him to investigate this matter thoroughly.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
How dare she come back?

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right. She killed Old Master.

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,440
This man has no conscience.

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Shameless.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,440
That's ridiculous.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,200
Wang Xiaodie.

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,920
Didn't you escape punishment?

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,440
How dare you come back now?

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
My father is dead.

74
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,840
As his daughter, I have to send him off.

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,680
Master was killed by your matrilocal husband.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
How dare you come back?

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,079
There are things

78
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,720
Are you sure

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Should I say it in front of others?

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,520
This is our family matter.

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
None of your business.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,079
Leave now!

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
Get down, all of you.

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
You too.

85
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,560
The juice remains.

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
and purchased Xuejian Cry.

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,320
I have all the evidence.

88
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,360
Do you still want to blame me?

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I've sent someone to invite Constable Xing.

90
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Just wait to be imprisoned

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
with your murderer's husband.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
Tomorrow,

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Fu An will bring the county magistrate to our mansion.

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
Please

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
don't use the same trick again.

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll pay you again.

97
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
After all, our county magistrate is an honest official.

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
I won't buy it.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,240
Wang Xiaodie

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,080
Your father hasn't been buried yet.

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,480
Do you have to make a scene

102
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
and lose face?

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Your daughter eloped with Lord Fu overnight.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't you feel ashamed then?

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,120
How dare you!

106
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,160
I know.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
you don't want to go to prison.

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,960
I understand.

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,520
You did this

110
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000
to help your husband get away.

111
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Master was ill for a long time.

112
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,080
He's been torturing him.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,760
Give him an end.

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,520
I'll take it as a filial piety.

115
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
Master.

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm sure

117
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,680
you wouldn't want to see

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,240
to have a family like this.

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
Let bygones

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
let bygones be bygones.

121
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,360
Constable Xing.

122
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I will tell him to withdraw the lawsuit.

123
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
There's a lot of work to do at the funeral.

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
You may leave.

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,520
We'll see.

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
I don't know what to do now.

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,080
If it doesn't work,

128
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,320
I'll ask Leejeong again.

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
No.

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,680
We're not related to her.

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,960
We can't always be like this.

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,840
or

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
into unnecessary disputes.

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,320
As expected from the soul chosen by the holy fruit.

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,760
You know how to push yourself.

136
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,920
How dare a murderer come back?

137
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
We have to be careful.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,760
Young Master is not easy to deal with.

139
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,920
He hasn't been buried yet.

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
Aren't you afraid he'll kill us?

141
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
How dare you!

142
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,680
How dare you talk about Master openly?

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360
How could she think of

144
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
to withdraw the lawsuit.

145
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
Is the lawsuit paper?

146
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,880
So casual.

147
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
Yes.

148
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,840
She's not the only one who can write the lawsuit.

149
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
Why are you here at this hour, Constable Xing?

150
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,200
What is this?

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
A lawsuit.

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
Since

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,640
has been withdrawn,

154
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,680
just throw it away.

155
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,240
Madam.

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
This lawsuit...

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
You're not a lawsuit.

158
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
Who are you?

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,200
Defendant.
