1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,040
Please.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,360
They're all dead.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,400
Mother.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,280
What happened?

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,160
Who died?

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,680
Go.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,920
Take Madam Sun with you.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,240
to the government office.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,320
Tell them Fu An is in the forest.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,000
in the forest.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
I wiped the blood on the knife

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,640
and let Madam Sun go.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,240
According to the steps,

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,320
there will be no more time

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,640
the people who searched the mountain came.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,240
why you went through so much trouble.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,040
I'll just kill them.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,319
Isn't it easier?

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,440
All you know is fighting and killing.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
What are you mumbling about?

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
Louder.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,400
I said

24
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,480
I didn't say anything.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,480
A good man doesn't take the risk.

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,920
You have no idea.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
There are rules in the mortal world.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
We must catch the murderer.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,200
The murderer will be executed.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,160
You have to find someone to take care of the government.

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,440
Fu An killed someone.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,920
Who?

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Why?

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
This is not something you should ask.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,039
Go back to your room and rest.

36
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,160
Don't go anywhere tonight, you hear me?

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,560
That's not right.

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,840
He's just a weak scholar.

39
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,200
How could he kill someone?

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
I told you to stop asking.

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Go back to your room.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,840
Okay.

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
How do you know?

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
I don't know the rules of the mortal world?

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,720
You know me?

46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,480
I saw you fight just now.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,920
is obviously not a mortal.

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,800
Besides, Fu An is my husband.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I know

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,280
what he looks like.

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,320
So...

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
he was taken away by you?

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,440
You're just a mortal woman.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,320
you know what it means to take away.

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,560
I read a lot of novels.

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
I know more or less

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,560
I know a little about it.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,320
What do you think?

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,200
Nothing.

60
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,120
But I met

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,840
I met a goddess.

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,280
She has the same face as you.

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,040
I hate her.

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,840
This is how people look.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,040
It's normal that I can't get into your eyes.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,200
Since the Goddess is disliked by the Immortal Venerable,

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,080
it must be her fault.

68
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
According to the storybook,

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,160
the fairies in the sky

70
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,280
are so troublesome.

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,320
If the Immortal Venerable hates her so much,

72
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
she must be a tough one.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,360
Do you really think so?

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,680
What could the Deity do wrong?

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,360
It must be that Goddess Guan.

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
My name is Chang Feng.

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,400
I originally came from the Divine Realm of Shangqing.

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,160
I accidentally shared my soul sense with Fu An.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,960
Who are you?

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Why are you in my consciousness

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
in my consciousness?

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
Don't be nervous.

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
I don't belong to the mortal world.

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,360
It's just that I have my own plan.

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
I accidentally entered your body

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,040
and share your soul sense with you.

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,640
I won't hurt you.

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,600
Maybe I can help you.

90
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Don't look at me like that.

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,720
Maybe I can do

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Maybe I can.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,880
In that case,

94
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,600
I have a request.

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,120
There is a seal

96
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,440
in the city.

97
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,000
It belongs to my father.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
Can you take it back?

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,720
Easy.

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,160
Unfortunately,

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,519
this guy is stupid and kind.

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
He keeps putting himself in danger.

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,880
I had to protect him.

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
In that case,

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,800
I did possess Fu'an.

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
Where is the holy fruit?

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,640
I have no power now.

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,600
How should I communicate with the Holy Fruit?

109
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Madam.

110
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,840
I told the police where it happened.

111
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,680
They have gone to arrest him.

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,520
Even if he is alive today,

113
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
I will let him

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
to prison.

115
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,159
Search carefully. They should be nearby.

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,120
The officers are here.

117
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,520
Follow the plan.

118
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
What do you mean?

119
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,640
My wound was caused by Madam Sun.

120
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,440
But you...

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
You look fine now.

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Looks like I have to give you some strong medicine.

123
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,720
Sorry, sir.

124
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,600
How can I be a public face?

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
I hit you lightly.

126
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
I'm here.

127
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
Help!

128
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,560
Over there!

129
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Here.

130
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
Let's go.

131
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,240
How is it?

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,520
Don't worry, Madam.

133
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,320
Miss Leng is only injured.

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,560
Just take a rest.

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,080
But Young Master,

136
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,360
His head is bleeding badly.

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
It's inevitable that he's weak.

138
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,200
He needs some time to recuperate.

139
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,520
How long will he wake up?

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
We haven't finished the interrogation statement yet.

141
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,240
I'm not sure.

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,400
All right, wait for me downstairs.

143
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,200
You don't believe my testimony?

144
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,920
We have witness and evidence.

145
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
The government has already concluded the case.

146
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
Madam Sun wanted to take revenge on me

147
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
and wanted to take revenge on me.

148
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,800
he took my wife and I into the mountain.

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,520
and wanted to kill someone with hysteria.

150
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,720
It's a matter of course.

151
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
It's important.

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
it's hard for you to defend the murderer.

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,520
I never said that I would defend the murderer.

154
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
My lady.

155
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,200
What are you talking about?

156
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Madam heard that you and Young Master were in danger.

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
she was so worried that she didnâ€™t eat all day.

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
She tried her best to find the truth.

159
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,840
Don't wrong a good person.

160
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,280
Whether Madam Sun is a good person or not,

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't you two feel clear?

162
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,840
You...

163
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,960
Xiaodie!

164
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,360
My dear.

165
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,840
How are you?

166
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,720
Iâ€™m fine. Are you okay?

167
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
Since Young Master is awake,

168
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Uncle Li.

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Go to the front hall

170
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
and invite Constable Xing over.

171
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Yes.

172
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Fu An.

173
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,560
The government

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
is not a joke.

175
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
Doctor, how is it?

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Go ahead.

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,120
Iâ€™ve checked

178
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Miss Leng and Young Master's wounds.

179
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
are correct.

180
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Her wounds

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
match Madam Sun's shoes.

182
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
What about Fu An?

183
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,080
Fu An was also hurt by Madam Sun.

184
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
A knife wound

185
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,000
and external trauma.

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
caused by external shock

187
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
are matched with the case files of the government office.

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
Thank you, doctor.

189
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,560
Please go back.

190
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000
Please don't tell anyone

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,280
about what happened today.

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,240
Of course.

193
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
Young Lady said that...

194
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,320
Although Madam Sun killed her,

195
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,680
it was caused by

196
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
because of her personal grudge.

197
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
So I asked for punishment.

198
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,880
Old man.

199
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,280
I know you're listening.

200
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Don't try to observe me in secret.

201
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,440
I want to see you now.

202
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,960
It seems

203
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,800
you want me to spread

204
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
all over the city?

205
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Come out now!

206
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
Immortals will be punished

207
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,240
will be punished.

208
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,679
Get to the point.

209
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,679
Hurry up.

210
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Here's the thing.

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,600
That day,

212
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
I felt the aura of the holy fruit.

213
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
It should be nearby.

214
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,280
And it should be

215
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,000
Wang Xiaodie's cheap husband.

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
But since I have no power now,

217
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm not sure if he really has the Holy Fruit.

218
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
So you have to help me.

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,560
You're still so eloquent.

220
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,000
This is difficult.

221
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
What font do you want to write in the dialogue novel?

222
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
I have an idea.

223
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
I knew you would.

224
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Here.

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,600
Give me your hand.

226
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,480
Still fighting

227
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
Give me your hand.

228
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,920
What's this? It's hot.

229
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,000
Remember this pain.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,320
If someone who touched the holy fruit appears,

231
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,240
he has contact with you,

232
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,360
it will remind you with heat.

233
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,640
If I touch Fu'an,

234
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
I'll know

235
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,200
is in his body.

236
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,360
Fu Qing.

237
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Nan.

238
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
Male.
