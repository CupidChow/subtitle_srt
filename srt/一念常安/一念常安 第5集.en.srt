1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm here. I'm here.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,240
Wang Xiaodie, what are you doing?

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,480
What's going on?

4
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Fu Qing or Fu An?

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,040
Who has the holy fruit?

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,080
Are you two fooling me?

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,600
Miss Rong.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
Why were you so reckless just now?

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,400
If I hadn't caught your sister in time,

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,440
she would have been beaten to death.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,240
She asked for it.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
She deserves it.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,480
She's married, yet she doesn't behave like a woman.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,400
She even tried to seduce Qing.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,960
What's wrong?

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
Hey!

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Don't look at him like that.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Don't look at him.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,000
You two.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Don't look at him.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,360
Don't look.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,520
Are you crazy?

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
First,

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,800
The tree in the backyard looks like this.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,880
Second,

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,000
A unmarried girl

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
You talk about men every day.

28
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,200
Who is worse?

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,120
Third,

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,240
Have you had dinner?

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,400
Have you greeted Father?

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,240
Not yet.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
No. Go now.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,120
Your mother spoils you.

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,440
I can't spoil her.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,479
Don't be rude.

37
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll knock your teeth off.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Go.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,600
I can't deal with you.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,760
Here.

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Qing.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,479
Why did you bring me here?

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,280
They're about to fight.

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Brother.

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
Do you have any clues about the seal?

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Lady Liu has the whole mansion.

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,360
She might have it.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
I've tried it before.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,280
to visit the study at night.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,320
But the mansion seems to be loose,

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
but it's quite tight.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,520
I pretended to run away

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,040
to cover it up.

54
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,240
Lady Liu is suspicious.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
She won't be so easily deceived.

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
What happened to Madam Sun

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,880
was her doing.

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,040
What happened in the mountain that day?

59
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,480
Did she really kill people wildly?

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,240
Before I was in a coma,

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,520
I did see Madam Sun commit the crime.

62
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,640
But

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,000
I feel something is wrong.

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Wang Xiaodie's reaction was too unusual.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
You said

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
Wang Xiaodie is a coward.

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
and indecisive.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
But you saw it just now.

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
she was more fierce

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
she's more fierce than the other person.

71
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,200
It doesn't look like he's weak.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
He does look different.

73
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
According to my observation these days,

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,960
Wang Xiaodie

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
is not doing well in this mansion.

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
Brother.

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,440
is soft-hearted to the people in the mansion.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,720
Have you forgotten our hatred?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
Five years ago,

80
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,880
Guatian Village's melon fruit

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,320
suddenly had a productivity problem.

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,200
This time,

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
there are not many fruits that fit the delivery requirements,

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,079
we can count them together

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
we can count.

86
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
But this place is far from the capital.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,079
Without a fast horse,

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,840
this is the good result.

89
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
It's rotten when we get there.

90
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah.

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,520
Everyone lost their money on the seedlings.

92
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
How can we afford to hire Officer Ma?

93
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240
I have an idea.

94
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,840
It's known as the sun and the moon.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
It's the withdrawal token of the No.1 silver in the capital.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,200
and my heirloom.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Father thought

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
we can use the seal as mortgage.

99
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
and ask the Wang family to deliver the goods.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
and redeem the seal after the payment is returned.

101
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
It’s a perfect deal.

102
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
You didn't know that if you trust me,

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,640
if you trust me.

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Wang,

105
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,160
How can you be so shameless?

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
for my goods with rotten fruits?

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
and set me up.

108
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,000
and let me down.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,440
You carried the fruit into the carriage yourself.

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm only responsible for sending them to the capital.

111
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
Give it to Master.

112
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,840
The owner doesn’t like your goods.

113
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,200
You are blatant.

114
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
and slandered people.

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll report you to the police.

116
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
Okay.

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
As for the fruit,

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
about the fruit.

119
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,640
Give me the seal.

120
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,040
No.

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,520
You haven't given me a penny.

122
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,920
Of course it belongs to me.

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
You...

124
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,800
Master Wang thought he could get the money

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
he could get the money

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
in the bank.

127
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,680
But I never thought

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,240
The reason why this is called the sun and the moon,

129
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,760
is to get two stamps together

130
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,760
to work.

131
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
I have no other wish

132
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,360
for the rest of my life.

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
If I can get the seal,

134
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
and lead the villagers to make a comeback,

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
I can do anything.

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
As for Master Wang,

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,400
he has done many evil things.

138
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
He will be punished.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,280
Brother, are you stupid?

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
It's all because of Wang.

141
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
because of Wang.

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Their depression

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,120
has something to do with them.

144
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,400
How can we let them go?

145
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
Qing.

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,640
If your parents were in heaven,

147
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,440
they wouldn't want to see you do this.

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,240
Anyway,

149
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,480
Take the seal. I'll take it.

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,600
we must

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
must be avenged.

152
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,960
In the Shijian Mirror,

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,840
in the Shijian Mirror.

154
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,360
Master Wang is still tough.

155
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
Why did he become

156
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,320
in a blink of an eye?

157
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Young Lady Yu Zhu just left,

158
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
and you came with her.

159
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Without my greed,

160
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Lady Ruoxi isn't here yet.

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,640
I'd like to say this.

162
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,040
if you want to stay here,

163
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
we should keep a low profile.

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
I'll tell Wang Xiaorui.

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
What's going on?

167
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,480
What are you waiting for?

168
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Go get a doctor.

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,160
No.

170
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,080
I can't let him die.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,360
Otherwise, I won't be able to clear my name.

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,880
I'll do my best.

173
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,920
I don't know

174
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
if anyone's blood is useful.

175
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
