1
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,200
You're not allowed to do this. You're not allowed to do this. You're not allowed to do this. You're not allowed to do this. You're not allowed to do this.

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Since you are married into the family,

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,040
you are my man.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,400
My rules are rules.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,480
I will never be wrong.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
The holy fruit was sensing me just now.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,920
But why is it gone in a blink of an eye?

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,960
What are you doing?

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,400
To warm us up.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,360
What's wrong?

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,880
How dare you

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,560
in broad daylight.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,920
I must report it to Her Ladyship.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,280
Go.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,240
Your mouth

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
in your mouth anyway.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,120
You...

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,000
Go.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Ask Young Master to come.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,680
Yes.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,760
No.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
If the Holy Fruit is really with Fu'an,

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
he must be fine.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,320
We are husband and wife.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,000
How can I not protect you?

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,760
Madam Sun.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,120
No matter where Fu'an goes today,

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,520
I have to protect him.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
Otherwise, you can't take him away.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
You two really love each other.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,360
I'm so touched.

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Then take him with you.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,759
Madam.

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,759
How is it?

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,680
Madam Sun has brought her up the mountain.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,080
I heard that Miss Leng

37
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,960
has been bewitched.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,880
She insisted on protecting the bridegroom.

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,520
Madam Sun took her with her.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
she found out the groom was a fake last night.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,039
she wanted to kill her.

43
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,080
Why are you protecting her now?

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,880
But Madam Sun sent someone to deliver a message.

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
to ask you

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,360
what to do now.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,200
I just wanted to torture Fu An.

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
Why did you break into the secret room?

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,520
Since they are so eager,

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,960
let them be.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm not interested

52
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not interested.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Madam Sun.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
No matter how poor I am,

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm the eldest daughter of the Wang family.

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,120
How dare you!

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,480
Untie me now!

58
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,160
My lady.

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,560
Do you still not know

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
why you are tied here?

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,800
To be honest,

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
the one beside you

63
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
is not a good person.

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,200
Last night,

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,720
sneaked into the secret room of Her Ladyship's study

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,960
and was caught by the night patrol servants.

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,320
Madam asked me to bring him out

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,520
to interrogate him.

69
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
I just had no choice.

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,200
and ran to the wrong place.

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Stop provoking me.

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
Believe it or not doesn't matter.

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
Both of you

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
will die today.

75
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,320
You...

76
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,080
Dragonfly.

77
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
You're naughty again.

78
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,880
You can guess it every time.

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,560
Boring.

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
You asked me out today

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
to show me something new?

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,320
How is my brother?

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,120
You came all the way here

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,640
to see me.

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,280
but for your brother.

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
To put it bluntly,

87
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,720
it's because of that bitch Wang Xiaodie.

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
How could you frame me?

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
Since I decided to be with you,

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,320
I've been obedient to you.

91
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,880
Even if it's a trap to taint her innocence.

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,520
Go on.

93
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,480
I forced her to compromise and get married.

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,120
I did everything you said.

95
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
I didn't expect you to suspect me.

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,760
My brother and I are family.

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
I must care about his safety.

98
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,079
As for you,

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
when did you

100
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
about our relationship?

101
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Qing,

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
Don't be angry.

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm sorry. I'll say it today.

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,040
Well,

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,560
Have an orange.

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,880
I'll peel an orange for you.

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,920
How is it? Is it sweet?

108
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,680
I'll try one too.

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,720
So sour.

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,760
The skin is glowing.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
No flawless soft spots.

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
The color is orange red and ripe.

113
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,280
Logically speaking,

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,920
the quality of the tangerine

115
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
should be top quality.

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
Unfortunately,

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
after the natural disaster five years ago,

118
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,159
the melon fruit in this town

119
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,080
are not harvest.

120
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
You know this?

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,400
I used to do melon fruit business for a few years.

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
What a coincidence.

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,400
I remember my father

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,920
did this before.

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
If it's not fate, then what is it?

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
Qing.

127
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,520
Indeed.

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
But you haven't told me

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
how my brother

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,640
How is he recently?

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,360
Stop!

132
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,680
All right.

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Xiaodie!

134
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Xiaodie!

135
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,080
Wang Xiaodie.

136
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,720
Since you got engaged,

137
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
you've been unhappy with me all day.

138
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I used to just cry.

139
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
But now,

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,920
You have a man and a backer, right?

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,680
You're so arrogant.

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
I want to see

143
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
how noble you are.

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Take off her clothes!

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,720
Stop!

146
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Let go!

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,000
Stop!

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,920
Let go!

149
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,680
Don't touch her!

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,440
Let go of me!

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't hurt her!

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Shut up!

153
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Let go!

154
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Idiot!

155
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,880
If you want to fight, do it!

156
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
What's the use of begging for mercy?

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
What are you waiting for?

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
Did the sinner take her away?

159
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,520
Don't kill her.

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
Count the time.

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,520
Wang Xiaodie and Fu'an have been abandoned in the wilderness.

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
Mother.

163
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,680
I have a favor to ask you.

164
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
What is it?

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,120
I've fallen in love with a husband.

166
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,200
Can I marry him?

167
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,560
When did you have a lover?

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
What's his name?

169
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,720
Where does he live?

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Is he good to you?

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,360
It's Fu Qing, the second son of the Fu family.

172
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,200
Ridiculous. You must be crazy.

173
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,280
Mother, I really like Qing.

174
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
What happened between Fu Qing and Wang Xiaodie

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,280
are just rumors.

176
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,680
It doesn't count at all.

177
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
And he doesn't like that bitch at all.

178
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Otherwise,

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,080
he wouldn't let Fu An Dai marry him, right?

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,200
Mother, we love each other.

181
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Please help me.

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
If Lord Fu knows

183
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,760
I sent someone to kill his brother,

184
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,360
Then how could he be with a dragonfly?

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
Please.

186
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,560
They're all dead.

187
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,760
Male.
