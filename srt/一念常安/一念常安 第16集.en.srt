1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,440
Are you curious

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,400
what the Wang family has

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,040
worth the effort

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,000
You went through so much trouble.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,800
Master Wang is not a good person.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,760
You know that.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,760
Master said

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,920
he had done too many evil things.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
That's why he got the result.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,080
Guatian Village and the Fu family

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,760
are part of his debts.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,400
He took away

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,080
he took away a seal

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,040
of the Fu family.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,040
And this seal is very valuable.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,720
It's enough to make the whole village

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,160
to be rich again.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,520
Fu An wanted me

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
to help him get the seal back

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
and help the villagers overcome the difficulties.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I always thought

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I always thought Fu An was a fool.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,400
Because of the kindness of the villagers,

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
Fuâ€™anâ€™s persistence became more meaningful.

25
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,400
Fu Anyan is an ordinary person.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,720
Although he is limited,

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
he can take care of everyone.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
This is

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,560
that I can't do as a deity.

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
What's so good about being a deity?

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,320
You're full of hypocrisy and morality.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,320
All beings in the world.

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,480
Why did you become a sinner?

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
I was a deity from Wuchen Peak.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Wuchen Peak

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,800
is the most powerful place in the Qing Dynasty.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,560
So the rules are strict.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
All deities need to be garrisoned forever and can't leave the mountain.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,240
Did you become a sinner because you escaped?

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,720
Have you ever regretted it?

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Regret?

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,600
Speaking of regret,

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,880
I regret not leaving early.

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,680
I never wanted to do anything.

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,920
the strongest God of War.

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,840
I just want to be a ray of free wind.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,920
It feels so good.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,039
Little Deity.

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,120
I think you have great magic.

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
you must have a bright future.

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
But why

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,960
always look unhappy?

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Because I don't want to be the strongest God of War.

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,120
I just want to be a ray of free wind.

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,640
It's you.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,760
You finally recognize me.

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
How about we

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
do something meaningful tonight?

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
Xiaodie

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,240
This is the vegetable I just collected in the morning.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,840
Take some to make noodles

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Thank you, auntie.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
You're welcome.

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
Where is Fu An?

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,120
You have no idea.

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,640
we were too late last night.

67
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,560
He's still here.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
sleeping.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,560
You're young.

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
I know.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
No, auntie.

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
We didn't.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,920
Don't work too hard.

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,480
By the way, I have

75
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,880
I have something good.

76
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,760
Stew it.

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Not my aunt.

78
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Actually, it's not what you think.

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,079
Here.

80
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,840
Just take it.

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
No need.

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,079
Just take it.

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,120
Don't be sorry to your aunt.

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,640
We're family.

85
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Take it.

86
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm leaving

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,320
Auntie I don't know how to do this

88
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
I'll keep it then.

89
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Xiaodie.

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,920
Did you write all these?

91
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,520
The analysis is really good.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,680
Why are you so familiar with

93
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,040
the growing characteristics of melon fruit?

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
What are you going to write?

95
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,040
The production of Urida Village is not low every year.

96
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
But the quality is bad.

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,120
If this goes on,

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
it caused the fruit people's income.

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,959
You are the God of Guo Shen Mountain.

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
You must be familiar with the growing characteristics of melon fruit.

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
Why don't we analyze them one by one?

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
and find the root

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,800
and find another way.

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,120
A way to rest in peace.

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,440
is here.

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
Return the holy fruit.

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
everything will be solved.

108
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,680
If you're willing,

109
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
you can try.

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Let's get down to business.

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
The fruit in Guatian Village

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
are tangerines and hawthorns.

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,600
Now our biggest problem

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,400
is to improve the taste of these two fruits.

115
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,240
As the saying goes,

116
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,120
what people eat

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,200
are transformed by qi.

118
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,960
So the air is back to its ears.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,760
So air quality is very important

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
And tangerines

121
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,720
It's a kind of gloomy plant.

122
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
These are written in common breeze.

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Chang Feng.

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,640
He's really willing to help us.

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
Xiaodie.

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Thank you.

127
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,440
This is Ms. Song

128
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,360
to replenish your health.

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,640
Drink it while it's hot.

130
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
After that,

131
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,000
let's check out the melon fruit.

132
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,800
The hawthorns are all rotten.

133
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
The harvest of this year is gone.

134
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,400
What should I do with this fruit?

135
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,640
Brother, what's wrong?

136
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,600
The fruit we collected tastes bad.

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
I can't sell them.

138
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
It takes up space at home.

139
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
Get ready

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Drag it to the mountain and throw it away.

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Lost?

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
You can't do that.

143
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
This is your hard work for a whole year.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
What can we do?

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,320
It's in the warehouse.

146
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,200
I can only watch it rot.

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,120
This is too sour.

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
The taste is sour.

149
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,520
It's really not suitable for food

150
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,720
The fruits here are all like this.

151
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,760
I won't lose them. What can I do?

152
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,840
Are there villagers who grow sugarcane in the village?

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,760
Yes.

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
What about sweetness?

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
There are sweetness

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
But compared to the previous harvest season,

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,360
the taste is a little dull.

158
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,720
I have an idea.

159
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
What are you two doing?

160
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm making delicious food

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
The fruit is very sour

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,400
It doesn't taste good at all.

163
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll make it delicious.

164
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
Male.
