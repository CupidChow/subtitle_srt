[Reblooming Blue]

00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,978
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
Why are you thinking so much about it?

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,199
These shares were originally our master's.

5
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,200
They should be yours.

6
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,199
Outsiders can't manage your family's affairs.

7
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,216
But outsiders are watching.

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,799
How she treats you determines
what kind of person she is.

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
If she can't think clearly at her age,

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,459
she's not your third aunt-in-law anymore.

11
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,719
Just stay grounded.

12
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,656
Hello, Mr. Fan.

13
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,879
Xiaoman is back. I forgot it.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
Okay, I'll be right there.

15
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,460
No need to pick me up.

16
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,656
I'll bike over.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
Well, the Porcelain Town.

18
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,819
Launching the signing ceremony.

19
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,260
The Porcelain Association is calling us all
to go support the event.

20
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,280
I'll just go there briefly
and then come back to you.

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,380
It's okay, go ahead with your business.

22
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,920
I can wander around
by myself without getting lost.

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,800
Alright, I'll call you later.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,496
Yujian,

25
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,080
about the Porcelain Town you mentioned,
is it Jingheng's?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,439
Yes, it's Jingheng's.

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
It was suspended for a while
because there was no money.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,660
They said it restarted a while ago.

29
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,120
Regarding this ceremony, it has been changed
several times back and forth.

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,719
Yes, it has been changed
back and forth several times.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,280
This project was the one
that my previous leader

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,519
led us to work on.

33
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,919
In the end, it got stolen by someone.

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,479
The person who betrayed your boss?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,240
Can you take me there?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,719
Why, to seek revenge?

37
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,496
No.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,340
After all, I put effort into this project.

39
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,368
I just want to take a look.

40
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,880
I once thought about returning home in glory.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,919
But I'm just going there
to boost the popularity.

42
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,619
I'm just afraid you'll become sentimental
when you get there.

43
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,159
And it'll ruin your mood.

44
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,920
It won't.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,639
I have quite a high adversity quotient.

46
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:20,576
Alright then.

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,760
If you want to seek revenge,

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,500
I'll help you drag down that bad guy

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,960
and then rip him to shreds.

50
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:27,776
Let's go.

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,039
Yuyao is a world-renowned capital of ceramics.

52
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,360
Its porcelain-making craftsmanship
is exquisite.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,639
The porcelain is exquisitely unparalleled.

54
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,140
Incorporating calligraphy, painting,

55
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,419
sculpture, and poetry,

56
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,800
it is a treasure
of our country's traditional culture.

57
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,240
Today,

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,959
Yuyao adheres
to the concept of innovative development.

59
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
The Porcelain Town project will promote
the refinement of ceramics

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,479
and personalized development.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,539
Let this thousand-year porcelain capital

62
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,380
radiate new vitality and energy

63
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,800
through heritage and innovation.

64
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,280
Well, who is your boss?

65
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,480
It's that one next to my uncle.

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,840
The one in the green suit.

67
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,720
Together we unveil the completion
of Phase One of Porcelain Town

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,480
and the exciting opening
of the signing ceremony.

69
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,180
On behalf of Juhe Investments,

70
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,460
I warmly welcome the presence

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,639
of all the guests.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,060
The one showing longstanding care and support

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,460
for the Porcelain Town project,
the director of Cultural and Tourism Bureau,

74
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,680
Mr. Cheng Li.

75
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,080
Yaosheng Investments,

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,319
Mr. Yan Su.

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,919
Jingheng Investments,

78
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,160
Mr. Liu Shuo.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,139
Qingteng Commerce & Trade,

80
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,519
Mr. Zhao Zhihong.

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
I express heartfelt thanks to them.

82
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,500
Next, we proceed
to the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
Please, esteemed guests, proceed
with the cutting of the ribbon.

84
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,139
That's very good.

85
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,339
In the future, for our Porcelain Town,

86
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,960
I ask for your continued care and attention.

87
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,000
Exactly.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,540
Mr. Cheng, I have arranged
the dinner for tonight.

89
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,640
How about we have a meal together?

90
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,880
We have regulations.

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,800
As for the details, let's discuss them
in the meeting room tomorrow.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,860
Alright!

93
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,040
- Okay.
- Have a good gathering.

94
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,399
- Mr. Cheng.
- It's okay.

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,240
There will be plenty of opportunities
in the future.

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,479
Mr. Ke, join us tonight, will you?

97
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,639
Of course, that's a must.

98
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,000
Ke Yan,

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,320
you did promise me.

100
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,040
If I need you for this matter,

101
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
you must accompany me to the end.

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
No problem.

103
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,072
Okay, let's not go home
until we're drunk, alright?

104
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,139
Not going home until we're drunk.

105
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,759
No problem, but it seems our car…

106
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,160
- Can't fit so many people, right?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
Well…

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,352
It's okay.

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,319
You guys go ahead. Send me the address
and I'll be there soon.

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,660
- I'll leave it to you.
- Okay.

111
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,040
Come on, Mr. Liu, let's get going.

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
You must come later.

113
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
No problem, hurry, let's go.

114
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,600
Boss.

115
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,360
What a coincidence.

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,839
Didn't expect to run into you here.

117
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:30,759
I didn't expect

118
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,879
why I could be here.

119
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,184
I still have an event to attend.

120
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll go get busy, we can talk later.

121
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,168
Bye-bye.

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Come on in, please.

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
Give me the helmet.

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,136
The light.

125
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,880
What are you thinking?

126
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:33,760
Nothing much.

127
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:37,739
Master Zhou,

128
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:40,840
you have many craftsmen
collaborating with you now.

129
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,959
Everyone holds me in high regard.

130
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,080
They put their things here for me to sell.

131
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,224
They look good.

132
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
Various styles.

133
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,220
When we were studying,

134
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,240
we made it together.

135
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Our master said you were slacking off.

136
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,100
It's very popular.

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,360
Many people asked to buy it,
but I didn't sell it.

138
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,599
I put it at the highest place,

139
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,879
making them green with envy.

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,799
You might as well just quote a high price.

141
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,399
You just didn't stick with it.

142
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,039
Our master said you had more talent than me.

143
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,700
If it weren't for our master's
early passing away,

144
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,279
you wouldn't be like this now,

145
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,759
drifting alone out there.

146
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,559
Have you thought about coming back?

147
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,260
Your third uncle has been nagging me about it.

148
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,720
He wants you to come back and develop.

149
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,519
Even if not in Yuyao, somewhere
closer to home would be good.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,080
That way, someone could take care of you
if something happens.

151
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,360
We'll talk about it later.

152
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,919
Still thinking about that ex-boss of yours?

153
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,496
No.

154
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,512
I'm just

155
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:22,752
tired.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Then take this opportunity to come back.

157
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,799
Nowhere is better than being at home.

158
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,960
Just come back.

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,660
I'll handle the clay by then.

160
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,000
And you'll be in charge of selling cups.

161
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,340
Why push yourself when it's so tough out there?

162
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,344
Right?

163
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,160
Me coming back is such a happy event.

164
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,280
Let's go have a drink.

165
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,440
Are you craving a drink right now?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,559
How could that be? No way.

167
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,500
Actually, when I was in Beijing,

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,899
I often spent evenings with my besties,

169
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,320
having a little drink and chatting.

170
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,300
I got it.

171
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,120
Big cities have big pressures, right?

172
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
A petty bourgeois lifestyle.

173
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,599
Let's go.

174
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,759
Let's take a cab.

175
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
He is drunk, right?

176
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
Look at him, he didn't drink a little.

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,879
Are you okay?

178
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,008
You'll feel better after throwing up.

179
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:29,088
Feeling a bit better?

180
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,880
You go back.

181
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,200
Shouldn't I go back by myself?

182
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,320
It's such an important occasion.

183
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,039
After you're done throwing up, come in with me.

184
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,080
- You go back, I'm fine.
- Come on.

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,919
Give me some face, come on.

186
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm fine.

187
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,519
- Come inside with me.
- Alright.

188
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,820
Once you're feeling better, come straight in.

189
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,799
I'll order some good food and drinks for you.

190
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
So many people here.

191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,740
Will you come in with me?

192
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,860
- You go in.
- Today is so important.

193
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,879
Let's go.

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,680
What are you doing?

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,759
Boss, are you alright?

196
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,019
Can't you see he's already drunk?

197
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,200
I didn't make him drink.
He wanted to drink himself.

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
Come on, come in with me.

199
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,759
He's already drunk. Why let him drink more?

200
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,879
Chen Xiaoman, this is business socializing.
Do you understand?

201
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,952
Let's go.

202
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:11,000
Boss, tell us,

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,320
do you want to go home or stay here and drink?

204
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:14,440
Go home.

205
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Did you hear that? He wants to go home.

206
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
Go away.

207
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,159
Let's go, I'll take you back.

208
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,679
Slow down, stand firm, let's go.

209
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,700
Slow down.

210
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,040
Okay, stop.

211
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,088
Taxi.

212
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,720
How could this be?

213
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,000
How come you're here?

214
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,679
Boss, you're awake.

215
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,879
Have a drink of water.

216
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,360
How come you are here?

217
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,200
I, well…

218
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,220
I was on the way.

219
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,440
I saw you with Liu Shang.

220
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,288
Understood.

221
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,288
You sit.

222
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,400
Sit down.

223
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
I saw you that day.

224
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,200
I didn't talk to you much, sorry about that.

225
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
It's okay, I understand.

226
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,960
Well, Boss,

227
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,300
after you left,

228
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,679
I also resigned from Juhe.

229
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,399
I owe you a job.

230
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,120
Don't say that.

231
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,600
You took such good care of me before.

232
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,368
So, what do you plan to do next?

233
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:51,424
I'm leaving tomorrow.

234
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,519
Leaving tomorrow?

235
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,480
I wish you a safe journey.

236
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,679
If there's nothing else, I'll be going back.

237
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,759
Please message me when you get home.

238
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
It's so late already.

239
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,960
Okay, don't worry.

240
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,799
This is my hometown, my turf.

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,759
Take care of yourself and drink more water.

242
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,096
Okay.

243
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:26,528
Goodbye.

244
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,256
Bye-bye.

Boss, I've arrived home.

250
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,984
Good night.

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
I'm no longer your boss.

252
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,279
You don't have to address me like that anymore.

253
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,519
Then I'll call you "Leader" from now on.

254
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,480
Leader,

255
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,919
when you left Yaosheng,

256
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,360
there were some things
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

258
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,420

for letting me join the project department.

260
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,960
I really learned a lot,

261
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:07,720
not just in terms of business.

262
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,039
I still remember the words you said

263
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,759
to us on the first day vividly.

264
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400

Sir, the drink you ordered.

272
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,128
Thank you.

273
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,219
I really didn't expect

274
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,960
that you would come to ask me for help one day.

275
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,079
It's your own decision whether to come or not.

276
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,856
I'm not begging you.

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,279
About your recent matters,

278
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:24,576
I've heard about them.

279
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,860
I'm very curious.

280
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,759
How will you retaliate?

281
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,759
I will take back Juhe.

282
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:37,179
When necessary, even Yaosheng
is not an exception.

283
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,039
It's not necessary to get up

284
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,759
exactly where you have fallen.

285
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,119
I've spoken to our boss about you.

286
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,400
If you agree to join Nanmian Investments,

287
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,960
you can have the same position as me.

288
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,616
The Vice President.

289
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,900
As for the annual salary and stock options,

290
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,000
you can negotiate about them yourselves.

291
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,392
Must do it?

292
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,279
Must do it.

293
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
I have a question that I'm very curious about.

294
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,400
We've been college classmates
for so many years.

295
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,920
You've always wanted
to join Nanmian Investments.

296
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:26,580
During the internship,

297
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,960
we were there together.

298
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,460
We received the acceptance letters,

299
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,979
but you switched to Yaosheng.

300
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,024
Why?

301
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,839
I'd rather lose to you

302
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
than tie with you.

303
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,839
Give me a hug. Why are you just sitting there?

304
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,100
I've missed you so much.

305
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,759
We haven't seen each other
for such a long time.

306
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,980
I tell you, I said this to our classmates,

307
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,400
but they didn't believe it.

308
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,580
It still has to be me who understands you.

309
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,119
It still has to be me.

310
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,128
Alright.

311
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,559
But let's get to the bottom of this.

312
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,199
You're asking me to cooperate with you.

313
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,599
It's fine.

314
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,660
Within three days,

315
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,919
bring a feasible proposal.

316
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,200
I remember you were
in the badminton team in college, right?

317
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,976
But I haven't played for many years
since I graduated. Look at my belly.

318
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,620
- Enough.
- Enough?

319
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,696
I'm off.

320
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,020
Where are you going?

321
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,096
To sleep.

322
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:25,216
Getting up early to play badminton tomorrow.

323
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,848
Ke Yan.

324
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,080
Ke Yan.

325
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,104
What do you mean by this?

326
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,319
As soon as I come,
you bring me to play badminton.

327
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,200
You don't take me out to eat and drink.

328
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:46,840
Let me tell you,

329
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,640
I haven't eaten anything.

330
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,740
Playing badminton on an empty stomach
can easily lead to hypoglycemia.

331
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,319
If I faint, you'll have to take me
to the hospital.

332
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,984
What's up?

333
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,980
Are you getting your badminton itch
after being away for so long?

334
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,640
You want to have a match with me, right?

335
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,672
No problem.

336
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,480
Hello, are there any spots left?

337
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,939
Not at the moment.

338
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,319
Our courts are fully booked for today.

339
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,640
See, you didn't make a reservation?

340
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:11,960
Are there any cancellations?

341
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,000
- Not yet.
- None yet?

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,680
How long are all these people going to play?

343
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
That's hard to say.

344
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,408
What should we do then?

345
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:22,480
Let's change the place then.

346
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,488
Mr. Ke.

347
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:25,184
Mr. Ke, it is really you!

348
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,260
Mr. Cheng.

349
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,380
What a coincidence!

350
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,740
Such a coincidence, indeed!

351
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,039
You guys enjoy playing badminton, too?

352
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,140
I usually play.

353
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,340
We've been eating and drinking
around here these days.

354
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,839
Got to exercise and sweat some, right?

355
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,780
Coming at this hour,
you're bound to find no space.

356
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,840
Yeah.

357
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,439
How about we play a doubles game?

358
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:45,200
No, we can't beat you, Mr. Cheng.

359
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,279
You only know if someone's a pro
when they start playing.

360
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,359
I won't go easy, mind you.

361
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,980
Mr. Zhang, let's play a doubles match.

362
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,024
Alrighty.

363
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,000
Show no mercy.

364
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,800
Okay, certainly.

365
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,104
Who is this person?

366
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,700
This is the director
of the Cultural and Tourism Bureau.

367
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,759
Mr. Cheng.

368
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,000
You really haven't changed at all.

369
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:14,976
Come on.

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
How do we play?

371
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,020
Making friends.

372
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,192
Understood.

373
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,744
Come on.

374
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,776
Out of bounds.

375
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,888
Ours.

376
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Mr. Cheng,

377
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,580
aren't you two just too amazing?

378
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,000
That's hardly an amateur hobby.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,659
You are simply at a professional level.

380
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,540
You guys continue. I'll take a break.

381
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,656
Alright.

382
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
Come on, Mr. Cheng, have some water.

383
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,599
Come on, let's continue.

384
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,500
Your friend

385
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,799
plays badminton quite well.

386
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,240
I can see you

387
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
came prepared.

388
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,039
Sweat has been shed,
and the badminton has been played.

389
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,039
Come on then, what do you need from me?

390
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,880
I would like to talk to you

391
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,559
about the plan for phase two
of the Porcelain Town.

392
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,416
Phase two?

393
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,559
This phase has just started construction.

394
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,160
It already includes
cultural and tourism projects.

395
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,920
So, tell me about this phase two.

396
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,400
What can it bring to Yuyao?

397
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
The phase two project

398
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,599
is larger in scale

399
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,659
and more mature.

400
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,160
And it will have more merchants settling in.

401
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,160
This sounds not much different from phase one.

402
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,456
Let me put it this way.

403
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,780
From the perspective of the town's

404
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,700
long-term development,

405
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,720
the government

406
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,240
indeed hopes for more people to develop Yuyao

407
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,740
to serve as a function of cultural output.

408
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,380
But if you and Jingheng

409
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,240
are doing the same thing.

410
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
We may not be able to support it.

411
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,920
We cannot allow capital to compete
within Yuyao market.

412
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:23,720
It would be damaging

413
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,200
this industry and harming the people within it.

414
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,880
Then it would be the government's negligence.

415
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,400
Our current work direction is

416
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,300
to guide you investors

417
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,880
to places that are not as mature

418
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
and where support is needed.

419
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,248
Understood.

420
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,040
Think about it,

421
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,320
today's youth can buy a train ticket
for a few hundred yuan

422
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
and come to Yuyao to develop.

423
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,519
If the barriers are high

424
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,359
and they can't cross them,

425
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,759
what should they do?

426
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,039
I'll ponder your words when I go back.

427
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,959
Previously, there was also a person

428
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,900
who wanted to establish
a leading enterprise in Yuyao.

429
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,079
Mr. Ma, you can have a chat with him.

430
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,200
Mr. Ma, Ma Muzhi.

431
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,319
He should be considered

432
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,319
as a legendary figure in this industry, right?

433
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,328
Yes.

434
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,880
These ten years,

435
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,280
he has supported many funding projects
in Yuyao.

436
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
There must be hundreds of them.

437
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,699
Almost

438
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,320
none are for profit.

439
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,460
Investors like this

440
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,880
are really hard to find.

441
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:28,559
I think

442
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,400
if you can convince Mr. Ma to join you,

443
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,160
I believe you would have a clearer idea

444
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,720
of what project you really want to do.

445
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,119
Welcome to Yuyao.

446
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,160
I hope you can bring

447
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
a unique luster to this city

448
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,599
and truly play

449
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
an awesome game.

450
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,576
Ma Muzhi?

451
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,620
Isn't it said that he has long retreated
to the mountains

452
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,880
to live a life in retirement?

453
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,079
Didn't expect him to be in Yuyao.

454
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,119
If he can be persuaded

455
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,424
and shift his support to me,

456
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,480
everything would be no problem.

457
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:23,104
Yes.

458
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
With his support, funding
is definitely not an issue.

459
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,480
But the question is, where can we meet him?

460
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,392
Just keep looking.

461
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
After all, this path

462
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
was directed by Mr. Cheng.

463
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,839
If we can persuade Mr. Ma,

464
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,359
let alone overtaking on a turn,

465
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,599
we could directly reach the finish line.

466
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,279
It's still the same question.

467
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,799
Where can we meet Ma Muzhi?

468
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,240
Do you know where he is?

469
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:06,385
[Inpatient Department]

470
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,312
What are you thinking about?

471
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,240
You never get involved
in the company's affairs.

472
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,104
What's up this time?

473
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,119
You bypassed me and went straight
to legal affairs for coordination.

474
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:24,288
Are you afraid that I would stop it?

475
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Regarding this matter,

476
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,599
since we promised the child in the beginning,

477
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
after all, it has to be done sooner or later.

478
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,839
I didn't think that much about it.

479
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
It was my lack of consideration.

480
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,800
We promised Xiaoman

481
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,900
that she could become a shareholder
once she saved up 500,000.

482
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,640
That was because she
had just graduated from college.

483
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,319
We encouraged her to forge ahead.

484
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,079
Now that I think about it,
it's like I've tied myself up.

485
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,759
I've put you in a tough spot.

486
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,040
All these years,

487
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,640
you've been raising several children.

488
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,039
You're the one who has worked
the hardest to bring Jifeng to this point.

489
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,620
But after all, the shares
of the company from your brother

490
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,039
and the house at home

491
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,060
all ended up in our names.

492
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,039
All these things were originally Xiaoman's.

493
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,120
What should be Xiaoman's,

494
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,600
I, Xu Man, will only give more, not less.

495
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,680
You can rest assured about that.

496
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,960
Xiaoman is going to get married
in the future, right?

497
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,160
If she lives in Beijing,

498
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,559
we'll give her

499
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,440
a dowry bigger than her own
biological parents would.

500
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,672
Is that okay?

501
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,800
If she comes back home,

502
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,979
we'll buy her the best house.

503
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:38,540
Let her be free from worries
about food and clothing.

504
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,720
I won't let others poke at our backbone.

505
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:43,880
As you know,

506
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,780
it's always been me managing the company.

507
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,679
We're not a small workshop anymore.

508
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,279
Whatever you say goes.

509
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,020
I have to explain to the other shareholders.

510
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,880
What you're doing
makes it very difficult for me.

511
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,104
Man,

512
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,319
but the word is already out.

513
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,079
What do we do now?

514
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,960
What else can be done?

515
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,079
I'll handle it.

516
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,520
The company is currently fundraising.

517
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,280
Many people want to get in.

518
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,440
If we bring Xiaoman in at this time,

519
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,720
what would the other shareholders think?

520
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,440
You have to consider the difficulty of my job.

521
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,160
You know I'm not just doing this
for the two of us.

522
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm doing it for our entire Jifeng

523
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
and the whole Chen family.

524
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,959
As for Xiaoman,

525
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,319
you don't need to worry about her.

526
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,960
She's now striving

527
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,439
in Beijing.

528
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,679
For her,

529
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,079
hard cash

530
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,680
is more important than shares.

531
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:48,460
Uncle, Aunt.

532
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,960
- Xiaoman.
- Xiaoman.

533
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,720
Uncle, I've made some soup for you.

534
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,240
Xiaoman, why did you make soup?

535
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,179
You've come all this way, not an easy trip.

536
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:00,959
Rest well at home.

537
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,579
- It's okay.
- That's great.

538
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,060
Are you happy?

539
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,120
Yes.

540
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,520
Xiaoman made the soup for you
with her own hands.

541
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,544
Come on.

542
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:10,336
Have a taste.

543
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,279
Is it good?

544
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,279
Delicious.

545
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,040
Very tasty.

546
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,000
You go on drinking.

547
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,039
I'll go talk to Xiaoman about something.

548
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,408
Okay.

549
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:40,672
Come, sit.

550
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,408
Xiaoman,

551
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,319
are you finding it hard to work in Beijing?

552
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,000
No.

553
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,039
No?

554
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,559
I've watched you grow up
since you were a child.

555
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,880
You can't hide anything from me.

556
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,240
Your concerns are all written on your face.

557
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,760
Indeed,

558
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,519
there's been a problem at work.

559
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,300
The day you came back,

560
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,640
I felt it.

561
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,519
Our child has encountered
some difficulties outside.

562
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,240
But Xiaoman,

563
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,959
life is never a smooth-sailing journey.

564
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,319
Right?

565
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,500
We are always overcoming
one hurdle after another.

566
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,080
Once you've overcome them all,

567
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,216
looking back,

568
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,392
you'll see these were no big deals.

569
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,519
The children of our Chen family

570
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,319
can't shrink back knowing the difficulties.

571
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,000
You can't give up easily.

572
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,039
Look at me and your third uncle.

573
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,960
How many hurdles we've crossed,

574
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
how many difficulties we've overcome

575
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,079
to achieve what we have today in Jifeng.

576
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
I understand.

577
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,640
It's just that

578
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,079
I haven't figured out the next steps yet.

579
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,200
You've studied for so many years.

580
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,320
Isn't it that you want

581
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,240
to develop in a big city?

582
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,240
In a small place like our Yuyao,

583
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,240
can you really stay?

584
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:16,480
But now

585
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,300
the overall environment outside isn't good.

586
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,920
That's all the more reason to act quickly.

587
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,419
Your third uncle

588
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,119
has a friend or two in Beijing.

589
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,299
I know you're a strong-willed child

590
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,680
and feel embarrassed to speak to him.

591
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,799
I will speak for you.

592
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,100
Let your third uncle
call his friends in Beijing

593
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,184
to pull some strings.

594
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,380
Thank you, Aunt.

595
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,279
What's to thank for? Family shouldn't talk
as if they are strangers.

596
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,599
Now that you're back,

597
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,480
take the time to recuperate well.

598
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,319
Let Ms. Xu make you some delicious food.

599
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,600
Nourish your body

600
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,200
and adjust your mood well.

601
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,960
When you return to Beijing,

602
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,319
you'll be full of vim and vigor.

603
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,040
You are drawing?

604
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,279
Look, this is what I've just drawn.

605
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,176
Take a look.

606
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,200
You drew it?

607
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,959
So astonishing.

608
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:36,579
You're so impressive!

609
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,840
Yesterday, you just came
and glanced at the sample

610
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,079
and now you've drawn it.

611
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,199
Mr. Chen,

612
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,839
look at what Man has drawn.

613
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,160
Your drawing is so good.

614
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,740
Why don't you join us?

615
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,720
It's such a waste to work in sales.

616
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,079
Not a waste.

617
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,440
- Let me have a look.
- I'm not as lucky as you.

618
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,799
Drawn by Miss Xu.

619
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,660
Your foundation in drawing is very solid.

620
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,800
Not bad.

621
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,160
You could consider speaking

622
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,400
with the factory

623
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,360
and strive to join
the next batch of apprentices.

624
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,500
It's okay. What?

625
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,119
Thank you, Mr. Chen, for the affirmation.

626
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,320
Actually,

627
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,460
I really like it.

628
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,820
I usually write and draw by myself.

629
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,840
I want to learn properly from you masters.

630
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,639
But I feel that sales also suits me.

631
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,400
It allows me to take care of my family,

632
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,879
provides more flexibility with time,

633
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,360
and enables me to earn a bit more money.

634
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,080
Okay.

635
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:47,360
Okay.

636
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,760
Look at you.

637
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,679
Mr. Chen has spoken.

638
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,312
It's okay.

639
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,520
Go on with your drawing.

640
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,800
You learning well is enough.

641
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,000
It's a gift for you.

642
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,159
Think carefully about what I said to you.

643
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,119
Go see your third uncle.

644
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
Drinking this soup

645
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,800
makes his heart blossom with joy.

646
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,439
Hello.

647
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,448
Hello.

648
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
When are you coming back?

649
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,008
Haven't decided yet.

650
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,040
Well, in the past,

651
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,119
I worked hard to make money for the shares

652
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,360
just to secure some for my dad.

653
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,220
Logically speaking,

654
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,000
considering your family's big company
and substantial business,

655
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,039
they should be able to arrange

656
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,128
a job for you.

657
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:23,639
We'll talk about it later.

658
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,540
The porcelain industry

659
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,320
is another industry.

660
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,280
Well,

661
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,440
why don't you come back?

662
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,920
There must be a way when the car
reaches the mountain.

663
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Okay, let's talk about it later.

664
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,840
When I'm not there, you must
take good care of yourself.

665
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,020
I've been taking very good care of myself.

666
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,920
I-I just miss you a little.

667
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,159
I miss you too.

668
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,980
By the way, I've sent
some rice noodles back to you.

669
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,599
You can eat them after heating them up.

670
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,199
I will think of you
while eating the rice noodles.

671
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,039
You sure know what to say. Hanging up now.

672
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,520
Mr. Ma,

673
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,472
give me five minutes.

674
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,740
After you understand the project,

675
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,199
I believe you'll be interested.

676
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,559
Do you know what this grass is called?

677
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,539
I'm living in seclusion in the mountains.

678
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:42,519
Do you think I'm completely cut off
from the world?

679
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,440
I've heard

680
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,016
about your matters in Beijing.

681
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,719
Well?

682
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,100
You're in such a rush to find a lifeline?

683
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,400
Wanting to crush Tian Xiwen and his gang

684
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
and vent your anger?

685
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,719
I'm not the kind of person who doesn't
distinguish between public and private affairs.

686
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,119
The Ceramic Cultural and Creative Park

687
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,280
does have its room for development.

688
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:12,400
Currently, in Yuyao,

689
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,880
the annual output value for the entire
ceramics industry is over fifty billion.

690
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,600
With the addition of your resources, Mr. Ma,

691
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I believe

692
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,219
we can absolutely secure

693
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,679
the largest slice of the market pie.

694
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,360
You're worthy?

695
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,559
I accept any form of cooperation.

696
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,139
What qualifications and conditions
do you have to discuss this with me?

697
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:36,840
I have a complete proposal in hand.

698
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,339
All right, there's no need to open it.

699
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:41,280
I've been here for over ten years.

700
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,480
These so-called proposals of yours

701
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,599
are worthless in my eyes.

702
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,120
Have you looked

703
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,352
into the top ten ceramic manufacturers

704
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:57,460
in Yuyao City?

705
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,560
Yes.

706
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,820
Out of these ten, three

707
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,800
were controlled by your former partner,

708
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,840
the one named Liu Shang,

709
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,039
and have joined their phase one project.

710
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
The remaining seven

711
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
are from the Jifeng series,

712
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,400
forming the Jifeng Alliance.

713
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,400
They support Jifeng

714
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,559
and don't want your capital
to come in and disrupt things

715
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,360
so that they have to compete
against each other.

716
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,320
This is the conclusion
you arrived at before, right?

717
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,320
Your name is Ke Yan, right?

718
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,199
You have a spine.

719
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,336
I understand.

720
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,639
But you don't understand Jifeng.

721
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
You simply won't have a chance.

722
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,719
What about the other six manufacturers?

723
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,880
You can take a try.

724
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,540
If I succeed in trying,

725
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,800
does it mean that

726
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,840
you are willing to join me?

727
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:06,880
Young man,

728
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,400
I went through a phase like yours.

729
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,119
But as a senior,

730
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,119
as someone who has gone through it,

731
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,960
I advise you to give up this project.

732
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,280
But I know

733
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
your abilities

734
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,760
and I would like to see
your abilities for myself.

735
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,704
How about this?

736
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,800
I have some funds

737
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,000
especially for charitable activities.

738
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,960
I plan to give you this opportunity

739
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,039
to manage this money.

740
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,768
What do you say?

741
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,224
No pay for no work.

742
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,800
There's no need for you to belittle me.

743
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
But thank you for being willing to trust me.

744
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,820
But I would prefer to work with you

745
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,080
as a partner.

746
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,560
Wait until you understand what this thing is.

747
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,400
Then come talk business with me.

748
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,079
Please, Mr. Qian.

749
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,060
Your Shili Pottery

750
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,000
is one of the top shops in Yuyao.

751
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,720
If we can truly gain your support,

752
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,280
it would be a win-win for us.

753
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,960
Mr. Ke, I think you misunderstand.

754
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,020
Our Shili factory

755
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,940
has no current plans to expand capital.

756
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,500
We are just a small factory.

757
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,179
We don't want to go so high-end.

758
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,020
Moreover, the masters in my factory
are all old craftsmen.

759
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,720
They've played with clay their whole lives.

760
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,620
Now you want them to operate machinery.

761
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,760
They will surely mess it up.

762
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:42,760
You can completely keep
the original production process.

763
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,180
Don't say anymore.

764
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,599
I believe my stance
is already very clear to you.

765
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,496
Okay.

766
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,696
Well,

767
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,319
I'm still quite looking forward
to the opportunity to work with you.

768
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,440
Please

769
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,080
think about it.

770
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,560
If there's a chance,

771
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,840
we can contact each other anytime.

772
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,360
Yuyao is small.
Hope to see you again if there's a chance.

773
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:48,554
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

774
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,442
♫ I tell myself over and over,
I must not fear ♫

775
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,501
♫ When nothing here goes my way ♫

776
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:05,817
♫ Where should I come from
and where should I go ♫

777
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:12,335
♫ When I dream of your figures once again ♫

778
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,402
♫ I find I no longer cry like I used to ♫

779
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:23,850
♫ I learned to control my emotions ♫

780
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,890
♫ And how to be alone ♫

781
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,459
♫ Facing the wind and rain in this world ♫

782
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:36,490
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

783
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,570
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

784
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,986
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

785
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:48,170
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

786
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,164
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

787
00:43:52,164 --> 00:43:55,050
♫ Embracing my body ♫

788
00:43:55,914 --> 00:44:00,011
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

789
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:02,922
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

790
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:06,673
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

791
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:13,162
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

792
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:21,686
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫

793
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:35,116
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

794
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:37,290
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

795
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,898
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

796
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:47,178
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

797
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:50,779
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

798
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:54,360
♫ Embracing my body ♫

799
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,410
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

800
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,386
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

801
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:05,101
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

802
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:12,074
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

803
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:19,882
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫
