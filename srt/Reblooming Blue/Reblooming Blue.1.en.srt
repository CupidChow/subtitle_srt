00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm telling you, we'll take a taxi.

188
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,816
Right away.

189
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,700
They talked about layoffs last month.

190
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,160
I lose sleep every night.

191
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,200
I feel like I'll have to go home
soon, I'm telling you.

192
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,720
Don't jinx yourself. It can't be you.

193
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,360
Hasn't your boss come back yet?

194
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,719
Not yet.

195
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,200
He's always traveling.

196
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,928
I don't know what he's doing.

197
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,020
Think of a strategy.

198
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,279
Fight for what you should strive for.

199
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
It's not about that.

200
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,200
I think he looks down on me.

201
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,400
What are the odds?

202
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,399
How did you end up with such a boss?

203
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,776
I can only do my job well.

204
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
With so many people, the elevator
is going to be full again.

205
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,408
This way, this way.

206
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:35,840
Here.

207
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:39,392
Come on.

208
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,780
Let's go.

209
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,944
Let's go.

210
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,096
I'll go press the elevator button.

211
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,440
[Fortune Plaza]

212
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Pang Juan.

213
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,688
It's done.

214
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,399
Thank you.

215
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,600
You're welcome.

216
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,399
I… I want to ask you for a favor.

217
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,519
What?

218
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,360
Didn't we agree on 5,000 before?

219
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,780
But I'm a bit tight on money now.

220
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,639
Would 3,000 be okay?

221
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,759
You know this chart is not easy to make.

222
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,920
It almost took me a month.

223
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,480
And the information
you provided was not complete.

224
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,639
I had to calculate a lot of it myself.

225
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,760
I know, I know.

226
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,519
This is not an easy job.

227
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,919
I'm not making excuses here,

228
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,559
but I truly have unspeakable difficulties.

229
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,272
I…

230
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,320
I'm pregnant.

231
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,639
It might be a personal physical issue,

232
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
but I have severe morning sickness
and can't work well.

233
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother you, right?

234
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
Have you told the company?

235
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,860
Pang Juan, good morning.

236
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,024
Morning.

237
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,472
How far along are you?

238
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,296
Three months.

239
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,680
Okay, 3,000 it is.

240
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,599
The rest can be considered
my gift money to you, okay?

241
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,500
You know, in our company,

242
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,200
there are several weddings this month.

243
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm also a bit short on money.

244
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,712
Thank you.

245
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,320
You're welcome.

246
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,799
Alright, go back to work quickly,
and take care of your health.

247
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:27,328
Go on, go on.

248
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,199
The head office's leaders
will arrive in half an hour.

249
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,319
Half an hour?

250
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,440
Miss Tian, can you please help out?

251
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,260
It takes time to print materials.

252
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,880
Come on, Administrative Dept.

253
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I haven't had a sip of water
since I came to work today.

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,439
I have a pile of documents to deal with.

255
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,960
If you say ten or eight minutes,
I can help you stall.

256
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,440
Half an hour is too long.

257
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,400
The more you talk with the group leaders,
the more mistakes you'll make.

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,519
It's difficult for.

259
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,380
Dear Miss Tian.

260
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,420
You always have so many issues.

261
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,059
Let me tell you, Ke Yan is finishing up

262
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,600
his project negotiations.

263
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Figure it out yourself, okay?

264
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
No wonder he doesn't reply to messages.

265
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,960
Pang Juan, did you finish that form yesterday?

266
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,780
Miss Tian, I am working on it. There's still
some information to fill out.

267
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,264
I have a meeting and I need it now.

268
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,320
I'll organize it right away.

269
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,540
Is it this one? Let me take a look first.

270
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,920
- No need.
- Let me see it.

271
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,472
Come with me.

272
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,920
Tell me, what's going on?

273
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,079
Miss Tian, I just haven't finished it.

274
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,680
I'm asking who did the annotations.

275
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,240
You've been working for quite a few years now.

276
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,480
It's not easy to have a job at Yaosheng.

277
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:24,512
Yes.

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,559
Xiaoman helped me do it.

279
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Is it Chen Xiaoman from Ke Yan's team?

280
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,039
Say this at the meeting later.

281
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,380
Miss Tian.

282
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,240
If you want to keep your job,

283
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,096
do as I say.

284
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
Haven't you always wanted to punish Ke Yan?

285
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,640
I've found an opportunity for you.

286
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,340
There is a data alignment
meeting of Fengyuan today.

287
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,000
I asked Pang Juan

288
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,599
to prepare the required forms,

289
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,500
but she asked Chen Xiaoman

290
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,759
from Ke Yan's team to do it for her,

291
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,640
violating the confidentiality agreement.

292
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,759
Even though Ke Yan's projects
are mostly finished,

293
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,799
in the end, all these projects will be yours.

294
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:40,384
Li.

295
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,160
For this year's Equestrian Week,

296
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,440
shall we have a little competition?

297
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,344
Place a bet.

298
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,160
Ke Yan, I really admire your energy.

299
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,319
You just got back from Yuyao
to accompany me in horse riding.

300
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,039
I thought you would say no.

301
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,420
With your drive,

302
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,680
who wouldn't want

303
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,624
to trust you with the project?

304
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,360
Once the time is ripe,

305
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll arrange for you to meet with Fengyuan,

306
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
My PR team told me

307
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,519
that Ke Yan had no weaknesses.

308
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,279
There's no way to preach him.

309
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,559
If you ask me,

310
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,720
from the perspective of a vendor,

311
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,699
I enjoy collaborating with someone

312
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,780
experienced and capable like you the most.

313
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,968
I couldn't ask for more.

314
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
You don't need to preach to me.

315
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,480
You're confident like the buying party,

316
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,304
which I rarely see.

317
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,460
I hope in this year's Equestrian Week,

318
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,279
you can win my horse Chocolate.

319
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,088
It's a deal, then.

320
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,599
I'll give it my all, let's go.

321
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,240
What a long morning.

322
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,819
The headquarters are coming

323
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,460
without saying anything beforehand.

324
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,120
No one told us,

325
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,799
and we had to prepare everything on-spot.

326
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,079
I wonder who they're meant to surprise.

327
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,519
Someone at the bottom
of the food chain like me, right?

328
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,579
Don't be anxious.

329
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:05,720
There's still some time left.
Don't get things wrong.

330
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,020
I think being a printer isn't too bad.

331
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,640
In my next life, I'll be a printer.

332
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:13,408
Dun Ge.

333
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
How's it going?

334
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,620
It's ready.

335
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,980
Don't print the cash flow statement

336
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,300
of Pang Juan's group.

337
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,400
They are going to project it
on the screen in the meeting.

338
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,060
Get ready

339
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,220
and bring out the other ones.

340
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,288
Okay.

341
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,279
I need something sweet for lunch today.

342
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,136
What a waste.

343
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,420
Let's welcome leaders
from the group headquarters.

344
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,640
Thank you for taking the time

345
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,839
to visit our company and provide guidance.

346
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,620
Today, we will have a

347
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,279
data alignment meeting of Fengyuan Group.

348
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,280
Before the meeting, I would like
to report to the leaders

349
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,439
the progress made

350
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,020
on the Fengyuan Group's acquisition case.

351
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,240
Our project team

352
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,420
officially took over this project
at the beginning of this year.

353
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,220
And it is also one of the larger

354
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,480
projects for our company in recent years.

355
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,640
Fengyuan Group is a strong player
in the cultural tourism industry.

356
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,679
Personally, I believe

357
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,800
this acquisition case of Fengyuan Group

358
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,080
will create a significant impact

359
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,480
on the market.

360
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,240
Recently, we have compiled some

361
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,840
consolidated cash flow statements
of Fengyuan Group

362
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,679
[Fengyuan 2022 Consolidated Cash Flow Statements]
and its seven subsidiaries.

363
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:47,900
Let's take a look at them now.

364
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,480
Wu, scroll down.

365
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,944
[Table Comments]

366
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,880
Why are there comments here?

367
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,640
Pang Juan.

368
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,240
What's with the comments on this?

369
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,279
Did you make this table?

370
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,440
I asked Chen Xiaoman to do it.

371
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,520
Chen Xiaoman isn't from our project team.

372
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,759
Why would she help you?

373
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Do you realize that the data in the table

374
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,559
is all about Fengyuan Group's trade secrets?

375
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,500
You asked someone who isn't on our project team

376
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,799
to help you with the table.

377
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,559
Have you considered the risks involved?

378
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,640
If Chen Xiaoman leaks this data,

379
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,240
do you know how much it would cost the company?

380
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm sorry, Miss Tian.

381
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,940
You don't need to apologize to me.

382
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,160
You have already crossed my bottom line.

383
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,599
Today, all the group's leaders are here,

384
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,559
as for your punishment,

385
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,240
an expert from the group will take over next.

386
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,720
The condition of the blue
and white porcelain is good.

387
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,040
Yes, it's particularly good.

388
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,679
Ke Yan, see you at the Equestrian Week.

389
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,880
Okay, see you then.

390
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,200
Make sure it eats well.

391
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Sure, no problem.

392
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,840
I must win the championship
at the Equestrian Festival this time.

393
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,888
Definitely.

394
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,808
Okay, see you later.

395
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,599
Hey, what's the rush?

396
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,672
Got it.

397
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,599
Come on, what's the situation now?

398
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,680
The group leaders are here

399
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,720
and they require us

400
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,180
to provide a solution today.

401
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,839
That's why we urgently called you back.

402
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,240
I think

403
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,780
Tian Xiwen must be up to something.

404
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,280
With Tian Xiwen's intelligence,

405
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
she couldn't have orchestrated this act.

406
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Fengyuan is already aware.

407
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,000
It's clearly directed at me.

408
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,760
The HR department has already
notified all departments

409
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,039
to finish work one hour late.

410
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,319
Isn't this our great contributor?

411
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,799
I heard you signed the contract
right there in Jiangxi.

412
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,599
That's pretty efficient.

413
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,720
You look travel-weary.

414
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
Why aren't you home to rest?

415
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,520
Are you behind this?

416
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,344
Behind what?

417
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,920
Don't falsely accuse me.

418
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:28,400
What's that?

419
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,519
Precious Chinese medicine.

420
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,920
Overthinking can easily lead to anxiety.

421
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,319
Take good care of your health.

422
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,368
What's going on?

423
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,820
You have too much spare time,

424
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,780
enough to work on projects for another group.

425
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,279
It didn't affect my work

426
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,300
or the company.

427
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,008
Why don't you do the cleaning work then?

428
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:08,159
It doesn't make money.

429
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,440
Quite honest, aren't we?

430
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,759
I didn't recognize you as a money grubber.

431
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:19,392
Boss.

432
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,720
Look, I've been on your team
for quite a few years now.

433
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,048
Just help me out.

434
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,659
I promise that I won't dare to do it again.

435
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,240
- There won't be a next time.
- The project we worked on for half a year

436
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,880
was almost within our grasp.

437
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,839
Just because of this mess you made,

438
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,240
I have to come back
and report to the company now.

439
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,320
I have a premonition.

440
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,640
Chances are I've made
a wedding dress for someone else.

441
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,359
If I help you, who'll help me?

442
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,000
It's you or me.

443
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,599
What an easy choice.

444
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,944
Xiaoman.

445
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,700
I didn't expect things

446
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,319
to develop to this extent.

447
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,319
It was consensual, after all.

448
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,599
No one should be sorry.

449
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,640
Being discovered just means we're unlucky.

450
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,376
Which project?

451
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:03,839
The Fengyuan one.

452
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,459
That's your team's project.

453
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:09,299
And the data is all confidential.

454
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,599
It's not appropriate for me to take over.

455
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,392
Did you just finish a meeting?

456
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,920
What's wrong?

457
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,039
Are you busy lately?

458
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,799
Can you help me out a bit?

459
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,559
I have a consolidated cash flow statement task.
Could you help me with it?

460
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,920
Which project?

461
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,384
The Fengyuan one.

462
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,780
That's your team's project.

463
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,640
And the data is all confidential.

464
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,720
It's not appropriate for me to take over.

465
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,880
If you don't tell and I don't tell,
who would find out?

466
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,640
It's not a matter of telling or not telling.

467
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,880
It's against the rules.

468
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,480
5,000. I won't let you work for nothing.

469
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,860
It's not about the money.

470
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,599
I know that.

471
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,580
I owe you a big favor.

472
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,839
Can you do me this favor?

473
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,759
No, I can't.

474
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,760
Please, just help me out.

475
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,520
You know, if it wasn't
for an absolute necessity,

476
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,240
I wouldn't ask you for help.

477
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,079
Please, just help me out.

478
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,640
I'll owe you a big one.

479
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
I'll take that as a yes.
I still have a meeting to attend.

480
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
I'll send you the materials right away.

481
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,152
I'm off.

482
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,720
I'm in a tough spot.

483
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,680
- I had no choice, you know.
- Don't worry.

484
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,159
I won't turn in this recording to the company.

485
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,296
That day, after the meeting,

486
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,240
the voice recorder was still on
when you came to see me.

487
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
A mother has to be strong, right?

488
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,096
I know

489
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,279
that this job means a lot to you.

490
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,448
But not just to you,

491
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,160
it's also important to me.

492
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,160
If I lost this job,

493
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,559
I wouldn't know where else to go.

494
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:11,120
Xiaoman.

495
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,192
We…

496
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,960
will not see each other again.

497
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,944
I wish you all the best.

498
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,319
You're just unlucky.

499
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,820
You happened to be there
when the group leaders came to investigate.

500
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,500
You got caught in the crossfire.

501
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,219
You're not a rookie new to the job market.

502
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:47,300
The project data involves trade secrets.

503
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,440
According to our company's regulations,

504
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
you need to make compensation

505
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
and resign on your own initiative.

506
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,079
But we gave it some thought afterward.

507
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,100
Considering your performance

508
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,200
has been good over the past three years,

509
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
we have decided

510
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,039
to give you a verbal warning

511
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,039
and deduct your bonuses
for the next two quarters.

512
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,152
Do you accept that?

513
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,808
I do.

514
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,240
After the group's discussion,

515
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,720
regarding your employee Chen Xiaoman,

516
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,799
the final decision is to dismiss her.

517
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,432
I don't agree.

518
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,720
If Pang Juan asked you for help,

519
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,319
and you were just cooperating
to assist a colleague,

520
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,079
then this matter

521
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,832
wouldn't be a big deal.

522
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,460
But you charged a fee,

523
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,880
and it involved the company's secrets,

524
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,200
the nature of this issue
is completely different.

525
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,680
Do you have any explanation?

526
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,199
Then do you accept

527
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,320
our decision?

528
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
I do.

529
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,339
Since Chen Xiaoman has accepted
this outcome herself,

530
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,879
I suggest that you should not go against

531
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,100
the company's decision.

532
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,296
Mr. Ke,

533
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,920
one rotten apple spoils the barrel.

534
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,080
Mr. Ke,

535
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,340
in light of the adverse impact
caused by the Chen Xiaoman incident,

536
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,500
the group advises you

537
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,940
to promptly conduct

538
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,719
an internal rectification of your team.

539
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,260
The Yuyao project

540
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,440
will be temporarily taken over by Yan Su.

541
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,959
This is not a suggestion,

542
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,079
but a decision.

543
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,248
Xiaoman.

544
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:10,752
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

545
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:16,544
♫ I tell myself over and over,
I must not fear ♫

546
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:22,898
♫ When nothing here goes my way ♫

547
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:28,036
♫ Where should I come from
and where should I go ♫

548
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:34,569
♫ When I dream of your figures once again ♫

The traffic situation from

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,400
is currently very congested.

567
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,159
All drivers, please remain patient

568
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,760

569
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,079
Yes, be careful.

570
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,640
Actually, as a new Beijinger,

571
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,576
my mood becomes especially
complex whenever it rains.

572
00:38:00,576 --> 00:38:01,720
Why is that?

573
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,760
Because my ancestral home is in the south,

574
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,260
where, once the rainy season arrives,

575
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,679
it can rain continuously for over a month.

576
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,599
It is the rainy days

577
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,199
that often make people feel melancholic.

I've been in Beijing for over a decade myself.

581
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,620
It doesn't rain often in Beijing.

582
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,760
That's why I especially
like rainy days in Beijing.

583
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,480
Sir, I haven't arrived yet.

584
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,920
There's a traffic jam today.

585
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,860
If it were a normal day, this amount of money

586
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,912
would have taken you there.

587
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,672

00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,896

615

00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:57,079
Actually, our family owns a porcelain company.

00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:32,679
According to the original plan, I'll have
saved enough by the end of this year.

653
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,040
