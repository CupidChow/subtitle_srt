[Episode 6]

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,719
You didn't see how happy your dad was.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,660
Seeing Xiaoman,

5
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,879
he couldn't wait to pull out the needle
and leave the hospital immediately.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,839
I'm angry at both of you.

7
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,719
Neither of you brings me any honor.

8
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,040
Mom, do you think this dress looks good on me?

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,832
Turn around and let me see.

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,880
It accentuates your waist
and is slimming, looks good.

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
You look good in anything.

12
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,120
Yaoyao,

13
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,979
last time you went to Beijing,

14
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,120
you saw your sister.

15
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,520
How is she doing?

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,860
She's doing quite well.

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,920
Although competition
in big companies is fierce,

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,560
she coordinates very well.

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,840
And she lives with a few close friends.

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
They can help each other.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,700
They're quite happy and free.

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,539
All you see is the freedom?

23
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,080
Can't you learn from her?

24
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,800
She has never caused anyone worry
from childhood.

25
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,819
Always discontented.

26
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,840
Discontented.

27
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,379
I can't bear to see you
and your brother suffer.

28
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,959
But I also know

29
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,140
that a little hardship is nothing to youth.

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,759
It's good for you.

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,539
I've thought it through.

32
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,720
This time,

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,180
after you graduate,

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,300
come to work as an intern for the company,

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,860
so that those experienced workers
in the factory can teach you more!

36
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,240
Take the opportunity to learn from them.

37
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,400
Their aesthetics

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,479
are not inferior to those
of your teachers in big cities.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,759
Don't be all talk and no action.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,039
Mom, how about this one?

41
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,120
Is the long one better or the short one?

42
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,520
Did you hear what I just said?

43
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
Yes, I heard you.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
Besides, isn't Chen Xiaoman
the most outstanding in our family?

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,039
Let her go then.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,659
Can't you show me or your dad

47
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,400
how good you are?

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,536
Besides,

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,319
I have my worries.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,780
My friend is calling me. I'm leaving first.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,320
Where are you off to?

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,440
Chen Xuntong.

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,679
Take good care of my mom.

54
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,759
- Chen Xunyao.
- Bye.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,759
Mom, look, my sister

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,479
really makes us worry.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Where are you going
dressed like this so late at night?

58
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,539
Mom, I…

59
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,060
I have to meet some very important clients.

60
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,860
And then, I also have to handle some

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,240
very important business.

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,280
So,

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,480
I would like to request a little…

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Scram!

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,439
Drink less alcohol.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,099
Okay.

67
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,360
Come back early.

68
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,056
Okay.

69
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,120
- Excuse me.
- Come, excuse me, excuse me.

70
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,320
- Come.
- Come on, be careful.

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,416
Come.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,056
Come. Thank you.

73
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,080
Be careful, be careful.

74
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,168
Careful, careful.

75
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,896
Thank you.

76
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
Boss, you didn't leave?

77
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,800
I plan to stay here
and continue the development of the town.

78
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:22,739
Do you want to go over there to talk?

79
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,919
It's more spacious over there.

80
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,879
We have to keep giving way here,
back and forth.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,728
Be careful.

82
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:30,816
I can.

83
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,312
Alright.

84
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,279
Boss, then are you

85
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,040
going to join Liu Shang and the others?

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,440
Starting from scratch on my own.

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,420
Let me know if you need any help.

88
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,464
No need.

89
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
I want to explore the way myself first.

90
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,472
Thank you.

91
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,776
No need.

92
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,399
It smells terrible.

93
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,680
Chen Xuntong, what are you doing?

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,079
Can't you see what I'm doing?

95
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,199
I'm asking what you are doing in my room.

96
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:33,248
I…

97
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,879
How bad it smells to vomit in my room!

98
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,440
Why are you still here?

99
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Weren't you supposed to leave in two days?

100
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
Who told you I was leaving?

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,639
Sister,

102
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,320
didn't you just come back
to deal with the shares?

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Just a matter of paying and signing.

104
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,240
If it were me,

105
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
I would be on the plane back now.

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,224
Yeah, keep bragging.

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,680
If you knew

108
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,220
how big a deal I pulled off today,

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,240
you should at least
toast me a couple of drinks.

110
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,239
What great thing have you done?

111
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,839
How about I get Aunt to toast you as well?

112
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,600
She should toast me, too.

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,632
Get lost.

114
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,380
Come here, I'll tell you.

115
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,480
Say it or not, I don't care.

116
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,040
Fine.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,736
You stink too much.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,439
Let me tell you.

119
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,184
I…

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
Go pour me a glass of water, quick!

121
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,399
Okay, I'll pour you a glass of water.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,240
- Pour a cup of hot water.
- Sis, it hurts!

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,740
- Come on.
- It hurts!

124
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,480
I'll pour you a cup of hot water.

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,380
Chen Xiaoman, let me tell you.

126
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,220
Don't be a coward.

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,760
Be bold and generous, you know?

128
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,220
Trust me.

129
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
Once you cower,

130
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,520
you'll lose your confidence.

131

[The Chen Family Network]

The other seven companies

are all part of the Jifeng series,

138

forming the Jifeng Alliance.

139
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,159
They support Jifeng

140
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,080
and they don't want your capital
to cause trouble.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,759
Let them compete against each other.

142
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
You don't understand Jifeng.

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,399
You basically have no chance.

is not as composed as he appears.

Uncle Ma didn't turn out to be the lifesaver
he had imagined.

147
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,380
And our entire family

148
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,279
has been incorporated into his plan.

149
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,320
Perhaps because I'm the closest to him,

150

over the next 100 days,

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,859
I'll embark on a phase

152
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,600
of unprecedented luck.

153
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,519
You have more foresight
and know operations better than others.

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,400
But these past two days,

155
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
you've already been everywhere.

The big factories that have not cooperated
with Liu Shang in Yuyao

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,400
are all closely following the steps of Jifeng.

158
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,039
You've almost visited each
and every one of them,

159
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,639
yet nobody nodded in agreement.

160
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
Ma Muzhi's big financier has resources.

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
Even if Nanmian Investments
is willing to invest,

164
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,976
the amount of funds available
is also very limited.

165
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,639
How will you overpower?

166
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,639
And moreover,

167
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm telling you the truth.

168
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,220
Our company hardly has

169
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,000
invested in such a project.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,140
If you want to endorse when the project lands,

171
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,232
I think it's not going to work.

172
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,320
We cannot make bricks without clay.

00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,600
Tell me, how do you plan to operate?

174
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,008
Give up already?

That's right.

Well…

Come back to Shanghai with me, okay?

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000

187
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,279
Former subordinate?

188
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,640
Sit.

189
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
About the Yuyao project,

190
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,099
he has led you all to a failed venture,

191
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,159
don't you blame him?

192
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,659
It's not his fault.

193
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,440
If anyone to blame, it's got to be Liu Shang.

194
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,759
Quite righteous.

195
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,159
Xiaoman, have you heard of a company

196
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,000
- in Shanghai called Nanmian Investments?
- Let's talk business.

197
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,919
What's with Yuyao?

198
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes, boss.

199
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,879
I feel the same way.

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,320
When we did our research before,

201
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,780
there were so many alternative projects.

202
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,519
Actually, any of them
would be a sunrise industry.

203
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,599
Why are you

204
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,300
competing with Liu Shang

205
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,360
and Yan Su?

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,020
These people

207
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,400
have low boundaries.

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,380
No, they don't have boundaries at all.

209
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,519
I think Xiaoman makes a lot of sense.

210
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,919
Actually, it's not that complicated.

211
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,440
I can't get over it myself.

212
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
If I tell myself to let it go this time,

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
I'll say that even more in the future.

214
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,260
I don't accept this outcome.

215
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,979
Fine, I won't persuade you.

216
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,440
Then you tell me.

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,900
You've been to all the other major factories
in the Jifeng Alliance.

218
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,719
All the roads in sight are blocked.

219
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,896
What else can be done?

220
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:30,980
Boss.

221
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,000
You've been everywhere in just two days?

222
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,719
You're too amazing!

223
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,720
Alright, enough with the flattery here.

224
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,360
Capture the ringleader first.

225
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,500
Then you say, Ke Yan.

226
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,879
How do you plan to knock on the door of Jifeng?

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
Why are you laughing?
Where did your confidence come from?

228
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,640
Mr. Xie.

229
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,519
Chen Huafeng is my uncle.

230
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:01,159
Who?

231
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,120
My uncle is Chen Huafeng.

232
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,399
Your uncle is Chen Huafeng?

233
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,559
I finally understand
why you were so confident just now.

234
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,759
Come on, Xiaoman,
give us a detailed explanation.

235
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,820
Specifically.

236
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,240
I can't explain clearly.

237
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,519
I've never talked to my uncle

238
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,399
about Jifeng's business affairs.

239
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,960
I don't know

240
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,080
why Uncle Ma hasn't co-operated

241
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,480
with my uncle after all these years.

242
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,779
I still need to know what he thinks first.

243
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,380
Right, no problem.

244
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,879
You need to have a good talk with him.

245
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,300
But of course,

246
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,599
if there's anything you need my help,

247
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,279
I'll do my best.

248
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,479
Xiaoman, shall we add each other on WeChat?

249
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,584
I'll scan you.

250
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,360
Sure.

251
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,472
Come on.

252
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,759
Alrighty, sent it.

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,340
Xie Junyao.

254
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,424
Yeah.

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,919
Don't deny it, you do have some dumb luck.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You've done Chen Xiaoman a favor.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,560
She's the stepping stone for you
to access Yuyao.

258
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,639
No.

259
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,399
She's the golden key to unlocking Jifeng.

260
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,320
Then you must hurry back to Shanghai.

261
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,720
Get the letter of intent
from Nanmian Investments as soon as possible.

262
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,440
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

263
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,120
The research aspect needs to be fast-tracked.

264
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,432
I need funding.

265
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,879
Can't let Liu Shang get a head start.

266
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,440
I have money.

267
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,280
It'll take time to persuade the board

268
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,399
to approve this project when I get back.

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,240
Ke Yan, you're right.

270
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,099
The project needs to get started first.

271
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,320
How much money do you have?

272
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,720
Over ten million, I guess.

273
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:12,580
Dirty money?

274
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,880
Don't talk nonsense here.

275
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,360
That's my hard-earned money

276
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
for the wedding and the house.

277
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:20,864
Ke Yan.

278
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,039
I'm doing my best for what you're trying to do.

279
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,759
Support you with my best, right?

280
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,160
Then, on this project,

281
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,000
you have to leave a share for me personally.

282
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
You're wolfing down the rice in your bowl

283
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,559
while keeping one eye on the pot.

284
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,432
You're greedy.

285
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll book the ticket right away.

286
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:08,960
Good morning, Aunt.

287
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
Xiaoman, you're up.

288
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,032
Did you sleep well?

289
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,759
Xiaoman.

290
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,240
It's been such a long time
since you've come back.

291
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,440
I haven't had a proper meal with you.

292
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,340
I had Xu make you
fried breadsticks with sticky rice.

293
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,376
Your favorite.

294
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,392
Eat more in a bit.

295
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,220
Aunt, has the company been busy lately?

296
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,320
Always so busy

297
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,140
Then do you have any

298
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,679
plans to expand production?

299
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,959
Expand production? Xiaoman.

300
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,360
It's not that simple.

301
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,480
You, just don't worry about these things.

302
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,940
Now that you're back, just be happy

303
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,240
and live your life well.

304
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,480
Then your uncle and I can rest easy.

305
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,600
I'll go to the hospital to see Uncle in a bit.

306
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,760
There's no need to see him every day.

307
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,119
It's not easy to come back home.

308
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,680
Just go out for some fun.

309
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
It's fine.

310
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,120
Since I've come home,
I want to spend more time with Uncle.

311
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,679
Besides, the company is so busy.

312
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,440
I also want to help you
shoulder some of the burden.

313
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I remember when I was a child,

314
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,359
once I did particularly poorly on a test,

315
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,599
my uncle didn't scold me,

316
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,319
but you did spank me quite a bit.

317
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,599
That was the first time I got spanked.

318
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,400
But over the years, away from home,

319
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,079
the more I grew up, the more I felt

320
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
that you really treated me
as a member of the family back then.

321
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:38,759
You gave me quite a scare.

322
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,880
I thought you held a grudge against me.

323
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,460
Fried breadsticks with sticky rice are here.

324
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,839
Great, come on, Xiaoman, eat more.

325
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,339
Put it in the middle. Aunt likes it too.

326
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,368
Come on.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Your favorite when you were a child.

328
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Have a big one.

329
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,039
The real deal.

330
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,400
Some scholars believe
it was from the Yuan dynasty.

331
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,544
Yuan dynasty.

332
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,240
Earlier it was mentioned as the Song dynasty.

333
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,960
Uncle.

334
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
Xiaoman.

335
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,340
Why are you reading again?

336
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,119
The doctor said you need to rest more.

337
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,119
Can't sleep.

338
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,419
I haven't even been on the operating table yet.

339
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:26,759
Lying down all day long,

340
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,640
my mind is almost mush from lying down so much.

341
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
What delicious food have you brought me?

342
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:34,780
Uncle.

343
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,280
Aunt is quite romantic, huh?

344
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,079
She changes the bouquet for you every few days.

345
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,000
It's Ma.

346
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,319
He loves all this flashy stuff.

347
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,540
I remember when Uncle Ma first came here,

348
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,279
it seemed like he wanted
to collaborate with Jifeng.

349
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Why do you suddenly ask about this?

350
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
It's nothing, I just feel that

351
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,500
you two seem to get along pretty well usually.

352
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,440
How come you haven't agreed
to his proposal over all these years?

353
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,599
You mean I'm working with him?

354
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,680
What do I collaborate with him on?

355
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,599
It's impossible for me
to cooperate with capital.

356
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,519
You studied finance, didn't you?

357
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,880
The Pu'er tea phenomenon.

358
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,656
You know, right?

359
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,600
Clinging to the concept of an aged old stump

360
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,279
that could be speculated
to several hundred thousand.

361
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,359
Those who want to drink tea can't buy it.

362
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,239
Those who grow tea can't afford a meal.

363
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,680
Can this be a good thing?

364
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,380
The craft of porcelain

365
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,559
has been passed down in Yuyao City
for thousands of years.

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,759
It hasn't been easy to get to this day.

367
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,279
I must uphold it for our ancestors

368
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,720
and also preserve it for your generation.

369
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
Is there any

370
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
win-win approach?

371
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,759
Win-win, how can there be a win-win?

372
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
What do they want?

373
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,100
Money.

374
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,480
It's all about money, right?

375
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,119
But once a person is obsessed with money,

376
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
there's only losing, no winning.

377
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:21,700
What are you talking about?

378
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,279
Aunt, it's nothing.

379
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,519
Have some fruit later.

380
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,912
Please take a seat, Aunt.

381
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,599
Why haven't you touched your meal at all?

382
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,799
It was just served.

383
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
You were too busy chatting, right?

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,639
The doctor said you need to rest well.

385
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,240
And eat properly.

386
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,300
No more talking, just eat quickly.

387
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,344
Okay.

388
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,480
Uncle, please eat.

389
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,440
With Aunt here with you, I'll head back first.

390
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
Okay.

391
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay.

392
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,720
Xiaoman,

393
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,040
you don't come back often.

394
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,020
Go out and have some fun with your friends.

395
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,104
Don't just stay at home.

396
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,279
Okay, I'll go back first then.

397
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,279
Be safe.

398
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,759
What were you talking about behind my back?

399
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,808
Nothing much.

400
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
But when I came in, you two stopped talking.

401
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,319
You told me

402
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,240
that the doctor has said

403
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,079
that I should eat well.

404
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,799
It would be good
if you could listen to the doctor.

405
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,279
I don't necessarily listen to the doctor.

406
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,359
I'll listen to you.

407
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Take a small bite.

408
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,839
Don't choke yourself.

409
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,079
Open your mouth, slowly.

410
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:12,928
Boss.

411
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,119
Why are you wandering around here?

412
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,960
On-site inspection.

413
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,160
There's a Chunxin market nearby, right?

414
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
Yes, just go in there.

415
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,640
And you?

416
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,640
I just went to the hospital
to bring my uncle his meal.

417
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,336
Mr. Ke.

418
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,279
Xiaoman is also here.

419
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
You two seem to have a lot of free time lately.

420
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,640
That's true.

421
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,360
You haven't had any free time before

422
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,000
but only gotten some leisure time now.

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why don't you get in my car
and I'll show you around?

424
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
How is your project doing?

425
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,839
Thanks to you, everything is underway.

426
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,500
Then when you have time,

427
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,599
take me for a visit.

428
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,260
Well, let's make it happen today.

429
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,680
Now, let's go. Get in the car.

430
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,592
Let's go.

431
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:05,152
Mr. Liu.

432
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,040
Mr. Liu.

433
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,960
Mr. Liu.

434
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,680
I want to talk to you more.

435
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,940
Li, haven't I told you?

436
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,960
It's no use coming to me.

437
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
These are all corporate decisions.

438
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
If you have time to look for me,

439
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
you might as well go back

440
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and take care of your equipment.

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,219
Perhaps you could sell it for a good price.

442
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,620
Mr. Liu, wasn't everything agreed upon before?

443
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,720
You invest,

444
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,100
and I'm responsible
for expanding production and building.

445
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,220
You can't

446
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,620
withdraw halfway through.

447
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,179
You are the one who ruined our factory.

448
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,760
And now you want us
to pay three times the compensation.

449
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,799
Are you even human?

450
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,600
Let's talk nicely.

451
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,664
We'll talk about it later.

452
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:39,904
See?

453
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,799
This is the mess you left behind.

454
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,580
I'll handle it first.

455
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,824
Let's do it another day.

456
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:48,832
Another day.

457
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,128
Boss.

458
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,660
What's the matter?

459
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,400
You wanna stay and help out with the issue?

460
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,824
Serves you right.

461
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,420
This is the situation

462
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,880
my uncle least wants to see.

463
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,480
That's because they're willing
to believe in someone like Liu Shang.

464
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
It may also be that what capital pursues

465
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,000
is in conflict with porcelain-making.

466
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,359
All the conflicts and contradictions
in the world

467
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,340
can be resolved.

468
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,480
It depends on our effort.

469
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,799
Come with me to the market if you're free.

470
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:28,288
Over there.

471
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm begging you, Mr. Liu.

472
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,940
Li, don't beg me.

473
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,620
If I help you, who will help me?

474
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,700
Let's just do everything according
to the contract, alright?

475
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,560
Mr. Liu, it's not that.

476
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,280
Mr. Liu.

477
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,440
Don't beg him.

478
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,500
Mr. Liu.

479
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,680
What a cruel man.

480
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,920
You're quite influential.

481
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,980
Me? I don't have any influence.

482
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,400
It's my uncle.

483
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Everyone respects him greatly.

484
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,680
Just like what you said before,

485
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,279
the sense of responsibility of a tomb keeper?

486
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
That's part of the reason.

487
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,039
That's why

488
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,440
a lot of people are willing to follow him.

489
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,599
Only guarding, not opening.

490
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,420
The value of the tomb

491
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,720
will forever be buried under the yellow earth

492
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,296
with no one to appreciate it.

493
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,408
Isn't that a pity?

494
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,088
However,

495
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,660
take my investment this time for example.

496
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,559
There are also many complex reasons.

497
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Over the years,

498
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,820
actually, besides Uncle Ma,

499
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,880
many people have also told my uncle

500
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,699
about investing to expand the scale.

501
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:37,760
He refused them all.

502
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,160
But as you know.

503
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,400
Capital is now a double-edged sword.

504
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,640
Perhaps

505
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
the blade of that sword often thrusts towards

506
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,880
what he considers most important, I guess.

507
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,759
Li.

508
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,319
Xiaoman, take a look.

509
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:11,100
Recently,

510
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,500
you've gotten a lot of good stuff.

511
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,160
Yes, all these are my latest works.

512
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,740
Just focus on your job when you're at work.

513
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,860
After changing to a new environment,

514
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,039
everything starts anew. Don't worry about me.

515
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,799
Can you help me

516
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,020
courier your stuff here

517
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,380
to another place?

518
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,400
Certainly, no problem.

519
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,120
This one.

520
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,176
This one?

521
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,920
Good choice. It's one of my favorite pieces.

522
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,248
Especially good.

523
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,200
Okay, I'll send you the address later.
I'll take this one.

524
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,319
Then I'll wrap it up for you first.

525
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,839
Auntie, I've returned to my hometown.

526
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,740
I've picked out a small gift for you and uncle.

527
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,280
I'll send it over in a couple of days.

528
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,079
You must take care of your health.

529
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:04,800
Your auntie?

530
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:07,520
Parents of a friend.

531
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,599
It's no easy

532
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,920
to make a sincere friend.

533
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,720
My friend has passed away.

534
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,599
So I try my best to help her

535
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,319
take care of her parents.

536
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:28,064
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,888
It's okay.

538
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,400
You're thinking of Liu Shang?

539
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:40,720
Yes.

540
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,380
Just don't think about people like him anymore.

541
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,700
I'm your good friend.

542
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,824
The sincere kind.

543
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,240
And also

544
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:49,900
Xie Junyao.

545
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,880
I can tell that you guys
are also good friends, right?

546
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,039
You're classmates?

547
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Friend, let's go.

548
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,200
Li.

549
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Please pack it up for me.

550
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,880
- I'll send you the address later.
- Okay.

551
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,260
- Send me the price.
- All right.

552
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,559
- Bye.
- Bye, take care.

553
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,680
This place surely can't compare with Beijing.

554
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,980
There aren't many places to go at night.

555
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,096
But here,

556
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,880
in recent years,
it has become popular with young people.

557
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,544
This place is quite good.

558
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,112
Is it okay?

559
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,120
Thank you.

560
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,319
Enjoy your meal.

561
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,344
Thank you.

562
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,232
Come on.

563
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,359
Thank you for accompanying me
to so many places today.

564
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,680
Of course, it's the host's duty.

565
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:34,400
Chen Xiaoman.

566
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,400
Ling Xiao.

567
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,480
When did you come back?

568
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,500
I've only been back a few days.

569
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,519
What are you doing here?

570
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,460
I'm here with Chuchu and Lu Yi.

571
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,200
Chuchu, Lu Yi, look who's back?

572
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,439
Who is it?

573
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,640
Chuchu, Lu Yi.

574
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,544
Xiaoman.

575
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,839
Chen Xiaoman.

576
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,040
How have you lost so much weight?

577
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,500
I can hardly recognize you.

578
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,780
Not really.

579
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,100
Let me introduce you.

580
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,160
These three are my childhood friends.

581
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,320
We grew up together since we were kids.

582
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,440
Ling Xiao, Lu Yi, and Chuchu.

583
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,479
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.

584
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

585
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,359
- Hello.
- This is my friend from Beijing, Ke Yan.

586
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,799
How about we sit together and join tables?

587
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay, let's join a table, come on, come here.

588
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,079
- Sure, sure.
- Let's go grab some stools.

589
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:24,768
Old friends.

590
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,640
Played together since childhood.

591
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
But since I went to Beijing,

592
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,680
we haven't kept much in touch.

593
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,519
It's really been a long time since we've met.

594
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,400
And you brought food over, come on.

595
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,696
Come on, come on.

596
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,224
Xiaoman.

597
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,680
How is it, made big money in Beijing, right?

598
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,599
What big money? Just working hard.

599
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,360
Xiaoman, let me tell you.

600
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,380
This guy just moved

601
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,780
into a 200 square meter studio.

602
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,039
Can you believe it?

603
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,540
He's an artist now.

604
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,599
We shall call him Mr. Ling.

605
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,496
Really?

606
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,479
That's all thanks
to the government supporting us craftsmen.

607
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,780
Stop, stop talking about me, here.

608
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,920
Let's have a drink, come on.

609
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,020
Welcome new friends, welcome Xiaoman back home.

610
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,119
Thank you.

611
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,559
But the government is willing to fund you

612
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,600
means your products

613
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
have significant market recognition.

614
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,039
How come?

615
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,040
You're not taking in some capital to expand?

616
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,340
Bro, you don't know.

617
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,660
Here with us,

618
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,039
capital has brought down many big brands.

619
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,219
That Shanhai Porcelain Factory
of Li Jihai's family

620
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,600
has been shut down for half a month.

621
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,744
It's on the verge of closing down.

622
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,376
A few months ago,

623
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,280
they aggressively bought equipment
and hired workers.

624
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,940
That made Jihai's dad so happy.

625
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,080
It was all thriving.

626
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,199
Jihai even thought

627
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,900
that when he took over the factory,

628
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,439
it might become a well-known brand.

629
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,580
Once the capital realized
it wasn't turning over,

630
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,599
they suddenly pulled out.

631
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,440
They even made Jihai's family pay compensation.

632
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,240
How is that possible?

633
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,900
They even wanted to take everything to go?

634
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,080
They're so shameless.

635
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
Exactly.

636
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
Jihai's family had to sell their house.

637
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,380
So I think,

638
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,900
the porcelain business,

639
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,640
we should keep it clean.

640
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,580
Come, let's toast to Mr. Ling.

641
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,599
No, no, no, don't embarrass me.

642
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,900
Come, have a look.

643
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,000
My studio, feel free to look around.

644
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,980
Awesome.

645
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,520
Come on, Chuchu, show her around.

646
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,680
Sure.

647
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:41,599
Can I take photos?

648
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,039
Yes, take as many as you like.

649
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,984
This is pretty.

650
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,160
This is hand-painted.

651
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,880
Did you write this?

652
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,799
I didn't write it.

653
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,200
But I did fire it.

654
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,440
Not a bad craft.

655
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,184
Awesome.

656
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,440
Your friend really knows my stuff.

657
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,952
How's it going?

658
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Beautiful, isn't it?

659
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:22,848
Beautiful.,

660
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,640
The first time I laid eyes on it

661
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,000
my expression was exactly like yours

662
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,480
I thought to myself at that time,

663
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
how could the ancients

664
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,700
turn this heavy and turbid clay

665
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,519
into something so crystal clear?

666
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,416
May I take a look?

667
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,460
Sure, just be gentle.

668
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,480
Got it.

669
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,240
It's so pretty.

670
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:46,599
Boss, look.

671
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,480
It's translucent under the light.

672
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,792
Take me to see the casting room, okay?

673
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:50,840
What?

674
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,900
Want to move your little workshop over here?

675
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,080
What else?

676
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,140
Let's go.

677
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,279
Mind-blowing.

678
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Take your time looking.

679
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I heard from your friend

680
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,839
that your uncle got sick
and is in the hospital.

681
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,576
Which hospital?

682
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,680
I think I can

683
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
ask some friends to help manage things for him.

684
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,120
Boss, you sure have a lot of friends.

685
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,299
However,

686
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,880
my uncle has already had his surgery
and is about to be discharged.

687
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,039
So no trouble for you then.

688
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
So cute and lovely.

689
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,880
Isn't it cute?

690
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,359
Cute, I'll take a picture for you.

691
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:34,559
That was not easy for me.

692
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,079
Kid, be careful.

693
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,160
Am I out of work, or am I okay?

694
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,519
You do, you do, but…

695
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,920
It's all good, the dish will be ready soon.

696
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,240
Shanhai Porcelain Factory.

697
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,079
Mr. Li Chongshan.

698
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:02,816
Who are you?

699
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,720
Hello, I'm Ke Yan.

700
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,960
I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.

701
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,008
I'm here to ask

702
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,199
about the current situation
of Shanhai Porcelain Factory.

703
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,320
The initial cooperation plan

704
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,119
between Yaosheng and Juhe
with the local porcelain factory

705
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
was brought up by me.

706
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,560
Wang, come on, make way.

707
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,712
Come on, Mr. Ke.

708
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,504
Please sit down.

709
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:37,248
Hello, Mr. Ke.

710
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,848
Come.

711
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,400
How did you come here?

712
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,544
What's the matter?

713
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,359
Could you please explain

714
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,280
the current situation
of Shanhai Porcelain Factory in detail?

715
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,048
Not good.

716
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,936
Initially,

717
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,159
Mr. Liu came to us,

718
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,479
saying that they would invest

719
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:09,719
for us to expand production.

720
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,448
In the first three months,

721
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,679
they made the initial payment promptly.

722
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,000
Although the production quota
was set a bit high,

723
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,440
we found an external factory

724
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,559
and workers to help us.

725
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,240
All of these have been completed.

726
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,720
But later on,

727
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,319
they wanted to

728
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,880
increase the production every month.

729
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,980
The down payment they made

730
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,360
was only enough
to buy some kilns and equipment.

731
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,260
These raw materials

732
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,060
and increased personnel wages

733
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,919
had to be advanced by us.

734
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,159
But as time went on,
we could no longer advance the funds.

735
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
These past two months, we failed

736
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,079
to complete the tasks due to lack of manpower.

737
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,599
Mr. Liu wanted to withdraw the investment

738
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,800
and hold us accountable.

739
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,840
Now the Shanhai brand

740
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,200
and our factory's workers

741
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,959
are all left with him.

742
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,719
We have no choice but come to this place.

743
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,199
Thanks to Chen.

744
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,700
Here I can still take a bit

745
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,880
of Jifeng's subcontracting orders.

746
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,520
Otherwise,

747
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
we really wouldn't know how to survive.

748
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,360
Chen?

749
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,520
Mr. Chen Huafeng from Jifeng?

750
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,632
Yes, Mr. Chen.

751
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You just mentioned

752
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,419
that the production capacity target

753
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,239
was ultimately barely achieved.

754
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,840
Well, since these goods have been sold,

755
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,159
you should have the funds to operate, right?

756
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
Not really.

757
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
When we initially
set the contract with Mr. Liu,

758
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,559
he also boasted

759
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,600
that we would handle the production,

760
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,840
and he could guarantee sales.

761
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,672
But later on,

762
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,079
you don't know, Mr. Ke.

763
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,000
Producing

764
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,639
such an item

765
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,639
requires five days of work.

766
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,840
Now, in order to rush the progress,

767
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,000
it must be completed within two days.

768
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,112
Like this,

769
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,159
can it be done well?

770
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,559
And how many people would be willing
to buy such a product?

771
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,960
I understand this principle.

772
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,200
But I,

773
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,319
somehow,

774
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,719
got obsessed.

775
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,039
The brand Shanhai

776
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,920
was built up during my father's time.

777
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,639
And it's about to be passed on to my son.

778
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,719
I really didn't expect

779
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
to be so confused and muddled.

780
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,800
And now it's about to be gone.

781
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,159
Mr. Ke, please help us.

782
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,760
I no longer have any connection with them now.

783
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:56,864
So I,

784
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
I'm not sure I can help you.

785
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,704
Mr. Ke,

786
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,079
please speak to Mr. Liu.

787
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,752
Even if

788
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,760
you could just say a few words
on our behalf in front of him.

789
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,079
Three times the compensation

790
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,880
would be the end of us.

791
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,119
Boss,

792
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,119
didn't we agree that I would be the host?
How come you arrived first?

793
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,960
Haven't we always talked
about getting together?

794
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,880
Then let's take our seats. Come on.

795
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,220
Waiter, come, bring the menu please.

796
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,264
Just a moment.

797
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,800
Actually, I came today to clarify something.

798
00:39:00,224 --> 00:39:01,248
Sir.

799
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,008
Bring it here.

800
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,920
Let me have a look first.
I'll call you if I need anything.

801
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,056
Alright.

802
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,339
Boss, is there something you need?

803
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,559
Just tell me, feel free to instruct.

804
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:43,776
I did some research

805
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,599
on Shanhai Porcelain Factory.

806
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,639
Given its current situation,

807
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
it cannot afford the compensation
in the contract.

808
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
The initial bet conditions
were written so strictly

809
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,360
just for

810
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,519
the absolute safety of the investment.

811
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,320
But the operation of Shanhai Porcelain Factory
during this period

812
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,519
has covered the original investment amount.

813
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,960
I addressed you as 'boss'

814
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,840
is based on our past

815
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,736
interactions.

816
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,000
But you shouldn't think

817
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,380
that I'm obliged to listen to you

818
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,639
tell me how to do things.

819
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,000
They just failed
to meet the production capacity for two months.

820
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,559
When withdrawing, they also cut losses in time.

821
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,320
The workers, the brand,

822
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,199
you already have them in your hands.

823
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,679
There's no need to utterly destroy them.

824
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,320
To utterly destroy them?

825
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,039
Are you kidding?

826
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,239
Let's talk about the contract.

827
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,239
You set it before you left.

828
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,039
Even if they have endless reasons,
they're still in breach of contract

829
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm reasonably
and legally defending my interests.

830
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,119
Am I wrong?

831
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,599
- You're not wrong
- Then if not me, who is wrong?

832
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,320
The Li family has managed the factory
for three generations here,

833
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,840
and have accumulated
certain connections and reputation.

834
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,720
If you really want to trample them underfoot

835
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
to the point where they can't get back up,

836
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,760
it'll not be of any help

837
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,719
to any of your future developments.

838
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,879
Moreover, the Li family

839
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,760
is currently subcontracting for Jifeng.

840
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,559
Your generous forbearance

841
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,639
can also leave a good impression on Jifeng.

842
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,760
I have followed you for so many years.

843
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,679
Do you think when it comes to social niceties,

844
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,960
I still need you to teach me?

845
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,568
However,

846
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,360
what I like the least is your obstinacy.

847
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,800
Everything is from your rationale

848
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,344
and logic.

849
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,119
Such a big project.

850
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,960
Shanhai Porcelain Factory,

851
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,800
just let it go with a flick of your wrist?

852
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,400
But,

853
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,119
Ke Yan, are you pleading with me

854
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
or assigning work to me?

855
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,199
I'm not your boss anymore.

856
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,039
Nor do I have any right to assign you any work.

857
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,599
The original collaboration terms
and the contract

858
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,119
were all drafted by me.

859
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:25,719
It has come to this now.

860
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:28,736
It's my responsibility.

861
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:02,314
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

862
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:08,202
♫ I tell myself over and over,
