[Episode 4]

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
I have almost finished discussing
with everyone else.

4
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,120
Only Chen Xiaoman is left, maybe you'd do it?

5
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,599
Then I'll do it. Ask her to come.

6
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,768
This is the employment contract.

7
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,800
If there are no problems, please sign it.

8
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:16,320
What do you mean?

9
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,984
From today,

10
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,080
Ke Yan officially leaves Juhe.

11
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,759
But he wants you all to stay.

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,960
He has negotiated the salaries for you.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,080
Especially you, Chen Xiaoman.

14
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,439
Your salary is twice
as much as it was at Yaosheng.

15
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,680
That's what he said.

16
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,720
I might

17
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,879
not be as excellent as him,

18
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,328
but I think

19
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,680
we would make a good team.

20
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,759
He trusts you so much,

21
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,439
how could you say so after betraying him?

22
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,960

Chen Xiaoman.

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
I always thought you are sensible.

25
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,179
Whether at Yaosheng,

26
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,180
or at Juhe,

27
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,599
it's all the same to you.

28
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
You should understand

29
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,039
Juhe can give you

30
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,759
everything you want.

31
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,800
The boss has already

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
given me an advance on the project.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Are there any other procedures
required for resignation?

34
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,599
You are really committed to Ke Yan.

35
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,599
He might not be able to
stage a comeback this time.

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,800
When you see him, please tell him

37
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,400
to stop making himself suffer.

38
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,419
I don't know if he can stage a comeback,

39
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,440
but I know

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,580
there will never be anyone around you

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,220
who is totally committed to you.

42

He who uses the sword will die by the sword.

44
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,399
You're so proud to betray your friend.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
I don't know how you can do that.

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm not that foolish

47
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,120
to make friends in the workplace.

48
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,279
But everything you get now

49
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,360
is because he treats you like his best friend.

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,079
And now you've lost this friend,

51
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,600
I wonder how far you can go on your own.

52

53
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,088
Of course not.

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,620
I have the money.

186
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
I'll lend it to you to pay the debt.

187
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,680
No way.

188
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,279
- It's okay.
- No way.

189
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,060
You worked so hard to save that money.

190
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,240
Right, Chen Xiaoman?

191
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,879
What did I do?

192
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,039
I-I can't take this money.

193
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
Really.

194
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,000
There has to be a way.

195
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,720
There has to be a way.

196
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,219
- What way do you have?
- I don't know.

197
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,960
But there must be a way.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,579
But I can't take your money.

199
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,360
The money saved is also for spending.

200
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,500
Just take it to pay your debt.

201
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,760
Chen Xiaoman, no way.

202
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,240
There has to be a way.

203
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,480
There has to be a way.

204
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,840
I know it.

205
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,559
Go to bed now,

206
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,420
and I'll think of a way tomorrow.

207
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,480
Dun Ge.

208
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,544
Hello.

209
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,280
It's me.

210
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,540
No. You lent this to me,

211
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,939
and it's great.

212
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:29,980
I'll give it back to you.

213
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,160
Come on.

214
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,680
I didn't lend it to you, but give it to you.

215
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,260
The clothes are meant

216
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,599
to be worn.

217
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,880
I wouldn't be able to wear it anyway.

218
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,459
Look at all my clothes.

219
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,559
Think of it as taking my load off.

220
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:46,880
Alright then, thanks.

221
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,800
Well, when I get my bonus,

222
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,799
I'll take you on a trip with Gezi, okay?

223
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:54,432
Sure.

224
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
You've been saying so for so long,

225
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
but you never have that time.

226
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
This year.

227
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,880
Okay.

228
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,819
Whoever doesn't go is a puppy.

229
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:06,480
Well, that puppy definitely isn't me.

230
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:15,360
Xiaoman.

231
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,440
When you read this letter,

232
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,839
I must feel so sorry

233
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,759
in another world for leaving you

234
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,759
without saying goodbye.

235
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,839
Every moment spent with you all

236
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,559
has sustained me for a long time.

237
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,240
But please forgive me.

238
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,659
In the end, I don't have the courage

239
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,380
to hang on anymore.

240
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,640
Yuan Yuan, did you also study finance?

241
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,079
I studied accounting,

242
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,820
can't compare to Xiaoman.

243
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,460
She is a top student from a famous university.

244
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,039
I'm a merely accountant.

245
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,519
I can't make a name in Beijing.

246
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,480
Anyway, we will both rely on you.

247
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,720
In your eyes,

248
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,480
perhaps I am someone who is strong inside.

249
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,839
In fact,

250
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,759
it's all just a disguise for my cowardice.

251
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
I bought clothes that I wouldn't normally buy,

252
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,599
thinking

253
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,820
I could at least

254
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,559
be dignified once when I leave.

255
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,079
Change your outfit and get your luck.

256
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,319
Since you have a new chance,

257
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,480
you have to find a new way to live.

258
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,039
Look how beautiful you look now.

259
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,160
Just show them.

260
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,839
But leaving in such a cowardly way

261
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,440
is not dignified at all.

262
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,079
Until the day I gave you the clothes,

263
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,240
I felt relieved.

264
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,079
Because you really look good in them.

265
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Xiaoman.

266
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,079
I admire your confidence and courage.

267
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,240
So I hope you to take hope

268
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,216
and me

269
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,800
to live bravely,

270
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,640
making your life the way you aspire to.

271
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,500
I hope I can

272
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,359
have a home of my own in Beijing.

273
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,280
It'd be better

274
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,720
I could meet someone I love.

275
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,664
That's great.

276
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,240
In a couple of years,

277
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,119
when our jobs are stable in Beijing,

278
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,860
we can have more time.

279
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,000
By then, the three of us

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,799
can go watch movies,

281
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,559
or get our nails done.

282
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,480
We'll probably all be married later on.

283
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,480
By then,

284
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,839
our three families spend the holiday together,

285
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,820
making dumplings,

286
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,400
chatting about gossip,

287
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,920
and sitting on the sofa together.

288
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,319
So happy.

289
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,599
Although at that time, I did not know

290
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,119
what pushed Yuan Yuan to the abyss.

291
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,080
But if there's a chance,

292
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,519
I will definitely stop her.

293
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,559
Nothing is more precious than life.

294
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,839
Because every good thing

295
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,799
will turn into endless sadness

296
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,400
at the moment of despair.

297
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,456
I…

298
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:06,624
Mom.

299
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:34,880
Gezi.

300
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:38,112
Come in.

301
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,680
Come out. I have something to tell you.

302
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,000
About your debt,

303
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,279
I'll lend you the money.
You go pay it back first.

304
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:10,480
I said no.

305
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:13,440
Why bring it up again?

306
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,079
Can you manage to gather it in time?

307
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,359
When can you gather it?

308
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,359
Just do as I say. Let's deal with it this way.

309
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:35,648
Then…

310
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,519
What about your shares?

311
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
It has to be dealt with sooner or later.

312
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,559
A bit later is fine.

313
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,960
Don't worry.

314
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,600
Who am I? I am Chen Xiaoman.

315
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,920
I definitely have my way.

316
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
Both of us have to live well.

317
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,359
It's just the two of us now.

318
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,759
Whatever happens in the future,

319
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,759
you have to tell me first, okay?

320
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
When I'm not in Beijing,

321
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
remember to eat well on your own.

322
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,960
Of course.

323
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,799
Or all my good cooking would go to waste.

324
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,920
Good.

325
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:46,079
It's really decided?

326
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,939
Anyway, sooner or later,

327
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,319
I have to go home and face it.

328
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,720
So give me a date. When will you be back?

329
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
I'll go back first.

330
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,860
I'll let you know when I get back

331
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,960
once I decide it, okay?

332
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:03,744
Anyway,

333
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,840
both of us should live well

334
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,976
and be happy.

335
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,599
I don't want you to leave.

336
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,480
The gentle Yuan Yuan

337
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
shocked everyone

338
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,480
in the most drastic way.

339
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,000
What pushed her to leave this world?

340
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,920
Or didn't she find a reason to stay?

341
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,880
She said, apart from the heavy luggage

342
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,079
and the older age,

343
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,880
nothing left

344
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
or can be taken away.

345
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,759
I think so too.

346
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
In the past, I would cry

347
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,799
by seeing the clouds of the hometown

348
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,599
because I return with empty bags
and meaningless ambitions.

349
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,440
Only now do I understand,

350
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
what I most want

351
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,400
is the wind

352
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,000
and clouds of the hometown,

353
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,440
which can heal my soul.

354
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,799
Dad, have an orange. It's really sweet.

355
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,768
Come in.

356
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:54,848
Uncle.

357
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,039
Why are you here?

358
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,160
- Why bring so much stuff?
- Xiaoman, why are you here?

359
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,279
No need.

360
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,960
- Right.
- Let me have a look.

361
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,840
You're not eating well. You're skinny.

362
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,439
No, I'm still the same.

363
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,660
What about you? What's going on?

364
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,740
I heard you need surgery.

365
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,960
Who told you that?

366
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,559
It's a minor disease.

367
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,039
You don't need to come all the way back here.

368
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,820
You're so busy with work,

369
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,000
must have taken leave to come back, right?

370
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,740
No, I am not busy recently.

371
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,440
I came back once I heard you were sick.

372
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,144
I know you're busy.

373
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,160
I didn't think I'd see you
until Chinese New Year.

374
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,200
Don't stand there. Come on, sit.

375
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,300
Come on.

376
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,359
Sit here, sit here.

377
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,799
It's fresh.

378
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:39,520
You guys chat and eat.

379
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,376
I have something to do.

380
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,296
Tongtong has grown up.

381
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,140
Uncle, tell me.

382
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,280
What is going on?

383
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,419
Why the surgery?

384
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:54,639
What's the problem?

385
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,020
Have you checked it thoroughly?

386
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,088
Are you tired?

387
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,380
It's an old problem.

388
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,820
My heart feels a little uncomfortable.

389
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,519
It's a small surgery.

390
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,792
I told them not to call you

391
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:06,912
or tell you.

392
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:08,359
Look, what a fuss.

393
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,240
Alright, I shouldn't have kept it from you.

394
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,500
It's good that you're back.

395
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,339
Keep me company.

396
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:17,840
I miss you.

397
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,119
Aunt misses you.

398
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,480
Uncle, you really need
to take care of your body.

399
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,408
You're not in your 20s anymore.

400
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,496
- Is that so?
- Do you know?

401
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:27,839
I think I'm pretty good.

402
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:29,984
Naughty.

403
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:32,096
Uncle.

404
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,240
It just so happens that I'm back.

405
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,939
There's something I want to tell you.

406
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:37,984
Go ahead.

407
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,620
Yujian has told you before.

408
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,640
About my 500,000…

409
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,839
I know. I have asked someone about it.

410
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,500
The procedures are not complicated.

411
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,759
Just a few signatures will do.

412
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,119
Wait until I finish the surgery. Don't worry.

413
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
No, I don't worry.

414
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
Xiaoman.

415
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
I really want to compliment you.

416
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,160
Look, you've been working for just a few years

417
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,240
and could save up 500,000.

418
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,640
I mentioned you at a dinner

419
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,039
with a group of friends the other day,

420
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,180
all of my friends

421
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,599
admired you so much.

422
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,079
You are struggling alone in Beijing,

423
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,480
and never asking for money from home.

424
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:22,500
Xiaoman.

425
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,440
It doesn't matter if you make money or not.

426
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,500
None of us are by your side

427
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,632
and can't take care of you.

428
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,380
You need to take care of your own body.

429
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,480
Don't hurt yourself

430
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,559
or exhaust yourself.

431
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,048
Hear me?

432
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,096
Yes.

433
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,000
Here, have a slice of orange.

434
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,240
You also need to take good care
of your body, okay?

435
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,896
Very sweet.

436
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,104
- You taste it.
- Okay.

437
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,039
Is it the orange peeled by Tongtong?

438
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,920
It tastes a bit odd.

439
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,320
Who hit me?

440
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,039
Go, go, go! Hurry!

441
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:20,704
Is the orange tasty?

442
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,360
Pretty sweet.

443
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,359
But Uncle said the one you peeled
has an odd taste.

444
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:30,840
Why are you back?

445
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,960
Couldn't make it in Beijing anymore?

446
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,640
Let me ask you.

447
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,939
Uncle was in good health before,

448
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:42,519
why the sudden surgery?

449
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,039
How would I know?

450
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Hurry! What are you guys doing?

451
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,519
- Sister, my…
- You made him so?

452
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,599
Why do you ask me?

453
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,496
Don't you know?

454
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:00,480
What do I know? I don't know.

455
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,039
They argued over your shares again.

456
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,080
It's so annoying.

457
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,160
Give it back to me.

458
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,759
I died! It's all your fault.

459
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,500
Guys, it's not my fault.

460
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Someone snatched my phone.

461
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,559
Another round, hurry up.

462
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,380
Alright, you go home.

463
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,520
I'll keep watch tonight.

464
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,900
He wouldn't allow it.

465
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,080
Alright, you have a tough day,

466
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,120
hurry back and get some rest.

467
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,072
It's okay, I'll stay here.

468
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,800
Just go.

469
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,160
Go peel him an orange with no odd taste, okay?

470
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You two keep talking,
I'm going to play games, okay?

471
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,620
Go, go, go. Move it.

472
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,319
Hurry up!

473
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,000
Someone snatched my phone.

474
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,559
Come on, log in, hurry up.

475
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,359
Wait.

476
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,920
Wait.

477
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,144
Xiaoman, you're back.

478
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,279
Want some shaved ice?

479
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,384
No, thanks.

480
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Uncle Liu, are you playing chess?

481
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
You are back.

482
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,300
- Xiaoman.
- Going out?

483
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,408
Going out.

484
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,119
Aunt Zhang.

485
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,300
Xiaoman, come and visit us when you have time.

486
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,384
Okay.

487
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,920
You are fat.

488
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,920
Hua.

489
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,719
- Hua, you've gotten so fat.
- Xiaoman.

490
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:58,112
Aunt Xu.

491
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,100
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,260
It was a last-minute decision.

493
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,360
Let me have a look.

494
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,339
You have lost weight.

495
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,160
Stay for a few more days.

496
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
I will make you some delicious food.

497
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,939
No means no.

498
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:12,000
Aunt.

499
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,780
Have a chat with your aunt.

500
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,900
I'll go make you some food.

501
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,968
Just like that.

502
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:17,520
Aunt.

503
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,980
Xiaoman, why did you suddenly come back?

504
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,080
It was a last-minute decision.

505
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,599
You should inform us,

506
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,180
so I can pick you up.

507
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,880
No need. I wanted to give you a surprise.

508
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,800
It really is a surprise.

509
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,039
Xiaoman, I have to go to the hospital.

510
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,840
Your uncle has surgery.

511
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,199
I know. I just went to see him.

512
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,140
Xiaoman.

513
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,159
You are still obedient and sensible.

514
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,360
How is it? Doing well in Beijing, right?

515
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
Pretty good.

516
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,679
You didn't come back
for Chinese New Year last year.

517
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,800
You must be busy with work.

518
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,400
It's okay.

519
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,879
No matter how busy,
you have to take care of your body.

520
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:59,079
Being young doesn't mean you don't get sick.

521
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,312
I understand.

522
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:03,480
Ms. Xu.

523
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,760
Get things ready

524
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
and make something nice for Xiaoman.

525
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm on it. Don't worry.

526
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:11,936
I'll take a call.

527
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:16,256
Hello.

528
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:19,456
Mr. Yin.

529
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,599
You know

530
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,039
Jifeng never has surplus stock on hand.

531
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,199
No matter how high the price you offer,
it would only put me in a dilemma.

532
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,539
Old Chen is still in the hospital.

533
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:34,960
You know him.

534
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:37,248
Exactly.

535
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:41,984
Alright, alright.

536
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,279
When he is discharged,

537
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,000
I'll invite you over to my place.

538
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,776
You'd give him a good talking.

539
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,840
Okay, I'll ship the goods to you tomorrow.

540
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:56,832
Got to go.

541
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,220
Xiaoman, I'm not going to eat with you.

542
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,639
I have to go to the factory.

543
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,960
Are you so busy that you're skipping meals?

544
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,159
It's the high season.

545
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,480
Mostly I eat in the factory.

546
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,480
Then, Yaoyao. Is Yaoyao at home?

547
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
Yaoyao has graduated from college.

548
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,559
She's gone traveling with her classmates.

549
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,420
Xiaoman, if you have time,

550
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,940
give Yaoyao a call

551
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,460
and ask her when she comes back.

552
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,039
I asked her and she didn't even talk to me.

553
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,792
Okay.

554
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,879
Xiaoman.

555
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:34,239
You are the most sensible
and capable person in this family.

556
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,680
Help me talk to

557
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,119
your younger brother and sister sometime.

558
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,880
Okay, don't worry. I'll talk to them.

559
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,500
Okay then, enjoy your meal. I'm leaving.

560
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,559
Okay.

561
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,159
Aunt, remember to eat something.

562
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,184
Got it.

563
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:41,888
Yujian.

564
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,199
You don't even tell me that you come back.

565
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,320
You don't care about me.

566
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,340
I want to give you a surprise.

567
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,359
Alright, come on out.
See you at the usual place.

568
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,416
Okay.

569
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:11,700
Uncle Zhang.

570
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,896
Xiaoman.

571
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,664
♫ Empty myself, quietly recording fatigue ♫

572
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:21,184
♫ How much longer must I wait to withdraw ♫

573
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:24,448
♫ Constantly questioning what I want ♫

574
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:29,760
Is it hot?

575
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,424
It's okay.

576
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,500
Go.

577
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,568
Let's go.

578
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,392
Let's go for a drive.

579
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:43,744
♫ The lake surface shimmering ♫

580
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:44,992
♫ I saw it ♫

581
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:47,456
♫ Twinkling in the darkness ♫

582
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,520
It's much more lively here
than it was two years ago.

583
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,960
Many shops on Linjiang Road have moved here.

584
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,180
Those that haven't moved

585
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,340
have all opened branches here.

586
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,440
Xiaoman, you are back.

587
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,120
Okay, you go ahead.

588
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,128
I'm leaving.

589
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,599
Have you gone to see Uncle?

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,840
He has a heart stent surgery in two days.

591
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,079
Although the technology has advanced,

592
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,800
I'm still a bit worried.

593
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,519
You have a lot on your mind.

594
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,480
It's not just about that, right?

595
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:19,520
The matter about the shares?

596
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,000
Uncle asked me to hurry up
with the shareholding procedures.

597
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,519
Isn't it a good thing?

598
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,919
Isn't that what you've been saving money

599
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,280
for?

600
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,000
I lent the money to a friend.

601
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:39,280
I wanted to tell him today,

602
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,520
but seeing how happy he was,

603
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,719
I couldn't tell him.

604
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,248
How much is missing?

605
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,280
More than 200,000.

606
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:52,980
I'll lend you some.

607
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,080
No need.

608
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,239
It's not just about the money.

609
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,400
What else are you worried about?

610
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:04,832
Your Aunt?

611
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,280
Why are you thinking so much?

612
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
These shares belong to Master,

613
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
and they should be yours.

614
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,880
Others can't meddle in your family affairs,

615
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,904
but they are all watching.

616
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,480
How she treats you determines
what kind of person she is.

617
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,960
If she can't figure it out at her age,

618
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,140
she's not your Aunt then.

619
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,400
Just rest assured.

620
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:59,274
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

621
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:05,162
♫ I tell myself over and over,
I must not fear ♫

622
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:11,221
♫ When nothing here goes my way ♫

623
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:16,537
♫ Where should I come from
and where should I go ♫

624
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:23,055
♫ When I dream of your figures once again ♫

625
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,122
♫ I find I no longer cry like I used to ♫

626
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:34,570
♫ I learned to control my emotions ♫

627
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,610
♫ And how to be alone ♫

628
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,179
♫ Facing the wind and rain in this world ♫

629
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:47,210
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

630
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,290
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

631
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,706
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

632
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:58,890
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

633
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,884
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

634
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,770
♫ Embracing my body ♫

635
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:10,731
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

636
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:13,642
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

637
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:17,393
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

638
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:23,882
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

639
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:32,406
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫

640
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:45,836
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

641
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,010
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

642
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,618
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

643
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:57,898
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

644
00:43:57,898 --> 00:44:01,499
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

645
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:05,080
♫ Embracing my body ♫

646
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,130
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

647
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,106
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

648
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:15,821
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

649
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:22,794
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

650
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:30,602
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫
