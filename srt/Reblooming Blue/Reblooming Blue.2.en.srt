00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,959
Please sign my resignation letter quickly.

5
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:17,080
I disagree.

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Then give me back the Yuyao project.

7
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,919
This is decided

8
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,848

If you really have to leave,

18
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:48,160
that's fine.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,479
But no member from your team

20
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,719

21
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,480
Why not?

22
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,199
You are resigning with malice.

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
I won't stop you if you leave.

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240

I hope you reconsider it.

No, I just got here.

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,639
Didn't expect you to go for a direct hire.

39
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't think it's clear over the phone.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,159
It's better to talk in person.

41
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,679
I told you over the phone

42
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,792
about my salary at my last job.

43

Actually,

I don't have any more demands.

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,599
Actually, there are no secrets
in a big company like Yaosheng.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,959
I don't intend to hide anything.

47
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,199
It's just that I feel I need
to clarify this matter.

48
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,240
It would involve other people.

Isn't that just above Yaosheng's floor?

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,240
Well, is it not good
to have them look up to me?

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,840
The cost of being looked up to is a bit high.

70
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,900
After the project is successful,
you won't think it's high.

want to come over.

How should I reply to them?

74
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,680
Tell them not to be impulsive.

75
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,240
The HR department of Yaosheng won't let
them off easily if they resign abruptly.

76
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,759
In the end, they won't even get
a bonus or a commission.

77
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,399
Those with families should wait a bit.

Wait until they get what they are supposed to.

00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:13,888
that leaving Yaosheng,

188
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,519
we will only live better.

189
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Be a man before you do things.

190
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,799
In being a man, first come the dynamics.

191
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,000
Have you ever thought

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,860
if the two of us go to jail together,

193
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,120
there would be nothing left.

194
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
But if only one of us goes to jail,

195
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,000
the other one can still prosper.

196
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,140
Think about it,
you're just a junior accountant.

197
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,320
If you go to jail, in a few years,
you'll be out, right?

198
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,440
When you come out, you'll still have me.

199
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,140
I would have built up the company by then.

200
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,920
Whenever you want to work, just come.

201
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,339
If you don't want to work,

202
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,020
just stay at home.
I will provide for you always.

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,136
You still have me.

204
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:15,440
You mean,

205
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,679
you want me to go to jail for you?

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
I don't want to either.

207
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,232
Xiang Shang,

208
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,960
listen to me, stop this.

209
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,879
About this energy storage project,

210
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,440
you can't be greedy for the money anymore.

211
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,080
Let's return all the money.

212
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,984
Let's turn ourselves in

213
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,840
to strive for leniency.

214
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,960
We'll bear any consequences together.

215
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,559
No way, why should I?

216
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm not going.

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,559
The money is already being watched.

218
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,800
It's a trap.

219
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,120
Why can't you see this is an abyss?

220
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
Why are you still taking such risks?

221
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,240
I want to give you the best.

222
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
I want to marry you with glory.

223
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:12,832
But

224
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,500
I don't need these that much.

225
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,840
But I need it. I'm a man, baby.

226
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
I must give you the best.

227
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,519
Otherwise, what kind of man am I?

228
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Look, if we talk about our meager wages,

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,280
I have to save, until when?

230
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,799
I'd have to save until the cows
come home to afford a house.

231
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,720
This is the only way for us.

232
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,039
If I can't even provide these things for you,

233
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,960
if I can't do that, I don't deserve you.

234
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
I'd rather we break up.

235
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,240
Everyone, time is pressing.

236
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,959
I hope everyone can quickly
introduce themselves.

237
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,960
Before knowing yourself,
you can also understand each other.

238
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,959
What kind of problems
we may encounter in the future.

239
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,039
Whether you can solve them
and how the team can help you.

240
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,960
All the time wasted here

241
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
should be spent
on meaningful and valuable things.

242
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,024
Let's start.

243
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,560
I am Wang Hao, a graduate student
in applied mathematics.

244
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,419
Previously, I conducted research
on model theory in the institute.

245
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,200
But I don't want to become an old scholar.

246
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
I want to apply it in practice.

247
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,360
If anyone needs me,

248
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,540
feel free to contact me anytime.

249
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,620
I have intermittent sleep.

250
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,399
I can fall asleep immediately
after solving a problem.

251
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,100
Hello, everyone. I am Xu Shanshan,
with six years of experience.

252
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,840
After graduation, I worked for two companies.

253
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,720
Both involved in the investment
of the cultural industry chain.

254
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,440
I earned a master degree in Psychology.

255
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,060
I have a certificate
in psychological counseling.

256
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,088
I am relatively good at communication.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,380
Fang Xin, seven years in the profession.

258
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,739
I have some experience
with cross-border mergers and acquisitions.

259
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,159
I am currently studying for the Chartered
Financial Analyst certification.

260
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,480
My name is Lin Yang. I graduated from Shanghai
University of Finance and Economics five years ago.

261
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,100
I had been with Fengyuan Capital before.

262
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,279
I was the head of a project management office.

263
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,000
My name is Yang Xie, an analyst.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,520
What I do best is

265
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,919
finishing a meal within ten minutes.

266
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,639
Hello, everyone. My name is Chen Xiaoman.

267
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,699
Four years in the profession.

268
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,400
Previously worked
in the back office at Yaosheng.

269
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,559
Please give me your guidance.

270
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,120
Very good.

271
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,719
Before Juhe officially launches,

272
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,240
I think I should also introduce
myself to everyone.

273
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:16,120
My name is Ke Yan.

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,180
I believe those who work in this industry

275
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,200
have heard my name

276
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,320
and are clear about my team leadership style.

277
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,759
But today, I'm not going
to talk about any sentiments.

278
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
I just want to tell you

279
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,440
why I entered investment banking.

280
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,056
Because this industry

281
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,240
is one of the fastest industries
where you can truly

282
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,620
achieve financial leapfrogging

283
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,919
through your own efforts.

284
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,320
Juhe's founding team is all here.

285
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,159
I'm not keen on expanding the scale.

286
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,200
So I will not increase the number of people.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
But not expanding doesn't mean
I won't eliminate.

288
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,759
To be honest with you,

289
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,728
outside right now,

290
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,120
including my previous team,

291
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,159
are lining up waiting for me to nod and join.

292
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,240
All those who don't do well, leave.

293
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,820
All who remain here,

294
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,879
I hope you can all be multi-skilled.

295
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,639
Because for the same remuneration,

296
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,699
in other teams,

297
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,500
dozens of people in big companies share it.

298
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,519
But at Juhe,

299
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,120
only our group shares it.

300
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,880
Okay.

301
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:17,960
I guarantee

302
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,380
You can definitely earn multiple times

303
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,460
or even ten times
the remuneration of other teams.

304
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,840
In the future, all of our projects

305
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
one after another, keep on going.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,072
I want Juhe

307
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,960
to become the most unique presence
in the market.

308
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,220
I also want you

309
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,440
to be even more proud when meeting other teams.

310
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,112
Is that okay?

311
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,240
Some people are born to shine.

312
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,480
People like that are really needed
in adversity,

313
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,159
like lighting a lamp.

314
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,279
At that time, being by his side,

315
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,639
I would often be illuminated as well.

316
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,480
I even felt that I could also shine.

317
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,599
But later on I came to realize

318
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,359
that to shine, one had to burn oneself.

319
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:19,072
♫ Looking out the window,
my heart is getting misty ♫

320
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,008
♫ I still find it hard to express my feelings ♫

321
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,981
♫ Throughout these years ♫

322
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:33,120
♫ Whether my feelings for you
are as usual or love ♫

323
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:41,154
♫ Quietly wandering
without disturbing your ease ♫

324
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,740
♫ Let soliloquies sleep buried deep
in my heart ♫

325
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:55,498
♫ Even if in the end
there's no record of the years ♫

326
00:17:56,752 --> 00:18:03,104
♫ At least it won't make you sigh
over loneliness ♫

327
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,464
♫ I will be by your side ♫

328
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:10,054
♫ Swimming in your blue sea ♫

329
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:14,868
♫ Walking by your side, staying out of sight ♫

330
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,336
♫ Just gazing at your bloom ♫

331
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:21,166
♫ I will be by your side ♫

332
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,192
♫ So there's no need to say it out loud ♫

333
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:29,792
♫ Thus, I don't feel wistful
for the longest waits ♫

334
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,184
♫ As long as you and I understand ♫

335
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,439
Hello.

336
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,620
Hello, what's wrong?

337
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,020
Do you know in the suburbs,

338
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,020
there's a place called Wo-something,
a motorhome camping site?

339
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,960
Wo? Woye.

340
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,160
Woye.

341
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,279
Near that wetland park.

342
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,240
Gather at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

343
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,440
Prepare all ingredients
and bring along chefs and gifts.

344
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,420
For the gifts, help me choose some porcelain.

345
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,659
Buy some of various kinds.

346
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,728
Also, go to Mr. Xu's place.

347
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:30,819
Help me check

348
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:33,216
if there are any camping gears
that would interest children.

349
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,359
Purchase them all.

350
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,640
Okay, got it.

351
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,816
[WeChat]

352
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,000
Gather at Huamao
at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

353
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,599
Boss.

354
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,432
Give her a hand.

355
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:10,912
Thank you.

356
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,768
It's good I made it in time.

357
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,840
Chen Xiaoman, you're really something.

358
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,620
Your home is over ten kilometers
away from here.

359
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,799
Morning rush hour,
couldn't squeeze into the subway.

360
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

361
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Do you know where we are heading?

362
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,039
Motorhome, camping, Qin Xinmin.

363
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,696
We are going to meet Mr. Qin of Hesheng,

364
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,759
right?

365
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,640
The planning book for the project complex
won't be ready so soon.

366
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
At the earliest, it would be next Wednesday.

367
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,520
So in a situation where we have nothing,

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,039
we have to engage with others.

369
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,480
Isn't it a bit too hasty?

370
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
What is the most profitable way
in the finance industry?

371
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,216
Information gap.

372
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,400
Did you bring the computer and materials?

373
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,704
I brought everything.

374
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,160
Mr. Yan, could you slow down and wait for me?

375
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,180
What's the point of us chasing to this place?

376
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,500
There's no need for you
to say these useless things.

377
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,219
Think about what's wrong with your plan.

378
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,640
He didn't even look at my plan,
what could be wrong with it?

379
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,599
Maybe I'll find a time
to communicate with him again.

380
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,279
Boss, I won't go with you.

381
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,824
Wait for you to contact me.

382
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,359
Didn't hit, try again.

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
Good shot.

384
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,319
Come on, watch daddy shoot.

385
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:36,920
Hit it this time.

386
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,220
Old Qin, you've set up such a big stall.

387
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,839
You just want to tire me out.

388
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm just playing with the children.

389
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,220
Enjoying nature, you see.

390
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,720
I don't want to enjoy.

391
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,799
Come on, let's do it again.

392
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,599
Mr. Qin, it really is you.

393
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,080
- Ke Yan, how did you get here?
- Madam.

394
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,272
- Ke Yan.
- Come on.

395
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,119
Last night, I saw your wife's post on Moments.

396
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,960
Well,

397
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,279
I just wanted to go out for a drive.

398
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:07,980
Ke Yan,

399
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,540
you've seen my Moments post

400
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,600
and you even brought friends.

401
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,740
You're trying to tire me out.

402
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,799
Alone, I can't handle it.

403
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,099
I've brought someone to help you.

404
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,319
- Help me?
- Really.

405
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,740
This must be your wife.

406
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,100
You can cook, right?

407
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,340
Just in time to help my wife.

408
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,440
She can't manage.

409
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,200
Hello, Mr. Qin. Hello, Madam.

410
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm Mr. Ke's assistant.
My name is Chen Xiaoman.

411
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,640
Assistants have these skills now.

412
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,359
Mr. Qin, you're joking again.

413
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,536
Isn't Liu Shang here?

414
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:34,592
Hurry up.

415
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:35,960
Mr. Qin, Madam.

416
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,480
Look whom I've brought.

417
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,359
Chefs from a five-star hotel.

418
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,180
Tonight we can eat whatever we want.

419
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,400
- Okay?
- Good.

420
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
Come on, hurry and help out.

421
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,319
- Come on.
- Come on, Ke Yan, let's have tea here.

422
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,392
Okay.

423
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,359
Miss, can you play
with the remote control car with me?

424
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,599
Really not bad.

425
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Ke Yan,

426
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,160
it's like you've moved the museum here.

427
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No, I'm working on a project
at the Yuyao recently.

428
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,000
I have collected some pieces.

429
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't actually understand it.

430
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
Could give me some guidance?

431
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,559
This is a falangcai solo cup.
It's a kind of overglaze color.

432
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,200
It requires at least two firings.

433
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,200
To make such a cup,

434
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
it probably takes about half a month.

435
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Not every single one

436
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,079
can be fired with such beautiful colors.

437
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,568
Very good.

438
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:10,759
Quite beautiful.

439
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,960
You know a lot about porcelain, huh?

440
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,279
Not really, just a superficial understanding.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,880
Mr. Qin, Xiaoman is being modest.

442
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
She is from the Yuyao herself.

443
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,260
She studied ceramics as a child

444
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,380
and later studied finance.

445
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,440
So

446
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,860
her understanding of the development
of the porcelain industry

447
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,000
is based on her own set of insights.

448
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
Is that so?

449
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
Not bad, very exceptional.

450
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,800
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Qin.

451
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,919
Miss,

452
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,160
this red cup is so beautiful.

453
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,440
Is it glass?

454
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,160
It's not made of glass.

455
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,079
Alright, put it back quickly.

456
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,768
It's okay.

457
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:45,880
This one

458
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,939
is a cup made from porcelain.

459
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,880
It's fired from porcelain clay.

460
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Clay? Isn't clay yellow?

461
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,600
That's the magic of porcelain.

462
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,520
We take the porcelain clay, which is like soil,

463
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,640
and repeatedly knead and pound it.

464
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,439
Then shape it into one beautiful form
after another

465
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,059
and fire it in the kiln.

466
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,000
Look at this red color.

467
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,560
This red color is
a particularly difficult color to achieve.

468
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,360
It has iron mineral components inside

469
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,440
and requires a high temperature
of 1,300 degrees

470
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,079
to fire such a red color.

471
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,880
So, temperature is extremely important.

472
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:20,679
As for the people tending the kiln,

473
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,120
you can say that they

474
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,160
can't sleep at all.

475
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,540
They have to keep watch it all night long.

476
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,440
Does he never sleep?

477
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,020
Exactly, for the ceramic makers,

478
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,519
it's a rather tough aspect of the job.

479
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,060
Not every effort

480
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,380
results in success.

481
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,679
One must also accept every failure

482
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,680
and repeatedly start from scratch.

483
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,839
For porcelain makers,

484
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
time is fire.

485
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,720
Once the fire is lit,

486
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,079
time stands still.

487
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,740
It's so magical.

488
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,740
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

489
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,500
Alright, this is for you then.

490
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,779
Thank the lady.

491
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:56,980
Thank you, Miss.

492
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,048
You're welcome.

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,880
It's getting late. We should head back.

494
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,119
- Okay.
- You guys keep talking.

495
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,599
- Say goodbye to the gentleman and the lady.
- Bye.

496
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,080
- Bye.
- Good night.

497
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,168
Good night.

498
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,279
Come on, Mr. Qin, let's have tea.

499
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,472
Mr. Qin,

500
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,359
in fact, the Yuyao now

501
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,279
- needs some financial investment the most.
- Ke Yan,

502
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,960
I'm a bit tired today.

503
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,160
Let's not talk about work
since we're out to have fun.

504
00:27:28,224 --> 00:27:29,312
Okay.

505
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,900
Are you leaving today?

506
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,880
We've also rented an RV, the 17th.

507
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,000
Well-prepared enough.

508
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,160
Okay.

509
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,080
I'll get some rest first.

510
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,159
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Qin.

511
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,256
Good night.

512
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,319
Boss, just one RV, huh?

513
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,839
Remember to put away all these cups.

514
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,888
The 17th.

515
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,280
Ke Yan's been wholeheartedly trying.

516
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,860
He even followed you here.

517
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,179
You don't even give him a chance to speak.

518
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,200
Is that appropriate?

519
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,640
Should I have to respond
just because he puts on a self-pity act?

520
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,760
It's up to you.

521
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
I think that girl is quite cute.

522
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,048
What are you doing?

523
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,079
I-I'm not doing anything.

524
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
No, I'm…

525
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,080
Well, I'm thinking…

526
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,800
If I have to do it here,

527
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,620
will it affect you resting here?

528
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,160
It will definitely affect me. Go do it outside.

529
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,856
I need to rest for a while.

530
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,440
Tell me when you're done.
I'll adjust and revise it immediately.

00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,472
♫ But love can heal imperfections ♫

546
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:20,265
♫ To face it with you ♫

547
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,799
A big watermelon.

548
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,200
Cut it in half in the middle.

549
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,759
Half for you.

550
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,319
Half to give to him.

551
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,319
And the other half is mine.

552
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:43,136
♫ You want to be my best friend ♫

553
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,904
♫ If we meet again ♫

554
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:51,104
♫ I won't let you go ♫

555
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:56,800
♫ Don't linger or wait too long ♫

556
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:03,455
♫ I'll go with you ♫

557
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,680
Boss, you are awake?

558
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,599
I've finished it all.

559
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,799
I've been sitting for too long.

560
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,160
My butt and waist are a bit sore.
I'll move around a little.

561
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,540
Wait a second, I'll transfer the data

562
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,000
into PPT and that's it.

563
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,519
I'm quick, just ten minutes.

564
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:44,832
You've worked hard.

565
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,440
Not at all. It's what I should do.

566
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:56,300
Well, Boss,

567
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,279
actually, there's a question
I've been wanting to ask you.

568
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,088
Speak.

569
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,359
Do you think I can do well?

570
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,224
So far, you're doing fine.

571
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,279
If a person has

572
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,599
a wish in their heart that they must fulfill,

573
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,080
they will surely give it their all,

574
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,279
fighting with all their might to achieve it.

575
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,456
So,

576
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
what is your fervent wish?

577
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,192
Money?

578
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,776
At the moment, yes.

579
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,200
Cheer up.

580
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,079
I'll transfer the data right now.
It will be quick.

581
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,039
It's done, Boss. I've made the changes.

582
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,824
It's done.

583
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,260
Yan Su and his group did not succeed.

584
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,599
Do you think we can make it?

585
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,352
Stay calm.

586
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:46,800
Still working hard this late?

587
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,736
Mr. Qin, you haven't slept yet?

588
00:34:50,912 --> 00:34:52,039
The PPT is ready?

589
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,299
It's done.

590
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,320
Then tell me about it.

591
00:34:58,816 --> 00:34:59,840
Okay.

592
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,032
Mr. Qin,

593
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,079
this project will be

594
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,639
the largest renovation project
of the Yuyao City for the coming year.

595
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,960
All the industrial parks

596
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
are all personally overseen
by the city leaders.

597
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,020
It is now entrusted

598
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,239
to a very capable local private enterprise
to manage.

599
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,560
Two investment companies
have already discussed with them.

600
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
But during this process,

601
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,200
there are still some issues
that cannot be resolved,

602
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,840
such as the timing of the funding.

603
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,639
I have the funds,

604
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,039
but I need to understand this project first.

605
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,424
Okay.

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,800
Then I'll ask Xiaoman to give you
a presentation on the project proposal.

607
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:42,752
It's like this.

608
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,220
Now, in the Yuyao,

609
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,539
many of the porcelain drifters
actually aren't locals.

610
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:54,940
A portion of the people

611
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,000
have even never been exposed

612
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,460
to the field of porcelain-making.

613
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,264
They are rooted in Yuyao solely out of passion.

614
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,619
These individuals are not very large in scale.

615
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,060
But when gathered together,

616
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,180
they can create a tremendous energy.

617
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,940
So the future plan

618
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,720
to achieve an annual income of ten billion yuan

619
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,519
is actually achievable.

620
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,240
Apart from what Xiaoman just mentioned

621
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,239
about the profit of ten billion yuan
in annual income,

622
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,139
the entire project is currently

623
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:19,180
planned to transform into a clustering type,

624
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,980
large-scale, high-grade, full-service,

625
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,719
and well-supported industrial park.

626
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,320
We have also conducted a survey.

627
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,920
The number of tourists
visiting the Yuyao each year

628
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,039
exceeds fifty million.

629
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,719
Once the industrial park
is completed in the future,

630
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,559
the revenue brought by these numbers

631
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,639
is truly incalculable.

632
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,679
It does sound like a promising project.

633
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:45,440
In that case,

634
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,639
next week, let's go to the company.

635
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,320
We will proceed to the next stage

636
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,360
and discuss some specific demands
of each company.

637
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,752
Okay.

638
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
You've done a pretty good job with the PPT.

639
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:00,544
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

640
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
Just now, my wife was complimenting you
for being cute.

641
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,880
She said seeing you guys striving

642
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,140
reminded us of the past

643
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,760
when we first started our business.

644
00:37:12,992 --> 00:37:14,079
Working late nights was tough.

645
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,840
Remember to ask Mr. Ke for a bonus.

646
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,592
Your assistant is pretty good.

647
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,920
See you on Monday then.

648
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,592
See you on Monday.

649
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,448
I'll go to bed.

650
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,660
Mr. Qin, go to bed early.

651
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,712
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

652
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,840
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

653
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,939
But how did you guess

654
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:50,920
Mr. Qin would surely notice us?

655
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,579
A CEO of a listed company

656
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,160
does have this level of observation skills.

657
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,239
Do you think he doesn't know

658
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,344
the reason for our visit here?

659
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:01,088
I've learned it.

660
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,232
What have you learned?

661
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,056
To be very shrewd.

662
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,256
[Fortune Plaza Office Building A]

663
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,064
Do you know?

664
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,760
Yesterday, Xiaoman went
to see Mr. Qin with the boss.

665
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:22,879
Really?

666
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,199
What do you mean "really"?

667
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,400
I've seen her Moments.

668
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,200
I've also seen this Moments post.

669
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,360
This one here

670
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,980
is an RV camping site.

671
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,519
The kind where you can stay overnight.

672
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,140
Xiaoman is someone
Mr. Ke brought out from Yaosheng.

673
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,020
Definitely not like us

674
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,400
who joined halfway through.

675
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,120
So that's why

676
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,559
sometimes, luck is also a kind of strength.

677
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,139
Anyway, the boss said

678
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,320
as long as we did our job well

679
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,339
and got the money.

680
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,480
- Right.
- Right.

681
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,599
Everyone, let's get to work quickly.

682
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,920
But

683
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,599
we still have to treat Xiaoman well afterwards.

684
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,728
He's the smart one.

685
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,239
Stop, this is my dinner.

686
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,500
Alright, you're so cute.

687
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,576
Here.

688
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,480
Has Uncle Zhou left?

689
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,696
Didn't he feed you dinner?

690
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:53,480
Finished it so quickly?

691
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,240
None left, this is mine.

692
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
None left.

693
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
This is really the last piece.

694
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:09,599
Fellow.

695
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,440
There's really none left, look.

696
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,460
Look.

697
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,000
There's really none left.

698
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,224
I'm not lying to you.

699
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:17,320
I'm sincere.

700
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,719
There's really none left.

701
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,960
There's really none left.

702
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,048
What do you think of her?

703
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,480
Who? Chen Xiaoman?

704
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,239
I think she's pretty good.

705
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,559
You were the one who didn't let her
join the project team at first.

706
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,159
You thought

707
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,579
she was better suited
for doing backend work for us.

708
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:38,619
With her helping us ensure the data,

709
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,400
we could boldly move forward.

710
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,559
Looking at it this way,

711
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,599
it seems a bit unfair to her.

712
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,519
Is it because she's too idle

713
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,119
that she does things for others?

714
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,360
Not because she's too idle,

715
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,480
but because she needs money.

716
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,360
How much does she earn
in fixed salary every month?

717
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,360
Just over 10,000, at most 20,000.

718
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,720
But when she helped out at the company,

719
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,239
I heard she made 2,000 this time.

720
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,184
Calculating this,

721
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,920
I'm a bit envious of her.

722
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,679
Sounds like she has
quite a unique way of thinking.

723
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,040
Yes, indeed.

724
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
Chen Xiaoman

725
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,872
is worthy of a good position.

726
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,224
Let's go.

727
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:28,544
Bye-bye.

728
00:41:58,707 --> 00:42:02,355
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

729
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:08,243
♫ I tell myself over and over,
I must not fear ♫

730
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:14,302
♫ When nothing here goes my way ♫

731
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:19,618
♫ Where should I come from
and where should I go ♫

732
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:26,136
♫ When I dream of your figures once again ♫

733
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:33,203
♫ I find I no longer cry like I used to ♫

734
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:37,651
♫ I learned to control my emotions ♫

735
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,691
♫ And how to be alone ♫

736
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:45,260
♫ Facing the wind and rain in this world ♫

737
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:50,291
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

738
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,371
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

739
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,787
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

740
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:01,971
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

741
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:05,965
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

742
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:08,851
♫ Embracing my body ♫

743
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,812
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

744
00:43:13,812 --> 00:43:16,723
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

745
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:20,474
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

746
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:26,963
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

747
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:35,487
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫

748
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:48,917
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

749
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,091
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

750
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:55,699
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

751
00:43:56,595 --> 00:44:00,979
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

752
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:04,580
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

753
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,161
♫ Embracing my body ♫

754
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:12,211
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

755
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:15,187
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

756
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:18,902
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

757
00:44:19,987 --> 00:44:25,875
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

758
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:33,683
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫
