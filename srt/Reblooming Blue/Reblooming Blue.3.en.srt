[Reblooming Blue]

00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:36,084
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,719
Boss, you were looking for me?

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,599
Mr. Liu of Jingheng will arrive tonight.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,640
I will accompany him to meet Mr. Qin tomorrow.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You'd come too.

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,159
I'll go with you?

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Who else then?

9
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,239
No, no. I'm okay.

10
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,840
You're all from the Yuyao.

11
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,560
I want you to catch up with him
on behalf of the company

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,079
and build a closer relationship with him.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, when I see Mr. Liu,

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
I will certainly get along well with him.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,112
Do you have any formal outfit?

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,936
Formal?

17
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,360
Will this do?

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
Buy a whole set of outfit.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,199
A whole set

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
costs quite a bit.

21
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,792
It's not appropriate.

22
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,159
The costs

23
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,919
can be deducted from your bonus.

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,639
I'd better buy it myself.

25
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,919
Yuan, why hasn't Gezi come back yet?

26
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,319
She hasn't been back for two nights.

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,620
She has gone wild.

28
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,439
When she comes back, I have to talk to her.

29
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,319
Why are you trying on this late?

30
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,519
My boss said tomorrow is very important.

31
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,120
He wants me to dress up.

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,439
I wonder what it means.

33
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,639
No way. I can't make the decision.

34
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,240
Change your outfit and gain your luck.

35
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,504
Take it.

36
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,928
It fits you.

37
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,739
The expensive clothes

38
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,600
are quite different.

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
I've never worn anything this expensive.

40
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,600
How much does this cost?

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,399
Don't mind it. As long as it looks good.

42
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,680
Something is missing.

43
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,920
Wait.

44
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,096
It's new,

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
matches this outfit really well.

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,560
It's also your favorite color.

47
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,879
Since you have a new chance,

48
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,079
then you have to find a new way to live.

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,319
Look how beautiful you are now.

50
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,759
Just show them all.

51
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,000
Bro.

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,048
Bro.

53
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,539
Isn't the reason we came out of Yaosheng

54
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,020
to work on this Yuyao project

55
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,880
to earn some brokerage fee
and make a name for ourselves?

56
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Why did we change from a broker to an investor?

57
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,680
That's too big a risk.

58
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,040
The future development of the Yuyao

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,279
is definitely far beyond what we can see now.

60
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,680
The industrial park is just a chance.

61
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
For the bigger picture,

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
I must invest in it.

63
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,099
I'm talking about the risk.

64
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,160
In order to rent an office,

65
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,859
you've put up your house as collateral.

66
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,880
If this goes on,

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
you'd risk your property and your money.

68
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,079
You got the point.

69
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,040
That's the difference
between investment and business.

70
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,240
They're taking the risk, but we are…

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,128
amateurs.

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,580
There's no point in investing

73
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,736
only a few millions.

74
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,839
Listen.

75
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,279
If this project worth it,

76
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,439
I should risk everything I have.

77
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:13,376
Okay.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,260
Let's change the way we think about it.

79
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,759
To be honest,

80
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,279
we still haven't finished
a lot of paperwork yet.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,080
You are here.

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,519
Then we should take a break.

83
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:26,976
How?

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Yaosheng is now watching us.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,160
One step behind and I'll lose everything.

86
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,752
How can we take a break?

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,240
You insist, right?

88
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:21,216
Boss.

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm here.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,952
Boss, what's wrong?
Why did you shake your head?

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Didn't you ask me to dress up?

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,020
This is an expensive and formal outfit.

93
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,128
Don't you think it's okay?

94
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,839
This place is so beautiful.

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,784
Boss.

96
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,619
What a beautiful courtyard!

97
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,280
It has antique charm. Pretty nice.

98
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,720
Ke Yan really has good taste.

99
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,520
Mr. Liu.

100
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,539
Ke Yan.

101
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,632
Welcome.

102
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:58,920
- We meet again.
- Yes, yes.

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,576
- Welcome.
- Mr. Liu.

104
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:01,696
Xiaoman!

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,519
- It's really you.
- It's been such a long time.

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,139
I had dinner with your uncle the other day,

107
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,399
and he mentioned you.

108
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,740
I didn't go home for the New Year this year,

109
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,140
so I haven't seen my uncle in a while.

110
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,160
You.

111
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,580
Come on, let's talk inside

112
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,616
- to catch up.
- Okay.

113
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:16,660
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,859
- Please, please.
- Mr. Ke.

115
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:18,879
How time flies.

116
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,500
You've all grown up.

117
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,600
I've spent a lot of time
in Beijing over the years,

118
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,539
so I don't have time to go home and see uncle.

119
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,639
You should go home more often,

120
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,759
or we can't even recognize you.

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Here, everyone.

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559
Let me introduce you.

123
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,640
Xiaoman, my niece.

124
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,480
Her father founded Chen's Porcelain,

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,759
and her third uncle took over recently.

126
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,659
They have made Jifeng

127
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,060
one of the top brands in the industry today.

128
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,140
I'm a witness to this.

129
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,248
Hello.

130
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, hello.

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,840
Mr. Liu.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
I didn't know you two are so connected.

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,600
Well, rest assured.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,140
Xiaoman will follow this project
all the way through

135
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,680
to ensure the security
of your project investment.

136
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,799
Good.

137
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,699
Come on, let's have a toast.

138
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,240
- Here, I'll pour it for you.
- Alright.

139
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,559
Here, cheers.

140
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,624
Cheers.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,159
The air is so fresh outside.

142
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,960
No wonder you know so much about porcelain.

143
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,980
Not really.

144
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,200
I just grew up with it.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
My father has spent his lifetime
studying this, after all.

146
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm currently

147
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,839
Project Director for Juhe Investments,

148
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,080
Chen Xiaoman.

149
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,368
Boss.

150
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,320
There's something I really want to tell you.

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,159
Okay.

152
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,399
Boss.

153
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm really grateful

154
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,799
for your trust in me,

155
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
allowing me

156
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,679
to be your right hand.

157
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,519
I would do my best for you.

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,600
You…

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,699
You found my talent,

160
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:06,820
and I'll do everything for you.

161
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,400
I'll do whatever you tell me.

162
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,460
If you tell me to do something,

163
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,659
I will make it done with all my might.

164
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,712
Okay, okay.

165
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,480
I got it.

166
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,224
Mr. Liu told us

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,279
to go to the Yuyao with him.

168
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,759
You could take this opportunity to go home.

169
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,839
Actually, I think I have been

170
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,600
doing well in Beijing with you.

171
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,759
Maybe someone else?

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,984
Any problem?

173
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,720
After finishing the project

174
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
and getting the bonus…

175
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,336
You want to return home gloriously?

176
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,408
Okay.

177
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,879
It's so late, where are you going?

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,799
To see my boyfriend.

179
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,579
You and him just met.

180
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,680
And you are moving in with him already.

181
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,260
No, no. I'm just going to stay for a few days.

182
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,399
I don't want to leave you.

183
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,000
Alright, keep in touch.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,064
I'm leaving.

185
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:33,216
Go ahead.

186
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,400
Be careful.

187
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,580
I'll be back in a couple of days.

188
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,640
I got it.

189
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,180
I got some food in the fridge.

190
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,799
Don't eat at street stalls
if you get hungry at night.

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
[Yuan Yuan]
It's unhygienic and easy to gain weight.

192
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I've been working overtime recently,

193
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,220
didn't you when I get back.

194
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,399
What are you busy with?

195
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,000
Just focus on your work.

196
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,640
I've changed to a new environment

197
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,120
and started everything anew.

198
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Don't worry about me.

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
Coffee is bad for pregnant women.

200
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,528
Didn't keep it.

201
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,240
Xiaoman, maybe you think I'm the bad guy

202
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,224
and look down on me.

203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
But I don't regret.

204
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
I don't regret either.

205
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,080
Did it ever occur to you

206
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,360
that if the two of us go in jail,

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,080
we'll lose everything.

208
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,799
But if only one of us goes in,

209
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,679
then the other one can still develop.

210
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,860
You are just an accountant.

211
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,099
If you go in jail, might be
out after a few years, right?

212
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:23,240
When you get out of there, you still have me.

213
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,000
And I will have the company built up by then.

214
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:18,304
[Juhe Investments]

215
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
Finishing all the paperwork

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
requires at least one more month.

217
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,960
I've already talked to five agencies,

218
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:37,560
and told them

219
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,860
to solve anything
that can be settled with money.

220
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,360
But they told me

221
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,919
that no matter how much money you spend,

222
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,519
the time required stays the same.

223
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,176
This is the reality.

224
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,080
If you want to move forward with the project,

225
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,856
then it would be quite embarrassing.

226
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,799
Such a big project,

227
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,519
I've taken care of everything.

228
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,600
And now I'm stuck with the paperwork.

229
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,160
Isn't it ridiculous?

230
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
There is no turning back.

231
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Are you still going
to move forward with the project?

232
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,080
If in the follow-up cooperation,

233
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,260
Hesheng finds out
that we haven't finished the paperwork,

234
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,200
not only will our project be shut down,

235
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,639
but we will also face huge compensation.

236
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,519
But there's at least a half month

237
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,000
before the contract is officially signed.

238
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,136
Excluding weekends,

239
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
let's say, ten days.

240
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,640
Ten days.

241
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,440
Before they find out
that we haven't finished the paperwork,

242
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,176
I believe

243
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,759
everything will be solved.

244
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,840
Effort makes the difference.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,120
You are the legal representative
of the company.

246
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
You don't need to ask me about
anything you can decide.

247
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,528
See you.

248
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:13,376
Boss.

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
You're taking a risk.

250
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,879
Hello, is this Ms. Chen?

251
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:40,640
Block A, right?

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,320
I've arrived with your takeout.

253
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,936
Yes, yes.

254
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,159
Here's your food.

255
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,099
Okay, thank you.

256
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,144
Goodbye.

257
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:52,600
Come on, let's eat. The food is here.

258
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,208
So soon?

259
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:56,288
Let's go eat.

260
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:57,320
Let's go eat.

261
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,799
Come on.

262
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,799
It looks really delicious.

263
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,400
Here.

264
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:08,032
♫ The crowds that come and go ♫

265
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:10,368
♫ You and I get lost and fall ♫

266
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:13,408
♫ Falling into each other's embrace ♫

267
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:19,456
♫ You want to be my best friend ♫

268
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,880
This is my first time

269
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,119
to come to the client's company

270
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,960
and see so many senior executives
together for a meeting.

271
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:31,560
I was really nervous.

272
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,759
I felt like my whole body was shaking.

273
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
But you looked natural to me.

274
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,552
And you are a nice drinker.

275
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,899
I guess the stress

276
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,359
just triggered my potential.

277
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,920
The more things you do,

278
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,816
the more you take on,

279
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
the more confident you will become.

280
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,839
Maybe you don't even realize it yet.

281
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,008
You're

282
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,480
a very different person now.

283
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,152
Maybe

284
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
it's the charm of the workplace.

285
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,640
It can silently change someone.

286
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,896
So boss,

287
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,160
I want to thank you sincerely.

288
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,672
Come on.

289
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,624
Okay.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,319
Good things come in pairs.
I have good news for you.

291
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,240
Well,

292
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,920
I'll drink later.

293
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,920
Hesheng and Jingheng

294
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,880
will sign the contract the day after tomorrow.

295
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,640
The day after tomorrow?

296
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
No one mentioned it at the meeting?

297
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,240
Mr. Qin just decided it.

298
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:03,872
So,

299
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,759
we have over 30 hours left

300
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,240
before our project is settled.

301
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
Just over 30 hours left?

302
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Wait, let me calm down.

303
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,920
Don't just get excited.

304
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,160
It means we have to

305
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,519
go over everything
in the contract before we sign it.

306
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,519
Boss, we should head back

307
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,144
to get the work done.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,040
Check, please.

309
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,100
Hello, sir.

310
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,799
This lady has already paid it.

311
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,560
My treat.

312
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,864
You're welcome.

313
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,056
How's the food?

314
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,599
Very delicious,

315
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,599
but a bit expensive.

316
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:01,792
Expensive?

317
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,456
Then I'll treat you next time.

318
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,199
Boss, I'm leaving first.

319
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,200
Be safe. I'm leaving, bye.

320
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,360
Wait.

321
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,304
Yours.

322
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,824
For me?

323
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,079
No. This is too expensive. I can't accept it.

324
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,632
You've worked hard.

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,060
Then I accept this gift.

326
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,144
Thank you, boss.

327
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,240
I will certainly continue to work hard.

328
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,559
- Then…
- I'll take you home.

329
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,719
No.

330
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,980
The bus stop is near here.

331
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,039
I can go back by myself.

332
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Thank you for the gift, boss.

333
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,880
See you tomorrow. Bye.

334
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,128
You're the only one to get his gift?

335
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,199
I suppose so.

336
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,279
He just handed it to me himself.

337
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,220
I guess

338
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,720
I have been working very well,

339
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,900
so he wants to use a gift

340
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,799
to encourage me.

341
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,712
A man?

342
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:44,959
Right.

343
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,160
It's the boss I mentioned before.

344
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,480
I've been working under him for years.

345
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,040
He's young, promising,

346
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,479
elegant, dashing,

347
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,160
handsome and righteous.

348
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,759
For years?

349
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,400
Still the same guy?

350
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,500
Wait. You told me he was cold and ruthless.

351
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,720
And he won't let you into the project team.

352
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,040
You're this happy
just because he gave you a gift.

353
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,104
Come on.

354
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,660
It's not about the gift,

355
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,839
but a sense of recognition.

356
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,639
But I treated him to dinner tonight.

357
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,579
I guess it's a return of the favor.

358
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,839
Well,

359
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,119
does he like you?

360
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,720
Bro.

361
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,540
Have you ever seen

362
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,600
ghosts driving a car with square wheels

363
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,880
in the grassland?

364
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,080
Alright then.

365
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,880
But as a girl,

366
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
you must be careful, okay?

367
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
I got it.

368
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,120
Let me tell you.

369
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,319
I'm about to save enough money to buy a share.

370
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,240
All I can think about right now

371
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,639
is buying shares,

372
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:46,359
so I don't have time
to think about anything else.

373
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,580
By the way, when I'm done with this project,

374
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,640
I'll just take a leave and go home.

375
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Okay, then tell me if you come back.

376
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,944
Good night.

377
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,319
A male boss?

378
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,519
A gift?

379
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,039
So pretty, so pretty.

380
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,460
Our boss is pretty handsome. See.

381
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,688
Let me see.

382
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,960
He is pretty handsome.

383
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,700
Well, he's so cool.

384
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,359
Thanks to Xiaoman and Mr. Ke this time.

385
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,439
Right.

386
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,079
Xiaoman and Mr. Ke
have achieved great this time.

387
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,580
- Right.
- Yes, indeed.

388
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,720
What are you talking about?

389
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Come on, have a look.

390
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,319
Phones for boys, bags for girls.

391
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,380
Come on, everybody take one.

392
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,400
It's so great.

393
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,480
- Thank you, Mr. Liu.
- Thank you.

394
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:53,536
It's the latest model.

395
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,079
Mr. Ke, why doesn't Xiaoman have one?

396
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,839
He has already given me mine.

397
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,839
Everyone, thank you.

398
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Facts proves

399
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,072
that our efforts don't go in vain.

400
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,079
These gifts are not from me,

401
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,119
but from Mr. Qin.

402
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:15,840
Of course.

403
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,880
I will show my gratitude to you too.

404
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,279
I'll throw you a party out of my own pocket.

405
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,040
You pick the venue.

406
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,960
Great!

407
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
Boss, I love you!

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,020
Boss, love you!

409
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,439
Love you!

410
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,520
Boss, love you!

411
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
I love you too.

412
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,792
Oh my.

413
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,519
Excellent people excel at everything.

414
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,096
For a long time,

415
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,440
the most important thing in my life

416
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,359
is saving money

417
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,880
to buy shares in the company my father founded.

418
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,559
I feel secure when my work fills my life.

419
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,239
This work experience at Juhe

420
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,740
is actually the first time

421
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,160
that I've gained something
beyond a salary and bonus.

422
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,240
And that night view outside the window

423
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
is one of the best I can remember.

424
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,384
Boss.

425
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,040
Actually, I want to ask you something.

426
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,780
And I know

427
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,160
I shouldn't ask it.

428
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,759
But I still want to ask.

429
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,144
Go ahead.

430
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,400
Can we finish the project in two months?

431
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,960
I mean,

432
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,152
within two months,

433
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,599
can I get my bonus?

434
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,740
Remember to talk to the accountant tomorrow

435
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,279
to advance 150,000 yuan in salary.

436
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,816
I know you're in urgent need of money.

437
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:09,408
Besides,

438
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,199
I don't want you to let other things

439
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,519
affect your performance.

440
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,808
Remember,

441
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
this project isn't just important to you,

442
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,799
so is to me.

443
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,880
Thank you, boss.

444
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,040
No need.

445
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,688
Boss.

446
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,519
You're awake.

447
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,680
I brought you back last night
after you've drunk.

448
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,792
Want some water?

449
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:44,416
May I?

450
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,119
Boss, the water tastes good.

451
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,620
Well, boss.

452
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,560
- May I use your…
- Go ahead.

453
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,688
Thank you, thank you.

454
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,976
Can I talk to you now?

455
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,160
Take a seat.

456
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,368
Boss.

457
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,079
Having followed you for so many years, I…

458
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,344
Mr. Shang.

459
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,088
Then I'll just leave.

460
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:22,336
Goodbye, Mr. Shang.

461
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
Don't be late for the meeting this afternoon.

462
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,400
I know you've always treated me like a brother.

463
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,560
I think I don't have to tell you this,

464
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,480
anyway, you'll know it this afternoon.

465
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,144
But…

466
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,599
I don't think doing so is appropriate.

467
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:57,359
Although the whole thing is not appropriate.

468
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,392
But…

469
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,400
that's my bottom line, at least.

470
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,008
[Acquisition Agreement]

471
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:22,944
Since

472
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,800
you have granted me the power,

473
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,039
the contract will not have any problems,

474
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,599
and it has already taken effect.

475
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,640
That's your bottom line?

476
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,888
Juhe

477
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,880
is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yaosheng.

478
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,000
I am the legal representative of the company.

479
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,200
If you want to,

480
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,880
you can still be the Supervisor.

481
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,880
I really think highly of you, Liu Shang.

482
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,800
So that's what you want.

483
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,159
Whether taking Yaosheng down

484
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:23,104
with you,

485
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,360
or taking you down with Yaosheng,

486
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
to me,

487
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,928
it's all the same.

488
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,280
For me, all I want is

489
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,320
to win.

490
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,344
Boss.

491
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,679
Do you know why you lost?

492
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,239
Since the first day I worked with you,

493
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,016
I knew

494
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,960
no one could surpass you

495
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,360
in ability, experience, or vision.

496
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,480
So I could never surpass you

497
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,079
in my life.

498
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
Then I choose not to follow you anymore.

499
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,880
I know this is wrong.

500
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:12,256
But I…

501
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,679
have to do the right thing for myself.

502
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,320
I really never thought

503
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
it would be you.

504
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,119
Actually, I am also surprised.

505
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,016
Indeed.

506
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,639
But everyone wants this chance.

507
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,719
Everyone wants to stand out.

508
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,020
But no one has as many chances as you.

509
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,400
When can I stand out if I don't set you up?

510
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,880
Since everyone's suffering,

511
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,272
then being longer won't hurt.

512
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,672
I'm out first.

513
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,208
Thank you, boss.

514
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,936
Are you coming for the contract signing

515
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,144
this afternoon?

516
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,719
Once the contract is signed today,

517
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,760
my bonus will

518
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,220
be secured.

519
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,599
I've already planned how to spend this money.

520
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,959
I'm going to travel.

521
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,239
Shanshan, do you want to go with me?

522
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,559
W-What's the situation?

523
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,840
Lin Yang, this won't do.

524
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
You say it in front of everyone,

525
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,360
can Shanshan agree?

526
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,144
What?

527
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:39,519
Shanshan, do you?

528
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,440
It's okay, Shanshan. There's still me.

529
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,519
- No.
- I'll take you.

530
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,960
Having multiple choices is good.

531
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,056
No, impossible.

532
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,440
This is a public tea room.

533
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
This is a common office area.

534
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,679
There's still some space we haven't used yet.

535
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,680
This is an office.

536
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,400
And this is the meeting room.

537
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,500
Not bad.

538
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,519
You guys have a nice working atmosphere.

539
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,599
Ke Yan is always discerning.

540
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes.

541
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,296
Mr. Liu, this way, please.

542
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,480
- Come on.
- Okay.

543
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
I'll get the door.

544
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,000
Xiaoman, the contract.

545
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,976
Here.

546
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,599
Mr. Shang, Mr. Ke isn't here yet.

547
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,559
Wait.

548
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,639
Why did Mr. Shang bring them here?

549
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,728
What's wrong?

550
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:38,816
Here, Mr. Liu.

551
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:41,536
Mr. Yan.

552
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,180
Rest assured, Mr. Liu.

553
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,239
This is all we've been discussing.

554
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,940
We have no problem.

555
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,064
We have no problem either.

556
00:38:57,632 --> 00:38:58,720
Okay.

557
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,816
What's going on here?

558
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,239
Wait.

559
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,639
What are they doing here?

560
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you know?

561
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,208
I don't know.

562
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,096
There should be no problem.

563
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,100
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

564
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,128
Pleasant cooperation.

565
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:31,936
Sorry I'm late.

566
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:33,860
- Ke Yan.
- Mr. Liu.

567
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,220
Come on, have a seat.

568
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,320
Okay.

569
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,480
Mr. Ke has arrived just in time.

570
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,900
We are just celebrating.

571
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,180
Mr. Ke has made an indispensable contribution

572
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,360
in promoting the cooperation
between Jingheng and Hesheng.

573
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,980
Yaosheng

574
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,280
could be part of a project like this,

575
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,880
we must thank you.

576
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,079
You created this opportunity for us.

577
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,280
From the initial research and investigation

578
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,800
between the Yuyao and Beijing,

579
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,339
to the audit analysis
and meet various investors.

580
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,800
Mr. Ke.

581
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,639
You've worked so hard.

582
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,456
Well said.

583
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,199
Mr. Ke is really discerning.

584
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,920
Speaking of this cooperation,

585
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,679
the future benefits for us are immeasurable.

586
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,799
Maybe all of you here

587
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,639
would be business titans.

588
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,688
Of course.

589
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,800
I also want to thank you

590
00:40:26,848 --> 00:40:27,936
for years of training me.

591
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,520
The ones you should thank most are Miss Tian

592
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,648
and Mr. Yan.

593
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Shake hands with them.

594
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,239
I'm not

595
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,039
as discerning as the two of them.

596
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:47,776
Ke Yan.

597
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,519
Anyway,

598
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,000
I should thank you.

599
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Mr. Liu, don't mention it.

600
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,960
In fact, I should thank you all.

601
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,899
Even in a situation like today's,

602
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:01,940
but Ke Yan,

603
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,119
you should

604
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,040
take care of the closing.

605
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,200
Rest assured.

606
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,960
I will take care of this project to the end.

607
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:12,352
Okay.

608
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,639
Well, let's gather tonight

609
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,800
and celebrate together.

610
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,939
I'll skip dinner tonight.

611
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:19,519
Mr. Liu, sorry. I have plans for tonight.

612
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,320
I hope there will be more opportunities
for cooperation in the future.

613
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,456
Of course.

614
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,048
Okay.

615
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:40,743
♫ When I start fighting for a dash of color ♫

616
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,631
♫ I tell myself over and over,
I must not fear ♫

617
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:52,690
♫ When nothing here goes my way ♫

618
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:58,006
♫ Where should I come from
and where should I go ♫

619
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:04,524
♫ When I dream of your figures once again ♫

620
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:11,591
♫ I find I no longer cry like I used to ♫

621
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:16,039
♫ I learned to control my emotions ♫

622
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,079
♫ And how to be alone ♫

623
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,648
♫ Facing the wind and rain in this world ♫

624
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:28,679
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

625
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,759
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

626
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:35,175
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

627
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,359
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

628
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:44,353
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

629
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:47,239
♫ Embracing my body ♫

630
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

631
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,111
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

632
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:58,862
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

633
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:05,351
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

634
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:13,875
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫

635
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:27,305
♫ When having gone through
hope and disappointment ♫

636
00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:29,479
♫ Slowly I realized ♫

637
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:34,087
♫ There are no traces of you and me ♫

638
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:39,367
♫ Yet another place feels so familiar ♫

639
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:42,968
♫ Even the air feels like a familiar hand ♫

640
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:46,549
♫ Embracing my body ♫

641
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:50,599
♫ I am willing to start today, here ♫

642
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,575
♫ To incorporate every bit of you ♫

643
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:57,290
♫ Into this shade of blue ♫

644
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:04,263
♫ These are the traces where you've been ♫

645
00:45:04,263 --> 00:45:12,071
♫ And the surprises you've left for me ♫
