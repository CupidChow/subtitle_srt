(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,050
(Episode 6)

14
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,820
- Get me our rate chart. - Yes, sir.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,660
What's our pay ratio for level D?

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,929
Level D is assessed individually.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,199
But last time, you yelled at General Manager Kang,

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,599
saying it was bad for the company's image.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,130
Goodness. What's all that noise outside?

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,140
What's going on?

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,839
Goodness. Seriously.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,210
- Hey, lady! Stop! - No, let go!

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,640
- What's your problem? - Should I go down and see?

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,249
- No, leave her be. - Why do you think...

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,649
- Let's see what she does. - I'm asking you this?

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,080
Du Won and I are very close.

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,689
The moment he hears that I'm here,

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,520
he'll come running barefoot all the way from over there.

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,320
Whatever!

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,330
Goodness.

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,240
Yes, let them in.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,959
Oh, my gosh.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,190
Is it really you, Lim Se Ra?

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,660
Gosh.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,260
You've gotten so much prettier...

36
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,430
that I...

37
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,560
I could hardly recognize you.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,299
Come here. How long has it been?

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,570
Come on.

40
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,570
I came to check something with you.

41
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670
I'll go first.

42
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,210
The truth is, I wanted to meet you, but you beat me to it.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,880
You wanted to meet me?

44
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,550
Why?

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,650
Can we talk in private?

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,490
It's fine. Say it.

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,150
It's a private matter between just the two of us.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,390
Who's he?

49
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,129
He's my...

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm her manager.

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,300
Come on. Your manager? No way.

52
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,410
Is he really your manager?

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,479
The thing is...

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,510
Yes, I am.

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,620
So please contact me to speak with Ms. Lim from now on.

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,490
She really was a top star back then.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,329
It's great that you're acting under your real name...

58
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,160
instead of revealing you're Lim Se Ra. Good call.

59
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,130
Keep doing your thing.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Once the buzz picks up, you can reveal who you are.

61
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,470
Then you'll be back in your second prime.

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,380
You never used to eat more than one piece of sushi...

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,780
and three pieces of sashimi.

64
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,990
Eat as much as you want. It's okay.

65
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,659
Why is it so cold in here?

66
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,030
You're cold? I'll go get a blanket.

67
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,570
It'd be better to turn up the heater.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,699
Hey! That will dehydrate my skin.

69
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,739
Oh, right. Can they warm up the floor instead?

70
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,870
Darn...

71
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,210
What the...

72
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,779
Du Won has always been quick to get things done.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
That's his only strength.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,020
Are you talking about way back when?

75
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,789
Do I still look like the road manager who used to wait on you?

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,850
Right.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,389
You're so successful.

78
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,290
How come you didn't stay in touch all these years?

79
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,130
What in the world are you talking about?

80
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,900
I couldn't reach you because I didn't even know where you were.

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,770
You were hiding so well that I couldn't find you.

82
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,640
You're the CEO of Korea's top entertainment agency.

83
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,110
Tracking someone down should be a piece of cake for you, right?

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,740
How am I supposed to find someone who's gone into hiding on purpose?

85
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,340
Do you think I'm a cop?

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I see. She went into hiding on purpose.

87
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,450
Why?

88
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,420
Did Ms. Bong have a reason to hide?

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,620
Goodness. What do you want from me?

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
You said you wanted to meet me.

91
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,770
Let me hear you out.

92
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,970
Why did you want to meet me again after all this time?

93
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,800
Is this guy really your manager?

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,540
I know. I look like an actor, don't I?

95
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,819
We agreed to work together...

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,120
as soon as I got my first role back in the scene.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,950
Oh, come on.

98
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,950
You shouldn't rush into signing a contract.

99
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,390
You trust people too easily. I've always told you to be careful.

100
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,830
I know.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,960
I trust people way too easily,

102
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,730
which is why I totally trusted you too.

103
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,500
What does that mean?

104
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,200
That said,

105
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,970
what really happened?

106
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
Tae Sook told me.

107
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,510
On the day of the awards ceremony 25 years ago,

108
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,409
you told Tae Sook and Sun Young that you were throwing...

109
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,080
a surprise party for me, so they weren't in the van.

110
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,450
That's why I was alone in the van when the accident happened.

111
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,420
Why are you asking about it now?

112
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Don't tell me...

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,930
You don't remember?

114
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,700
It's not that I don't remember what happened.

115
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,930
We just want to check.

116
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,270
Some say...

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,970
the accident might have been planned.

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,210
"Planned?"

119
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,610
That's right.

120
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,950
My goodness.

121
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,650
Chung Ja, how much longer are you going to dwell on your past?

122
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,990
You've made a comeback, and things are looking up for you.

123
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,990
So you should focus on your future.

124
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,360
Answer my question.

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,360
What were you doing when the accident happened?

126
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
That day?

127
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,340
I already told you everything.

128
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,100
You told me?

129
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,210
- When? - What?

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,880
The day you woke up in the hospital.

131
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,980
I came running to see you. Don't you remember?

132
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,850
My gosh. That really hurts my feelings.

133
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,550
(Patient Chart, Bong Chung Ja)

134
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,350
She lost her memory?

135
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh, my.

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,260
Three to four months after the accident,

137
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,270
she miraculously woke up, right?

138
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,970
Is that right?

139
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,740
I don't really remember as it was too long ago.

140
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,510
I know. Too much time has passed.

141
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,590
Let me.

142
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,720
Thanks for the meal.

143
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,889
Who would've thought you'd buy me such an expensive meal?

144
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,130
I never thought I'd live to see this day.

145
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,830
You should live a long and happy life, with me.

146
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,740
Did you mean it when you said I could ask you for help anytime?

147
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,870
We, at 2ONE Entertainment, are ready...

148
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,140
to do whatever it takes to help you.

149
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Now, hop in.

150
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,920
Mr. Manager, can I get your business card?

151
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,650
Pardon?

152
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,990
Oh, right.

153
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,059
I came in such a rush that I forgot to bring my business card.

154
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,190
Come on. An actress' manager should always have business cards on them.

155
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,299
How is this any different from a cop...

156
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,800
going after a suspect without his gun?

157
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
You're right.

158
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,370
Well, then... One moment.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,210
Then give me your number. I'll text you.

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,550
- Here. - Thanks.

161
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,920
- I'll be in touch. - Sounds good.

162
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,120
- Bye, Chung Ja. - Yes, bye.

163
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,429
Hey, you should get a new car.

164
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,630
- Goodness. - All right.

165
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,770
Bye!

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,650
Look into the number I just texted you.

167
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,980
What exactly am I looking for?

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,390
Your grave site?

169
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
My apologies, sir.

170
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,359
By the way, what happened?

171
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,700
Did you get a new phone?

172
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,600
I always carry a second phone, just in case.

173
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,230
One that can't be traced.

174
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,940
I knew it.

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,570
You said you used to be a detective.

176
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,810
No wonder you're incredibly thorough.

177
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I give you that.

178
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,080
Anyway, what's that?

179
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,150
It's nothing.

180
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
Is it a gift?

181
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,850
- Hey! - Hey.

182
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,220
A gift? What are you talking about?

183
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,920
There was too much left, so I had some packed to go.

184
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
That'll be my dinner.

185
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,490
Where's mine?

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,800
What are you saying?

187
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,330
Anyway, I thought you came to check something with Mr. Kang.

188
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
I couldn't because he told a blatant lie.

189
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,640
He lied?

190
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,010
How do you know he lied?

191
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,480
He might have forgotten,

192
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,449
but that day 25 years ago feels like yesterday to me,

193
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,710
so I remember everything vividly.

194
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,550
On the day of the awards ceremony 25 years ago...

195
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,960
What were you doing when the accident happened?

196
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,830
That day?

197
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,930
Whenever he's about to say something difficult,

198
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,430
he licks his lips and talks with an accent.

199
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,810
I already told you everything.

200
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,340
The day you woke up in the hospital.

201
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,380
I was the first one to come running to see you.

202
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,980
You don't remember?

203
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,280
My gosh. That really hurts my feelings.

204
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,890
So I knew he was lying.

205
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,690
Also...

206
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Just this once.

207
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,390
Could you do it just this once?

208
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,270
It'll be the end of everything, including Director Choi's movie.

209
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,740
Never mind. It's nothing.

210
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,900
By the way, why did you tell him you were my manager earlier?

211
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,700
I couldn't think of anything else.

212
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,570
You said you'd never be my manager even if I begged.

213
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,250
The world you want to return to.

214
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,950
I'm certain the culprit is part of it.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,550
You're never safe until the culprit is caught.

216
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,020
So, you did it because you were worried about me?

217
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,060
Are you going to go undercover...

218
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,460
to stay by my side?

219
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,400
Are we filming a drama or something? Cut the nonsense.

220
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,500
Oh, right. How did you know that?

221
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,170
That Lim Se Ra woke up 3 to 4 months after the accident.

222
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,610
None of the articles I've read mentioned it.

223
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,709
Well, in TV dramas,

224
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,650
people miraculously wake up after 3 to 4 months.

225
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,250
Go on in. I'm off.

226
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,420
Hey, wait!

227
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,860
This is for you.

228
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,290
You.

229
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,259
What is your relationship with her?

230
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
("Love Is Not a Crime")

231
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,530
He used to only watch "Jewelry Store Girl" over and over again.

232
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,940
I don't know what got into him,

233
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,510
but now he's hooked on that new drama.

234
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,570
Oh, right.

235
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Your sister paid off all the overdue invoices.

236
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,980
My sister?

237
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,380
What was her name?

238
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Yes, Ms. Bong Chung Ja.

239
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,650
She came by the other day.

240
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,250
She didn't tell you?

241
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Dad.

242
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,360
I'll be back to see you next month.

243
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,170
- Okay? - What?

244
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,230
Who are you?

245
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,140
I heard Se Ra was here.

246
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,769
Se Ra? Se Ra is here now?

247
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,040
- Goodness. - Gosh, please sit down.

248
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,680
You don't even have strength in your legs.

249
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,610
Where is Se Ra?

250
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,020
Let me see her. Please?

251
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,060
Dad, do you only have one daughter?

252
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,359
I was the one who stood by your side for 20 years,

253
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
yet you never once recognized me.

254
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,800
How could you only remember Se Ra's name?

255
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,240
- Dad. - What?

256
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,870
Starting in my senior year of high school,

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,840
I had to take care of you in prison, so I gave up college.

258
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,110
I was also the one who sat by your sickbed and looked after you.

259
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,980
It was never Se Ra!

260
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,050
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,389
Forgive me.

262
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,520
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,660
Sorry. Forgive me.

264
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,830
Please forgive me.

265
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,430
I'm sorry, Dad.

266
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,300
- What's wrong with me? - My goodness.

267
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,340
- I'll be going, then. - Se Ra...

269
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,840
Se Ra.

270
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,110
Se Ra...

271
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,520
Here's the revised script.

272
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,320
They revised it again?

273
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,690
Thank you.

274
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,360
What is this? What's wrong with this script?

275
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,630
My gosh!

276
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,740
I got way more lines this time!

277
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,310
- Hey. - Oh, my.

278
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,370
Hey, you!

279
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,310
Did you bribe the writer or something?

280
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,280
What absurd nonsense are you barking about now?

281
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,050
"Absurd nonsense?"

282
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,180
I mean, it seems that way.

283
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,749
Until last week,

284
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,989
you were just a housekeeper with 2 or 3 scenes per episode.

285
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,690
Now, you have so many lines. How does that make sense?

286
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,930
I guess you're jealous because I have more scenes than you.

287
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,730
Why, you...

288
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,199
Know your place, all right?

289
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,599
In this business, when a newcomer acts up and pushes out an old-timer,

290
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,429
it usually ends badly for the newcomer.

291
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,770
Why don't you just pray for my downfall?

292
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,110
As if you could fall any lower.

293
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,909
The one and only Lim Se Ra...

294
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,480
is in this mess now...

295
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,810
Watch what you say.

296
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,580
I'm Bong Chung Ja. Ms. Bong.

297
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,330
Excuse me.

298
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,440
That is your role in this household.

299
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,870
A housekeeper preparing kkakdugi.

300
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,310
If you keep acting up,

301
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,079
people will find out who you really are, so watch out.

302
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,140
Don't tell me...

303
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,350
you're delusional enough to think...

304
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,220
you're the madam's only man.

305
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,150
What do you mean?

306
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,590
The child in her womb. Who do you think...

307
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,830
the father is?

308
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,960
The child's not mine?

309
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,200
Answer me. Hurry up and tell me!

310
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,939
Let go. I told you to let go!

311
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,270
Let go of me!

312
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,950
Oh, gosh.

313
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Sorry.

314
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,620
I lost control of my strength.

315
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,560
Sorry about that.

316
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,430
("Love Is Not a Crime")

317
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,370
(Bong Dumpling Shop)

318
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,879
- Oh, my. - She's so cool.

319
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
That was cool.

320
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,349
- Oh, she used this radish. - Yes!

321
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,520
- This was it. - She hit him in the face with it.

322
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,750
Look at this. Oh, my.

323
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,420
- Awesome! - That's how it's done.

324
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,660
This is that very radish.

325
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,019
Look how fresh it is.

326
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,559
If you want that refreshing crunch when you bite into it,

327
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,329
you need to buy radishes this fresh.

328
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,959
Make sure you don't miss out on this today.

329
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,629
- Nice. - Cheese!

330
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,970
- Where am I supposed to look? - Where?

331
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,939
You look even prettier...

332
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,909
- now that you appear on TV. - I know, right?

333
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,710
Why didn't you tell us you were an actress?

334
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,779
Actress? Oh, please. It's just a minor role.

335
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,149
You're in a daily drama.

336
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,549
If that doesn't make you an actress, what does?

337
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,520
- You're a top star! - Oh, stop.

338
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,719
- Yes, totally. - I'm a big fan.

339
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,449
Please keep watching and supporting my show.

340
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,019
- Of course! - We watch it every single day.

341
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,259
Don't forget us.

342
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,429
Of course, I won't. How could I ever forget you?

343
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,089
- How sweet. - Can I get another autograph?

344
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,000
- It's for my son. - Sure thing.

345
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,770
- Hi. - Da Hee.

346
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,700
Are you leaving this job?

347
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,510
Yes. It just so happened.

348
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,410
You must've been embarrassed because of me.

349
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,680
Do you have something to tell me?

350
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,580
The thing is...

351
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,820
I have to submit something to school. Can you sign this?

352
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,620
You want me to sign it?

353
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,630
- Why? You should tell your mom. - No.

354
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,459
Mom's busy with her shop.

355
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
I barely see her when I get home from the academy.

356
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,329
You can't do it?

357
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,370
It's your report card, isn't it?

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm guessing you bombed your exam.

359
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,640
All right. Hand it over.

360
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,710
My goodness. So many people want my signature today.

361
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,019
You have to study, okay?

362
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,080
Thanks for this.

363
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,350
Wait.

364
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,130
I was struggling myself,

365
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,430
so I couldn't even give my niece any pocket money.

366
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,729
It's fine.

367
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,900
From now on, I'm going to work hard...

368
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,540
so I can repay your mom for everything...

369
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,800
and also cover your grandpa's hospital bills.

370
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,110
So you just study hard, Da Hee.

371
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
Okay?

372
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,810
Promise.

373
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,050
- Don't do this again. - Okay.

374
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,450
You can go.

375
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,690
Which one would be good?

376
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,230
- Well... - Should I try with this?

377
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Yes, let's try.

378
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,130
You jerk!

379
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,429
- This isn't it, right? - I don't love the look of that.

380
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,799
This looks like a radish, right? What would be good?

381
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,640
- A green onion smack in the face? - A green onion smack in the face?

382
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,509
It might be better to use kudzu root.

383
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,939
How about trying a different category of items?

384
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,280
A different category? Like what?

385
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,680
You could use some kind of living creature.

386
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,520
- A live small octopus? - A live small octopus?

387
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,619
I'll throw the octopus like this.

388
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,119
Then it'll stick to his face and won't come off.

389
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,389
- Something like that? - Yes, that's it.

390
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,819
Spoon worms! How about spoon worms?

391
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,960
She's totally lost it.

392
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,790
That will really hurt, right?

393
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,500

- Sir. - What?

400
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,060
How long has that detective been following us?

401
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,830
It's been about 15 days.

402
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,330
He's the same guy from before, right?

403
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,500
Yes.

404
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,440
We're ready.

(Dawon Motel)

406
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,390
Because you were taking your sweet time, I got cold feet.

407
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,490
I even thought you weren't coming.

408
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,530
I was surprised you called asking for the final payment,

409
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,230
especially since you failed to do your job.

410
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,670
I did everything I possibly could.

411
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,070
I risked my life to cause that accident.

412
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,970
How was I supposed to know that the old lady would survive?

413
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,780
Is it the full amount?

414
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,420
It seems like you don't have much to carry.

415
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,590
Your body alone should be enough, yes?

416
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,820
What do you mean?

417
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:59,490
I've got you a boat that leaves tomorrow night.

418
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,530
Pack your things and go.

419
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,030
Go where? Abroad?

420
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,900
Are you serious? This isn't what we agreed on.

421
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,900
One annoying guy has latched on.

422
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,130
Honestly, isn't this better than prison?

423
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,970
Aren't you on probation right now?

424
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,110
Sweetheart.

425
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,350
If I go to jail, do you think I'd go alone?

426
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,680
Funny, is it?

427
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,350
If you don't, then what?

428
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,260
Let go.

429
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,590
It's too little money for me to leave.

430
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Five times.

431
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,900
No. Pay me ten times more.

432
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,470
Then I'll leave this country quietly.

433
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,670
- Fine. - Really?

434
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,940
In return, you must do your job properly. Got it?

435
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,180
Of course.

436
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,310
Wait. Are you telling me to try and kill her again?

437
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,320
- It's tenfold. - Fifteen...

438
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,850
Okay.

439
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,860
Maybe the driver at fault has already fled overseas.

440
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,800
- I doubt it. - Didn't he go into hiding?

441
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,330
His house was empty, and so was his credit card bill.

442
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,670
If he planned it out, he must have left by now.

443
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,900
He'll surely leave soon.

444
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,670
But after the payment is complete.

445
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,340
You sound like you know where he is.

446
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,150
Was there an urgent reason to lie low?

447
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,719
- Could it be for an alibi? - What kind of nonsense is this?

448
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,790
Good grief.

449
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,330
Good. Make sure to stay out of sight, okay?

450
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,170

00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:51,309
Please pass it along to the CEO.

543
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,809
- Okay. - Thanks for the treat.

544
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,879
- Thank you. - Thank you.

What's all of this?

548
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,490
Obviously, it's my love for you.

549

Stop joking around.

550
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,029
Come now. I can afford to throw...

551
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,800
a celebration for your comeback.

552
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,770
But you don't spend money for no reason.

553
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Gosh.

554
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,070
You know me so well.

555
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,570
And that means I know you too.

556
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,010
What's that about?

557
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,710
You need money, don't you?

558
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,550
This time, let's meet alone. Just the two of us.

559
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,580
Fine.

560
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,450
I've got something to confirm too.

561
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,760
So let's meet. Just you and me.

562
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,490
Okay.

563
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,470
Is this everything? Isn't there more?

564
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,570
No, those are everything.

565
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,240
I told you to bring everything and not pick and choose for yourself.

566
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,610
But those are all of them.

567
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,310
Why am I getting fewer scripts after Cannes International Film Festival?

568
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,549
Perhaps people are hesitant to send you scripts...

569
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,580
because you're top class.

570
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,690
Hey. As if I'd just act in anything.

571
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,019
I don't want anything childish.

572
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,530
You know. I want something sophisticated.

573
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,960
Better yet, a genre piece with a killer character.

574
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,300
I'm no ordinary actress now. Let's be picky.

575
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,469
Now would be the perfect time for a streaming project.

576
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,510
You.

577
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,880
Check if there's a fixed streaming platform lineup that I can take on.

578
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,610
"Streaming platform?"

579
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,179
There must be plenty of scripts...

580
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,780
they didn't dare to send me, scared I might reject them.

581
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,490
Anything that's already fixed probably has all the casting done.

582
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,920
Don't you realize who I am?

583
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,629
I'm Go Hui Yeong.

584

Go Hui Yeong, Queen of Cannes.

585
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,499
No matter who it is, I'll take the role from them.

586
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
So go secure one right now!

587
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,130
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,350
I heard you visited Dad.

590
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,980
I did.

591
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,650
So you covered all the overdue hospital bills.

592
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,590
Why didn't you tell me?

593
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,729
From now on, I'll be paying for everything,

594
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,090
from Dad's nursing home to Da Hee's lessons.

595
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,260
Has your memory come back?

596
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,740
Not yet.

597
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,970
But it should return soon.

598
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,810
Take it with you.

599
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,980
You love kimchi dumplings.

600
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,590
Thanks.

601
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,960
Will you still be appearing in that drama?

602
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,670
Of course. I'll be going to auditions as well.

Things were rough...

607
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,750
after my accident, right?

608
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,060
Especially since Dad was away and you were all alone and so young.

609

610

Sure, it was hard for me.

611

But Dad, your biggest supporter, had it worse.

612
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,110
He even visited the hospital to see you.

613
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,280
Dad came?

614
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,980
But wasn't he...

615
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,950
wanted back then?

616
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,489
The moment Dad saw you on the news,

617
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,060
he came rushing out of hiding.

618

621

Once I get locked up, who knows...

622
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,670
All the police cared about was arresting him.

623
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,610
But Dad kept begging them to let him see you just once.

624
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,080
He may have caused you trouble,

625
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,550
but the one Dad held onto until the very end was you.

626
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,020
Thanks to that detective,

627
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Dad was able to see you before going to jail.

628
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,760
What detective?

629
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,700
You know, the detective with a dialect.

630
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,570
I think he was from Busan or something.

631
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,270
Do you know his name?

632
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,240
That was years ago.

633
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,740
I do recall his name being unique.

634
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,050

635

It's not easy to transfer from Busan to Seoul.

Darn it. This is bad.

727
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,290
Where did she go?

728
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,740
Hey.

729
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,970
Hi.

730
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,880
Come here!

731
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It hurts.

732
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
It hurts.

733
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,650
Nice shot.

734
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,690
Hey.

735
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Don't come near me.

736
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,830
Don't you dare.

737
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,060
I might not look like a threat to you.

738
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,829
But I learned all kinds of combat skills...

739
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,300
while training at an action school back in the day.

740
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Don't come near me.

741
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,570
My gosh.

742
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,670
Darn it.

743
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,190
Are you all right?

744
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
What are you going to do with it?

745
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,250
Get out of my way, you jerk.

746
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,970
You know the drill since you've been down this road.

747
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,699
You can refuse to answer questions that could be used against you.

748
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,909
You have the right to an attorney and so on.

749
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,470
I'll spare you the details. Okay?

750
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,209
Hey! You jerk.

751
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,579
- You little... - Hey!

752
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,609
What?

753
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,119
- You... - Stop that.

754
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
- Come on. - Darn it.

755
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,590
Are you okay?

756
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,150
How did you find me here?

757
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,060
I kept an eye on him just in case.

758
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,830
You're not hurt, right?

759
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,760
- Oh, no. You're bleeding. - What?

760
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,260
No!

761
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,299
You jerk!

762
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,240
- Come on. - That hurts.

763
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,670
Hold on.

764
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,079
Come on. Hear me out.

765
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,179
Listen. Yes, I did abduct her.

766
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,079
But I was the one who got beaten up.

767
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,989
Seriously. You hit me! Didn't you?

768
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,520
- Get in already. - I can't when the door is closed!

769
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:50,089
Darn it. I should have torn you up into pieces when I had the chance.

770
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,530
You can make a statement tomorrow at the station. I'll come with you.

771
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,630
He won't be released again, right?

772
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,070
He's already on probation from a previous assault charge.

773
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,869
He committed an abduction, assaulted with a weapon,

774
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,539
and even attempted murder while on probation.

775
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,970
He'll be detained while his case gets processed.

776
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,310
Don't worry.

777
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,210
Why did he try to kill me?

778
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,829
You've got our support.

779
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,129
Good luck!

780
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,299
- Go, Chung Ja! - Good luck!

781
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,239
- Bong Chung Ja is the best! - Bong Chung Ja!

782
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,439
- You're the best. - Thanks for this.

783
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,540
Thank you!

784
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,340
(Seminar for New Recruits)

785
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,550
They sent a coffee truck to this woman?

786
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,820
Darn.

787
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,919
It's me.

788
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,720
The agency sent a coffee truck to the shoot of a daily drama.

789
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,390
Find out who ordered it.

790
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,229
Oh, that. I think the CEO personally sent the coffee truck.

791
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,660
It came from Mr. Kang himself?

792
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,130
And this is top secret.

793
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,640
The CEO is planning to sign the actress, Bong Chung Ja.

794
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,810
That crazy fool.

795
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,080
Find out where he is right now.

796
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,350
That jerk.

797
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,520
You knew about her, but kept it a secret, didn't you?

798
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,890
Bong Chung Ja.

799
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,360
She's Lim Se Ra, right?

800
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,330
You figured it out faster than I thought.

801
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,490
I thought Hui Yeong would be the first to figure out.

802
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,530
No way. She doesn't know about this yet?

803
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,240
Knowing her temper, she wouldn't have let it slide if she did.

804
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,420
I think I recently saw someone we know.

805
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,550
Has it been 25 years?

806
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,820
Since Lim Se Ra's disappearance.

807
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,500
I have no interest in going to the Good Place after I die.

808
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,800
I'm going to get there...

809
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,830
while I'm breathing.

810
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,040
Okay. She's good.

811
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,740
Acting-wise, she's as good as Lim Se Ra.

812
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,009
It's just that she's not as popular.

813
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,519
She's as attractive as Lim Se Ra.

814
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,179
Come on. You can't say that.

815
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,119
Lim Se Ra was the top actress for a reason.

816
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,419
She had her own presence and aura.

817
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,520
Don't you agree, Director Choi?

818
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,820
Well,

819
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,200
you're aware that Lim Se Ra was supposed to take this role, right?

820
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,529
Yes, I'm aware.

821
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,599
Go Hui Yeong,

822
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,570
in what way do you think you're better than Lim Se Ra?

823
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,550
It's my desperation.

824
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,190
I can't speak for how she planned to approach this character.

825
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,890
But I can say I'm more desperate than her.

826
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,219
I don't mind if I get paid less than her.

827
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,990
I'm willing to do all the scenes she refused.

828
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,530
Are you willing to do anything you're asked to do off-camera?

829
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,840
The truth is...

830
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,639
Even if Lim Se Ra hadn't been in an accident,

831
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,350
it would've fallen through. Do you want to know why?

832
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,250
She failed to do the most important thing,

833
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,650
which was to meet the investor's needs.

834
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,370
You know that you were just filling in for Se Ra.

835
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,380
But what if Se Ra returns?

836
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,880
That ought to be quite interesting, right?

837
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,890
Kang Du Won.

838
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,790
He knew everything all along.

839
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,530
He did this on purpose while knowing everything.

840
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,630
How far are we?

841
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,299
I'm sorry.

842
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,969
I'm trying to get there as fast as possible.

843
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,570
Are you sure he's at the agency?

844
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,200
Yes, I had it confirmed.

845
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,050
Rest up then. I'll get going.

846
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,850
You're just leaving?

847
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,750
Well, I should get going. What could I do?

848
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,650
Come on in.

849
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,050
My gosh. What...

850
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,920
What are you doing?

851
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,860
- Take it off. - What?

852
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,430
Take what off?

853
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,400
My goodness. What are you doing?

854
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,570
What did you think I was doing? We need to treat your wound.

855
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,910
There's no need to make a big deal out of it. I'm fine.

856
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,780
Should I drag you to the hospital?

857
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,850
- Gosh. - Sit down now.

858
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,650
Come on.

859
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,490
Take it off now.

860
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,120
I told you I was fine.

861
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,360
- My gosh. - Let me see.

862
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,570
- It's a small scratch. - Oh, no.

863
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,270
This needs to be disinfected first.

864
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,940
Gosh, you don't need to do that.

865
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,210
I'm sorry.

866
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,310
Why?

867
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,580
You got hurt because of me.

868
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,980
Forget about it.

869
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,749
I could've floored him with a punch if it'd happened in my prime.

870
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,820
My goodness.

871
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,749
Besides, I got hurt because I got rusty. It's not your fault.

872
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,690
- That stings! - Oh, no.

873
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,580
So you should always keep your phone with you.

874
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,849
I'll make sure to bring it everywhere I go from now on.

875
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,309
And I'll charge it regularly.

876
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,880
Exactly. Make sure to carry it. Don't scare me like that.

877
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,920
Were you scared for me?

878
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,720
Well, it's only natural.

879
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,190
I couldn't reach you,

880
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:30,690
but that lunatic was hanging around you.

881
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,360
I really thought something had happened to you.

882
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,570
What if it did?

883
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,130
If it did, it wouldn't have been good for me.

884
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,870
Well...

885
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,539
You're the victim of the case I'm in charge of.

886
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,880
You know.

887
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,690
Is that the only reason?

888
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,490
Then what else...

889
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,970
Actually,

890
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,370
it's about what I wanted to tell you the other day.

891
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,010
Does it...

892
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,050
have to do with what happened today?

893
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,420
I think so.

894
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,129
I'm asking you why you didn't tell me...

895
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,400
Bong Chung Ja was Lim Se Ra!

896
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,540
So everyone knew.

897
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,710
But I was the only one who didn't know like a fool.

898
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,050
Hui Yeong.

899
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,249
As soon as I confirmed it,

900
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,780
I was going to tell you right...

901
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,890
What are you plotting?

902
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,220
Why are you getting Lim Se Ra involved?

903
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,960
Get her involved?

904
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,190
I know everything.

905
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,570
I heard 2ONE Entertainment was planning to recruit her.

906
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,199
Hey, you're unbelievable.

907
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,670
My gosh, you must be out of your mind.

908
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,140
This is so ridiculous that I can't even watch.

909
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,640
What's gotten into you guys?

910
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,110
She's not the same Lim Se Ra.

911
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,820
She's a nobody named Bong Chung Ja.

912
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,949
Did you guys barge in here at night...

913
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,450
because you felt threatened by a washed-up has-been?

914
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,890
The mighty Queen of Cannes and Chavely?

915
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,260
I'm not the only one going down...

916
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,230
with Lim Se Ra's return.

917
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,230
It will ruin you too.

918
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,170
Exactly!

919
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,370
You guys need to shut your mouths and watch.

920
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:05,280
Just watch me destroy Bong Chung Ja. Okay?

921
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,180
Understood?

922
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,150
Seriously.

923
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,260
So this man...

924
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,900
tried to kill me 25 years ago...

925
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,210
and recently tried to kill me again in the car accident?

926
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,780
It's not confirmed, but...

927
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,849
the same man was spotted at both scenes.

928
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,150
It means...

929
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,650
these two car accidents can't be a coincidence.

930
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,130
It's your fault!

931
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,100
This man...

932
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,170
I met with him before my accident a month ago.

933
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,550
Does the memory you remembered recently involve him?

934
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,870
So she's determined to come out of the shadows?

935
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,950
I'll find him.

936
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,850
I'll make him come to me.

937
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,520
He ruined my life as if trying to kill me wasn't enough.

938
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,760
I'll catch him myself no matter what.

939
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,870
He managed to hurt Lim Se Ra, the actress the whole nation knew.

940
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,300
But something like that happens again?

941
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,470
- The next time it does, you... - But now,

942
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,340
I'm not alone like I was before.

943
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,390
(Epilogue)

944
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,690
Which way is to Lim Se Ra's room?

945
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,230
Lim Se Ra?

946
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,000
My gosh.

947
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,040
The celebrity, Lim Se Ra.

948
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,410
I know that she got the surgery here and is staying in this hospital.

949
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,440
What's your relationship to the patient?

950
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,180
Actually,

951
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,910
I'm her father.

952
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,180
Could you show me your ID card?

953
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:39,390
Let me see my daughter just once!

954
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,829
I really am Lim Se Ra's dad!

955
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,199
Once I get locked up, who knows when I'll be out again.

956
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,139
Please let me see my daughter before I go.

957
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,870
- Just once. - Let's talk at the station.

958
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,439
Hold on a second.

959
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
What's going on?

960
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Well...

961
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,680
I'm a detective from Busan Police Station.

962
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,250
- What's this about? - Well...

963
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,750
This is Bong Seok Bong, the one on the wanted list, right?

964
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,189
- Yes, he is. - I'm the detective on his case.

965
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,790
- Let me take him in. - What?

966
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,560
Will you believe me if my team leader talks to you?

967
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,700
(Intensive Care Unit)

968
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,000
I thought we were going to the police station.

969
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,040
You will. But before that, you ought to see your daughter.

970
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,349
So my Se Ra is in there?

971
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,510
Make it quick.

972
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,120
I can't give you a lot of time.

973
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,449
- Thank you, Detective. - Gosh.

974
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,490
Okay.

975
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,500
Se...

976
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,600
Se Ra.

977
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,840
(Restricted Area)

978
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,230
My daughter is lifelessly lying in the hospital.

979
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,860
And look at me, locked up in prison.

980
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,100
After running the con,

981
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,730
not only did you run away, but you also went into hiding.

982
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,900
Did you not think you would get arrested for it?

983
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,980
Se Ra needs to wake up soon.

984
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,310
That way, she can get me out of here.

985
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,950
My goodness.

986
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,450
Detective.

987
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,920
Were you able to reach my second daughter?

988
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,720
Why do you ask?

989
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,120
It's getting cold.

990
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,160
Can you ask her to send me some commissary money?

991
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,200
She's only in high school. How could you ask her for money?

992
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,200
I need to get by here too.

993
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,510
My goodness.

994
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,829
(Commissary Amount: 300 dollars)

995
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,359
(Name: Lim Se Ra, Relation: Daughter)

996
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,970
(Request for Commissary Deposit)

997
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,050
(My Troublesome Star)

998
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,250
You're certain Lim Se Ra will come back in this, right?

999
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,920
The second heyday of Lim Se Ra.

1000
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,820
Let's make it happen together.

1001
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,420
I should give you a present for signing with the agency.

1002
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,019
How did you manage to hold back...

1003
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,760
for decades when you wanted to go on a power trip?

1004
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,730
You only have yourself to blame...

1005
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,730
for how things turned out for you.

1006
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:12,100
I finally found the connection between 2ONE Entertainment...

1007
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,600
and Ju Seung Pil after all these years.

1008
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:16,170
I'm not going to run away from it. I'll face it head-on.

1009
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,170
I'm not alone like I was before.
