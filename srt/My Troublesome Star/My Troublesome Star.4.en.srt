but I'm indeed that Lim Se Ra.

(Resident Registration Card, Bong Chung Ja)

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,600
But when I woke up, I had turned into...

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,600
a shooting star overnight...

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,270
and crashed.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,040
And I went crashing...

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,610
straight to rock bottom.

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,780
I'm going to go back...

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,980

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,050
Did you find the culprit?

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,620
Well...

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,720
I will.

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,860
I'll find them.

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,030
I was scared.

31
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,030
Thank you for saying that.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,370
Well...

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,310
I'm not just saying it.

34
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,410
I promise.

35
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,490
You came all this way at this hour just to say that?

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,200
Well...

37
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,770
I'm glad you're okay.

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
I mean it.

39
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,110
I think something got in my eye while I was running here.

40
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,730
Lim Se Ra resurfaced.

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,110
No way.

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,940

After everything I've done...

47
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,890
to get here...

Thanks to your love, trust, and support,

57
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,580
I was able to win the Best Actress at Cannes...

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,990
Yes.

59
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,200
- Go Hui Yeong is here! - Go Hui Yeong!

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,929
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,399
- Congratulations! - Give the camera a wave!

62
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,699
Did you expect to win Best Actress at Cannes?

63
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,799
Go Hui Yeong, please look over here too.

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,139
You've gone from Korea's beloved actress to a world-class star.

65
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,210
- How do you feel? - Over here!

66
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,580
I began my career...

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,940
in the industry 30 years ago with a small acting role.

68
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,680
Winning the prestigious Best Actress at Cannes...

69
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
Gosh, what can I say?

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,190
I'm more nervous now than when I gave my acceptance speech.

71
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,190
You've got to be kidding me.

72
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,700
It's a miracle.

73
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes, it's a miracle indeed.

74
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,830
This miracle was only possible...

75
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,670
thanks to all of you.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,770
Thanks to your trust, love, and support,

77
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,440
this once minor actor, Go Hui Yeong,

78
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,579
has finally...

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,150
I, Lim Se Ra, have finally...

80
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,720
- made it this far. - made it this far.

85

I owe it all to you.

86
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,729
- Thank you. - That crazy little...

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,630
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,929
- Congratulations! - Look over here!

89
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,040
She copied my award acceptance speech to the letter.

90
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,470
Thank you.

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,140
You copycat. You mean witch!

92

Hui Yeong.

93
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,670
I came here myself to escort the Queen of Cannes.

94
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,710
You really are impressive. Gosh.

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,679
- Hey, you. - Yes, sir.

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,740
She must be cold. Get her a jacket or something.

97
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,650
You punk.

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,750
All right.

99
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,020
I'll give you a smooth and comfortable ride.

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,559
Those were good days...

101
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,220
when you were always in the driver's seat.

102
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,760
I miss the days when you were always riding in the backseat behind me.

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,900
Who would have thought you'd take Cannes by storm?

104
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,600
Bravo! Well done.

105
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,200
You've risen so high that it's impossible to even look up at you.

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,370
That's why I left that thing right in front of you. Take a look.

107
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,320
Through the layers of time we've shared,

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,860
there's a solid foundation of faith, friendship, and trust.

109
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,259
Isn't that right?

110
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,260
I believe there's something else too.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,100
Let's confidently lock in a ten-year contract...

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,700
and put all the rest behind us.

113
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,770
I wasn't the one who stirred up all that old dust.

114
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,810
- You did. - All right.

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,170
I'll give you three percent more in stock options.

116
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,680
With the company going public soon, I'm giving you a generous gift.

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,280
Because we're like family, right?

118
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,120
Of course, I know. Like family.

119
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,220

Someone is filing charges?

121
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,690
I am Lim Se Ra,

122
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,860
but I'm not really Lim Se Ra.

123
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,060
So please look into it again...

124
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,130
Pardon me?

125
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,800
Someone's filing charges against Bong Chung Ja?

126
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,570
Who?

Assaulting a minor?

136
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,670
What? I didn't even hit her.

137
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,609
I spilled some kkakdugi on her. That's all.

138
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,709
Even throwing water on someone may be legally considered assault.

139
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,179
Forget assault charges for a second.

140
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,949
It can't be property damage.

141
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,579
It's just a bag. They can just wash it.

142
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,049
It's not "just a bag." It's from a luxury brand.

143
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,390
It's a limited-edition bag.

144
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,059
Have you checked whether that bag is...

145
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,489
authentic or a knockoff?

146
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,459
Ever since that girl had kkakdugi dumped on her,

147
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,329
she's been so traumatized she hasn't been able to go to school.

148
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,060
The bigger problem is that she can't even go to her academies.

149
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,629
The victim's mother is fuming mad.

150
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,900
That girl...

151
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,669
gave me a nasty look from the start,

152
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,340
like I smelled bad or something.

153
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,970
So did you dump kkakdugi on her on purpose?

154
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,510
Whether it was intentional or not is important.

155
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,240
"Intentional?"

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,509
Both property damage and assault charges...

157
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,420
require intent to be valid.

158
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,919
If there was tension between you two prior to the incident,

159
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,649
it suggests it was deliberate.

160
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,190
My goodness. Mister!

161
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,790
Do I look like such an unreasonable young lady to you?

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,230
I need to stay calm.

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,670
If I get convicted...

164
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,100
before I even regain my memory...

165
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,510
First, I need to face the facts.

166
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,170
I'm no longer that Lim Se Ra.

167
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,540
If I raise my voice,

168
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,810
they'll just think I'm a rude old lady.

169
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,890
Detective.

170
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,560
This is so unfair.

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,970
As you can tell from my address,

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,170
I don't even have a home.

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm currently living in a gosiwon.

174
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,210
I was already struggling with money,

175
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,510
and then I had a car accident on top of it.

176
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm working at the cafeteria...

177
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,620
to survive day by day.

178
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,720
Why would I intentionally waste such valuable kkakdugi...

179
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,490
that I treasure like my own life?

180
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,660
Do you know what went into making that batch of kkakdugi?

181
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
I was on my feet all day,

182
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,300
rinsing, chopping, and mixing the radish to make it.

183
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,970
It was precious food to me.

184
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,680
The bus suddenly braked hard,

185
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,590
and I fell down.

186
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,060
I get that it scared that girl,

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,300
but can you really compare that to my despair over losing...

188
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,300
my precious kkakdugi that I could've eaten for days?

189
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,370
The kkakdugi sounds precious indeed.

190
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,110
It sounds way more precious than a luxury bag.

191
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,740
Don't cry.

192
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,080
Without intentionality, the charges won't stand at all.

193
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,750
Really?

194
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,250
Claiming damages through a civil case is possible,

195
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,620
so try to talk things through with the victim.

196
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,960
Thank you, Detective.

197
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,029
(Police)

198
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,540
(Criminal Investigation Department)

199
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,550
Where have you been? I've been trying to call you.

200
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,909
I worked the night shift and came straight here as soon as I woke up.

201
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,220
Come on. What's going on?

202
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,790
What's this? "Complaint"

203
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,190
"Kkakdugi?"

204
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,859
Did you use kkakdugi to assault someone?

205
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,919
No, I did not.

206
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,889
- Then it's fine. - No, it's not fine.

207
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,359
This won't even stand without proof of intent.

208
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,399
I made it through Round One with my acting skills.

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,830
I'll need your help for Round Two.

210
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,930
What do you mean by Round Two?

211
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,419
Ever since that day, my daughter has been receiving therapy.

212
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,989
She has panic attacks at the sight of kkakdugi and can't get any sleep.

213
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,190
Because of her kkakdugi trauma, she can't even study now.

214
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,659
How will you take responsibility for ruining my daughter's life?

215
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,960
What will you do about it?

216
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,030
Gosh, I see.

217
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,070
I never knew kkakdugi could be so scary.

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Ma'am.

219
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,810
But saying your child's life has been ruined over this is a bit...

220
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,279
At a glance, I can see what kind of situation you're in,

221
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,809
so I tried to be kind and handle this by talking it out.

222
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,349
But that won't work. I'll have to take legal action.

223
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,379
Ma'am, please. That won't be necessary.

224
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
Ma'am.

225
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:07,480
(Dokgo Cheol, Seoul Police)

226
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,420
Please don't be so angry.

227
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,290
Please be kind and forgive her just this once. I sincerely implore you.

228
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,630
So what if you're a cop? What do you want from me?

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't want anything from you.

230
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,129
Goodness.

231
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,830
I see you noticed my police badge.

232
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,529
Ma'am. I need you to take a look at something first.

233
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,299
I have security footage from that day.

234
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,500
Here, look.

235
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,210
Originally, it was falling at a 35° angle,

236
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,909
but when your daughter tapped it with her hand...

237
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,939
Look.

238
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,210
It shifted slightly by about 15°. Did you see that?

239
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,480
- No. - Here.

240
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,720
The resolution is too low for me to see anything.

241
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,450
In any case, I sent this footage to our lab.

242
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,360
As per the angle expert belonging to the National Forensic Service,

243
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,660
- this is... - What?

244
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,559
There's such an expert?

245
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,730
Is there really such a thing as an angle expert?

246
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,430
Well...

247
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,700
I guess she doesn't know.

248
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,240
Ma'am. The National Forensic Service has experts for everything.

249
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,040
Anyway, according to that expert,

250
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,940
this wasn't intentional at all.

251
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,050
The kkakdugi just flew off and burst open.

252
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,180
Ms. Bong here lost her grip on the kkakdugi,

253
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,179
and your daughter tapped it with her hand.

254
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,320
Then it flew into the pole and burst.

255
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
That's what happened.

256
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,820
But do cops...

257
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,430
have this much time on their hands these days?

258
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,159
You got the security footage...

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,799
and sent it to the National Forensic Service...

260
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,969
for something like this?

261
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,100
My point, exactly!

262
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,240
Must you make such a fuss over something like this?

263
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,480
Ms. Bong deeply regrets what happened.

264
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,710
Also, she told me on our way here...

265
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,520
that she decided to quit kkakdugi.

266
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,220
She loves it, but she promised she'd never eat it again.

267
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,990
Right?

268
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,120
You promised earlier, right?

269
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,689
If I catch you eating kkakdugi one more time,

270
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,390
I'll teach you a lesson.

271
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,960
Ma'am, please forgive her.

272
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,940
Please read this over and sign here.

273
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,070
I beg you.

274
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,010
Here. You can use this.

275
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,620
That was quite a show.

276
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,520
When did you get the security footage from the bus?

277
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,660
As soon as you called me.

278
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Let's go. I'm treating you to a nice meal today.

279
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,200
Since I have a conscience, I can't do that knowing how broke you are.

280
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,040
Come on. I can afford that much.

281
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,210
Let's go.

282
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,279
All right. Let's eat.

283
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,310
Goodness.

284
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,380
Enjoy.

285
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,080
I told you I'd treat you to something nice.

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,990
This place is famous. Try it.

287
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,160
Have you tried this?

288
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,420
I've had it just once.

289
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,800
It feels like it was just a few days ago,

290
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,960
but it was actually 25 years ago.

291
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,440
When?

292
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,870
Once, I visited Busan.

293
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,610
The pork gukbap I had in Busan...

294
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,910
was to die for.

295
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,850
(Gukbap)

296
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,130
Hold on.

297
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,200
Put in salted shrimp instead of the spicy paste.

298
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,100
It keeps the broth clean and tasty.

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,840
Don't you eat salted shrimp?

300
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,080
It's not that.

301
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,210
It's nothing.

302
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,710
Try it.

303
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,160
By the way,

304
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,300
do you really want to make a comeback?

305
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,000
I feel like my acting skills have come back already.

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,170
You should regain your memory first. Why think about your acting skills?

307
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,269
You should've seen me...

308
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,680
flaunting my acting skills at the police station earlier.

309
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,610
The detectives knew it was an act, but they were just playing along.

310
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,450
You promised to help me. Are you backing out now?

311
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,920
In your current state, you can't...

312
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,960
Too much time has passed for you to go back to acting.

313
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,160
Put your worries to rest.

314
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,530
My family members have become powerhouses in the industry.

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,830
If they're trustworthy, why didn't they get in touch for 25 years?

316
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,240
Gosh, seriously...

317
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you spoiling my plan before I even get started?

318
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,170
No. All right.

319
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,510
Let's eat first.

320
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,290
Careful.

321
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,400
You used to cover yourself with a hat, mask, and sunglasses.

322
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,900
Why don't you anymore?

323
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,970
Are you making fun of me right now?

324
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,510
No, it's not that.

325
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,840
I mean, who knows? Someone might recognise you.

326
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,250
In the past, I had to cover up just to walk down the street.

327
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,720
Now, people look at me strangely, so I stopped wearing them.

328
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,690
Hey. You have a mask, right?

329
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,920
Wear it. The fine dust levels are high these days.

330
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,760
All right.

331
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,730
Goodness.

332
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,730
Well...

333
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,899
Put these on to protect your eyes.

334
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,499
What's with you? I told you no one recognises me.

335
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,100
It's not that.

336
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,770
- The UV rays can hurt your eyes... - Seriously!

337
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,110
Forget it.

338
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,880
(Will)

339
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,810
It's not your fault.

340
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,450
You did nothing wrong.

341
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,420
I will catch those scumbags. Okay?

342
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,930
Do you promise?

343
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,200
I do.

344
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,070
So don't worry.

345
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,790
Did you find the culprit?

346
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,820
I'll find them.

347
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,690
I'm glad you're okay.

348
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,300
I mean it.

349
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,920
(Minnat Salon)

350
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Gosh.

351
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,900
("Jewellery Store Girl")

352
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,880
Welcome.

353
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,280
Did you make an appointment?

354
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,420
I'm here to meet someone.

355
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,420
Did you make an appointment with them?

356
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,650
No, but I'm sure she'll come if you call her.

357
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,320
May I know the name?

358
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,860
It's Tae Sook. Min Tae Sook.

359
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,760
You mean the director?

360
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,870
Who is she?

361
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,170
She's here to meet the director.

362
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,040
I'm sorry. Our director's schedule is packed.

363
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,540
It's hard to meet her without an appointment.

364
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,380
Could you make an appointment next time?

365
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,350
I'd love to, but I don't know her number.

366
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,820
I'll do that if you give me her number.

367
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,390
Our director doesn't have time to meet with just anyone.

368
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,890
I'm not...

369
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,060
just anyone.

370
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,100
It's problematic if every Tom, Dick, and Harry wanted to meet her.

371
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,759
Enlarge the "No Soliciting" sign and hang it up again.

372
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,830
Understood.

373
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,070
You!

374
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,440
Do you mean me?

375
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,440
That's right. You.

376
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,210
What did you just say?

377
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,780
"Every Tom, Dick, and Harry?"

378
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,920
Do I look like a Tom or Dick to you?

379
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,390
Keep this up, and we'll call the police.

380
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,760
Be my guest. I know a police officer myself.

381
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,790
- I'll call him. - Why don't you come back with him?

382
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,860
Leave already.

383
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,059
- What are you doing? - Did you just push me?

384
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,130
Drag her out at once.

385
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,159
- What do you think you're doing? - Leave.

386
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,599
- Go check with Min Tae Sook. - Leave already.

387
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
- She won't move. - Drag her out.

388
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,039
- Shut her mouth. - Please be quiet.

389
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,170
- Min Tae Sook! - What's all this fuss about?

390
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,770
Oh, dear.

391
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,110
Min Tae Sook?

392
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,620
What's going on?

393
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,949
I told this woman she couldn't,

394
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,050
but she kept insisting on meeting you.

395
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,220
- Who is she? - A lunatic.

396
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
It's me.

397
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
Don't you remember me?

398
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,230
No. Who are you?

399
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Tae Sook.

400
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,500
It's me,

401
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,540
Se Ra.

402
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,200
What was that? "Se Ra?"

403
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,840
Yes, it's me.

404
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,140
It's Lim Se Ra.

405
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,410
Whether you're Se Ra or Lim Se Ra, I've never met you...

406
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,690
Lim Se Ra?

407
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,529
You must be out of your mind. Call the police.

408
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,030
No, she seems unwell. Call an ambulance.

409
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,870
- It's me. - Ma'am.

410
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,109
If you're Lim Se Ra,

411
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,069
I could be Kim Tae Hee or Jun Ji Hyun.

412
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,680
Who are you trying to fool?

413
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,279
Salt the place after she's gone.

414
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,880
Tae Sook, it's me.

415
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,610
Tae Sook, it's me!

416
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,720
Tae Sook! It's me.

417
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,550
Hold on. Tae Sook!

418
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,050
When Nam Ju rejected you,

419
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,460
who splashed juice in his face?

420
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,940
When you were bawling your eyes out because he cheated with his stylist,

421
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,210
who had the script changed...

422
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,340
so that he got beaten to a pulp?

423
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,150
Se...

424
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,180
Se Ra?

425
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,990
That's right. It's me.

426
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,390
I'm Lim Se Ra.

427
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,430
Oh, my gosh.

428
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,260
This...

429
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,930
This is impossible.

430
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,640
Se Ra...

431
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,670
What on earth happened to you?

432
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,640
Tae Sook...

433
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,180
Se Ra.

434
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,520
I can't believe this.

435
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,149
Se Ra.

436
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,960
Is it really you, Se Ra?

437
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,960
What do you mean you don't remember?

438
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,300
I remember heading back home after winning...

439
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,500
- the award at the ceremony. - Okay.

440
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,070
And the car got into an accident.

441
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,180
But when I woke up,

442
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,180
twenty-five years had passed.

443
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,350
Are you...

444
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,649
Are you saying you lost your memories?

445
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,850
Memories from the past 25 years?

446
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,030
Unbelievable.

447
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,629
Do you know how much I looked for you...

448
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,760
when you disappeared after the accident?

449
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,070
Thinking you might have done the unthinkable...

450
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,369
or been tricked by someone into doing something bad,

451
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,470
I was terribly worried. Do you even know?

452
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,340
You've become really pretty.

453
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,650
And you've lost so much weight.

454
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Really?

455
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,990
My dear Se Ra. Goodness.

456
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,790
You used to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

457
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,800
But what's this? How upsetting.

458
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,200
Tae Sook.

459
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,600
What's the matter?

460
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,110
Ms. Min has a guest.

461
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
Doesn't she always have a guest?

462
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,880
- Ask her to step out. - Ms. Min is acting strange.

463
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,680
Should I say that she's overreacting more than usual?

464
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,350
- Is it a guy? - No, it's a woman.

465
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,650
Who is she?

466
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,520
What was her name again?

467
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,360
Se Na? Se Ri?

468
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,220
Right. Se Ra.

469
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,630
"Se Ra?"

470
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,459
The only Se Ra I know is Lim Se Ra.

471
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,700
You're right. It was Lim Se Ra.

472
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,630
What?

473
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,700
Is it really Lim Se Ra?

474
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,940
Who are you?

475
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,610
Come on. Don't you recognise him?

476
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,550
- What? - It's Nam Ju.

477
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,850
What?

478
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,990
The guy you poured juice on and beat to a pulp.

479
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,930
He's my husband.

480
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,670
What?

481
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,240
Every single moment with you...

482
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,779
was the happiest I've ever known.

483
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,449
- You little... - "You little?"

484
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,580
How dare you!

485
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,980
- No way! - No way!

486
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,660
How did you end up marrying that arrogant Nam Ju?

487
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,040
Did he threaten you? Answer me.

488
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,840
I got pregnant.

489
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,310
- What? - I got pregnant, okay?

490
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,540
Good grief.

491
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,549
I told you to run it by me before dating anyone, didn't I?

492
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,880
But you were gone.

493
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,519
Did I not contact you after the accident?

494
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,950
It wasn't only me.

495
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,789
None of the journalists trying to get a scoop...

496
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,319
could get a single piece of information.

497
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,560
You went completely AWOL.

498
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,200
No way.

499
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,199
What in the world happened to me?

500
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,330
Exactly.

501
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,200
That doesn't matter.

502
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,540
I'm going to make a comeback.

503
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,770
Why?

504
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,810
- "Why?" - Why after all this time?

505
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,910
Come on. I'm Lim Se Ra.

506
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,809
Go Hui Yeong even won Best Actress at Cannes.

507
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,179
I can't let myself live such a miserable life.

508
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,220
Exactly.

509
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,150
You've been living a miserable life until now, so why...

510
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I mean...

511
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,520
A quiet life.

512
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,060
So why now?

513
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,870
- I need the money. - Seriously, Se Ra.

514
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,300
If that's what it was, you should've told me sooner.

515
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,700
Money? I'll lend it to you.

516
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,710
You know me, don't you?

517
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,180
I became famous the moment I debuted...

518
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
and dominated the advertisement world.

519
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,410
From cars and phones to mobile carriers,

520
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,310
snacks, and ice cream.

521
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,549
I topped the ad ratings for seven years in a row, you know?

522
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,320
That was ages ago.

523
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,030
I have no idea where all that money disappeared to.

524
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,200
Does it make sense that Lim Se Ra, the nation's sweetheart,

525
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,529
would just vanish without a proper retirement piece,

526
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,640
- as if she were running away? - No, it doesn't.

527
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,310
There must've been a reason you disappeared like that.

528
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,939
I don't remember.

529
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,180
Goodness.

530
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,979
- My glass is empty. - Right.

531
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
One glass of beer, please.

532
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,050
Se Ra. The industry isn't what it used to be anymore.

533
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,889
My husband was unemployed until now.

534
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,720
It took him years before he finally got cast.

535
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,190
But in a daily soap, not even a mini-series.

536
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,460
That jerk Nam Ju...

537
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,670
Your husband...

538
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,940
looks terrible now. Seriously.

539
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,770
Wasn't he at least handsome back then?

540
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,140
He was, wasn't he?

541
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,510
How could someone change that much?

542
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,580
Seriously, I couldn't recognise him.

543
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,480
He's aged terribly.

544
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,790
And he even gained so much weight. Unbelievable.

545
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,559
To think that unrivalled Lim Se Ra...

546
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,860
would show up with that outrageous hair.

547
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,660
I don't think I'd even recognise her if I saw her on the street.

548
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,070
Why are you doing it, honey?

549
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,369
It's been a while.

550
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,910
So how about a family meeting?

551
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,240
Who calls a family meeting while holding a pair of scissors?

552
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Oh, right.

553
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:01,280
How's that South African sapphire mine you invested in last time?

554
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,249
The sapphires are being mined.

555
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,590
I see. So it's still being mined.

556
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,160
Keep going. You might find a gem or two that's worth something.

557
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,830
Why the negativity?

558
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,429
Then what about that Namhae Residential Complex Project...

559
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,800
you sank our fortune into after dreaming of hitting the jackpot?

560
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,269
That one...

561
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,509
The greenbelt hasn't been settled yet.

562
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,639
Oh, my gosh. I didn't know that matter was still ongoing.

563
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,710
Really.

564
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,520
I've learned a lot working with Se Ra for ten years.

565
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,990
Why would you bring her up?

566
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,960
You recall Se Ra's father always causing trouble?

567
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,189
Apparently, doing business is a disease,

568
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,630
like gambling addiction or a compulsive affair.

569
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,130
A chronic disease that can never be cured.

570
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,200
No. Mine can be cured...

571
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,099
once I hit the jackpot.

572
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,110
Is that so?

573
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,810
My question is, why must you invest...

574
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,680
and hit the jackpot with my money?

575
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,819
Why?

576
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,490
When will you come to your senses?

577
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,770
How can you get in the way of your husband's future?

578
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,369
My upcoming role is a singer-songwriter with long hair.

579
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,439
My hair... What will you do about it?

580
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,240
Gosh. it's such a perfect match with your true self.

581
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,539
A singer-songwriter with long hair is gutsy but jobless,

582
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,639
just like you.

583
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,750
- Hey! - What?

584
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,080
Don't forget to mention Se Ra.

585
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,049
I'm just an option myself. How could I bring someone along?

586
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,590
I can barely take care of myself.

587
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,390
You can still introduce her to others.

588
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,059
Why Lim Se Ra of all people?

589
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,089
No.

590
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,060
She'll be using her real name, not Lim Se Ra.

591
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,660
Well...

592
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,499
Bong Chung Ja does suit her better.

593
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,970
I'm not the perfect match. She is.

594
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,600
Anyway, get her a role. Okay?

595
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
Or else, I'm retrieving the business funds.

596
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,039
The resolution is insane.

597
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,340
You can even see the pores. This is bad.

598
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,520
Yes, Tae Sook?

599
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,520
Mission complete.

600
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,990
I got one?

601
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,990
Oh, my gosh.

602
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,290
Thank you so much, Tae Sook.

603
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,730
I promise I'll make a successful comeback and repay your kindness.

604
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,630
I'll repay you a million times over.

605
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,870
Think of my husband and do a good job.

606
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,939
Of course, I know how good you are at acting.

607
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
But still, okay?

608
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,200
Okay. I promise.

609
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,470
All right. Thanks. Bye.

610
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,630
- Ji Eun. - Yes?

611
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,630
Save these two.

612
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,830
They're for Hui Yeong when she's on The Newsroom.

613
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,470
Is she appearing on The Newsroom?

614
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,899
She won at Cannes.

615
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,070
People wouldn't want her on just The Newsroom.

616
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,610
This is pretty too.

617
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,410
But it won't match Hui Yeong's personal colour.

618
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,479
Find out if they have a darker one.

619
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Okay.

(Where could Lim Se Ra have gone? Lim Se Ra's former makeup artist)

626
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,000
It's absurd that I have no idea if she survived that accident.

627
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,100
It's a lifetime regret even now.

628
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,469
I had other work that day,

629
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,109
but why didn't the other staff members ride the van with her?

630
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,680
I'm dying to know too.

631
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,580
Just thinking about it makes me furious. Goodness.

632
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,949
Seriously.

633
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,549

could she have avoided the accident?

In scene 34 of episode 13, there is a housekeeper.

I know an actress who fits this role.

695
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,500
- She's perfect for it. - So what?

696
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,799
That's why I'm recommending her.

697
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,500
So you, a supporting actor, are trying to pitch someone in?

698
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
It's just a housekeeper role.

699
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,340
But that housekeeper has more lines than you.

00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,080

It'd be bad if she stood out too much.

- "A housekeeper?" - What? Do you hate it?

707
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,930
Of course not.

708
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,830

I'd be happy with housekeeper 18 too.

Dolling you up would've been tough.

713
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,280
It's true that I don't look my best right now.

Hello. Please... Gosh.

901
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,970
What brings you here, Hui Yeong?

902
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,980
Which is more surprising? That I'm here or that you are?

903
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,580
Oh, me? I'm working the room.

904
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,950
I see. You're the director of the biggest salon in Gangnam.

905
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,120
I guess coming to the shoot is part of the job too.

906
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,459
Yes. It's for VIPs. You know how it is.

907
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,919
Hui Yeong. Take this.

908
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,230
It's from the place you like.

909
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,300
Have a good day today. Good luck.

910
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,599
Hello. I skipped you earlier, didn't I?

911
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,700
Please take good care of her.

912
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,800
Hello.

913
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,340
("Love Is Not a Crime")

914
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,210
How dare you come after my place?

915
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,980
Get out.

916
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,250
Get out of my sight!

917
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,060
Ma'am.

918
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,160
Let go of me.

919
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,800
Let go!

920
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,830
Cut.

921
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,170
Great. Let's review the footage.

922
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,040
Was it good?

923
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,539
Gosh, her gaze is just spot on.

924
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,540
Director.

925
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,380
She's pretty good considering she was a last-minute hire, right?

926
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,079
Your acting was great.

927
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,189
This time, engage a little more when you try to stop her.

928
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,250
And add a new line, "Your husband will be home soon."

929
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:40,920
A new line?

930
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,260
You can do that, right?

931
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,459
Yes. Of course.

932
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,990
Okay. Let's have another take.

933
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,700
"Your husband will be home soon."

934
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,230
"Your husband will be home soon."

935
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:54,900
Ma'am.

936
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,870
Let go of me.

937
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,739
Your husband will be home soon.

938
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
I told you to let go.

939
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,450
- Did she really slap her? - Cut.

940
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,250
That looked so real.

941
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,620
It's been a while since I slapped anyone. I'm losing my touch.

942
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,319
My gosh. I see now where your power for a hole in one comes from.

943
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,390
Nice.

944
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,190
Director Ju. Let's try this again.

945
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,060
I might have clenched my teeth too hard when I shook off her hands.

946
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,670
Didn't you see some wrinkles?

947
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,270
I think it looked good.

948
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,970
Okay.

949
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,870
Let's roll again.

950
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,110
Let's try again.

951
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,250
Ma'am. Your husband will be home soon.

952
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,680
I told you to let go of me.

953
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,690
I missed it, didn't I?

954
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,220
Let's try again. Roll again.

955
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,990
Are you all right?

956
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,100
Let go of me.

957
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,340
Cut. Okay.

958
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,010
That was great. Let's go to the next scene.

959
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,750
No. Let's do it again!

960
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,220
That crazy...

961
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,350
Don't do anything.

962
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:16,949
Let go. That lunatic...

963
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,589
- keeps on doing that. - My gosh.

964
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,820
She's divorcing her husband, so she's a little sensitive.

965
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,990
- Again? - Yes.

966
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,329
But why is she taking it out on Chung Ja?

967
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,100
- Be quiet. - My gosh.

968
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,230
Let go!

969
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Cut.

970
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,639
I think we have enough takes for this scene.

971
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,710
Why?

972
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,180
I haven't been on a roll like this in a while.

973
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,290
Let's try one last time.

974
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,890
One last time.

975
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,220
Unbelievable.

976
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,590
Hui Yeong. We really have to get going now. It's time.

977
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,280
Let's go. That's enough.

978
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,150
Get up.

979
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,620
What are you doing here?

980
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,220
Come on.

981
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
Who are you?

982
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,160
- What are you doing? - I should be asking you!

983
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,660
What is this?

984
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,600
- What's going on? - I don't know.

985
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,040
Wait. I'm not done with my scene.

986
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,240
You just approved the take, right?

987
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,880
Then you're done. Come with me.

988
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,980
- Hold on. - Just come out already.

989
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,550
Wait.

990
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,290
Who is he?

991
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,840
(Epilogue)

992
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,010
When's our next rest stop break?

993
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,949
We're not even on the expressway yet.

994
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,309
Besides, you've been eating the whole time.

995
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,180
Wait. You're still eating.

996
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,379
This is just a snack.

997
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,220
I didn't get to have a proper lunch today.

998
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,590
Let's eat first.

999
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,790
You're the best, Se Ra.

1000
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,859
Gosh, no. We can't do that.

1001
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,459
We're already running late.

1002
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,330
Since we're running late anyway, we can eat first.

1003
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,899
- What... - Se Ra.

1004
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,039
I want to eat ribs, milmyeon,

1005
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,209
gukbap, mulhoe, hotteok...

1006
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,569
Yes, and some fishcakes too.

1007
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,139
Just pick one.

1008
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,279
Is she possessed by a beggar or something?

1009
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,550
She does she eat so much?

1010
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,149
Se Ra. This is the most famous and authentic restaurant in Busan.

1011
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,219
We could've gone to any restaurant. Why did you bring us here?

1012
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,020
We're here anyway. Let's enjoy the meal.

1013
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,159
This restaurant has milmyeon, your favourite.

1014
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,989
My gosh. Welcome.

1015
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,599
- Come inside, pretty lady. - Hello.

1016
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,459
- Isn't that Lim Se Ra? - Where?

1017
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,429
- Yes, it's Lim Se Ra. - I can't believe this.

1018
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,729
- No way. - Goodness.

1019
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,669
Funny running into you here.

1020
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,900
What are you doing here?

1021
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,070
- Are you here to have milmyeon? - Yes.

1022
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,179
When you're in Busan, you ought to try pork gukbap.

1023
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,549
Don't you agree, guys?

1024
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,249
- Of course. - That's right.

1025
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,179
- This place is legit. - It is legit.

1026
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,550
That's right. Busan is famous for gukbap.

1027
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,449
- My gosh. - Let's go.

1028
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,019
You jerk! You good-for-nothing jerk.

1029
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,929
How dare you steal my customers? They were about to come in.

1030
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,359
I ought to push someone like you into the deep ocean.

1031
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,960
Even that won't do you justice. My gosh, that jerk.

1032
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,669
By the way, the owner of the milmyeon restaurant...

1033
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,440
said some pretty harsh things to you.

1034
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,410
Oh, her? It's fine.

1035
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,940
She's my mom.

1036
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,649
Then the restaurant earlier...

1037
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,420
Yes. That's my mother's restaurant.

1038
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,090
Stop!

1039
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
- What is it? - What are you doing?

1040
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,760
You almost ruined it.

1041
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,999
- Ruin it? - The pork gukbap from Busan...

1042
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,270
has the deepest broth. That's why...

1043
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,270
you need to add only a bit of salted shrimps.

1044
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,770
That'll make it taste amazing.

1045
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,380
Try it.

1046
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,750
Right.

1047
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,620
This tastes...

1048
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,120
Why? Does it taste bad?

1049
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,730
It tastes amazing.

1050
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,860
Right?

1051
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,269
I knew it.

1052
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,099
Add some rice to the soup too.

1053
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,130
Add a lot of it.

1054
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,700
- All right. What? - Okay.

1055
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,470
Can we order suyuk too?

1056
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,810
Would you like some suyuk too?

1057
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,980
Sure.

1058
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,310
Ma'am, give us a plate of suyuk too.

1059
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,880
Make that two!

1060
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,859
Oh, no. Wait!

1061
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,690
Hold on a second! Stop!

1062
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:27,900
Ms. Lim.

1063
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,330
Here you go. Make sure to eat this.

1064
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,230
And I'll see you again.

1065
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,010
Go ahead!

1066
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,809
Go back to Seoul safely!

1067
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,440
(Best Pork Gukbap)

1068
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,640
Drive safely!

1069
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,809
My goodness.

1070
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,509
Why don't you take care of your own mother that dearly?

1071
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,620
You punk.

1072
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,390
Look at you being ridiculous. Goodness.

1073
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,149
My gosh.

1074
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,290
You're still acting like a fool.

1075
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,130
Gosh, that punk.

1076
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,500
What's that?

1077
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,940
It's peppermint candy. That looks good.

1078
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,210
I wish I had some. Can I have half?

1079
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,840
Se Ra?

1080
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:16,810
Who am I talking to?

1081
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,020
(To Best Pork Gukbap, Lim Se Ra)

1082
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:36,530
(Best Pork Gukbap)

1083
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,440
(To Best Pork Gukbap, Lim Se Ra)

1084
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,910
(My Troublesome Star)

1085
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,950
What's your relationship with her?

1086
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,779
There's only so much you can investigate...

1087
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,290
while following a celebrity.

1088
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,489
He's my...

1089
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,490
I'm her manager.

1090
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,330
The woman from earlier, Tae Sook. Is she trustworthy?

1091
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,090
Don't trust anyone for now.

1092
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,299
There was something I wanted to ask...

1093
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,860
ever since I found you.

1094
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,630
A month ago at the Obong Intersection...

1095
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,900
What are you getting at?

1096
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,700
If you happen to find him, do call me.

1097
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,210
I got into the accident after meeting him.

1098
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,840
And it happened again.
