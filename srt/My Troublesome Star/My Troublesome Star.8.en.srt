(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

13
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,541
Wait, why did you bring me here?

14
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,511
The story broke.

15
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,410
How did this happen?

16
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,380
The reporters are coming back.

17
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,681
We have to go. Hurry.

18
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,661
- Ms. Lim Se Ra.
- Ms. Lim Se Ra.

19
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:06,721
You're Lim Se Ra, aren't you?

20
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:08,760
Ms. Lim, why use a different name?

21
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,730
You've been going by Bong Chung Ja, is that correct?

22
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:12,130
- Ms. Lim, please look here.
- Please, just say something!

23
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,400
After vanishing since the accident,

24
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,371
did you come back just because you were struggling?

25
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:16,900
Please answer us.

26
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:18,771
So you're Bong Chung Ja, but you're really Lim Se Ra, right?

27
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,040
- You're Lim Se Ra, aren't you?
- What?

28
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,771
No pictures.

29
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:23,311
Just a moment.

30
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,611
You can run, right?

31
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,081
- What?
- On three, we run.

32
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:30,451
How? The reporters are everywhere.

33
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,651
One,

34
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,521
two, three!

35
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:35,921
Move away!

36
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,441
(Episode 8)

37
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,611
Where are we?

38
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:38,521
My place.

39
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,851
Why your place?

40
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,320
Well, you never know.

41
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,061
They might follow you to your gosiwon.

42
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:46,461
Hurry, get out.

43
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,041
No one's looking.

44
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,480
Oh, wait a second.

45
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,410
- Okay?
- It's okay.

46
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:11,681
I know it's messy when men live alone.

47
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,051
Just a minute. Hold on.

48
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,331
Darn it.

49
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,561
Can I come in now?

50
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,890
Yes.

51
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:53,961
I'll be right there.

52
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:55,761
I'm coming.

53
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,401
It's done.

54
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,961
It's done.

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,131
Come in.

56
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,741
Over there.

57
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:13,811
Want something to drink?

58
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,080
- Just water.
- Water it is.

59
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,151
Okay.

60
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,261
Here.

61
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,231
Thanks.

62
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,241
Okay, what do I do now?

63
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:45,281
You look flustered. Why don't you sit down?

64
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,110
Oh, should I?

65
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,181
Okay.

66
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,191
Hey, why are you on the floor when there's a couch right there?

67
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,090
Oh, I rarely sit on the couch.

68
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,160
It's more of a backrest.

69
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,461
Like this.

70
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,630
Oh, I see.

71
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,970
So that's your routine.

72
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,831
Sitting right there, having a drink, and watching TV.

73
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,001
How did you know?

74
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,571
What else is a bachelor to do at home?

75
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:36,931
Should we watch TV?

76
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:38,461
Sure.

77
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,931
Wait!

78
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:48,771
Wait.

79
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,281
Hey, for the time being,

80
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,781
maybe we shouldn't watch TV.

81
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,851
Okay?

82
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,451
Why not?

83
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,460
Well, you never know.

84
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,830
If you pop up on the news again,

85
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,831
it'll just make you feel bad.

86
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:18,601
This whole situation is absurd.

87
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,411
How so?

88
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,111
Right after the accident,

89
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:28,451
it felt so strange that nobody recognised me.

90
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:32,251
Like Alice in Wonderland.

91
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,791
But...

92
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,761
But to be recognised again after just a few months...

93
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,731
It feels so awkward.

94
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,301
You'll get used to it in no time.

95
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:52,070
My only worry is...

96
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,171
I know.

97
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,111
How people will react.

98
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,541
I know what to expect.

99
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,781
To all the people expecting the old Lim Se Ra,

100
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,791
the way I am now...

101
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,961
must be such a disappointment.

102
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:24,571
The truth is, the real Lim Se Ra is even more pathetic.

103
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:31,180
You wouldn't know this, Detective,

104
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:33,811
but I was really nasty and selfish.

105
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,251
What Go Hui Yeong said...

106
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,421
That's Lim Se Ra.

107
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,761
The mess you're in now.

108
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,791
You brought it all on yourself.

109
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,491
You did this to yourself.

110
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,901
She must've resented me so much...

111
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,570
that even after 25 years,

112
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,811
she still holds a grudge.

113
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,611
And who knows?

114
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,411
There might be others besides her.

115
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,321
People hurt by my entitlement and arrogance...

116
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:15,191
might still hate me to this day.

117
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,361
Even the person who tried to kill me...

118
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,330
Maybe that's why.

119
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:26,431
No.

120
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,671
The Lim Se Ra I know would never be like that.

121
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,571
How would you know, Detective?

122
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,811
You didn't even know me back then.

123
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:40,610
I deal with violent criminals every day.

124
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,451
So I'm surrounded by crazy people.

125
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,221
I can tell just by looking into someone's eyes.

126
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:49,891
Maybe you hurt people by accident, like a stone thrown without thought.

127
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,321
But you're not the type to throw a stone on purpose.

128
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,531
Back then and now,

129
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,201
you seem the same to me.

130
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,111
Are you saying you're not a fan of me...

131
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:17,751
both then and now?

132
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,990
What? Not a fan?

133
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:25,390
- When did I ever say that?
- You said it back then.

134
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,660
When you had drinks with Tae Sook.

135
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,291
You said you really weren't a fan of Lim Se Ra's.

136
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,160
When did I say, "Really?"

137
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:36,230
I just said I wasn't a fan back then.

138
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,241
- I never said...
- It's the same thing.

139
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:39,300
What's the difference?

140
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,710
You kept putting down the rookie detective.

141
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,941
So what if I praise or critique him?

142
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,881
What's it to you, Detective?

143
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,810
Come on, it does concern me.

144
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:50,881
It's...

145
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:55,851
I mean, the thing is...

146
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,521
Right.

147
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,421
I guess so.

148
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,400
I mean, as a fellow detective...

149
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,931
A sense of humiliation, you know?

150
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,231
A modicum of responsibility.

151
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:12,270
Or a sudden sense of camaraderie, or...

152
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,141
You know, things like that. Right?

153
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,251
Where's the shower?

154
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,191
A shower? Why now?

155
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,261
My hands.

156
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,561
I need to wash my hands.

157
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,601
I see.

158
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,070
Well...

159
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,801
I mean, you could go to the restroom.

160
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,800
The restroom, the shower.

161
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,441
It doesn't matter. I'm just washing my hands.

162
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,241
Do you just call it a restroom?

163
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,391
I brought you a change of clothes.

164
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,631
I'll leave it here.

165
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,311
Come on in.

166
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:32,951
Come in. It's okay.

167
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,021
You can sleep in here.

168
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,621
What about you?

169
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,160
Oh, I'm fine with the couch or floor.

170
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,221
Yes.

171
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,061
Get some rest.

172
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,761
To everyone waiting for Lim Se Ra,

173
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:14,531
I must be...

174
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,931
such a disappointment.

175
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:39,380
Love

176
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:40,891
One more time

177
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,950
Quick, quick, slow, slow

178
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,321
Quick, quick, quick

179
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,061
One, and, two

180
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,421
Wait.

181
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,331
Why am I suddenly so hyped?

182
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:56,230
Pull yourself together, okay?

183
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,331
Snap out of it.

184
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,971
Get a grip!

185
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,021
Darn it.

186
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,821
Hold on, I'll call you back.

187
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,591
Darn it.

188
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,061
Darn it.

189
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,631
Gosh!

190
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,261
What was that?

191
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:38,901
Did she see it?

192
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,211
I don't think she did.

193
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,491
You...

194
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,321
Excuse me.

195
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:00,721
Were you startled?

196
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:08,731
If you're up, do you want a beer?

197
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:13,741
Is she asleep?

198
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,181
She's sleeping.

199
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,481
Gosh, she snores so loud.

200
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,641
How dare he.

201
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,021
Next, we have an update on Lim Se Ra.

202
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,821
Many fans were eagerly awaiting her,

203
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,431
and Lim Se Ra has returned.

204
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:13,231
But her unexpected appearance was a shock.

205
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:17,101
(Darn thing)

206
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,671
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.

207
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,610
I don't know why she had to crawl back to that world,

208
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,211
only to end up like that.

209
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,721
You're home.

210
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,891
Was that why?

211
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:40,820
What was?

212
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,431
The way you opposed my becoming a celebrity.

213
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,261
Was it about Auntie?

214
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:49,130
Why bring up the past?

215
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,101
Why did you hide the fact that she was Lim Se Ra?

216
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,471
What about it?

217
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,371
Is it something to brag about?

218
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,381
So what if she used to be famous?

219
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,410
Look at the state she's in now.

220
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,251
Mom, why do you hate her so much?

221
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,281
Whatever mistakes Auntie made,

222
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,021
everyone is pointing fingers at her.

223
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,320
Why on earth does her own family have to pile on?

224
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,321
Da Hee.

225
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,860
- I have my reasons, you know.
- No matter what your reasons are,

226
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,531
aren't families supposed to have each other's backs?

227
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,531
Whatever the situation is between you and Auntie,

228
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,131
- I'm not like my aunt.
- What's that supposed to mean?

229
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,071
Da Hee.

230
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,461
I think it's ready.

231
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:53,401
Come on out and have some food.

232
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,641
Is she sleeping?

233
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:03,511
Time to eat.

234
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,051
Come on out and eat.

235
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:18,961
Let's eat.

236
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,631
What are you looking at?

237
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,831
Let me see.

238
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,741
Give it here.

239
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:33,501
Hurry.

240
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,211
(Bong Chung Ja)

241
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:42,280
Seriously, I told you not to look at these things for a while.

242
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:46,880
I was just going to read the article about our show's finale.

243
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:49,291
As if the algorithm would just leave you be.

244
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,790
When it comes to "Love Is Not a Crime,"

245
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,661
Bong Chung Ja is Lim Se Ra.

246
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,491
I used to be sad when no one recognised me,

247
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:59,731
but it's heartbreaking...

248
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,331
to be recognised like this.

249
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,271
Hurry up and come out to eat.

250
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,771
I've completely lost my appetite.

251
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,251
Let's go.

252
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,001
How dare you cast Lim Se Ra?

253
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,630
I looked the other way when you brought her to the agency.

254
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:39,901
But forcing her into my project? That's crossing a line.

255
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,611
- How is it different?
- Seriously? You know what I'm like.

256
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:47,610
I'm not asking you to roll out the red carpet for me,

257
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,911
but I will not tolerate you sabotaging my work.

258
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,021
How did you find out faster than the reporters?

259
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,090
Did you plant a spy on my team or something?

260
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,291
I'm not going to say it again.

261
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,061
Get her off the project. Now.

262
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,191
I think you're misunderstanding something here.

263
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,901
It's my project, not yours.

264
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,330
What?

265
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:12,371
This is my 1st official project with 2ONE Entertainment.

266
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,001
So...

267
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:17,810
why are you making a fuss over the cast?

268
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:19,341
Darn it, why?

269
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,180
You're not the only one suffering.

270
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,321
I've been holding back, too.

271
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,751
And if you were going to leak this to the press,

272
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,791
at least learn to pick your moments.

273
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:36,330
I'm trying to fan the flames on this,

274
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,431
and you just had to ruin it?

275
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:39,401
What are you talking about?

276
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,171
You're the one who tipped them off.

277
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,741
How much longer do I have to clean up your mess?

278
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,280
Hey, Kang Du Won, you...

279
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:58,251
It's amazing how you haven't changed one bit in 25 years.

280
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:02,521
- You punk!
- See? There you go again.

281
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,921
We may be like family,

282
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,721
but let's try to respect some boundaries, okay?

283
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,731
Hello, everyone.

284
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,300
I'm Dokgo Cheol, Bong Chung Ja's manager.

285
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:18,501
I'm in your care.

286
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,541
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

287
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:25,610
I'm Dokgo Cheol. It's nice to meet you.

288
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:28,451
You crazy punk!

289
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,590
I'm going to kill you.

290
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,391
Hey!

291
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,401
And who are you?

292
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,671
Oh, Mr. Kang asked me to come.

293
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,031
Yes, come on in.

294
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:57,811
Let's discuss this together.

295
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,651
The male lead will be Won Ban,

296
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,921
and the female lead is Go Hui Yeong, the Queen of Cannes.

297
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,661
And the supporting female role is Bong Chung Ja.

298
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:15,491
- Excuse me?
- Scratch that.

299
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,591
Let's call her Lim Se Ra. Right?

300
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,861
Pardon me? Yes.

301
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:28,470
Wait, that's the next biggest role.

302
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:29,910
That's the role. Get her ready.

303
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,841
Tell Ms. Lim about this.

304
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,311
Fine, then hold an audition.

305
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,211
What?

306
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,781
I mean, come on.

307
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,650
This is our first major production.

308
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,721
It's a waste to just hand over a major role, isn't it?

309
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:49,491
So it wasn't a done deal after all.

310
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:51,531
Well...

311
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:56,231
An open audition with Lim Se Ra means buzz.

312
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:58,301
I want to be a judge, too.

313
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:00,940
But on one condition. The judges and everyone else...

314
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,970
- must come to a unanimous decision.
- Okay, I can agree to that.

315
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,181
Okay, let's do it.

316
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,520
We'll be on our way.

317
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,521
Okay.

318
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:13,721
Goodbye.

319
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,051
Let's go.

320
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,821
Gosh! Really?

321
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:22,030
For real?

322
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:24,231
Oh, my goodness!

323
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,761
You're that happy?

324
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,761
Happy doesn't begin to cover it.

325
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:30,030
Like lightning in a clear sky...

326
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:33,240
and seeing a double rainbow.

327
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,341
Unbelievable!

328
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,010
It's not final yet.

329
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,271
You still have to audition.

330
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,910
I'm going to get this part.

331
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:42,351
I'll get this role, no matter what.

332
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:46,181
That accident kept me from working with Director Choi Young Guk,

333
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:49,921
but this time, I'll see it through.

334
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,921
I'll do everything I can to help.

335
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,131
Okay, then. Can you take me home first?

336
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:57,661
What?

337
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,431
To that gosiwon?

338
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:01,230
I need to get home and start preparing for the audition.

339
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,871
Hurry! I'm going to change.

340
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:03,931
Be right back.

341
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:22,221
It was chaos here this morning.

342
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,121
Sleazy reporters were snooping,

343
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,761
filming this rundown gosiwon...

344
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:28,460
and interviewing anyone.

345
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,960
Oh, no. I made it hard on everyone.

346
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:32,931
And I already had a bad reputation.

347
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,871
I wonder if Pistol is going to kick me out.

348
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,141
Shall we go in?

349
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,551
Hey, what's with you?

350
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,821
Gosh.

351
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,721
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,790
I heard I gave you a rough time.

353
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:04,861
So you're Lim Se Ra.

354
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,731
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:11,770
There was never a good time.

356
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,441
Gosh.

357
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,641
Wait, are you really that mad?

358
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:28,951
Oh, I'm not prepared for this.

359
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:30,591
She even touched me.

360
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,220
I never imagined that I would...

361
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:36,191
meet Lim Se Ra in my lifetime.

362
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,901
I'm a huge "Jewellery Store Girl" fan.

363
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:42,030
I've watched it so many times.

364
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:46,471
I've seen it 22... No, maybe 24 times.

365
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:50,711
Are you really Lim Se Ra, though?

366
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,151
You look really different now.

367
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,651
I know what you did to that woman.

368
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,091
What do you mean?

369
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:08,091
I know what you made me do.

370
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:11,631
What did I make you do?

371
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:15,531
The orders came from you.

372
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:21,401
We're trying to help your situation.

373
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:25,381
We're not here for you to shift blame.

374
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:27,111
What was that?

375
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,050
Are you blaming me now?

376
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,381
Choose carefully.

377
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:32,420
Who did it?

378
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,581
It was Ju Seung...

379
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:36,821
I see.

380
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:38,191
That's your game?

381
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:39,491
Okay.

382
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,690
I won't die like this.

383
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,160
Tell them this, loud and clear.

384
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:44,430
If that's your game, I'll sing like a canary.

385
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,800
- I've got nothing to lose.
- What?

386
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,861
You're turning yourself in?

387
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:50,000
I just might.

388
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,531
I'm a dead man anyway.

389
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:54,371
Misery loves company.

390
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,781
What was that?

391
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,081
Hey.

392
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,421
The primary is in two days.

393
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:10,221
One mistake now and it's all over.

394
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,791
We've sunk a lot of money into this,

395
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,590
and we'll walk away with nothing!

396
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:17,661
You punk!

397
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,701
Darn it, he won't even flinch...

398
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:25,871
Hello?

399
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:27,671
What's this about?

400
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,341
Yes, speaking.

401
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:31,471
Right now?

402
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,941
Yes, I'll be there right away.

403
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:35,911
Yes, of course.

404
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:45,321
You'll have nothing to worry about.

405
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:49,561
You're the one who should worry,

406
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:50,931
not me.

407
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:00,971
Handle her before the primary. No excuses.

408
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:02,840
Yes, sir.

409
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:05,211
I'll handle her, even if I have to beat it out of her.

410
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,010
Until this is resolved,

411
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,611
stay away from the campaign.

412
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:11,881
Sorry?

413
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,050
Wait, but...

414
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:17,221
If you interfere and it goes south,

415
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:20,661
you become a ticking time bomb to us.

416
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:24,291
You're not going to show up, are you?

417
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,411
This is what I like about you.

418
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:43,681
You're quick to know your place.

419
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:50,721
And that's how you got this far.

420
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:04,400
Gosh.

421
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:07,341
This punk!

422
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,971
This punk!

423
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:14,041
Darn it, you little punk!

424
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,481
Jung Do!

425
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:19,151
Let's call the cops!

426
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,051
The police are on your tail.

427
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,120
And they already have solid proof.

428
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:25,321
What do you mean?

429
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,461
- You should lay low.
- Lay low?

430
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:29,291
Lay low, my foot!

431
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:33,801
My hard-earned money is about to vanish!

432
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,901
What did you say?

433
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,071
Telling me to lay low? You punk!

434
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,301
What is this now?

435
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:41,741
A vehicle is approaching.

436
00:29:58,521 --> 00:29:59,961
Find someone to take care of it cleanly.

437
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:01,421
Yes, sir.

438
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,201
Stand back.

439
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:18,911
Where is the patient from jail?

440
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:23,551
What happened?

441
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:25,280
Luckily, his heartbeat is back,

442
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,950
but he's in a coma.

443
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,381
How did this happen so fast?

444
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:31,491
He has a history of epilepsy.

445
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:34,091
So we scheduled an EEG and an MRI.

446
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,261
Could it be an external factor?

447
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:37,991
We're looking into that right now.

448
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,461
But if sleep apnoea lasts too long,

449
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,271
it can cause a seizure.

450
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:50,711
So, maybe he was purposely suffocated?

451
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:21,771
Hello, everyone!

452
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:25,381
Hey, Chattaeng! Chavely is here.

453
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,751
I said I'd have a flash sale today.

454
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,050
Gosh.

455
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:31,411
What's happening?

456
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,021
Gosh!

457
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:34,751
We broke 20,000 viewers?

458
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,351
Gosh.

459
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,990
I've never had so many viewers.

460
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:40,560
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

461
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,291
Oh my gosh, what do I do?

462
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:46,200
Okay.

463
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,031
Ta-da! Ta-da!

464
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,271
You know what this is, right, Chattaeng?

465
00:31:51,231 --> 00:31:56,771
The lip gloss worn by the Queen of Cannes, Hui Yeong, herself.

466
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:58,271
For today only,

467
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,741
everyone who buys the full set...

468
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:02,810
(That's awesome!)

469
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:03,850
(I heard you were Lim Se Ra's stylist)

470
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:05,150
(Lim Se Ra?)

471
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:06,620
(Is that true?)

472
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,581
(No way, right?)

473
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,120
(Live broadcast has ended, 29,482 viewers)

474
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,121
She turned it off?

475
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:15,690
Did you see that?

476
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:16,830
Did you see her face fall?

477
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:17,890
See?

478
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:21,301
I thought you were paranoid over her.

479
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:23,671
And it looks like she's innocent after all.

480
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,540
- Gosh!
- Ouch!

481
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,141
Come on, you!

482
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,341
Gosh.

483
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,570
But it's strange she ended it like that.

484
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,681
See?

485
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,740
That punk Chavely worked so hard to set the stage,

486
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,280
so she wouldn't just end the stream like that.

487
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:37,380
When she turns it back on,

488
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:38,451
let's change our ID and comment.

489
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:39,821
- So no one can tell.
- Okay.

490
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,021
- What?
- What is it?

491
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:43,891
I got a message.

492
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:46,391
(Who are you?)

493
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:47,861
What do we say?

494
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,191
Oh, what do we do?

495
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:57,670
We know what you did...

496
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,801
- twenty-five years ago.
- Sent.

497
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,340
Come on, what are you saying?

498
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,541
You don't know a darn thing.

499
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:05,211
But you never know. We're just dangling bait.

500
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,541
And if she takes the bait?

501
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:08,951
And if she does?

502
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:10,381
Then she's caught red-handed.

503
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,651
You're dead.

504
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:21,621
(I know what you did 25 years ago.)

505
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,391
What do you know?

506
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,471
(You're nothing without Go Hui Yeong.)

507
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,201
Who on earth are you?

508
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:36,570
(Go Hui Yeong)

509
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:40,010
I need the necklace you borrowed back.

510
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:42,850
- Whatever.
- Excuse me?

511
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:46,781
Go ask the one who threw it. Gosh.

512
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,661
I heard from Lim Se Ra...

513
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,691
that she's just biding her time until the awards ceremony.

514
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,901
She's planning to drop the bomb at the press conference right after.

515
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,301
That's not my problem.

516
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:08,671
The one with something to lose should fix it themselves.

517
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:11,671
As for me,

518
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,241
I don't really have anything to lose.

519
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:36,401
How long have you been there?

520
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,241
I'll be on my way.

521
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:47,681
No way.

522
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:51,151
Did you hear all of that?

523
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:00,961
Gosh.

524
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,231
Darn it.

525
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:11,631
Thanks for coming to my commercial shoot.

526
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,000
Gosh.

527
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,300
You should've told me you were coming.

528
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,370
If you had, I would've...

529
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:17,511
I'm glad to hear you had a reshoot.

530
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,311
I was worried it might fall through.

531
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:27,251
I'm sorry I haven't been a good sister to you.

532
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:32,921
To be honest, I haven't been a good daughter either.

533
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,490
Use this for the repairs...

534
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:36,591
and pay off your debts.

535
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:40,161
How did you know I was in debt?

536
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,671
You could've made a comeback like this all along,

537
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:48,271
so why have you been living like that?

538
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:50,941
Tell me about it. I'd like to know too.

539
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:55,381
What on earth has been holding me back all this time?

540
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:02,321
But I'm not going to run away anymore.

541
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,221
I'm going to find whatever I lost.

542
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,421
Be it my memories or something else, I'll find it all.

543
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:12,301
And I'm going to set everything right.

544
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,221
Is there a grown-up we can call?

545
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:41,021
If your mom isn't available, what about your dad?

546
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:42,931
Can't we reach your dad either?

547
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:47,231
My dad can't come.

548
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:50,971
You're saying you won't take the CSAT?

549
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:54,070
You've already been accepted to so many colleges,

550
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,311
and all you have to do is meet the minimum score on the CSAT.

551
00:36:56,911 --> 00:36:59,841
So many kids would kill to get into those schools.

552
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,381
Are you really going to throw your life away like this?

553
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:07,381
The 2001 CSAT took place nationwide today.

554
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,490
Despite the chilly morning air,

555
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:12,491
test-takers went to the exam sites with nervous expressions.

556
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:19,801
Yes.

557
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,101
I'm Bong Chung Ja's sister.

558
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:24,931
Why do you ask?

559
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,051
It's such a relief.

560
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:38,981
Your sister has a rare blood type, so she was in danger,

561
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,951
but luckily, you have the same blood type.

562
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,391
Mom.

563
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,331
Yes?

564
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:54,461
Where are you off to on the weekend?

565
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:56,671
I told you I'm going to the library.

566
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:57,970
When will you be back?

567
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,271
After dinner.

568
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,571
What about money?

569
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,571
I have some.

570
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,271
I'm heading out.

571
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:29,130
Hey, Bong Da Ri.

572
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:32,170
- You messed up your moves again.
- Sorry. I got the moves confused.

573
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,841
No one told you to join late. Did they?

574
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:37,011
If you get us cut from our debut, will you be responsible for it?

575
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,271
That's enough.

576
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,040
Am I the only one affected?

577
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,081
Everyone's working so hard for this.

578
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:44,550
She joined late. So she must try harder.

579
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:47,851
Then instead of complaining, you could show her how it's done.

580
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:49,621
Riley.

581
00:38:51,051 --> 00:38:52,051
The CEO wants to see you.

582
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,001
A call-up from the CEO.

583
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:05,431
You know this is a fast track to the debut group, right?

584
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:07,101
Yes, I do.

585
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,471
Make it count.

586
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,081
I worked so darn hard.

587
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,581
I gave it my absolute all, every single day.

588
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,491
I'm sorry.

589
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:53,281
I worked so darn hard.

590
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,051
I gave it my absolute all, every single day.

591
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:59,661
I never had a day of peace.

592
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,591
That's how I lived my life.

593
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:03,561
But...

594
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,531
why did it end up this way?

595
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:13,101
Why am I the only one suffering?

596
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,210
(Lowering the hand as if understanding)

597
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,181
(A desperate cry, sadness, rage)

598
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,551
I worked so darn hard.

599
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:34,021
I never had a day of peace. That's how I lived my life.

600
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,361
Why am I the only one suffering?

601
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:41,201
I worked so darn hard.

602
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:42,930
(Judge Go Hui Yeong)

603
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:44,531
I gave it my absolute all, every single day.

604
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,601
But why did it end up this way?

605
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,501
Why me?

606
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,871
Why am I the only one suffering?

607
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,511
Okay, that's enough.

608
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,111
Could I please try Scene Three?

609
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,550
I'm confident about that one.

610
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,811
Go home.

611
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:58,981
Thank you for coming in.

612
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:31,581
Drink this while it's warm.

613
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:33,481
Thanks.

614
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:40,021
Okay, relax. Do what you practised.

615
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:41,591
- Okay?
- Yes.

616
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:42,961
Let's go.

617
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:44,461
- Let's go.
- Ms. Bong Chung Ja?

618
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:46,831
Yes?

619
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:50,001
- They're ready for you.
- Okay.

620
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:53,171
You can do it.

621
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,271
You can do it.

622
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:06,651
Hello.

623
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:09,621
I'm Actress Bong Chung Ja.

624
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:16,331
She's last. How about some freestyle?

625
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:20,431
I'm tired of the same performances.

626
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:24,531
Well, isn't that asking a bit much without any prep?

627
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,601
Oh, come on. She's not some amateur.

628
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:30,671
For goodness' sake, she's Lim Se Ra. She won the Best Actress Award.

629
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:32,941
Of course, she can do it.

630
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,651
They're on the last audition right now, correct?

631
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:39,081
Yes, that's right.

632
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,781
Let's wrap up now.

633
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:43,251
Understood.

634
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:00,241
Maybe I asked for too much.

635
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:11,051
I guess age catches up with you.

636
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,121
Just do the scripted scene.

637
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:17,151
Is she nervous?

638
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:54,321
Why are you looking at me like that?

639
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,431
You still don't get it, do you?

640
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:58,561
What it is you did wrong!

641
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,801
- What did I do that was so wrong?
- What are you looking at?

642
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:06,601
Are you crazy?

643
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:10,841
Keep going.

644
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,511
- Keep what going?
- Mad because I hit you?

645
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:16,651
Furious, are you?

646
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,951
Think about what you did to me.

647
00:44:21,281 --> 00:44:23,121
You shattered my dreams...

648
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:25,551
and destroyed my life.

649
00:44:35,301 --> 00:44:37,101
Seeing you all polished up,

650
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:39,901
it looks like you've been living the good life.

651
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:43,641
After you left me to rot in this nightmare!

652
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:46,441
Right.

653
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:50,081
To you, it's just a distant memory, isn't it?

654
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:55,151
You went on with your lives and forgot I even existed.

655
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,291
You were...

656
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:06,831
You were probably hoping I was dead.

657
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:13,071
So?

658
00:45:13,571 --> 00:45:17,071
How does it feel to see me back, alive and well?

659
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:25,811
I haven't had a single peaceful night's sleep.

660
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:31,990
Every day, I fought to survive, like I was coughing up blood!

661
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:34,221
All for this very moment!

662
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,061
What should I do to you?

663
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:54,111
It wouldn't be any fun to end this too quickly.

664
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:02,991
Just you wait.

665
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:05,121
My revenge...

666
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:07,761
is just getting started.

667
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:42,691
Gosh.

668
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:53,741
So, how was it?

669
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,541
How did it feel seeing Lim Se Ra after 25 years?

670
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,611
Honestly, I was shocked.

671
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:04,481
I can't believe she recalled a scene from a 25-year-old film so well.

672
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,481
In that movie from 25 years ago. What if she had been cast...

673
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:11,321
instead of Go Hui Yeong?

674
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:15,761
I thought so then, and I still do. Lim Se Ra is a brilliant actress.

675
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,361
In fact, she's gotten even better.

676
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:19,700
It's been such a long time...

677
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:21,161
since I've met a true actor...

678
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:24,201
and my heart pounded at the thought of making a new film.

679
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,391
It's not even a big role. What are you so happy about?

680
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:47,691
But someone recognised my talent and sought me out.

681
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:50,090
I'm going to get this part.

682
00:47:50,091 --> 00:47:52,391
I'll get this role, no matter what.

683
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:26,801
I...

684
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:31,301
I think I really bombed the audition today.

685
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,941
You did great.

686
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:42,581
You were really great.

687
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,121
Really?

688
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:52,391
Was I really okay?

689
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:56,261
Well,

690
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,161
that was the best performance I have ever seen.

691
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:01,531
I guarantee it.

692
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,131
No one else could have done it that well.

693
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:10,071
I was so worried.

694
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,871
That's such a relief.

695
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:16,681
It's all thanks to you, Detective.

696
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:23,591
Thank you for being there for me.

697
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:29,861
It's true, right?

698
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:38,900
You didn't have to release an article...

699
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,101
about Lim Se Ra failing her audition.

700
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:43,711
He said to handle things quietly if we could.

701
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:45,611
That was his idea.

702
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,981
So I'm supposed to just take care of Lim Se Ra quietly?

703
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:54,781
Well...

704
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:57,650
That guy I sent last time was a real paper tiger.

705
00:49:57,651 --> 00:49:59,351
He was useless.

706
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,061
Should I try scouting somewhere else?

707
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:05,661
What's with that look?

708
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,560
What's wrong with my eyes?

709
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:09,401
I mean, why are you glaring like that?

710
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:12,001
- You got a problem with something?
- No, it's just...

711
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,971
I'm wondering how much longer I have to do this,

712
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:16,471
and it's really weighing on me.

713
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:23,081
- "This," you say?
- Lim Se Ra, as well as our talent,

714
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:25,481
are all assets of 2ONE Entertainment, right?

715
00:50:31,891 --> 00:50:33,421
Oh, my abs are killing me.

716
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,221
And you thought they were yours?

717
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:37,030
They're not mine?

718
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:38,890
To help you not become penniless,

719
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:41,901
we fed you rice, and now you think you're human?

720
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:43,570
You're just a little puppy.

721
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:44,631
Woof, woof.

722
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:56,411
After 25 years, shouldn't my accounts be settled?

723
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,351
And who do you think does that accounting?

724
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:00,851
- What's that supposed to mean?
- First off,

725
00:51:01,051 --> 00:51:03,920
a slave has no right to talk about ending contracts.

726
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:05,591
That doesn't make any sense, now does it?

727
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:08,121
Slavery is a lifetime commitment.

728
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:10,461
A slave?

729
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:12,430
What, you think you can break off your shackles now...

730
00:51:12,431 --> 00:51:13,701
to become some kind of runaway?

731
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:15,231
Go on then, you punk.

732
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:16,331
Let's see you try.

733
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,271
I doubt you'll make it.

734
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,271
You won't even get halfway before your ankles are broken.

735
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:31,951
Whether I end up broken or a free man...

736
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:34,181
There's only one way to find out.

737
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:44,791
So this is why you brought Lim Se Ra back?

738
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:49,431
Leaking her comeback to the press.

739
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,101
You've been writing your own little script?

740
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:09,381
You'll break it.

741
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:16,121
Stop looking at me like that, you punk!

742
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:19,431
Darn it.

743
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,781
Hey. Release the article now.

744
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:49,891
Now that you're going to be in a drama,

745
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:51,891
shouldn't you find your own place and move out?

746
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,461
I did think about that,

747
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:55,961
but I'm comfortable here for now.

748
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:57,871
It's not like I have family to go to.

749
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:00,671
Oh, I was so worried you might move out.

750
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,341
What a relief.

751
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:05,311
I haven't even been that nice to you.

752
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,381
Did my being here even make a difference?

753
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:09,881
You're the only person I've really been able to open up to.

754
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:11,611
And you...

755
00:53:12,781 --> 00:53:15,921
are the only one who has conversations like this with me.

756
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:20,320
- When's your exam again?
- I stopped the countdown.

757
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:21,991
I'm trying not to think about it until it's time.

758
00:53:22,421 --> 00:53:25,160
Counting down the days was making me feel like I was suffocating,

759
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:27,830
- and I can't seem to focus.
- I know what you mean.

760
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:29,501
Just try to relax.

761
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,871
You're young. Your whole life is ahead.

762
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:37,241
Failing now is a lesson for the future.

763
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:41,711
When you're my age, you'll see.

764
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:47,321
Just how wonderful your youth was.

765
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:53,221
Why are your hands so cold? Why are your hands so cold?

766
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:56,291
Oh, I keep the heat off to stay up.

767
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:59,161
Here. Let me warm them up for you.

768
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:04,201
Warmer?

769
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,611
Gosh, what are you doing?

770
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:24,851
That punk.

771
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:38,671
Yes, it's me.

772
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:45,141
So, how did it go?

773
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:51,751
(Lim Se Ra's Comeback In 25 years, From a Supporting Role To Main Role)

774
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:58,991
(Lim Se Ra's Comeback In 25 years, From a Supporting Role To Main Role)

775
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:06,801
Come on!

776
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:09,631
Stop fidgeting with that.

777
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:34,391
I need to lose weight right now.

778
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:36,761
What, all of a sudden?

779
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:42,801
I mean, I never used to have a big appetite.

780
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:46,771
But I've let myself go for 25 years.

781
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:48,901
I get hungry right after I eat,

782
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:51,271
and I lose control when I see food.

783
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:54,711
I just can't seem to control myself.

784
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:59,181
But that's not needed for the role.

785
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:00,821
But I don't need to gain any weight either.

786
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:05,951
I owe it to the fans who have waited for Lim Se Ra.

787
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:10,330
But you can't get fit overnight from here.

788
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:11,361
The fat...

789
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:13,761
I mean...

790
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:16,401
Anyway, what's the plan? Getting a personal trainer?

791
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:18,531
Where would I get money for that?

792
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:21,071
Gosh.

793
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,151
You okay?

794
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:36,621
Need a break?

795
00:56:37,921 --> 00:56:39,691
Gosh. Come on.

796
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,761
Come on. That's it.

797
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:51,300
More.

798
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:53,841
All right. Four more.

799
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,701
Little

800
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:01,741
More.

801
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:02,741
You can do it!

802
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:05,310
Aren't you the one working out?

803
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:06,350
Yes!

804
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:07,780
Then why am I so exhausted?

805
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:09,051
This is hard too.

806
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:11,291
Enough!

807
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:15,990
I'm really not what I used to be.

808
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:16,991
Here.

809
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:18,591
Oh, thanks.

810
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:24,531
Oh, that's a lifesaver.

811
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:27,141
So what about the culprit?

812
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:31,710
- The culprit? Why ask now?
- You told me before.

813
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:33,341
That crucial evidence turned up.

814
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:35,841
Is he still refusing to talk?

815
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:39,411
Well, he's in no position to talk.

816
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:41,081
What situation?

817
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:44,951
Well, the thing is...

818
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:48,021
We may need to investigate further.

819
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:55,261
You know how in movies they have things like, in-person testimony?

820
00:57:55,831 --> 00:57:57,200
If I meet him, maybe I can tell if he's...

821
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:58,201
No, absolutely not.

822
00:57:58,202 --> 00:57:59,271
That won't be necessary.

823
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:01,541
Ms. Bong, just focus on your life.

824
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:04,211
Keep exercising in crowded places like this.

825
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:06,041
Got it. Got it.

826
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:08,611
Try to avoid places without security cameras.

827
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:11,210
I mean, I'll stick with you as much as I can, but...

828
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:12,311
You just never know, right?

829
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:13,511
Don't worry.

830
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:16,851
I'm ready for anything.

831
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:27,861
Just keep a close eye on him.

832
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,571
So, no improvement at all?

833
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:40,381
I'm worried he might never wake up.

834
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:44,681
The fear is that the attacker might return.

835
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:46,311
Sorry?

836
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:49,381
Oh, never mind.

837
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,351
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

838
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:53,150
You know, in dramas,

839
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:54,861
people wake up miraculously after a couple of months too.

840
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,261
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

841
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:00,501
- Hey.
- Yes?

842
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:03,061
What diet were you on? Your face is thin.

843
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,370
Really? Is it obvious?

844
00:59:05,371 --> 00:59:06,371
Yes.

845
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:10,240
But you wanted to lose belly fat.

846
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:12,441
What's the point if it only comes off your face?

847
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:15,340
If you lose weight wrong at our age, you'll look like Gollum.

848
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:16,410
Gosh.

849
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:17,511
Do I look like Gollum?

850
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:19,810
No, it's not that bad.

851
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:21,050
Wait, hold on a second.

852
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:22,620
Let me try to fix it with your hair.

853
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:24,550
- How about we try it like this?
- Any better?

854
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:25,721
Yes, that's a little better.

855
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,961
Why can't I lose this fat?

856
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:32,131
It's middle-age spread.

857
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:34,200
It just won't come off.

858
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:36,000
You'll just lose muscle mass,

859
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:37,571
and end up with osteoporosis.

860
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:40,871
You're the one who needs upkeep.

861
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:44,040
What upkeep does a manager need?

862
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:46,071
My only job is managing the building.

863
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:50,180
That's a fine way to talk for someone...

864
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:51,850
who got a role thanks to her.

865
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:54,880
Should I curl that big mouth, too?

866
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:56,180
- Yes, let me just...
- Ouch!

867
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:57,250
Goodness.

868
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:59,120
Do a better job this time.

869
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:00,121
I do a great job.

870
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:01,460
But the people just don't get it.

871
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,420
If they don't get it, you failed.

872
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:04,760
That's why you get cut.

873
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:05,830
What do they know about art?

874
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:08,100
Art? Please. Be an artist in your own room.

875
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:10,100
You need to earn your pay.

876
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:11,170
Am I wrong?

877
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:12,400
That's why art stagnates.

878
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:13,900
Stop with your nonsense.

879
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,100
Just do your job properly.

880
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:16,840
And no more nonsense about art.

881
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:18,041
Do it commercially.

882
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:41,501
- Hello.
- Hello.

883
01:00:53,371 --> 01:00:54,611
- Coming through.
- Coming through.

884
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:11,461
- Coming through.
- Coming through.

885
01:01:22,901 --> 01:01:24,111
Coming through!

886
01:01:54,571 --> 01:01:56,571
Whenever you're ready.

887
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:37,880
What is that behind you?

888
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:38,951
What?

889
01:02:39,111 --> 01:02:40,281
Oh, it's nothing.

890
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:42,981
Come on, you've been hiding something.

891
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:46,191
Are you hiding snacks from me?

892
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:48,591
No, that's not it.

893
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:53,901
It's a sponsorship gift.

894
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,431
Really?

895
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:57,601
Oh, of course.

896
01:02:57,602 --> 01:02:59,031
You're Lim Se Ra. This is the bare minimum.

897
01:03:00,101 --> 01:03:01,670
- What is it?
- Want to open it?

898
01:03:01,671 --> 01:03:02,741
Yes.

899
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:07,141
Gosh, it's so beautiful.

900
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:08,881
Is it?

901
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:10,911
Yes, absolutely.

902
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:13,251
It's so pretty.

903
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:20,861
Well?

904
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:24,161
It's not Lim Se Ra. It's Bong Chung Ja.

905
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:28,361
Don't tell me Go Hui Yeong is scared of someone like Bong Chung Ja.

906
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:31,331
Scared? Who said I'm scared?

907
01:03:31,971 --> 01:03:33,771
Then what's this?

908
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:38,911
You're drinking soju? Not even beer?

909
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:41,510
Reporters are swarming outside.

910
01:03:41,511 --> 01:03:43,181
They're here for Go Hui Yeong and Won Ban.

911
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,710
Not Bong Chung Ja who's middle-aged and fat,

912
01:03:45,711 --> 01:03:47,881
but you, Go Hui Yeong, the Queen of Cannes.

913
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,420
If you're not going out there, reeking of booze...

914
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:54,861
to make a scene, get it together.

915
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:07,301
Hui Yeong, this is where it begins.

916
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:10,611
The Go Hui Yeong, Lim Se Ra's double from 25 years ago?

917
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,870
Now, let's go crush Lim Se Ra for good...

918
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:14,910
together.

919
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:15,981
Okay?

920
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:17,881
It's the perfect setup.

921
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:43,971
Bong Chung Ja will make you shine even brighter.

922
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:45,241
Just you wait.

923
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:21,871
(Epilogue)

924
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:29,640
Gosh, it's so expensive.

925
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:30,711
You're back again.

926
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:32,951
Oh, yes.

927
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,821
Okay. Goodbye.

928
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:39,991
How about a necklace?

929
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:42,920
A necklace?

930
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:44,260
It's not over-the-top,

931
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:47,501
but a necklace is a great accessory.

932
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:56,070
What's her style like? What's her style like?

933
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:57,871
Oh, yes. Thank you.

934
01:06:58,071 --> 01:07:00,011
How can I describe her?

935
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:03,610
She's not flashy, but you can't help looking at her.

936
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:07,051
And she has an understated elegance.

937
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:09,921
And... What's the word...

938
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:13,950
Like, a classy yet elegant air?

939
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:14,961
Yes.

940
01:07:15,591 --> 01:07:17,391
Like Actress Lim Se Ra's style?

941
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:19,490
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

942
01:07:19,491 --> 01:07:21,031
- Not at all.
- No, really, I'm sorry.

943
01:07:21,301 --> 01:07:22,301
Gosh.

944
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:23,701
I was just using her as an example.

945
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:25,331
No, you're right.

946
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:26,701
Lim Se Ra style.

947
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:28,001
You nailed it.

948
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:29,470
Gosh, yes.

949
01:07:29,471 --> 01:07:32,871
Oh, in that case,

950
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:34,941
this would be perfect for her.

951
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:38,951
It's the perfect piece for an elegant beauty like Lim Se Ra.

952
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:43,421
Gosh.

953
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:45,121
It's beautiful.

954
01:07:47,691 --> 01:07:48,991
It would look so good on her.

955
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:58,061
(My Troublesome Star)

956
01:08:58,391 --> 01:09:01,501
She was like Lim Se Ra in her prime, shining so brightly.

957
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:03,561
Didn't you say she'd make me shine?

958
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:06,100
That you'd crush her for good?

959
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:07,101
Lim Se Ra!

960
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,701
Go Hui Yeong, where are you?

961
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,871
What will you do without evidence?

962
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:12,140
Says who?

963
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,571
Who says I have no evidence?

964
01:09:13,711 --> 01:09:15,111
Go Hui Yeong did that to Se Ra?

965
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:16,610
She's just the same.

966
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,181
Still gorgeous and radiant.

967
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,451
You know, right?

968
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:20,581
About their scandal.

969
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:22,781
This won't work.

970
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:24,291
I'm sleeping here tonight.
