(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,190
The baby I was carrying is gone now.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,690
- Don't tell me... - You killed it.

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,489
- You killed it. - Dad.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,189
You really don't remember? It was this small,

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,430
like a fingernail.

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,530
The USB drive.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,629
I gave it to you. Do you remember?

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,800
Se Ra is so beautiful. Goodness.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,870
Gosh.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh, it's over.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,540
Oh, no.

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,140
Play it again for me.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,040
Hold on, Dad. Let me find this first.

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,510
Now!

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,730
("Jewellery Store Girl")

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,670
I found it.

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,739
Dad. I found it!

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
Dad!

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,250
Dad. I found it!

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,180
Dad.

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,780
Thank you, Dad.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Thank you.

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,790
Dad.

36
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,560
And I'm so...

37
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm so sorry, Dad.

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,740
Dad. I'm so sorry.

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,550
Dad. I'm so sorry.

40
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,270
Hui Yeong. What on earth did you say to Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,970
Why?

42
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,110
"Why?"

43
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you know how dangerous he is?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,449
He says he'll kill Lim Se Ra now.

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,550
Now, what are we going to do?

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,390
All right. Action!

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,900
It's all in the past, anyway.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,670
What's the point of digging it all up again?

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
In the past?

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,310
Sure.

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,610
For you, I'm sure it's all in the past.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,919
But for me, it's far from over.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,119
So what? You're here for revenge?

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,150
Why?

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,520
You think I can't?

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Don't tell me...

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,900
- that's why you came all this way. - What if it is?

58
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,999
Wait. For real?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,169
- She actually hit her. - That was a real slap.

60
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,569
- That was crazy. - For real? She hit her hard.

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,170
- That was not how we practised. - I know, right?

62
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,680
Is that all you've got?

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,390
That wasn't in the script.

64
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,630
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,660
What's this?

66
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,330
Just you wait.

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,640
I know...

68
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,710
exactly what you did.

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,020
Lim Se Ra said it herself.

70
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,790
She's waiting to get the award.

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,890
She's planning to drop the bomb at a press conference right after.

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,330
Don't tell me, sire,

73
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,830
you still have a soft spot for Lim Se Ra.

74
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,960
What a shame.

75
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,559
If you don't stop Lim Se Ra,

76
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,300
you can say goodbye to this election.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,140
You never know.

78
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,010
Lim Se Ra could be holding something that could completely destroy you.

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,810
You shouldn't be asking me that.

80
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,450
The one with more to lose should be the one to handle it.

81
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,820
After all, I don't have much to lose.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Darn it.

83
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,400
(Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan)

84
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,270
When you brought is Lim Se Ra,

85
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,970
did you not search her body?

86
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,840
Well...

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,310
We weren't able to...

88
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,050
I'll take full responsibility and handle it.

89
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,030
What? You mean Lim Se Ra?

90
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Darn it.

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Hui Yeong.

92
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,620
What did you tell Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

93
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,050
Why?

94
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,150
"Why?"

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,890
Hui Yeong!

96
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,530
Do you know how dangerous he is?

97
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,330
He says he'll kill Lim Se Ra. What are we going to do?

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Is he really?

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,100
Hui Yeong. Don't tell me...

100
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,270
Du Won.

101
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,940
This is an opportunity for us.

102
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,610
How long are you going to be stuck as Lim Se Ra's manager?

103
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,980
Just do what he says.

104
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,410
That's how...

105
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,380
we both get out of this alive.

106
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,260
Hui Yeong, you're out of your mind right now.

107
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,590
- How could you do that to Se Ra? - Du Won.

108
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,030
When you took me to Assemblyman Do instead of Lim Se Ra,

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,400
we were already in the same boat.

110
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,550
But then, Sun Young overheard the call.

111
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,150
She knows about this? What were you thinking?

112
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,650
It's not like we can kill her, too, right?

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,350
Where's Du Won?

114
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,680
He said something urgent came up.

115
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Now...

116
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,470
This watch belongs to you now.

117
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,500
No, sir. I couldn't.

118
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,740
This is your most prized watch. How could I possibly accept?

119
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,810
Me giving you this watch...

120
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,850
means that you are my successor.

121
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,380
My district, my supporters,

122
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,549
and my patrons.

123
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm passing it all down to you.

124
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,190
Thank you, sir.

125
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,099
Early this morning, a van carrying top star Lim Se Ra...

126
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,199
it collided with a five-ton dump truck...

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,470
while returning home after an awards ceremony.

128
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,580
As a result of the accident, the van overturned,

129
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,650
and Lim Se Ra was rushed to the hospital.

130
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,720
Did you want to get rid of me that badly?

131
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,660
So badly you wanted to kill me?

132
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,160
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,029
Let go of me. I said, let go.

134
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,100
Let go of me.

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,500
Let me...

136
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,110
Cut.

137
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,150
That was too real.

138
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,620
Hui Yeong. Are you okay?

139
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,090
- What? - What is going on?

140
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,630
- That was really good. - Yes, it was.

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
You crazy wench.

142
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,270
You crazy wench. Die.

143
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,740
You crazy wench. Die.

144
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
("Ms. Casting")

145
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,610
Die.

146
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,140
Die.

147
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,419
Se Ra. Your acting was on fire back there.

148
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
You're at the top of your game.

149
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,250
- It wasn't an act. - If it wasn't an act, what was it?

150
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,120
So it was real?

151
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
You know me.

152
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,800
I put my heart into each performance.

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,030
Gosh. You got me.

154
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,529
By the way, when you snapped at Go Hui Yeong earlier,

155
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,700
she was trembling like a leaf.

156
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,770
What did you say to her?

157
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,270
What I've been wanting to say for years.

158
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,510
What?

159
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,050
This is the last time I'll ever bow down to Go Hui Yeong.

160
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm going to head out first.

161
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,470
Call me if anything happens.

162
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,710
Gosh. My bad.

163
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,650
Darn it.

164
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,490
What did you mean earlier?

165
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,630
When you said you know everything. Don't tell me...

166
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,730
What?

167
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,330
Are you scared?

168
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,940
The statute of limitations is up anyway, so what's the point?

169
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,010
So you are scared.

170
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,780
You're shaking because you're afraid I'll expose everything you did.

171
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,420
Don't worry.

172
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,760
I have no intention of making this easy for you.

173
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,860
What are you talking about?

174
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,060
Finishing you off in one blow would be too boring.

175
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,540
Just like how I was torn down bit by bit,

176
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,670
I'm going to tear you down just as slowly.

177
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,780
Stop acting all high!

178
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,660
Stop looking down on me like you're lording it over me!

179
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,700
What makes you so special?

180
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,329
How are you better than me?

181
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,640
What gives you the right to show up and rattle me like this!

182
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,050
Finally, you're being honest.

183
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,550
Was my return so threatening to you?

184
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,219
I'm Go Hui Yeong. You hear me?

185
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,630
I'm no longer that supporting actor who was ignored, just your sidekick.

186
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm Go Hui Yeong, the Queen of Cannes!

187
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,770
You stole my spot, and that's all you became?

188
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,670
Did you just say "that's all?"

189
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,270
"That's all?"

190
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,580
Do you have any idea what it took for me to get here?

191
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,980
Everything was just handed to you on a silver platter.

192
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,920
All those opportunities that were just handed to you...

193
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,990
I had to fight and claw for every single one of them.

194
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,490
But what do you know?

195
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,189
What do you know about me to talk to me like that!

196
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,190
Who do you think you are?

197
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,970
You.

198
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,839
Stop acting all high!

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,740
I'll crush you just like I did 25 years ago.

200
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,610
Do you think I can't?

201
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,480
- What did she say? - Isn't she Go Hui Yeong?

202
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,250
I don't even need to bother with revenge.

203
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
What?

204
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,660
You just keep living in your own pit.

205
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,230
Because I'm going to soar again.

206
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,970
Stop acting all high!

207
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,909
I'll kill you all over again.

208
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,680
Do you think I can't?

209
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm going to kill you all.

210
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,120
What are you looking at?

211
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,890
Is this fun to you?

212
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,860
- Darn it! - Oh, my gosh.

213
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,360
I'll seriously kill you all.

214
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,270
It can't be.

215
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,340
She knows everything?

216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,510
I'll kill you all over again.

217
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,549
I'll crush you just like I did 25 years ago.

218
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,880
Lim Se Ra. I'm going to kill you!

219
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,650
What are you looking at?

220
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,220
Get lost, all of you!

221
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,689
- I'm going to kill you all! - I'll ensure this...

222
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,029
cause any problems for you, Assemblyman Min.

223
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,730
I'm going to kill you.

224
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,900
Bury them. So they can never talk again.

225
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,080
I found the person who sent you the recording file.

226
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,950
Really?

227
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Who is it?

228
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,690
It's Kang Du Won.

229
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,960
Wait.

230
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,760
Are you seriously telling me...

231
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,830
Kang Du Won sent me the recording file?

232
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,500
I backed up all the CCTV footage, just in case.

233
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,070
Good thinking. It was couriered six months ago.

234
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,610
So start checking the footage from then.

235
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,280
All six months of it?

236
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,880
But you're Lim Se Ra's biggest fan, right?

237
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,480
Yes, but...

238
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,290
We're trying to catch a criminal who's way worse than some stalker.

239
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,290
So have a sense of mission. Go get them!

240
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,590
For my beloved Se Ra, I can do it.

241
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Let's do this!

242
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,760
(Jumbo Gosiwon)

243
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,400
I found him!

244
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,200
Okay.

245
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,170
I confirmed it.

246
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,010
He said he received the package from Kang Du Won's secretary.

247
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,180
And put it in the gosiwon's mailbox.

248
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,250
But...

249
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,450
But why would Du Won do that?

250
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,649
It looks like he was trying to use you.

251
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,290
If that recording file gets out,

252
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,749
the ones who'd lose the most are...

253
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,590
Assemblyman Min Guk Hee and Ju Seung Pil.

254
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,160
So, to cut ties with Ju Seung Pil and Assemblyman Min Guk Hee,

255
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
he dragged me into this?

256
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,670
At least based on the evidence, yes.

257
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,980
Let me handle Kang Du Won.

258
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,310
What are you planning to do to him?

259
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,979
I need to talk to him. See if he can be redeemed,

260
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,890
- or if he needs to be put down. - Right.

261
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,060
Still, focus on physical therapy. You haven't fully recovered.

262
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Come on.

263
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,300
How much longer do I have to do this physical therapy?

264
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,870
You have to keep at it for at least a month.

265
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,770
A whole month?

266
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,969
Don't think of skipping a session. I'm coming with you every time.

267
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,970
Come on!

268
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,409
I mean, you're not my manager now.

269
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,470
You don't have to go this far.

270
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,480
You wouldn't come if I didn't make you.

271
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,979
Alright!

272
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,480
Okay. One.

273
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Two.

274
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,920
Se Ra!

275
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,990
There you are!

276
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,229
Gosh. You're really going at it.

277
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,300
My gosh.

278
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,430
Se Ra. Your face is beet red!

279
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,339
Oh, my goodness.

280
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
Your heart's racing too.

281
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,739
What's with the fuss about my heart?

282
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,870
It's perfectly fine.

283
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,280
Why are you sweating so much?

284
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,840
- Are you okay? - Yes.

285
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,250
By the way, it's so hot in here. Did they turn on the heat?

286
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,550
Really? The AC is on full blast.

287
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,620
I wonder.

288
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,520
Is it really because of the heat?

289
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,090
Honey. Were you there?

290
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,590
I've been here the whole time.

291
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,529
I'm not exactly the kind of person you wouldn't notice,

292
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,760
but you two had no idea.

293
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,230
How long have you been there?

294
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,799
Since you two started your workout.

295
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,439
You were both lying on the floor.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,999
You know, hugging.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,070
- It was almost... - Oh, my gosh!

298
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,510
Gosh. Are you okay? What is this?

299
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,780
Was that a blowfly or a mosquito? Are you okay?

300
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,580
Are you okay? Look. Try to keep your mouth closed.

301
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,820
You have to be careful.

302
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,120
You don't want a blowfly in your mouth, right?

303
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,390
Just be careful with your mouth. Are you all right?

304
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,960
He says he's fine.

305
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,860
Don't they do any pest control here? Why are there bugs?

306
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,369
Honey. There are bugs here.

307
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,900
Let's work out with our mouths closed. Close your mouth.

308
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,200
Breathe through your nose. Let's go!

309
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,270
Were you surprised?

310
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,549
- Se Ra! - What is it?

311
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,750
Look at this. Go Hui Yeong is in big trouble.

312
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,150
Look at that.

313
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,660
Look at all the related searches when you type in her name.

314
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,630
"Go Hui Yeong and the Car Crash Conspiracy."

315
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,990
"Go Hui Yeong, Se Ra's replacement."

316
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,830
"Go Hui Yeong and 2ONE Entertainment"

317
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,369
Finally, the public knows the truth.

318
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,840
Go Hui Yeong's ugly true colours. This feels so satisfying.

319
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
Right, Se Ra?

320
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,880
What's with that look?

321
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,810
Don't tell me you feel sorry for Go Hui Yeong.

322
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,080
I know what it feels like to fall from the very top.

323
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,390
Goodness gracious.

324
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,889
I know this is a little blunt,

325
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,430
but you're not exactly in a position to worry about anyone else.

326
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,130
That's why this is a golden opportunity.

327
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
"An opportunity?"

328
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:09,270
Yes. Just as she used your crash as a stepping stone to rise,

329
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,240
it's your chance to step on her.

330
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,310
So you're telling me to push her aside and snatch the lead role?

331
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,510
Exactly.

332
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,450
Goodness.

333
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,690
You know, my body really shines when I'm shirtless for a role.

334
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,060
Even if I just work out a little, I get an insane pump.

335
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,230
Hey, Mr. Loner. A pretty face is not enough.

336
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,470
You need to build a solid foundation like I have.

337
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,239
It's Mr. Dokgo, not Mr. Loner.

338
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,679
All right. I'll show you.

339
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,380
- Move. - What?

340
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,410
- You've done this before? - No, just watch me.

341
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,480
If you do it like this...

342
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,290
Do it my way to get a great body.

343
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,350
Hello?

344
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,960
There we go.

345
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,730
The lead actor is dropping out?

346
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
Yes.

347
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,030
So does that mean production is on hold until this is sorted out?

348
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,700
I see. Yes, I understand.

349
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,470
Alright.

350
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,609
Right. Okay.

351
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,379
- Mr. Loner. What is this? - Seriously.

352
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,680
- Hurry. - Try lifting it up.

353
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,980
- Excuse me? - Try.

354
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,980
No! Help me.

355
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,580
- Help me, quick! - Goodness.

356
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,990
Come on.

357
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,020
- Didn't you say "solid foundation?" - I'm sorry.

358
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
Goodness.

359
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,999
(A public office asking for cash? That's voice phishing!)

360
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hey.

361
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,500
Here's the phone's forensics report we found in Ju Seung Pil's car.

362
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,700
But I thought you said there was no phone in the car.

363
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,770
We didn't find it during the initial crime scene investigation,

364
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,169
but while processing the vehicle,

365
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,180
we found a burner phone hidden in the trunk floor.

366
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,710
Any contact information on Assemblyman Min Guk Hee?

367
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,050
Of course not. He only called a single number.

368
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
We're pretty sure it's Kwak Jung Do.

369
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,750
The calls began when he disappeared.

370
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,890
What's this?

371
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey. Isn't this for a boat leaving tonight?

372
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,600
It looks like he's trying to flee the country illegally.

373
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,370
I'm heading out now. You call for backup. Okay?

374
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,440
- We have to go together. - Run a trace on the burner phone.

375
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,820
I really don't get it.

376
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,850
Why are you tagging along? You're in the Traffic Department!

377
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,650
We even got rammed by those punks.

378
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,260
You expect me to do nothing?

379
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,930
Don't you dare pull that out. You hear me?

380
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,660
Last time, I got my gun taken and almost got killed.

381
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,770
They started this, and I'm going to finish it.

382
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,300
- Let's go! - Gosh.

383
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,610
Keep it up, and you'll get killed. Seriously.

384
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,300
What is that? Darn it!

385
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,310
Kwak Jung Do! You're finished, you punk!

386
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,440
Let's do this the easy way. All right?

387
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,840
- Darn it. - You little...

388
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Hey.

389
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,410
Come on.

390
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,150
It's locked, you punk!

391
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,660
What's that?

392
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Hey!

393
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,220
Good thing you brought it, Byeong Gil.

394
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,020
When did you snatch that?

395
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,450
Catch. Do it quick.

396
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,660
You're letting me do it?

397
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
Goodness.

398
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,860
- Gosh. - You punk.

399
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm the one who caught you.

400
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,760
Does that hurt? This is breaking my heart, you punk.

401
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,500
That must have been painful.

402
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,340
You're not going to die, are you?

403
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,200
No, this won't kill him.

404
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,520
You have no idea how worried I was.

405
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,390
After you got beaten up at the hotel,

406
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,860
I wondered if our dear attempted murderer here got hurt,

407
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,800
if you were getting proper medical treatment,

408
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,530
or if you had killed yourself before you could be caught.

409
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,010
You heard what happened to the boss on the news, didn't you?

410
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,080
Right now, we're the only ones who care if you live or die.

411
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,680
I know your playbook. It's obvious.

412
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,849
You promise me a reduced sentence,

413
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,750
sweet-talk me into a confession, then leave me high and dry.

414
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,690
Isn't that a little played out?

415
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,430
Would this be more original for you?

416
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,760
So, what's the job?

417
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,270
They said to take care of a woman.

418
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,869
Well, 1 of 2 things will work.

419
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,540
Either just kill her or cripple her.

420
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,540
There are only two reasons why I'd never see you again.

421
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,980
One, you do the job so perfectly that we never see each other again.

422
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Or you screw up even a little, and I make sure we never meet again.

423
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,750
Recording without consent is illegal, isn't it?

424
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,090
An illegal recording can't be used as evidence.

425
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,689
That's right.

426
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,760
But...

427
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,800
But testimony is a different story.

428
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,040
Everyone on that recording is dead,

429
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,710
so who's going to testify?

430
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,530
What happened?

431
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
He apparently had a seizure. We've checked the CCTV footage.

432
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,270
And besides the medical staff, no one went in or out.

433
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,070
From now on, this will be treated as the Kang Dae Gu murder case.

434
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,980
What about the body?

435
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,890
The moment Ju Seung Pil finds out Kang Dae Gu is alive,

436
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,720
he'll definitely come for you.

437
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,430
There's only one way to survive.

438
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,430
You have to reveal the truth.

439
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Well...

440
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:38,920
Why don't you look happier to see each other?

441
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,149
You were dead. How are you alive?

442
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,220
Why? Are you disappointed you couldn't kill me?

443
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,090
Then try to kill me right now.

444
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,729
Go on and try, you punk.

445
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,200
Hey. Hold on. Just calm down.

446
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,170
This isn't why I called you here, is it?

447
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,330
Calm down.

448
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
Okay?

449
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,540
Okay, I'll talk.

450
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,680
The jerk who hired me to kill Bong Chung Ja,

451
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,550
is this punk right here!

452
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,020
Kwak Jung Do. Since it's come to this,

453
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,120
wouldn't it be unfair for you to take the fall all by yourself?

454
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Okay.

455
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,390
You know how this goes.

456
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,630
When it comes to prison time,

457
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,630
it's meant to be shared.

458
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,230
Right?

459
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,549
(Notice of Contract Termination)

(2ONE Entertainment CEO Kang Du Won)

461
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,730
It's you.

462
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,040
Gosh. Are you crazy?

463
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,040
I think you're the crazy one, not me.

464
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,210
You! How dare you touch my niece?

465
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,940
My niece?

466
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,080
Give it!

467
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,849
Darn it.

468
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,479
You can't just hit me.

469
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,980
That hurts. Gosh.

470
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,050
What's this?

471
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,090
You sent this, didn't you?

472
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,190
And what if I did?

473
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,590
Don't tell me you came to thank me.

474
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,300
- To give you one last chance. - "A chance?"

475
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,299
Did I have any left?

476
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,710
A chance to reveal the whole truth and pay for your crimes.

477
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,550
What kind of nonsense is that?

478
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,850
Do you know what it took for me to get here?

479
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,150
And you want me to just throw it all away and step down?

480
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,650
That position isn't one you earned on your own merit anyway.

481
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,090
I...

482
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,770
I haven't had a single peaceful night's sleep since that day, too.

483
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,670
You're not the only one who's been suffering.

484
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,380
That was your last chance, and you just blew it.

485
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,450
Se Ra!

486
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,080
If it weren't for me,

487
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,290
you would've died a cafeteria lady without knowing a thing.

488
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,120
Who do you think you have to thank for returning as Lim Se Ra?

489
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,559
Who made your spectacular comeback?

490
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,590
It's all...

491
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,670
- thanks to me. - What did you say?

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,070
You didn't send that recording file for my sake.

493
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,509
You used me...

494
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,310
to get rid of Assemblyman Min and Ju Seung Pil, who exploit you.

495
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,210
And I was just a means to an end for you.

496
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,380
Gosh.

497
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,360
Your script analysis is brilliant.

498
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,690
I guess you didn't know.

499
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,300
You may have a good eye for scripts, but I have real analytical skills.

500
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,370
And that's why I'm such a good actress.

501
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,520
- This is a warrant for your arrest. - "Arrest?"

502
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,590
Gosh. What did I do wrong?

503
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,160
Let's see.

504
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,359
Forcing talent into prostitution, aiding in sexual offences,

505
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,600
sexual assault, and abetting sexual harassment.

506
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,630
Should I go on?

507
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,200
Let go. Let go of me!

508
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,070
I'll walk on my own with my own two feet.

509
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,280
Get out of my way.

(Jumbo Gosiwon)

511
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,720
Se Ra.

512
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,670
What is this?

513
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,510
- What? - Gosh. What is this?

514
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,930
What do you think you're doing?

515
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,630
You already know.

516
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,700
You know what I did.

517
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
And?

518
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,770
Did you get scared all of a sudden that I was going to get revenge?

519
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,310
- Se Ra. - You were silent for 25 years.

520
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,050
So why the sudden change of heart?

521
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

522
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,700
Honestly, I expected this from Go Hui Yeong,

523
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,060
but you shouldn't be doing this to me, of all people.

524
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,910
I cared about you so much.

525
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,880
You, Tae Sook, and Du Won...

526
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,080
I really wanted to believe in you all until the end.

527
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,890
I mean it.

528
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,860
I truly thought of us as a family.

529
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,600
But I guess I was the only one.

530
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,680
And all that time you watched me...

531
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
was it amusing to you?

532
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,120
At first, if I didn't keep my mouth shut,

533
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,460
I was afraid I'd get hurt too.

534
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,230
And later on,

535
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:38,170
I didn't want to lose what I'd gained from it.

536
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,170
But honestly, Se Ra. I've always felt terrible.

537
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,180
I was so wracked with guilt, I never had a moment's peace.

538
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm serious.

539
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll give you a chance.

540
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,700
To prove if you really mean it.

541
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,719
A lot of people have been asking...

542
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,790
why actress Go Hui Yeong and I have parted ways.

543
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,790
The story is so shocking.

544
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,160
You may want to prepare yourselves.

545
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,670
I'm about to confess a secret that I've kept hidden...

546
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,140
for 25 years.

547
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,410
Oh, my gosh.

548
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,210
- Honey! - What is it?

549
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,680
She's lost her mind.

550
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,880
I knew about Go Hui Yeong's crimes 25 years ago.

551
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,290
But in exchange for my silence,

552
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,760
I shared the rewards she gained...

553
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,090
by pushing Lim Se Ra out of the picture.

554
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
This crazy...

555
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
I gained wealth and fame,

556
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:22,310
but I was always living with anxiety and guilt.

557
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,069
She has surrendered.

558
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,279
Why confess now, of all times? She should've spoken up sooner.

559
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,779
It's been 25 years. What can be done to Go Hui Yeong?

560
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,910
Will they arrest her for defamation? What can they possibly do?

561
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,020
- Unbelievable. - Oh, no.

562
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,490
For her, the biggest punishment is never being able to act again.

563
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,120
Right. She'll never come back, will she?

564
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,160
- Her career is over. - Exactly.

565
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,789
- Hey. But what about our show? - Your show?

566
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,099
- Yes. - Won't your drama be cancelled?

567
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
- What? - What?

568
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,200
Sue them all!

569
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,540
Sue that wench Chavely for libel.

570
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,840
And sue all the online trolls and reporters who posted fake news.

571
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,340
And tell them to stop it!

572
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,049
Oh, no.

573
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,210
That might just backfire on us.

574
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,880
You be quiet, and go find me a lawyer quickly.

575
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,320
Has she lost her mind?

576
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,520
- Oh, my gosh. - Hui Yeong!

577
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,090
Hui Yeong. We're in big trouble!

578
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,560
How could things possibly get worse?

579
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,370
What's this now?

580
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,109
("Go Hui Yeong to Face Police Investigation...")

581
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,240
("Over Alleged Illegal Tranquillizer Use")

582
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,849
("Go Hui Yeong's Illegal Use of Tranquillizers")

583
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,609
A confession about the past with no legal standing...

584
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,880
will be blown over in no time.

585
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,199
What are we going to do?

586
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,830
Police arrested CEO Kang Du Won for prostitution and solicitation,

587
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,840
as well as violating laws on the sexual protection of minors,

588
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,599
and for bribery and embezzlement.

589
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,840
He was immediately taken into custody.

590
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,170
Are these allegations true?

591
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,160
Dokgo Cheol. What are you doing here?

592
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,090
Nice mugshot.

593
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,260
(Police, Busan Bunam Police Station, Officer Dokgo Cheol)

594
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,030
What on earth? This was a setup?

595
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,040
The great Kang Du Won got played?

596
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,980
Yes, you got played. What are you going to do about it?

597
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,140
And by a nobody like me, of all people.

598
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,180
Unbelievable. Beaten by a pathetic loser like him.

599
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,879
That's just great.

600
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,950
That's just...

601
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,390
very impressive.

602
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,490
Goodness.

603
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,820
Brother. I mean, Detective.

604
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,690
I'm being framed here.

605
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,860
As you know from the company search...

606
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,200
- We found a lot of dirt. - Exactly!

607
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,400
Do you know why you found so much?

608
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,899
It's all because of Ju Seung Pil...

609
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,000
I know.

610
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,770
You do?

611
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,740
Then I bet you know this, too.

612
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,550
- Who's backing Ju Seung Pil? - "Backing him?"

613
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,420
Wait. Is someone above him?

614
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,960
I can clear up that little headache for you.

615
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,860
- Are you serious? - Yes.

616
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,630
My MBTI type is the Judging-type, a meticulous planner.

617
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,270
- "Judging-type?" - Yes.

618
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,740
I think I'm the Perceiving-type. Anyway, so what?

619
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,210
Just in case,

620
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,310
I took out a little insurance policy.

621
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,450
So you've hidden something away.

622
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,789
No wonder our search and seizure came up empty.

623
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,190
Of course.

624
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,960
I've got it tucked away in my secret little honey pot.

625
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,560
I was hoping we could negotiate my sentence.

626
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,500
- "Honey pot." - Yes, a honey pot.

627
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,500
- A honey pot. - A honey pot.

628
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,670
A honey pot.

629
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,240
- Kang Du Won. - Yes.

630
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,980
How about I get you a harsher charge and you do ten years in the slammer?

631
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,350
Where did that come from?

632
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Why are you being so harsh?

633
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,490
My lawyer told me...

634
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,089
I'd get 4 or 5 years at most,

635
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,220
and maybe even get off with probation.

636
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
Starting with Im Se Ra 25 years ago,

637
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,469
to Yun Jeong, who killed herself three years ago,

638
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,640
and even Riley.

639
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,699
Do you want me to spell out everything you've done?

640
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,009
I'll break a rib for each one.

641
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,040
Do you?

642
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,080
Wait. Please, stop!

643
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,440
Spill it if you want to live.

644
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,350
Where is the honey pot you mentioned?

645
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,580
I'll talk!

646
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,050
- Where is it, you punk! - I'll talk!

647
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,890
You're going to kill me!

648
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,630
Three, two, one.

649
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,300
The cushion!

650
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,030
It's in the cushion.

651
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,499
- A cushion? - Yes.

652
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,270
The cushion that I always sit on. The round one.

653
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,610
The one you sit...

654
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,510
Yes, that donut cushion.

655
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,920
Gosh. This guy is something else.

656
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,450
- It better be there. - Yes, sir.

657
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,700
I've got eyes in the back of my head.

658
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,130
Yes. Congratulations.

659
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,500
What?

660
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,000
- "Congratulations?" - No.

661
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,670
- What did you just say to me? - Nothing. I'm sorry.

662
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,280
- What? - Nothing. I said I'm sorry.

663
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,210
- I'm just going to... - Sir, here's your ID.

664
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,310
Oh, gosh.

665
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,520
- Seriously. - I'm sorry.

666
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,090
Is this it?

667
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,530
I'll check the cushions next time.

668
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,759
Gosh. I never would have thought.

669
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,960
That he'd hide it in here.

670
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,400
Hey. You do it.

671
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,070
- Darn it. - Me?

672
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,639
Then, who else? Is there anyone else here?

673
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,769
Hurry up and search it.

674
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,810
Hurry.

675
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,320
Do you see it?

676
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,320
There's something in here.

677
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,690
There is?

678
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,090
Hold on.

679
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,330
Gosh. This honey pot is in a really nasty spot.

680
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,810
Seung Pil and I...

681
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,140
were just following orders.

682
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,550
So...

683
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,320
Who gave the order?

684
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,690
Assemblyman Min Guk Hee.

685
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Here.

686
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,530
I got the confession and secured the evidence.

687
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,630
What more do you need?

688
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,270
Assemblyman Min is running for mayor.

689
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,410
The front-runner with a huge lead in the polls, no less.

690
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,840
Gosh. Seriously.

691
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,080
Don't tell me you're getting cold feet now.

692
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,380
It's normal to have cold feet! You're the one who's not normal.

693
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,279
Okay, fine. I take the fall, you get the credit.

694
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,319
Are we good then?

695
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,189
Just give me the warrant for Assemblyman Min.

696
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,860
We don't have time. Come on. Hurry up.

697
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,530
What happened to the spirited Chief I once knew?

698
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,890
Seriously. Here.

699
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,330
Does family change a man this much?

700
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,600
If this really goes south, it's all on you.

701
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,970
I know. Hurry up!

702
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,540
Come on. Hurry!

703
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,439
In the key 50s demographic for this election,

704
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,450
Among the voters in their 50s, a key demographic for this election,

705
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,110
you're the front-runner with an overwhelming approval rating.

706
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,820
If this trend continues,

707
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,650
I believe your election as the mayor of Seoul is all but guaranteed.

708
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,890
And...

709
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:30,930
Here.

710
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,830
This is an arrest warrant.

711
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,199
Assemblyman Min Guk Hee,

712
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,560
you are under arrest on charges of inciting murder.

713
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,169
Aide Choi Seung Hee, you are under emergency arrest...

714
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,670
of charges of inciting the murder of Ju Seung Pil.

715
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,070
- Okay. - Let's go.

716
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,570
Sir!

717
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,510
Let's go.

718
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,580
(Saebaram Party)

719
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,220
Aren't you going to eat?

720
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,370
Get up.

721
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,080
Get up. Right now!

722
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,680
Am I dead or something?

723
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,680
Is it the end of the world?

724
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,020
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

725
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,649
This is exactly what you wanted.

726
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,760
That's right. Those useless scumbags?

727
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,060
They take advantage of naive kids and make them do whatever.

728
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,300
You were too naive to know better and went crawling to them yourself.

729
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,870
Your aunt barely made it out alive.

730
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,300
I'm so glad that darn company went bankrupt. It's such a relief.

731
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,200
This is your chance to wake up.

732
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,040
Don't even think about becoming a celebrity.

733
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,740
It's not the path for you. Don't you get it after all this?

734
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,950
What do you know?

735
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,550
How can you say that when you know nothing about it?

736
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,529
(Bong Dumpling Shop)

737
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,090
Thanks. That was delicious.

738
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,330
You could've at least said hello.

739
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,170
Why did you just drop off the food and go?

740
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,510
What's with the long face? Is something wrong?

741
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,340
It's Da Hee.

742
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,650
She hasn't gone to school since that day.

743
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,920
She won't eat, and she won't leave her room.

744
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,060
Maybe I should go talk to her?

745
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,930
Don't.

746
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,560
You two are exactly alike.

747
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,570
You'll say you want to comfort her, but you'll just be stirring the pot.

748
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,080
Do you really hate it that much?

749
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,820
I get that you're sick of it because of me.

750
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,220
Like you said, the world I work in...

751
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,860
and the world Da Hee dreams of is by no means an easy one.

752
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,130
- Exactly. - But do you know why I went back?

753
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,730
I'm willing to put up with all the hardship and pain...

754
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,670
because it's the work I love.

755
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,940
- You're crazy. - You're right.

756
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,140
You have to be crazy to be in this business.

757
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,610
That's why I have no regrets.

758
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,090
Just like you came to understand and accept me again,

759
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,090
can't you try to understand Da Hee, too?

760
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,870
Baek Ja, you're the reason Lim Se Ra could even exist.

761
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,100
Without my family's support,

762
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,970
I can't do anything.

763
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,570
What do you know about me?

764
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,410

00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,170

I'm Queen of Cannes, Go Hui Yeong.

768
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,020
Hui Yeong. Are you in there?

769
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Hello?

770
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
If you're in there, please open the door.

771
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,589
If I don't do it, then that's that.

772
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,590
Yes.

773
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,360
Hui Yeong!

774
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,090
Hui Yeong!

775
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,900
Gosh. I'm not ready yet.

776
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,109
Just call the set and tell them we're running late.

777
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,440
Call the salon, too. What are we going to do?

778
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,080
Did you take pills again?

779
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,980
Watch your mouth!

780
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,880
I told you already.

781
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,850
They're just tranquillizers.

782
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,419
It's because of that wench, Lim Se Ra.

783
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,320
I can't even function with this headache.

784
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,760
This time, I'm going to crush her so she can never get back up again.

785
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,329
I'll crush her under my heel. I'll grind her into the dust.

786
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,370
Hui Yeong, please. Pull yourself together.

787
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,220
So I'm really done for now, right?

788
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,990
Today is my last day.

789
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,500
You're leaving me, too?

You disloyal punk!

791
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,400
I have to look out for myself.

792
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,170
You take care of yourself, too.

793
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,340
- Cut! Okay. That was great. - Good work.

794
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,709
- Great work, everyone. - Good work.

795
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:02,039
- Good work. - Good work.

796
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,350
- Oh, gosh. - Great work.

797

No, I should thank you, Chung Ja. You got the finale script so late.

Please.

803

When Go Hui Yeong dropped out, your part just kept getting bigger.

804
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,830

00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,410
How about one last gig as my manager for a day?

895
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,640
"The last gig?" What's on the schedule?

896
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,720
You're a real manager now. Asking about the schedule and all.

897
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,220
What do you need me for? Tell me.

898
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,060
And you'll do it if I tell you?

899
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,189
Well, I'm back with the CID, so I'm a little busy.

900
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,600
Oh, you are?

901
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,430
Then forget it.

902
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
No, that's not what I meant.

903
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,970
I mean, I'll do it no matter how busy I am.

904
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,770
Playing hard to get when you were going to do it anyway.

905
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,639
Come on, I need to know what it is so I know whether to prepare or not.

906
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,740
There's nothing to prepare.

907
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,680
- All you have to do is show up. - Really?

908
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,349
What about things like hot packs, bellflower tea, blankets, or a fan?

909
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,380
You don't need any of that?

910
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,590
Just come and sit there.

911
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,590
You'll come, right? Good.

912
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,800
- Seriously, what is it? - You'll see when you get there.

913
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,430
You're really not going to tell me?

914
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,080
(The 45th Geumsang Film Festival)

915
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,180
You should've told me if it was something like this.

916
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:00,559
- Hello. - Look over here, please.

917
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,959
Good luck out there.

918
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,070
- Please look here, - Over here.

919
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,900
- Over here, please! - Very nice.

920
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,940
Wave for us, please!

921
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,650
- Look here. - Over here, too!

922
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,059
That's Bong Chung Ja.

923
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,599
This was the most contested category of the year.

924
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,740
The Best Supporting Actress award goes to Lim Se Ra for "Ms. Casting!"

925
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,310
Actress Lim Se Ra returned after many years.

926
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,350
- Oh, my gosh! - Congratulations again on your win.

927
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,890
Let's go, Lim Se Ra!

928
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,290
Let's go!

929
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,900
It's been 25 years.

930
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,829
Twenty-five years ago,

931
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,840
while giving a speech on this stage,

932
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,340
I believed I would go on to star in countless other projects.

933
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,410
But in the 25 years that followed,

934
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,880
I was only given two roles.

935
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,380
And in one of those,

936
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,220
I had a minor role.

937
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,030
But thanks to that part, I met a wonderful writer,

938
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,330
was cast in a truly special film,

939
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,600
and I gained cherished colleagues.

940
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,570
The reason I'm able to stand on this stage again...

941
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,570
is because people let me act again despite my many shortcomings.

942
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,410
People who believed in me and waited for me.

943
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,150
To my dear sister Baek Ja, who always looked out for me,

944
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,720
and believed in me.

945
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:07,520
And to my beloved niece, Da Hee.

946
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,529
Who never forgot me, even when I had forgotten,

947
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,030
and who waited for me.

948
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,400
Dad.

949
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,270
Dad, you're watching this, right?

950
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,570
I love you.

951
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,710
And to Tae Sook, who's always been on my side through the years,

952
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:31,509
and Gu Nam Ju, who's now a colleague I've grown fond of.

953
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,450
Oh, she called your name. Honey.

954
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,080
Thank you all.

955
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,820
Why are you crying?

956
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,720
Don't cry on such a happy day.

957
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,450
Se Ra.

958
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,320
When I had hit rock bottom,

959
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:48,160
Yu Ran, who didn't turn away but reached out her hand,

960
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,699
and my family at the gosiwon.

961
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,069
- Gosiwon. That's us! - Oh, my gosh.

962
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,299
That's awesome.

963
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,540
- Gosh. - And finally,

964
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,140
to the driving force who enabled me to get this far...

965
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,250
who believed in and supported me through it all.

966
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,720
To my precious manager, 0728,

967
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,790
I dedicate this award.

968
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,620
Everyone.

969
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,220
Even when you've hit rock bottom and all seems lost,

970
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,990
there is still hope.

971
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:50,590
As long as you can endure, don't you ever give up.

972
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:55,260
As long as you can bear it, don't you ever give in.

973
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,600
To everyone out there struggling to hang on and endure right now,

974
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,970
you are the true heroes.

975
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,010
Finally, this is for all of you.

976
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,840
Thank you.

977
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,190
Let's go, Lim Se Ra!

978
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:20,450
Let's go, Lim Se Ra!

979
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,790
Let's go, Lim Se Ra!

980
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,369
- Let's make a toast. - Cheers!

981
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,770
- Cheers. - Cheers.

982
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:47,320
(Room where Lim Se Ra stayed)

983
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:04,070
(Jumbo Gosiwon)

984
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:10,300
(Recommended by Actress Lim Se Ra, Jumbo Gosiwon)

985
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:14,180
Next is for the person who has shown long dedication in their field,

986
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,950
who has worked tirelessly and made immense contributions.

987
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,850
With decades of unwavering passion and creative innovation,

988
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,090
this person led a transformation in our culture and arts scene.

989
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:30,120
With their sincere and warm work, they've captured the hearts of many.

990
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:39,429
We will now start the conference.

991
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,770
Please start with your questions.

992
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,769
This project was nearly cancelled due to Go Hui Yeong,

993
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,340
but it was saved.

994
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:47,579
This must be very meaningful for you.

995
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,340
Could you please share your thoughts?

996
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,450
This project felt like a reflection of my own life.

997
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,280
That's why I was so determined not to give up on it,

998
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,520
and because I truly gave it my all until the very end,

999
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,920
I believe I'm able to receive this wonderful award today.

1000
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,729
You had a scandal with Won Ban 25 years ago,

1001
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,330
and now there's another one. Is there nothing between you?

1002
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,570
Won Ban is a wonderful actor and a good colleague.

1003
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,940
That's all there is to it.

1004
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,739
We'll take no more questions on him.

1005
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,340
What about the other guy?

1006
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,310
I read in an article.

1007
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,309
You were close to your prior manager,

1008
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,680
but your agency denied any romance.

1009
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,179
But you have a new manager now,

1010
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,950
is there a particular reason for that?

1011
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,789
Well..

1012
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,560
The former manager quit for personal reasons.

1013
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,190
There is absolutely nothing going on between them.

1014
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,200
We'd like Lim Se Ra to answer for herself.

1015
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,059
That's enough.

1016
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,699
- I guess it's true then. - So they're just friends?

1017
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,069
- What's wrong with the atmosphere? - Maybe, they're going out.

1018
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,969
- They're something. - I knew it.

1019
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,209
They're not taking more questions for a reason.

1020
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,369
- What is it? Gosh. I'm curious. - I wonder what it is.

1021
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,380
To me,

1022
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,180
he's someone very precious.

1023
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,780
You said he's precious. Does that mean you're a couple?

1024
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,350
Please refrain from speculation.

1025
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,490
He was just my professional partner.

1026
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,430
And he's not my manager anymore.

1027
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,170
Just a professional partner?

1028
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,650
Oh, my. Why is he saying that?

1029
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,120
What if that person...

1030
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,590
doesn't want to be just partners?

1031
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,219
- What? - Where did he come from?

1032
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,429
- What is he saying? - He's the manager.

1033
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,059
- He's a reporter, right? - He's not a reporter.

1034
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,929
- He's the manager. - He is.

1035
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,229
We'll take him out.

1036
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,500
(Geumsang Film Festival)

1037
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,540
Can you be more specific?

1038
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,510
What kind of partner?

1039
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,039
He's definitely not the manager.

1040
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,339
- I think he is. - Who is he?

1041
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,650
- He looks familiar. - Suddenly?

1042
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,820
Well...

1043
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,520
Someone who can walk with you toward the light.

1044
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:16,160
If I said that's our relationship, would that be convincing?

1045
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,070
No.

1046
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,110
That's exactly...

1047
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,280
what I want.

1048
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,650
Oh, my gosh.

1049
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:02,700
Se Ra!

1050
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,310
I'm going to go back...

1051
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,380
to my place.

1052
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,180
Did you want to restart your career just to be treated like this?

1053
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,720
If I lose this opportunity,

1054
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,179
I'll end up as an extra, waiting for another chance...

1055
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,319
not knowing how long it will take.

1056
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,389
Who are you?

1057
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,490
- I'm Bong Chung Ja's... - He's my manager.

1058
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,930
I was shining in the sky.

1059
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,100
I had turned into a shooting star and crashed.

1060
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,070
And I went crashing straight to rock bottom.

1061
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,040
That was the best performance I have ever seen.

1062
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,940
I guarantee it.

1063
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,279
No one else could have done it that well.

1064
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,009
To Go Hui Yeong, of all people.

1065
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,380
And of all people...

1066
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:48,180
You had to be the one.

1067
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,980
I told you before.

1068
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,090
As your true manager,

1069
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,090
I'd always be here for you.

1070
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,360
I think you're the first I've seen reclaim a dream they'd lost.

1071
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,430
You were the only one for me too, Detective.

1072
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,200
The only person who believed in me when I said I was making a comeback.

1073
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,419
Is this the precious manager you mentioned in your acceptance speech?

1074
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,950
Is this a public proposal?

1075
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:34,690
(Epilogue)

1076
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,520
Fortunately, they were moved to a hospital room.

1077
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,490
I'll head back after getting a statement.

1078
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,060
- One, two. Action. - Action.

1079
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,330
Why is this standing up?

1080
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,200
It's standing up.

1081
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,039
Why, you old woman...

1082
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,070
Are you out of your mind?

1083
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,750
That didn't work. You're too light.

1084
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,519
Just go! Please!

1085
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,690
A car comes crashing.

1086
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,760
A car comes crashing.

1087
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,259
(Director: Laughing)

1088
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,290
Okay.

1089
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,070
Okay, for now.

1090
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,170
- It's me. - Tuck your chin in and look up.

1091
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,339
- Good. - Then how about this one?

1092
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,140
- It's me. - That was good.

1093
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,240
It's me.

1094
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,050
It's me.

1095
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,220
It's me.

1096
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,090
It's me.

1097
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,730
I know, right?

1098
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,359
You're so successful.

1099
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,960
How come you didn't stay in touch all these years.

1100
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,029
(Du Won: Laughing)

1101
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,530
- How come you didn't. - There was more to that.

1102
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:52,700
The scene is over.

1103
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,570
- It's over. - Se Ra.

1104
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,540
- Was that an NG? - What?

1105
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,939
It was fine. What happened?

1106
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,310
- Was it good? - Yes. It's great.

1107
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,920
Darn it.

1108
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,960
Shall we go for it?

1109
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,859
The love between you and me

1110
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,100
Did it show too much?

1111
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,830
- A little bit. - Alright

1112
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,500
Look into the camera this time.

1113
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,380
Okay. Do it cool this time.

1114
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,750
How can this be cool?

1115
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:41,250
- How can this be cool? - Just your face.

1116
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,380
Cue.

1117
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
You are cool.

1118
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,520
How could someone change that much?

1119
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,559
Seriously, I couldn't recognise him.

1120
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,530
He's aged terribly.

1121
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,730
(A reality hit)

1122
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:57,760
Honey?

1123
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,900
Are you crazy?

1124
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:08,080
You used to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

1125
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,650
- No way! - No way!

1126
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,520
No way!

1127
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,749
Was that too much?

1128
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,820
(Taek Sook: Laughing)

1129
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,299
Okay. Cut.

1130
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,200
Why don't you use this opportunity and start dating Won Ban for real?

1131
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,309
It seems Won Ban still...

1132
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,470
Still...

1133
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,080
- What was it? Still... - Still likes you.

1134
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,280
I'm drunk.

1135
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,010
- Seriously. - So drunk.

1136
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,150
Gosh. I'm so drunk.

1137
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,550
Okay.

1138
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,350
Gosh. Are you all right?

1139
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,020
Are you sure you're okay?

1140
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,630
Please, don't worry about anything else.

1141
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,059
(Laughter)

1142
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,600
I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.

1143
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,730
Hold on!

1144
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,940
Gosh. Come on.

1145
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,049
(Thank you for watching My Troublesome Star.)

1146
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,460
(The end!)
