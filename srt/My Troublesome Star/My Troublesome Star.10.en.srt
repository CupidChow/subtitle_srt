00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,590
It's me. I'm here.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,600
- Where are you? - At your place.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,830
Wait, you're here? But why?

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,300
Well, you got hurt helping me. How could I just ignore it?

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,299
I may not be able to treat you,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,069
but I can at least make you porridge.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,809
I'm telling you I'm fine. Okay?

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,110
Open the door.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,450
What? Oh, you're already here?

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,179
I'm right outside your door! Hurry up!

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,280
This is heavy.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,849
Just a minute! Wait! Hold on! Just a second!

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,920
You must be in too much pain to even move.

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,789
All right, just tell me the code. You just stay put.

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,859
I'll let myself in.

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,599
No, that's not it. It's just...

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,230
Hurry up. This is heavy.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,409
Okay, it's 0728.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,140
- I'll be right out. - Hello?

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,640
So 0728...

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,260
I dedicate this award to 0728,

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,730
who gave me great strength and courage...

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,870
when I was struggling.

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,969
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,039
The broth should be clear.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,739
You need to add only a bit of salted shrimps.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,040
You season it with salted shrimp. Here, let me.

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,310
Isn't Busan your hometown?

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,750
How did you know?

42
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,890
To all the people expecting the old Lim Se Ra,

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,320
the way I am now must be such a disappointment.

44
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,460
Back then and now, you seem the same to me.

45
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,770
I'm just glad you're safe. I mean it.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,600
(Open)

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,880
I told you I'm okay.

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,890
What's wrong?

49
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,730
It's nothing.

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,910
Oh, come in. My goodness, what is all this?

51
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,410
Here, let me get that.

52
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,280
Come on in.

53
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,970
My type is a moderately masculine build,

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,540
and intense eyes that seem to look only at me.

55
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,240
With an honest voice...

56
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,779
He had absolutely no clue how to dress.

57
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,310
And his face was so tanned as if it were stained with dirt.

58
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,320
If I were that detective, I wouldn't like Lim Se Ra.

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,959
You kept putting down the rookie detective.

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,729
So what if I praise or critique him?

61
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,529
What's it to you, Detective?

62
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,930
Come on, it does concern me.

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,900
I mean, the thing is...

64
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,700
Don't tell me you've been pretending all this time?

65
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,239
Gosh. How long has it been since I've been to Busan?

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Are you talking about that police station in Busan you mentioned?

67
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,610
You had so many chances to tell me the truth,

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,650
and you played dumb all this time?

69
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,650
No one's looking.

70
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,190
What is all this stuff?

71
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,690
Gosh.

72
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,370
People who live alone don't eat properly.

73
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,570
And you're sick, on top of that.

74
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
Do you even know how to cook?

75
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,579
Gosh! What's this?

76
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,879
What's your problem with hospitals? If you're sick, you see a doctor.

77
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,490
Why are you treating it yourself? Honestly...

78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,920
Eel.

79
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,359
Gosh, I thought it was a snake. Anyway, I use first-aid medicine.

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,559
And I'm fine after a good night's sleep.

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,630
That's how you get a chronic injury. What, you think you're still young?

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,200
You think you're as spry as you used to be?

83
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,570
People think I'm in my 30s. I even get carded sometimes.

84
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,740
Look at you lying with a straight face.

85
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,280
Are you always such a good liar?

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,420
What? When have I ever lied to you?

87
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,360
There's really nothing?

88
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,390
Nothing you've hidden or lied about?

89
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,370
Well...

90
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,170
I don't think so.

91
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,840
Remember that detective I told you about?

92
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,080
The rookie detective with the accent who had no style.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,890
Oh, you mean that guy from back in Busan?

94
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,720
The way you described him. How could I forget that?

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,100
His looks left a bit to be desired, but he was a good person inside.

96
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,430
"Left a bit to be desired?"

97
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Oh, I see.

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
So what was so great about him on the inside?

99
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,370
He doesn't spin a yarn.

100
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,879
What kind of actress uses language like that?

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,049
Oh, forget it. Just go.

102
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,950
I need to cook. Hurry up and go.

103
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,230
But it's just an indulgence that's not worth the money.

104
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,330
Exactly.

105
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,270
Do you know who she's marrying?

106
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
We have to get married earlier.

107
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,110
So what?

108
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,510
Oh, so you're a "dating expert" now, not a "dating coach?"

109
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,980
What does that even mean to you?

110
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,220
What meaning?

111
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,120
You can't throw that...

112
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,490
Gosh!

113
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,500
I know you live alone, but still.

114
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,530
What on earth have you been living on?

115
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,930
I live on dew.

116
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
It's all ready. Come and eat.

117
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,330
You could have at least told me.

118
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,930
Seeing you get hurt and heartbroken...

119
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
I couldn't stand to watch it anymore.

120
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,080
As your true manager, I'd always be here for you.

121
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,780
So from now on, regarding Lim Se Ra, you go through me.

122
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,420
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

123
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,590
And I didn't even realise he was right here beside me.

124
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,820
Excuse me.

125
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,920
The food you left out in the kitchen for us to share...

126
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
I really enjoyed it.

127
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,860
(This food is for you. Enjoy. Bong Chung Ja, Unit 406)

128
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,730
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,170
It's just that I can't rest easy after a free meal.

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,440
Oh, my goodness. That feels so good. This is amazing.

131
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,350
You have a hidden talent.

132
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,850
You have to learn whatever you can to get by.

133
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,650
Why live in a place like this?

134
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,290
Why do you live in a place like this, then?

135
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,130
You seem so young. Did you graduate from school?

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
I dropped out and got my GED.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I see.

138
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,040
Who cares about background nowadays, anyway?

139
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,710
I heard you used to be a super famous actress.

140
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
What, I don't look the part?

141
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,250
When I give massages,

142
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,850
sometimes I can sense someone's life through my fingertips.

143
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,790
How is mine?

144
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,720
- You haven't lived a pampered life. - Gosh.

145
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,600
You've got skillful hands.

146
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,330
I was worried you might have drugged it,

147
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,100
but it was actually quite delicious.

148
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,370
What on earth?

149
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,840
Do you think I'm crazy?

150
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,279
Why would I drug someone's food?

151
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,580
No, it's just that... I saw you in the kitchen before...

152
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Before?

153
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,749
Never mind.

154
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,550
What? Why are you stopping mid-sentence?

155
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,890
What is it?

156
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,420
Come on, what is it?

157
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Hey.

158
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,629
- Hey, I said stop filming! - Ms. Lim Se Ra!

159
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,700
Seriously!

160
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,129
Get out of here before I report you for trespassing.

161
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,600
This is all being broadcast. Watch your mouth.

162
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,769
What is all this?

163
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,609
Look, I asked for her manager but got no reply, so I came myself.

164
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,309
You all saw on TV that I live here. What more do you want to film?

165
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,520
The public is eager to hear your story of how you ended up here.

166
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,849
What do you mean, "here?" What's wrong with this place?

167
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,090
What do you mean, "here?"

168
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,230
Or is it just you who's curious, Mr. Reporter?

169
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,800
Why so determined to keep quiet? Are you hiding something?

170
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,360
That's...

171
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,840
For now, I'm focusing on my project. I'll reveal everything after that.

172
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,669
I'll even give you the exclusive. Deal?

173
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,640
I feel like a bigger story will break before then.

174
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,150
"Bigger?" What do you mean?

175
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,230
Gosh.

176
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,870
Anyone home?

177
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,510
I guess she's gone. Oh, well.

178
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,050
Eat every last bite and get better soon.

179
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,560
And don't you dare get me sick.

180
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,439
Actress Lim Se Ra, making her comeback after 25 years,

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,640
is now rumoured to be dating global Korean star, Won Ban.

182
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,939
On an online forum, photos of Won Ban and Bong Chung Ja...

183
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,449
being very affectionate on set have been posted...

184
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,950
and have since gone viral.

185
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,590
What do you mean you won't issue a statement denying the rumours?

186
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,819
(Won Ban and Lim Se Ra's Pink Romance)

187
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,260
Gosh. It means we won't confirm or deny.

188
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,359
You need to officially state that the rumours are unfounded.

189
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,729
That there's nothing going on between us.

190
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,670
And what would be the point of that?

191
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,270
- What? - Think about it.

192
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,870
This is Won Ban we're talking about.

193
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,240
An A-lister for nearly 30 years. A global superstar.

194
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,609
What do you possibly have to lose by being linked to him?

195
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,410
- I don't want this. - What if his people say it's fine?

196
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Don't tell me...

197
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,720
Did you plant this story?

198
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,829
So all this "second prime" talk was a ploy to get me to do this?

199
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,830
Let's be blunt. You're yesterday's news.

200
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,739
Young people don't care about you. But Won Ban is a different story.

201
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,400
He's still bankable.

202
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,139
So you want me to ride his coattails to generate some buzz?

203
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,110
There we go. Now we're talking. Come on, high five!

204
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,310
Yes?

205
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,349
Oh, perfect timing. You told the press, "No comment."

206
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,560
And you spread that around, right?

207
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,730
"The two are absolutely not dating." I issued an official denial.

208
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,700
What? You punk.

209
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,629
I told you exactly what to do! To subtly hint that they're dating.

210
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,169
Why did you go do your own thing? Darn it!

211
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,200
Hey, Kang Du Won!

212
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,010
You lay one finger on my manager.

213
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:58,320
Look, why not use this opportunity and start dating Won Ban for real?

214
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,459
You've lost your mind!

215
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,400
Why not? It seems Won Ban still likes you.

216
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,059
Hey, Kang Du Won!

217
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,930
You're not exactly in a position to say no.

218
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,069
I mean, honestly, in your position,

219
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,439
with absolutely nothing to your name,

220
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,509
you should be on your knees,

221
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,240
thanking him for even looking at you.

222
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,439
Gosh, you're in this pathetic state, and you still can't grasp reality.

223
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,550
You don't even know your place. Darn it.

224
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,950
Watch your mouth.

225
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,790
What has gotten into you today?

226
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,340
I was kidding. Your look could kill.

227
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,940
Gosh, so scary.

228
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,680
This is just ridiculous.

229
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,930
Thanks.

230
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Let's go.

231
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,210
Well, look at that. The punk's got some nerve.

232
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,710
Why was I intimidated? Unbelievable.

233
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,750
Gosh. That had me on pins and needles.

234
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,030
Do you have a grudge against Mr. Kang I don't know about?

235
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,830
Gosh, Detective. I've never seen you so angry before.

236
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,270
An actress?

237
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,010
The management agency that brokered the deal was Lim Se Ra's.

238
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,750
(Kang Du Won)

239
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,650
I never liked him from the start.

240
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,290
Did Mr. Kang give you a hard time when I wasn't around?

241
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,260
- No, not at all. - He must have been harassing you.

242
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Goodness.

243
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,410
From now on, if anything happens, you have to tell me.

244
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,480
Don't let him walk all over you.

245
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,110
I'm here to protect you, Chung Ja. Not the other way around.

246
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,320
That's the whole reason I joined 2ONE Entertainment.

247
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
This is the absolute last time. Just turn a blind eye this once,

248
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,740
and just think about your future.

249
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,969
What? That girl...

250
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,610
What is it? Do you know her?

251
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,050
I've seen her around. She seemed off so I tried to talk,

252
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,020
but she seemed in pain.

253
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,750
You're so close to your debut. Are you going to give up like that?

254
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,760
- How? - Well...

255
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,660
She had bruises on her body.

256
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,300
That's why I've been worried about her.

257
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,540
Put your seat belt on.

258
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,250
Are you going to follow them? What for?

259
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,819
Call it a cop's hunch.

260
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,890
I'm just going to check it out.

261
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,490
Gosh! We're going to lose them.

262
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,750
What's that building?

263
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,590
- Wait here. - Be careful.

264
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,210
Can I help you, sir?

265
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,779
Oh, I'm here for the restaurant.

266
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,680
- There is no restaurant. - What's going on?

267
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,750
Just checking, sir.

268
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,389
Oh, the cold noodle place upstairs, right?

269
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,449
There isn't one.

270
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,819
Like I said, there isn't one. Now get out.

271
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,890
Please leave.

272
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,290
Yes, okay.

273
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,230
Was it the building next door?

274
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,710
You know that I'm only doing what I am told.

275
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,140
Just because you're told to, you do everything?

276
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,510
Could you have made me do this if I were your sister?

277
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,190
No way.

278
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,490
Kang Du Won. Is that crazy punk still at it?

279
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,269
Were you able to check it out?

280
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,340
Security's too tight to get in. There's no back entrance, either.

281
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,779
Looks like they're on the top floor. We can just come back later.

282
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
Hold on.

283
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,980
Let's just wait a little longer. At least until she comes out.

284
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Excuse me.

285
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,780
Do you still...

286
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,110
not need someone to talk to?

287
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,750
I went through something difficult once, too.

288
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,790
So difficult that I couldn't tell a single soul.

289
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,400
Do you want to hear my story for a minute?

290
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,130
And why should I?

291
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,480
Because you remind me so much of myself back then.

292
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,990
What?

293
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,690
What?

294
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,460
What's going on?

295
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,720
Why are you telling me this?

296
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,690
You're just prying to see if the same thing happened to me.

297
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,629
No, it's not like that at all.

298
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,970
Coincidence? Please. I saw you following me from the office.

299
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,839
No, I think you've got the wrong idea.

300
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,510
Why? Did they tell you to spy on me?

301
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,940
Told you to see what I'd say?

302
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,610
I signed an NDA, and that should be enough!

303
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,080
No, that's not it.

304
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Wait!

305
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,860
How long have you been standing there?

306
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,800
How could you leave while I slept? What if something happened?

307
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,030
I just thought it might be better if we talked girl-to-girl.

308
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,870
It didn't go well, though.

309
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,470
How can you possibly get through to kids like that?

310
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,880
You're not even a real manager,

311
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,920
so how do you know what it's like for trainees so well?

312
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,560
I've seen it before.

313
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,660
Someone who couldn't stop...

314
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,500
and ended up getting burned.

315
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,310
Please, help me.

316
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,080
Call 911.

317
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,950
- Hurry! Are you okay? - Are you okay?

318
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,690
What's the situation?

319
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,960
We got a DNA sample, but we can't identify the offender.

320
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,700
I think he put something in my drink.

321
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,580
I don't remember anything after that.

322
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,020
How did you end up there?

323
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,250
He said he'd make an introduction.

324
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,450
That it would help me land a role.

325
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,460
It's my fault.

326
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,530
I was so stupid to fall for that.

327
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,960
It's not your fault.

328
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,230
You did absolutely nothing wrong.

329
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,910
I'm going to catch those punks for you. No matter what.

330
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,180
I promise.

331
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,480
So, don't you worry. All right?

332
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,420
Do you promise?

333
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,120
I promise.

334
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,730
- Gosh, it's stuffy. - Boss.

335
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,810
How long has that punk been tailing us?

336
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,980
- About two weeks. - That's the same punk as before.

337
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,090
Yes.

338
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,130
Yes. Sir, I'm terribly sorry, but for now,

339
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,160
I'll handle your security from a different location.

340
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,530
No, it's nothing like that. Yes, we've got a fly buzzing around.

341
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,729
A horsefly. Yes.

342
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,170
He's, not the kind of guy an assemblyman should deal with.

343
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,909
But since he's a cop, it's tricky for me to take care of him directly.

344
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,379
Yes. Don't you worry about a thing.

345
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,410
Yes.

346
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,420
The darn horsefly!

347
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,860
Do you think I'm doing this for me? I'm doing this to save you!

348
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,990
Just drop it.

349
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,860
I said stop!

350
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,530
(Dokgo Cheol)

351
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm off.

352
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,450
No!

353
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,290
It's all my fault.

354
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,890
I never should have gone there that day.

355
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,759
I was a fool to think I'd get a break...

356
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,099
if I just did what my agency said.

357
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,559
(Will)

358
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,470
I regret that stupid, split-second decision so much.

359
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,600
Detective, you were the only one on my side.

360
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,840
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,080
I'm the one who broke our promise, not you.

362
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,320
So, please, stop feeling guilty.

363
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,490
- Yes, Boss. - Hey, you still kicking?

364
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,800
Turns out there's a reason that woman has nine lives. Get it?

365
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,200
She has a pig stuck to her like a shadow,

366
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,670
playing bodyguard with his life on the line.

367
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,810
- What could even Kwak Jung Do do? - I'm sorry, sir.

368
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,150
You know me. I may not be book smart,

369
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,280
but I've gotten this far on loyalty alone.

370
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,390
- I never abandon my family. - I know, Boss.

371
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,100
Just lay low until after the election.

372
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,270
Just make sure Jung Do can't do anything stupid.

373
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,410
Yes, sir.

374
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Excuse me.

375
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm sorry. About the news article.

376
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Why would you be?

377
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,160
I feel like I'm dragging down a big star,

378
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,830
like I've become a burden.

379
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,310
- Because you got involved with me. - I wanted this.

380
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,780
The only reason I took this part is because I heard you were in it.

381
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,810
I've been waiting a long time. After I gave you my number.

382
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,260
You still remember that?

383
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,930
Because I never stopped waiting.

384
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,080
- Se Ra. - What? What is it?

385
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,540
Why have you been spacing out?

386
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,650
What are you grinning about?

387
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,850
- "Because I never stopped waiting." - Oh, you heard that?

388
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,189
Oh, my goodness, Se Ra, you got a confession from Won Ban!

389
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,890
I thought my heart was going to explode!

390
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,600
Se Ra, you two should just go public!

391
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,729
No way.

392
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,969
What do you mean, "no way?" Is it not the right time to date?

393
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,470
Or, what, you're not into Won Ban?

394
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,210
Don't tell me...

395
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,180
It's not because of your manager, is it?

396
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,379
Oh, my. Are you insane?

397
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,679
You've lost your mind!

398
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,749
Are you rejecting Won Ban for a manager with a pretty face?

399
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,089
He's more than just a pretty face, you know.

400
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,919
Oh, my goodness.

401
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,159
Listen, he's that old and still a temp manager.

402
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,259
It's not that he couldn't. He chose not to.

403
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,200
Taking his side already?

404
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,239
Hello? I spent decades supporting a loser.

405
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,699
You need to get a grip.

406
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,709
- He's a detective. - A detective?

407
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,010
What detective?

408
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,980
A detective?

409
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,920
Mr. Manager.

410
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm on your side.

411
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,130
I thought you were a fan of Won Ban's just a second ago.

412
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,180
Well, I have a bit of a weakness for law enforcement.

413
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,279
No wonder. I knew there was something special about you.

414
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,990
- Gosh, this is something else. - What...

415
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,460
Looking at you from the side...

416
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
- And from the front... - We're on set, so...

417
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,390
Even from the back...

418
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,900
That job really suits you.

419
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,970
- What do you mean? - Hey, that's sexual harassment.

420
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,070
Women can get arrested for that too, you know.

421
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,470
Hold on. Oh, my gosh, Hui Yeong!

422
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,679
This is actually perfect. Whenever the Won Ban rumours came up,

423
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,979
you'd get so stressed out. But I guess that's over now.

424
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,750
And all thanks to Se Ra, no less.

425
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,819
The public loves shipping singles. It's not like this is anything new.

426
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,090
But isn't this a little different, though?

427
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,360
I heard Won Ban liked Se Ra best.

428
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,000
Now what are you talking about?

429
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,169
- I overheard it earlier. - Okay.

430
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,440
- Won Ban said to Se Ra... - Hui Yeong.

431
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,340
Please, get ready.

432
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,880
You should go.

433
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,820
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

434
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,820
Those two look great together, don't they?

435
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,390
So, what was it that Won Ban said?

436
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,929
- He said... - Oh, don't listen to her.

437
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,799
Everything she says is baseless.

438
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,540
Well, I'd still like to hear it.

439
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,509
Wait a minute. My stories are baseless?

440
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,579
Oh, please.

441
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,709
Then is any of the gossip from your clients ever true?

442
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,580
This time I heard it clearly with my own two ears, okay?

443
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,349
Right, so could you just tell me what it was you heard? Please.

444
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,850
Hey, I said no spreading of rumours. And you're on set doing it again.

445
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,789
Fine, I won't! I won't say anything.

446
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,859
Seriously. I swear I won't say another word.

447
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,429
- No, wait... - I'm just so upset.

448
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,099
Why did I get married for this?

449
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,159
Marrying you was a mistake.

450
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,370
- Wait, but... - Wait, what were you going to say?

451
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,770
Seriously, why did he come?

452
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,640
Darn it.

453
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,170
Yes?

454
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,810
What about Ju Seung Pil?

455
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,210
He just got to the club.

456
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,580
He's practically clocking in here every day.

457
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,120
All right, keep a close eye on him.

458
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,690
Will Kwak Jung Do show up?

459
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,860
He could only hide for so long. He is bound to show his face.

460
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,260
- Just keep watching. - But I can't tomorrow.

461
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,200
Why not?

462
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,670
Wine club again?

463
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,570
No, it was all guys, so I quit. Nowadays, it's all about makgeolli.

464
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,310
Oh, makgeolli. Right.

465
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,920
Okay.

466
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,549
Enjoy your drinks tomorrow. But today, you must stick with it.

467
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,550
Okay. I'm hanging up.

468
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
Man, what a time to be alive. Seriously.

469
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,330
Yes, it's so much better.

470
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,260
Oh, no, it's nothing.

471
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,430
You have tomorrow off, right?

472
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,440
A deposit of 16,000.45 dollars. Is that correct?

473
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,910
Yes, that's correct.

474
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,580
You've now paid off all the late fees and the principal.

475
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,250
We were about to seize your assets, so I'm glad you made it in time.

476
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,820
Tell me about it.

477
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,290
But she was marked as present. What do you mean she's not there?

478
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,060
Look, I even got a text message saying she checked in.

479
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,290
How can she not be here? That makes no sense.

480
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,820
Hey, are you okay?

481
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,970
Your debut is coming up soon. Your schedule must be insane, right?

482
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,510
Still, I'm so jealous.

483
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,640
Honestly, who knows how long I'll be stuck as a trainee.

484
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,050
Nothing to be jealous of. This wasn't just handed to me.

485
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,890
What's that supposed to mean?

486
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,160
Practice is a wrap for today.

487
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,970
Where have you been?

488
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,510
Mom.

489
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,910
Take this off.

490
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,150
Mom!

491
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,590
What is this?

492
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,319
I told you I want to be a star. No, I'm going to be a star!

493
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,160
Which is exactly why I told you in no uncertain terms not to do it.

494
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,590
And you insist on going down this path anyway.

495
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,459
It's my life, not yours, Mom. This is what I want to do!

496
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,430
And look at what this life did to your aunt.

497
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,770
That path ended up destroying her. And you want to do the same?

498
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,970
Look at her now.

499
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,540
She's made a huge comeback.

500
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,480
No. Absolutely not!

501
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,280
I'm going to sue this darn company.

502
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,089
How dare they go behind my back and sign a minor?

503
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,220
- I submitted a consent form! - What consent form?

504
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,790
I never gave my permission! So who signed it?

505
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Baek Ja?

506
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,560
Well, you're looking pretty good.

507
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,130
Is something wrong?

508
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,060
Are you happy now you've dragged my daughter into this snake pit?

509
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,800
Are you happy to be back in that wretched world you came from?

510
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,299
A snake pit? I don't know what's going on, but...

511
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,670
It's not that you don't know. You just don't want to.

512
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,610
It's always been all about you, hasn't it?

513
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,810
You're the kind of person who never cared about family.

514
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,119
I've been letting this slide, but aren't you going too far?

515
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,360
Now you're acting like the Bong Chung Ja I know.

516
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,959
How have I gone too far?

517
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,199
From the day I debuted as a student to the moment I had my accident,

518
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,770
I never lived a single moment for myself.

519
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,899
I hid that we were family so it wouldn't affect your studies.

520
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,410
I was dragged to the police for Dad, and had my hair pulled by victims.

521
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,180
I don't know what...

522
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,850
I don't know what I've done that's so terrible in your eyes,

523
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,950
but after my accident and amnesia, I tried to come back out of guilt.

524
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,560
Do you have any idea how hard I struggled?

525
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,060
That was for the family, you say?

526
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,199
The money I made after my comeback,

527
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,030
I spent it all on you and Dad.

528
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,300
What more do you want from me?

529
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,340
Fine.

530
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,110
You think acting like a decent human for a bit changes who you are?

531
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,350
It must be convenient for you not to remember.

532
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,590
You don't remember what you did, how you left and cut us all off.

533
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,200
I cut you all off?

534
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,470
You should have stayed away for good.

535
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,600
What's the point of this darn blood tie?

536
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,310
Well, how am I supposed to know if you don't tell me?

537
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,980
You forgot it all, so you have peace.

538
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,910
No need to stir up old troubles.

539
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,720
I won't let my daughter ruin her life,

540
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,990
trying to become a celebrity like you.

541
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,560
So don't ever show your face to us. Not to Da Hee,

542
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,330
and not to me.

543
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,730
We don't need you.

544
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:38,390
You don't remember what you did, how you left and cut us all off.

545
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,140
Excuse me.

546
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,280
- You have another visitor. - A visitor?

547
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,430
You can't run away over this.

548
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,600
This is partly your fault, Aunt. So I'll be crashing here for a bit.

549
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,630
Have you seen the mess in this room? You still want to stay here?

550
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,400
It's better than home with my mom.

551
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,510
When you had me sign that, you should've said what it was for.

552
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,450
You wouldn't have signed it if I had.

553
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,480
My goodness, who do you get that from?

554
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,750
Mom always says I'm a spitting image of you.

555
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,560
I'm telling you, your mom will never back down.

556
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,270
Neither will I.

557
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,800
Then what's your plan?

558
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,440
I'm going to make it big and prove her wrong.

559
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,840
So you're not going home until that happens?

560
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,740
Please keep our relationship a secret from the agency.

561
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,310
How can you be sleeping right now?

562
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,890
Da Hee is with me,

563
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,160
so don't worry.

564
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,070
Hold on a second.

565
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,340
It's simple. This is my niece, Bong Da Hee.

566
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,309
And this is my aunt.

567
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,779
Okay, so aunt and niece. You're both with 2ONE Entertainment,

568
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,220
and you want me to keep it quiet. Is that about right?

569
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,819
Right? Gosh.

570
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,920
And how long do you think a secret like that will last?

571
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,260
Well, your detective secret is safe, isn't it?

572
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,330
Hey, that's... What?

573
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,230
Hey, you can't say that out loud!

574
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,370
Don't worry. You hide our secret, I'll hide yours.

575
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,570
Da Hee, get in the front. Let's roll!

576
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,450
All right.

577
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,119
Look, I didn't ask for this, but I'm your guardian for now,

578
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,919
so come home right after practice.

579
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,990
Home? It's a gosiwon.

580
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,500
Call me if you're going to be late.

581
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,699
Hey, answer me!

582
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,540
- Fine. - Go on.

583
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,070
You got this!

584
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,880
Don't say a word. I'm already completely overloaded.

585
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,780
You know, you two really look alike.

586
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,550
How so?

587
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,620
You've both got spunk.

588
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,260
What spunk?

589
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,660
Did he, or did he not, say that last time was the final time?

590
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,330
He did, sir.

591
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,899
He said it would be the last time after the election.

592
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,130
Gosh. It's always "the last time."

593
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,040
What about the girl I sent last time?

594
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,970
Well... He requested a new one.

595
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,410
That freeloader has no right to be so darn picky.

596
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,620
- Hello, sir. - This is our newest trainee.

597
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,920
- Is she 6th batch or 7th? - She's pretty.

598
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,160
- Let's see you blossom. - Yes, sir.

599
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,300
- I thought the last one was fine. - Hey.

600
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
Who was it?

601
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:48,040
- Her name's Riley? - Riley?

602
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,200
Yes.

603
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,580
Riley, are you ready? Come on down.

604
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,260
I'm so jealous. She's getting called up already.

605
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,600
Riley.

606
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,310
Hey. I want to make the debut team, just like you.

607
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,810
And?

608
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,880
I just met with the CEO, and he said I have potential.

609
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,250
- He really said that to you? - Can I go with you?

610
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,550
- Do you even know where I'm going? - It's somewhere good, right?

611
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,600
Hey, how did you get in here?

612
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,340
Oh, I'm with 2ONE Entertainment.

613
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,810
What's your name?

614
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,810
It's... Riley.

615
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,650
Riley?

616
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,780
Yes, that's her.

617
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,570
What are you talking about? She already came up.

618
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,080
Who are you?

619
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,410
Are you saying 25 years ago, you met the dead Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

620
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,250
He was wearing the same watch, so I just assumed it was him,

621
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,859
Oh, hey, I was just about to call you.

622
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,599
Reflect on yourself before you ask a favour.

623
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,339
Why do I have to work overtime?

624
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,739
It's just for today. See anything unusual?

625
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,740
Unusual?

626
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:12,910
As a matter of fact, there is.

627
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,310
What?

628
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,109
That bruiser, Kwaw Jung Do's right-hand man.

629
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,450
- The way he's moving is suspicious. - What about it?

630
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,920
Just a hunch.

631
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,190
Don't do anything stupid.

632
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,560
Hey. He's on the move.

633
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,160
Hey! Don't follow him, it's too dangerous.

634
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,860
What? Hey, I said don't go!

635
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,230
Come on!

636
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,630
Gosh. Where are you? I'll be there.

637
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,469
Don't get caught and just watch. Okay?

638
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,970
Don't make a move on your own.

639
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,339
This guy, I swear.

640
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,810
Say,

641
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:50,010
the sizes here are so limited. You don't carry sizes 77 or 88?

642
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,649
Gosh.

643
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,720
This one could work. What do you think of this?

644
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,180
Gosh.

645
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,150
If you try that on and it rips, you have to pay for it.

646
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,230
Something happened 25 years ago, didn't it?

647
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,630
What are you talking about?

648
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,969
The day of Se Ra's award ceremony. You didn't get in the car afterward.

649
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,000
Where were you?

650
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,810
That was decades ago.

651
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,140
Isn't it weird you remember that?

652
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,509
I have to close up.

653
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,150
- Leave. - That the accident was imminent.

654
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,220
You knew, didn't you?

655
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,759
What, are you saying I pushed Se Ra to her death?

656
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,960
Gosh. Why so defensive?

657
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,700
Don't tell me it was you.

658
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,730
The one leaving mean comments online, was that you?

659
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,140
The truth will come out when the evidence is revealed anyway.

660
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,740
What evidence?

661
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,510
Now that Se Ra has it, it's only a matter of time.

662
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,580
Lim Se Ra has the audio file?

663
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,520
Audio file?

664
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,190
I'm curious...

665
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,660
about what secrets it might be hiding.

666
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,880
An audio file?

667
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,549
I heard before your accident, you caused a big scene with someone.

668
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,580
The man with the watch.

669
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,620
Didn't you go after him because you heard that audio file?

670
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,850
I don't remember anything before or after, so I have no idea.

671
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,830
I'm sure the secret from 25 years ago is in that file.

672
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,860
If I did listen to it,

673
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,170
I wonder where it could be now.

674
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,880
My feelings for you have never changed.

675
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,280
And they never will.

676
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,190
(To be continued in Episode 5)

677
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,059
Turn it on.

678
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,829
Goodness, go to sleep. Do you know what time it is?

679
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,930
- Turn it on. Come on. - All right, fine.

680
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,800
("Jewellery Store Girl")

681
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,210
("Jewellery Store Girl")

682
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,360
Who is it?

683
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,589
Hello?

684
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,060
This is Riley. Do you remember me?

685
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,930
Oh, yes. What's this about?

686
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,170
A fellow trainee seems to be in danger,

687
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:04,210
and she needs help. You were the only one I thought of.

688
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,840
In danger? Who?

689
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,350
What? Da Hee?

690
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,220
Where did Da Hee go?

691
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,789
Gosh, why is traffic so bad? Unbelievable.

692
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,149
Faster! Come on.

693
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,419
- Okay. - We really have to get there fast.

694
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,090
I know. Just a second.

695
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,789
Hey, why are you cutting me off?

696
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,830
This traffic is already driving me crazy.

697
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,299
That's it. I'm getting out and running.

698
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,729
Are you crazy? Where are you going alone?

699
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,729
You keep trying to call the detective, okay?

700
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,969
Wait, it's dangerous!

701
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,470
No! What are you going to do by yourself?

702
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,210
This is insane. Please.

703
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,819
What is your business here?

704
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,250
I need to get inside right away. It's urgent.

705
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,350
This is a restricted area.

706
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,819
I'm Lim Se Ra. The actress, Lim Se Ra.

707
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,889
You don't recognise me?

708
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,459
Lim Se Ra, the actress with 2ONE Entertainment? Is that correct?

709
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,759
Yes, that's right. I was told to come here immediately.

710
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,829
They said to come to the top floor immediately.

711
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,200
Please wait a moment. I need to confirm with upstairs.

712
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,540
Oh my gosh, what's that? What's wrong with that person?

713
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,610
Hey! Stop her!

714
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,650
Get out.

715
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,990
Over here.

716
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,030
And who is this?

717
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,059
She lied about being from 2ONE to sneak in. We caught her.

718
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,370
I didn't lie.

719
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,340
I really am a trainee at 2ONE Entertainment.

720
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,010
The company doesn't know I'm here.

721
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,820
So you don't know where you are? What's your name?

722
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,980
You're a feisty one, aren't you?

723
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,910
Get over here.

724
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,180
Get over here!

725
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,850
Let go! I said, let go of me!

726
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:22,360
- Let me go! - Da Hee!

727
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,660
Da Hee, are you in there?

728
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,960
I'm in here!

729
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,830
Da Hee, are you okay?

730
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,740
Da Hee!

731
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,769
Be quiet!

732
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,970
The detective will be here soon. Okay?

733
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,140
- Just hang on a little longer. - Aunt!

734
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,880
Aunt!

735
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,550
- Clear out the room. - Da Hee!

736
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,670
Open the door.

737
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,440
Open the door!

738
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,860
Disable the security! Now!

739
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,430
Oh, no!

740
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:25,910
Da Hee?

741
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,150
Aunt!

742
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,419
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

743
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,750
- I'm okay. - You sure?

744
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,189
Come on, let's go.

745
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,289
We can take the elevator.

746
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,429
No, we don't have the key. Let's take the emergency exit.

747
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,490
Hurry.

748
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,870
Isn't it pathetic? All that work, just to end up here.

749
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,970
Such an amateur move.

750
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,709
It's over for you. The police are on their way,

751
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,239
and everyone will find out what you've done.

752
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,880
We already took care of the evidence.

753
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,650
So, should we take care of the witnesses now?

754
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,050
What are you talking about?

755
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,190
Who do you think gets here first? The cops? Or our clean-up crew?

756
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,220
- Go down! - No, I can't!

757
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,659
I can't go down alone.

758
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,329
Go, now! The police will be here soon.

759
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,430
Go and get them, hurry!

760
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
What?

761
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Dokgo!

762
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,329
You came by yourself?

763
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,540
Gosh, I told you not to go off by yourself.

764
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,840
I came with this guy.

765
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
I see.

766
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,350
- Ju Seung Pil. - Took your sweet time getting here?

767
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,020
How does it feel?

768
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:13,990
You searched the world for me, and I'm right under your nose.

769
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:19,229
Right. I'm just so overwhelmed. You ignored all our summonses.

770
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,400
Well, now, you folks are a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you?

771
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,299
The old case closed with no charges. It wasn't that I didn't go.

772
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,370
There was no need for me to go.

773
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,010
So, are you here to rack up some new charges?

774
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:35,080
Attempted murder and aggravated assault on an officer.

775
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,649
- Get him. - Yes, sir!

776
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,180
Hold on.

777
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:58,730
Yes!

778
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,140
We must verify the report. so please step aside.

779
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,539
We have no confirmation of that. You're not permitted to enter.

780
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:12,949
What do you mean it's not confirmed? Let them in, now!

781
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,350
There's a kid up there! Hurry!

782
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,120
Help me!

783
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:20,589
Oh, my! Da Hee!

784
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,990
Aunt...

785
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,919
Aunt is up there!

786
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,729
Oh my gosh, no! She's up there! Open the door now!

787
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,230
- Help! - Oh, no!

788
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,319
Go!

789
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,820
Dokgo, behind you! Watch out!

790
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,020
(Epilogue)

791
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:31,289
Oh no, my script! Oh, I'll be right back.

792
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,629
You should've paid attention.

793
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:35,430
You've got me all flustered. I'll be right back.

794
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,999
- Okay. - Goodness, I'm so...

795
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,530
Take your time.

796
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,140
People get like that when they get older.

797
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,210
Mister, are you really a detective?

798
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,410
Why would a detective also be a manager?

799
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,589
It's complicated grown-up business.

800
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:02,120
I see. You like my aunt, don't you?

801
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,160
What? Me?

802
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,200
Me, like your aunt? No, absolutely not.

803
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,930
It's strictly professional, you know?

804
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,300
So you go through that for her for no reason?

805
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,040
What is she to you?

806
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,080
You've got quite a mouth on you for a kid.

807
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,910
How am I supposed to explain this?

808
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,550
Okay, this is top secret. Got it?

809
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,950
For real.

810
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,360
- The truth is, - Yes?

811
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,160
I used to be a big fan of your aunt's.

812
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:45,499
You don't know what a big star she was, right?

813
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,470
That was ages ago. It was before I was even born.

814
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,470
Was it? You're really young.

815
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,279
Anyway, you might not know because it was before your time,

816
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,950
but back then, you couldn't turn on TV without seeing a Lim Se Ra ad.

817
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:02,450
Makeup, phones, soft drinks, cars... Her face was on almost everything.

818
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,979
And don't even get me started on her shows.

819
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,689
In the violent crimes unit, an office crawling with tough cops,

820
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,490
the second Lim Se Ra came on TV,

821
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:12,230
everyone from the cops to the perps went dead silent.

822
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,500
I'm serious. Back then, when her show was on,

823
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:22,100
the streets were completely empty. It was "Se Ra Time." So all went in.

824
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:26,709
Man, the whole world went crazy just to glimpse Lim Se Ra.

825
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:27,710
For real.

826
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,010
Think I could be like her someday?

827
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,720
- Want my honest opinion? - Yes.

828
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:39,950
I'd say...

829
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,690
the two of you are the same.

830
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,790
She's here.

831
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,329
Sorry. I'm late. We have to go. Now.

832
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,030
- Okay, let's roll. - Let's go.

833
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,750
(My Troublesome Star)

834
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,690
She's been badly injured. She's on her way to the hospital.

835
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,890
If we really go for 2ONE, something's bound to come up, right?

836
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,830
Of course. Hey, wait.

837
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,400
What's that?

838
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,070
We won't let you fight this alone, not like before.

839
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,640
Are they determined to ruin me? Darn it!

840
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,140
Because my eyes are finally wide open.

841
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:08,810
Is this the best you can do? You just wait.

842
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,680
I found out...

843
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,750
what you've done.
