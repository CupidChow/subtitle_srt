We must verify the report. so please step aside.

We have no confirmation of that. You're not permitted to enter.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,029
What do you mean it isn't confirmed? You haven't even checked!

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,659
There's a kid up there! Hurry!

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,060
Help me!

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,300
Oh, my! Da Hee!

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,869
Aunt...

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,969
Aunt is up there!

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,609
Oh my gosh, no! She's up there! Open the door now!

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,110
- Help! - Oh, no!

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,910
Finally coming to your senses?

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,350
Gosh. This is humiliating. So much for police dignity.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,620
While you were busy watching us,

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,750
it's not like our eyes were just for show.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,490
But still, you'd do this to a cop?

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,490
Well... It does make me a little curious.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,900
I wonder how far you cops are willing to go.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,900
What on earth are you talking about, you punk?

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
What?

32
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,619
Dokgo! You came by yourself?

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,760
Gosh, I told you not to go off by yourself.

34
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,160
I came with this guy.

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
I see.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,600
- Ju Seung Pil. - Took your sweet time getting here?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,340
How does it feel?

38
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,380
You searched the world for me, and I'm right under your nose.

39
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,449
Right. I'm just so overwhelmed. You ignored all our summonses.

40
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,650
Well, now, you folks are a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you?

41
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,559
The old case closed with no charges. It wasn't that I didn't go.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,590
There was no need for me to go.

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,390
So, are you here to rack up some new charges?

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,330
Attempted murder and aggravated assault on an officer.

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,129
I guess we're done with all this.

46
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,170
Because you'll be under arrest.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,469
I regret only sending you to the Traffic Department.

48
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,710
I should've sent you to the underworld.

49
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,079
- Get him. - Yes, sir!

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,450
Hold on.

51
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,530
Yes!

52
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,579
Go!

53
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,980
Dokgo, behind you! Watch out!

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,140
It's no fun if you chicken out this early.

55
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
Right?

56
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,670
What happens when a cop loses his gun?

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,080
Why would a traffic cop bring a gun?

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,650
What are you two doing?

59
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Aren't you scared?

60
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,790
Gosh! What?

61
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,030
Goodness.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,069
Darn it!

63
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,270
The first round's a blank. You didn't know that, did you?

64
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,140
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,610
Look, my friends are here. Time to go.

66
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,910
Stop them, you punks!

67
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,210
Come here.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Ju Seung Pil!

69
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,750
You punk!

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,990
Hurry!

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,970
Are you okay? I don't see any major injuries,

72
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,809
but I think you should get a full workup.

73
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,579
Gosh, I told you not to go off alone.

74
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,949
We were about to lose him. What else was I supposed to do?

75
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,920
You almost got yourself killed!

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,679
Besides, do you even know how to shoot a gun?

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,589
No, I was just counting on you. I think I'm okay.

78
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,459
- Are you okay? - What do you mean you're okay?

79
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,490
Go to the hospital and get checked out from head to toe.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,229
- My arm feels weird. - Hurry.

81
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,330
Get a gurney over here.

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,300
You hurt your arm.

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,199
(Bong Se Ra)

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,630
(Detective, please come! Da Hee is in danger!)

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,569
Se Ra's been badly injured.

86
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,770
She's on her way to the hospital.

87
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,420
(Episode 11)

88
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,520
Occipital bleeding. Patient is unconscious.

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,859
BP is dropping fast, from 90 to 50.

90
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,730
Get two units of RBCs to the ER stat!

91
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,330
Report on the FAST scan immediately!

92
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,440
- Mom. - What happened?

93
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,439
Not again! How? How did this happen again?

94
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,479
Why?

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,479
She's in surgery right now. She's going to be okay.

96
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,049
Don't worry. She pulled through last time, right?

97
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,050
Let's just wait and see.

98
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,350
- Mom! - Here, have a seat.

99
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm going to lose my mind.

100
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,740
Director! What should we do?

101
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,949
- Lim Se Ra still isn't here. - This is ridiculous.

102
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,510
We're supposed to start shooting any minute!

103
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,190
Her manager isn't picking up either. I hope nothing bad happened.

104
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,130
Hey, why won't you answer the phone? Where's Lim Se Ra?

105
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,230
The shoot stopped, and it's chaos. The hospital?

106
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,230
Keep your voice down! Aren't you supposed to be on set?

107
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,630
Why? Why is she at the hospital?

108
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,900
She's in surgery right now. She's badly hurt.

109
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,940
- What? How? - I'll explain later.

110
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,179
Well, we have to tell the director, don't we?

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,210
Don't be ridiculous! You know what she did for this role?

112
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,719
Her manager will handle it. For now, you're not to say a word.

113
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,780
Got it?

114
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,720
But her manager's out of touch. How is he supposed to handle this?

115
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,359
- Hui Yeong. - Yes?

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,900
The shoot might get cancelled today.

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,199
- What? - Lim Se Ra...

118
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,899
I mean, Bong Chung Ja isn't here.

119
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,239
For real? Is she totally out of contact?

120
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,740
I looked into it, and it seems the CEO is also in the dark.

121
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,980
Mr. Manager!

122
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,580
- She's in surgery right now. - What happened?

123
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,989
I don't know the exact details, but I went up the building,

124
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,090
and I found her collapsed on the floor. What am I going to do?

125
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,960
It's all my fault.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,200
- What? - No, what are you talking about?

127
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,480
It's not your fault.

128
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,780
It's all my fault.

129
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,760
I should have caught those punks a long time ago.

130
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,060
But I failed.

131
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,930
They weren't punks.

132
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,470
It was a woman.

133
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,310
I don't know who it was.

134
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,250
I followed Riley up to the top floor.

135
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,779
They tried pulling me into what seemed...

136
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,810
like a secret room and lock me in.

137
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,890
They seemed more terrifying than the police.

138
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Hey.

139
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,770
What are you doing here?

140
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,140
Should I stay still after all that, then?

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,540
I told you to rest, old man.

142
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,480
I've checked everywhere. All the security cameras are fake.

143
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,150
They cleaned this place spotless.

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,189
Who knows what those punks did?

145
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,020
While getting our patient to the hospital,

146
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,590
they wiped all the evidence clean.

147
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,759
The entry must've had cameras.

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,929
What a surprise. It was down today. They said it recorded nothing.

149
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,559
It seems they cut the elevator camera,

150
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,470
only when someone came to the penthouse floor.

151
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,779
Look at all this blood. She must have tumbled from here.

152
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,220
After losing this much blood, you think the victim can survive?

153
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,130
Oh, right, 2ONE Entertainment rented the penthouse.

154
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,339
- Yes? - Hey. you punk!

155
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,799
Why have you been so hard to reach?

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
Where's Lim Se Ra right now?

157
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,810
Hello?

158
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,550
Did the call drop?

159
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,019
Don't tell me he just hung up on me. That punk.

160
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,189
He's got a death wish. Darn it.

161
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,589
- Sir. - What?

162
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,890
- You should take a look at this. - What is it?

163
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,660
It's a rumour that just popped up on social media.

164
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,530
- Find the hospital Lim Se Ra is in. - Right away.

165
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm going to lose my mind. Darn it.

166
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,740
(Operation Room)

167
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,270
Doctor!

168
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,080
How did it go? Is she going to live?

169
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,979
- The surgery went well. - Thank you so much.

170
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,220
Now, it's all up to her will to live.

171
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,489
Pardon? What do you mean by that?

172
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,390
We'll have to wait for her to regain consciousness.

173
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Gosh.

174
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,660
Gosh, Baek Ja!

175
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,000
Goodness.

176
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,220
Se Ra.

177
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,590
Se Ra. Wake up.

178
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,310
Yu Ran.

179
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,880
Come on. Wake up.

180
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,420
We have somewhere to go.

181
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,920
What's going on?

182
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,890
And what's with these clothes?

183
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,490
Come on. Follow me.

184
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,820
But that's me.

185
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,460
What's going on here?

186
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
Come on, Se Ra.

187
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,730
(Director Choi Young Guk Returns, Looking For the 2nd Lim Se Ra)

188
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,540
For 20 years,

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,380
I've changed so much.

190
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Dad!

191
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm hungry.

192
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,359
- Wait a second. - I'm hungry.

193
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,159
- Wait, Dad. - I'm so hungry!

194
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,060
Hold on, Dad!

195
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,910
The spoon.

196
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,650
I should have at least warmed up some soup for you.

197
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,590
- Dad. - Yes?

198
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,300
- Am I pretty? - Yes.

199
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,330
Se Ra, you're pretty.

200
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,370
Really?

201
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,140
Am I still pretty?

202
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,640
You're pretty.

203
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,250
You're the best!

204
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,680
The prettiest!

205
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm going to do it again.

206
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,589
I'm going to make a comeback.

207
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,860
Dad. I can do it again.

208
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,100
I'm going to do it again. I swear I will.

209
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,470
You're so lucky to have a dad like that.

210
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,240
He may have...

211
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,080
caused a lot of trouble,

212
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,350
but he absolutely adored me.

213
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,090
What about you?

214
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,070
Yu Ran.

215
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,770
Dad. Director Choi Young Guk is coming here today.

216
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm sure he'll be thrilled to see me.

217
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,470
You cold?

218
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,509
Stay warm. Got it?

219
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,510
Yes.

220
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,750
I know I can make a comeback.

221
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,990
I will ask him for another chance. Got it, Dad?

222
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,520
You have to wait for me.

223
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,229
Director! Dad.

224
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,299
Stay right here, Dad. Don't go anywhere.

225
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,930
Don't move.

226
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,470
Director!

227
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,110
Aren't you going to try and remember?

228
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,309
Let go! There are memories I don't want.

229
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,809
Let go, I said! Let go!

230
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,950
Se Ra.

231
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,390
Director.

232
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,790
Director.

233
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,059
Aren't you freezing?

234
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
It's so cold today.

235
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:12,599
- Why meet in this awful cold? - Should we get in?

236
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,930
Let's go.

237
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,500
Director!

238
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,440
No!

239
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
Taxi!

240
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,780
No! No, don't get in!

241
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,620
Don't get in!

242
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,619
Follow that black car ahead, please. Hurry.

243
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,820
I don't think we should be chasing that car right now.

244
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,379
Go find another cab. There's no way I'm taking you.

245
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,840
Se Ra.

246
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,550
No!

247
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,150
No! Don't go!

248
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,890
No! Don't go!

249
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,800
Dad!

250
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,439
Dad! No!

251
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,640
No, Dad!

252
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,650
Dad!

253
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,520
Dad!

254
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,719
I remember everything! I remember it all!

255
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
I remember everything I did!

256
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,730
Do you regret it?

257
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,140
I...

258
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,840
I abandoned them with my own hands.

259
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,309
I abandoned them with my own hands. I'm the one who ruined my family.

260
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,310
Yu Ran! I...

261
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,620
It's not over yet.

262
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,120
I...

263
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,090
Aren't I dead?

264
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
You have to...

265
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,890
go back and make it right.

266
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Can I...

267
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,970
really go back?

268
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,100
Yes.

269
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,350
Yu Ran. But what's with the outfit?

270
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,180
Did you get a job?

271
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,290
It looks great on me, doesn't it?

272
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,130
That's wonderful, Yu Ran. I'm so happy for you.

273
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,060
See? I told you.

274
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,100
If you never give up, you can do anything.

275
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,070
So don't you give up either.

276
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,110
- What are you talking about? - You can do it.

277
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,450
Promise me.

278
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,250
What's wrong? You sound like you're not coming back.

279
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,740
Hey. Are you with us?

280
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,010
Se Ra.

281
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Yu Ran.

282
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,480
Se Ra.

283
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,819
What are you saying? Who's Yu Ran?

284
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Yu Ran.

285
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,920
Se Ra, you've been out for three days.

286
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,459
Do you know how worried I was you wouldn't wake up?

287
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,190
Da Hee. It's your aunt.

288
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Da Hee.

289
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

290
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,170
Are you crazy?

291
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,500
What were you thinking, going alone? What if something had happened?

292
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,540
Good grief. You find this funny?

293
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,650
- Why? - Why?

294
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:58,950
Is my face okay?

295
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,850
Am I badly hurt?

296
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,519
Quick, give me a mirror.

297
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,790
You're worried about your face now? You're driving me crazy.

298
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,860
Here you go.

299
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm totally fine. I'm not hurt, right?

300
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,470
I wondered how bad I was hurt this time.

301
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,970
I was really worried.

302
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,910
Are you thinking about going back to the set?

303
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,610
You said I was out for three days, right?

304
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,119
The set must be a total mess. What am I going to do?

305
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,159
Just stay in bed. Why are you even worried about that?

306
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,890
Don't worry. The manager's on it.

307
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,130
Are you all right?

308
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,800
Are you sure you're okay? How many days has it been?

309
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,700
Please, focus on resting. Don't worry about anything else.

310
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,739
What would you like to drink? There's a...

311
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,770
Who are you?

312
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,210
Se Ra!

313
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,990
Don't tell me...

314
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,960
you don't remember again.

315
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,160
Could it be...

316
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,329
How could I forget you, Detective?

317
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,669
Good grief, I swear.

318
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,039
She must be out of her mind! I was so surprised!

319
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,769
I was so shocked!

320
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,169
What is going on?

321
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,940
You have no idea how shocked I was.

322
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,509
I was so shocked. You must have been too, right?

323
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,580
I...

324
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,790
I've gotten all my memories back.

325
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,060
I thought the world had abandoned me.

326
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,670
And that my family had abandoned me, now that I was useless.

327
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,810
That's what I made myself believe.

328
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,310
Slowly.

329
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,760
Oh no. Are you okay?

330
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,560
Oh, no, your knees. I'll fetch you some water.

331
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,630
I couldn't find the courage to go back.

332
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
No.

333
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,770
To be honest, I was terrified.

334
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,910
Oh, my goodness.

335
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,560
Why?

336
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Because if even the only family I had left...

337
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,900
wouldn't take me back,

338
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,840
I'd have nowhere left to turn.

339
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,019
Seriously? Of all the jobs, you chose a school cafeteria?

340
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,720
Kitchen work is hard, I know, but serving the food is appealing.

341
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,719
- Sounds like a total bore. - Well,

342
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,890
when the kids are all lined up in front of me with their trays,

343
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,789
it's as if they're all lined up...

344
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,530
for my autograph or something.

345
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,400
Still craving the spotlight?

346
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,630
- And there's something else. - What else?

347
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,740
There's someone I want to see, too.

348
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,340
What's this?

349
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,580
(Ju Seung Pil)

350
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,850
It's a USB drive.

351
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,610
(Ju Seung Pil)

352
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,040
Two, six, six, eight.

353
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,810
Two, six, six, eight.

354
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,090
Two, six, six, eight.

355
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,600
It's all your fault my life is ruined like this!

356
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,129
I know everything. The car accident 25 years ago!

357
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,640
I know you were the one behind it all!

358
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,799
So?

359
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,010
"So?" Is that all you have to say?

360
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,080
You destroyed my life,

361
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,880
and all you can say is, "So?"

362
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,310
What do you want me to do?

363
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,050
That was 25 years ago. Even if you go to the police,

364
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,280
the statute of limitations ran out a long time ago.

365
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,520
But my life is still slowly falling apart.

366
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,230
What do you mean? The statute of limitations is up?

367
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,490
- Go ahead, call the police! - Yes, sir.

368
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,299
Take responsibility. I said take responsibility!

369
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,500
Take responsibility!

370
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,870
Take responsibility!

371
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,020
Fine. If you insist, I have no choice.

372
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,860
The police may not care, but I bet the media will.

373
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,790
What a leading candidate for mayor did in his sordid past...

374
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,460
I'll lay it all bare.

375
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Just you wait. Just like you ruined my life,

376
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,010
I'm going to ruin your life in the exact same way!

377
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,010
I'll take care of this quietly.

378
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,920
Why should we get our hands dirty?

379
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,050
Get in touch with President Ju.

380
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,560
But tell him I won't tolerate any mistakes like last time.

381
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,600
He'll get the message.

382
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,530
I know that must've been difficult to say. Thank you.

383
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,240
I left a scar on my family that will never heal.

384

They say if you stay in the dark for too long,

385
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,050
you can get trapped and lose sight of the way forward.

386
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,990
But now you're out of the darkness, you can start putting things right.

387
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,820
Do you think I can do it?

388
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,030
Of course. You've already succeeded beautifully.

389

390
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Hey.

391
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,570
About the culprit you saw on the stairs back then...

392
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,510
Can you remember her?

393
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,220
I only got a brief glimpse. I was saving Da Hee and fighting.

394
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,820
- I wasn't in my right mind. - Was it this woman?

395
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,930
Yes. That's her.

396
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,000
That's right.

397
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,370
This woman. The culprit you remember...

398
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,440
is Assemblyman Min Guk Hee's aide.

399
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,370
What are you waiting for? Let's go arrest her now!

400
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,140
Not yet. It'll be like last time without proof.

401
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,179
What do you mean, no evidence? I'm the victim. I was there.

402
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,850
You know as well as I do.

403
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,220
They'd use your psych records to discredit you and walk free.

404
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,690
- We need more conclusive evidence. - So what are we supposed to do?

405
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,259
How can I possibly go up against a candidate for mayor of Seoul?

406
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,100
If we catch Ju Seung Pil first,

407
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,200
we'll be able to prove that Min Guk Hee was behind it.

408
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,070
- What is it? - I've found Ju Seung Pil.

409
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,210
You did?

410
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,410
Where are you now? Send me your location.

411
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,120
But Ju Seung Pil is dead.

412
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,670
What happened?

413
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,880
His body was found in a car with a lit charcoal briquette.

414
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,720
- From the looks of it, suicide. - The looks of it?

415
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,120
More like it was staged to look like a suicide.

416
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,270
Where's the assemblyman? Why did they only send you?

417
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,140
The assemblyman is too important to deal with a punk like you.

418
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,750
I paved the way for him and put him in position to clean up your messes.

419
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,020
So why are you messing up now? You looking for a fight?

420
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,990
That's exactly why I'm here.

421
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,360
To clean up the mess.

422
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,609

423
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,110
Let me know the second you find anything, got it?

424
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,710
On the chance it was a clean job, you think they'd find anything?

425
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,920
They took everything, including his phone and all his belongings.

426
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,350
Don't you think we'll find something if we dig into 2ONE Entertainment?

427
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,020
We better. If not, we'll keep on digging.

that woman just has a real talent for staying alive.

463

464
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,370

00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,820
I have to be helpful in any way I can, right?

537
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,750
Look at Mr. Passionate Manager.

538
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,730
It's so touching I could cry. Now get out.

539
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,159
As of June 3, 2025,

540
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,729
we have a search and seizure warrant for 2ONE Entertainment.

541
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,260
- All right, everyone out. - Staff, clear the way!

542
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,029
Any interference is obstruction of justice.

543
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,800
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

544
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,740
Hey! What are the prosecutors doing here?

545
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,240
We're not sure what's happening.

546
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,609
So you just let them walk right in?

547
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,239
They had a warrant. We couldn't stop them.

548
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,580
Darn it! You punk!

549
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,329
A businessman, Ju Seung Pil, who was wanted by the police,

550
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,240
has been found dead in a car parked near a reservoir in Yeonsu City.

551
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,739
Ju was wanted for solicitation of murder and aggravated assault,

552
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,010
and linked to the recent scandal of an agency offering sexual favours.

553
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,650
Get some rest.

554
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:45,450
What happened? Did Ju Seung Pil kill himself?

555
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,459
It's under investigation. And we're raiding 2ONE Entertainment,

556
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,590
- so we should find evidence soon. - And what if you don't?

557
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,800
If you don't, I'll end up like him. In fact,

558
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
they already tried to do that to me, didn't they?

559
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,499
- They just failed, right? - First, just calm down.

560
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,340
Calm down? Da Hee almost got hurt.

561
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,009
If anything happens to Da Hee, I don't think I can go on.

562
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,850
Chung Ja.

563
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,410
I'll protect you.

564
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,820
I'll keep you and your family safe. I swear I will protect all of you.

565
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,400
I won't let you fight this alone like you had to before.

566
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,530
All right?

567
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,410
I'll get going now. Try to get some rest.

568
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,810
I trust you.

569
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,990
Even when you had no real power,

570
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,790
back when you were just a junior detective,

571
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,130
you still protected me.

572
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,100
Zero, seven, two, eight.

573
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
Wait.

574
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,430
You knew about that?

575
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,680
My sister told me.

576
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,750
That you came to see me when I was in the hospital after my accident.

577
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
And...

578
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,660
my dad and my sister...

579
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,600
That you secretly looked out for them, too.

580
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,140
You can't leave without seeing your daughter first, can you?

581
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,630
I'm here to keep a promise.

582
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,070
If there's one thing I do, it's keep my promises.

583
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,010
A promise?

584
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,479
Se Ra! You have to wake up.

585
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,779
The promise we made to see each other again.

586
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,550
You have to keep it! I'll be waiting for you!

587
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,490
Take this.

588
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:18,430
(To: 0728, It was nice meeting you. See you again.)

589
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,310
So don't you worry.

590
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,240
I'll be sure to keep the promise I made today, too.

591
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,440
Are these all the ad offers we got?

592
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,370
Our channel's reputation in the industry is terrible.

593
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,080
We keep losing subscribers, too.

594
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,680
I think the big blow was losing Hui Yeong.

595
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,879
All because of the rumour we're incompetent.

596
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,190
That's just media play from Go Hui Yeong's camp.

597
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,290
We should put out a rebuttal article,

598
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,120
and work the comment sections on YouTube and the news articles.

599
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,930
Wouldn't it be faster to just ask Go Hui Yeong for help?

600
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,000
What help?

601
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,100
Ask her what? How?

602
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,270
Gosh.

603
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,910
What happened?

604
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,710
It's nothing serious. I'm fine now.

605
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,880
You don't look fine at all.

606
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,890
I'm not going to skip out on rent, so don't you worry.

607
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,530
Hey. That's not why I'm asking.

608
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,460
I'm your fan. Stop misreading my concern.

609
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,740
Yu Ran.

610
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,540
Yu Ran.

611
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,050
Yu Ran, I'm sorry.

612
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,390
No, that can't be. No way!

613
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,060
We just had lunch together today. I mean...

614
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,090
We promised...

615
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:36,029
We promised to practice together. Yu Ran!

616
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,430
No, Yu Ran!

617
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,070
Yu Ran! No!

618
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,240
- You... - Are you trying to hit me?

619
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,110
Isn't it funny?

620
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,690
Seriously, why are you drinking milk like that?

621
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,720
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

622
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,520
Then shouldn't you avoid drinking it?

623
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,660
No, I'm training my body to get used to it rather than giving up.

624
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,630
What are you talking about?

625
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,229
The urge hit me during the last exam,

626
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,970
and my stomach was killing me.

627
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,340
So I drink it to build tolerance.

628
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,410
Why?

629
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,409
Does that even make sense? You should just stop drinking milk.

630
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,450
I'm trying, okay?

631
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,890
I'm sorry, Yu Ran.

632
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,260
I shouldn't have forgotten you too.

633
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,130
I'm sorry, Yu Ran.

634
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,570
Yu Ran.

635
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,839
- Doing it like this? - I can do it like this.

636
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,710
- You know? Stuff like this. - Stuff like that?

637
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,180
You're the only one I've really opened up to.

638
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,720
And you're the only one who even talks to me like this.

639
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,100
Put this on your eyes when you sleep.

640
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,470
It'll help with the swelling.

641
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,870
Thanks.

642
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,710
I seriously thought that you were crazy.

643
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
I'm sorry.

644
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,550
No, it's okay. I can see why you'd think that.

645
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,690
And for a moment there,

646
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,700
I think I wanted to go crazy, too.

647
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,030
Hey, a room just opened up at the place I'm staying.

648
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,800
(Jumbo Gosiwon)

649
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,230
Why don't you come live there?

650
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,670
From that moment on, Yu Ran...

651
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,580
was my only family and my only friend.

652
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,580
Only after she was gone did I realise.

653
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:47,920
I'd always thought my family had abandoned me.

654
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,060
It wasn't like that.

655
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,700
I was the one who abandoned them. I was...

656
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,700
I inflicted a wound that will never heal.

657
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,410
To my family.

658
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,120
(Coupon)

659
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,080
What? You're going to the shoot?

660
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,579
You just got out of the hospital!

661
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,749
Absolutely not. Get back inside.

662
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,250
Hey. Look at me.

663
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,020
I'm perfectly fine. Right?

664
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,020
What was it you said to me before? That at your age overdoing it kills.

665
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,690
If I were to just disappear like this,

666
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,660
the crew and the public too will lose all faith in Lim Se Ra.

667
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,900
She'll lose any chance of making a comeback.

668
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,170
I can't let history repeat itself.

669
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,210
Let's go.

670
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,450
Are you sure you'll be okay?

671
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,730
No contouring to slim my face down. Make me look vibrant,

672
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,689
like someone who isn't sick at all. Go heavy on the blush.

673
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,800
- Pack it on! - Got it.

674
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,400
I'll do that.

675
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,000
But today's scene looks pretty intense.

676
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,610
- That's why I'm even more excited. - About what?

677
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,180
Because my eyes are finally wide open.

678
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,120
I'm off.

679
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,390
All right, here's Ms. Bong Chung Ja!

680
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:40,830
Welcome!

681
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,669
Congratulations. Good to see you.

682
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:47,840
Thank you.

683
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,410
But it's not even my birthday.

684
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:08,620
A gift for delaying the shoot and messing up our schedule.

685
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,260
She's out of her mind. Seriously!

686
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,710
Oh, dear, what am I to do? You passed while I was stretching.

687
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,409
- You did that on purpose, right? - If that was on purpose,

688
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,940
was the cake on purpose too?

689
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,910
Goodness. Are you okay?

690
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,750
Seriously.

691
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,590
Thanks.

692
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,099
Se Ra, that article must've been Go Hui Yeong's doing.

693
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,330
Don't you think she leaked it on purpose?

694
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,629
It doesn't matter.

695
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,840
What do you mean it doesn't matter? You should go drag her by the hair.

696
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,740
That's an amateur move.

697
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,470
Amateur?

698
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,220
All right. Action!

699
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,800
Is this why you came back?

700
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,870
It's all in the past, anyway.

701
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,600
What's the point of digging it all up again?

702
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,600
In the past?

703
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
Sure.

704
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,050
For you, I'm sure it's all in the past.

705
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,120
But for me, it's far from over.

706
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:48,120
So what? You're here for revenge?

707
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:49,990
Why?

708
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,290
You think I can't?

709
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:53,960
Don't tell me...

710
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:59,130
- that's why you came all this way. - What if it is?

711
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,940
Wait. For real?

712
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,639
- She actually hit her. - That was a real slap.

713
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,609
- That was crazy. - For real? She hit her hard.

714
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,440
- That was not how we practised. - I know, right?

715
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:22,620
Is that all you've got?

716
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,430
Is this right?

717
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,000
What do you think you're doing?

718
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,440
What's this?

719
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,280
Just you wait.

720
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,720
I know exactly what you did.

721
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,640
(Epilogue)

722
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,479
What is all this?

723
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,580
You need to get your strength back. Then you'll get better quickly.

724
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,790
Finish every last bite.

725
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,490
Okay.

726
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:43,300
You're going through so much, taking care of me and all that.

727
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,540
Just like you have before.

728
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,880
Your manager is the one who went through the most.

729
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:54,250
- He did back then, too. - My manager?

730
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,919
He didn't even go home until you woke up...

731
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,690
and stayed here at the hospital to look after you.

732
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,590
Thanks to him, I didn't have to close up the shop during the day...

733
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,160
and could still take care of Da Hee.

734
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,490
He's that detective from all those years ago, isn't he?

735
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes.

736
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,240
I only found out recently myself.

737
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,910
I guess it was meant to be. Don't you think?

738
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,780
I mean, that you two met again after all these decades...

739
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,280
Okay, be honest. What's going on between you two?

740
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,650
What do you mean, "What's going on?"

741
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,720
Why? Is he your biggest fan or something?

742
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,829
What is it?

743
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,659
So there's something between you two. Tell me.

744
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,860
What is it?

745
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,640
He's just...

746
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,180
my sun.

747
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,010
Your son?

748
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,780
You have a son with him?

749
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,850
No, the sun!

750
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,100
He shines a light on me. Brightly.

751
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,730
When he's by my side,

752
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,240
he makes me sparkle and shine.

753
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,480
(My Troublesome Star)

754
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,950
I found who sent the audio file to you.

755
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,480
You sent this, didn't you?

756
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,420
Bury him. Make sure he never talks again.

757
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:23,260
I'll kill you again. I'll crush you like 25 years ago.

758
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,760
I am here to confess a secret I have hidden for 25 years.

759
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,670
So you did have something to hide.

760
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:37,570
You can stay in your nightmare. I'm going to soar once again.
