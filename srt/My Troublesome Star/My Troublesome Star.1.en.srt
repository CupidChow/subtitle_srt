Ms. Im...

360
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,420
I'm sorry, but...

361
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,950
Well...

362
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,050
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,390
Okay.

364
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,890
I'm a person, too.

365
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
You think I'm a joke, too. Don't you, ahjussi?

366
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,590
Pardon?

367
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,630
I'm not an ahjussi.

368
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,380
I met someone terrible today.

369
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,750
Was he worse than me?

370
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,600
Yes.

371
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,410
A lot worse.

372
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,200
There was actually a film
I really wanted to be in.

373
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes. I saw it on TV.

374
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,010
It's Choi Yeong Guk's film, right?

375
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,020
I lost the part today.

376
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,100
I mean,

377
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,200
I gave up on it.

378
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,870
What's so great about me, anyway...

379
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,130
With my own hands,

380
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,150
I flipped a table with a huge spread.

381
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,700
Isn't that pathetic?

382
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,110
No.

383
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,130
A feast that makes you sick afterward...

384
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,360
What's the point of stuffing yourself?

385
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,220
No matter what anyone says,

386
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,740
a simple meal that's easy to digest is the best.

387
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,800
Don't you agree?

388
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,820
Ms. Im,

389
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,130
I'm so sorry. I-

390
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,510
No.

391
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,910
Thank you.

392
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,290
Pardon?

393
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,940
For listening to me.

394
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,940
No, I just rambled on.

395
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,620
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,620
Where should I meet you?

397
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,890
Pardon?

398
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,760
Where?

399
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,520
For the investigation.

400
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,740

You came.

413
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,940
I'm here for the investigation.

414
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,060
What a pretty voice.

415
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,730
I'll take you to the questioning room.

417
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,830
Is this the questioning room?

418
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,210
Since you aren't just an ordinary
person, I prepared this

419
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,490
to provide a special treatment.

420
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,290

She's radiant.

I'm taking that cup.

424
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,070
Don't wash that cup.

425
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,170
This actually isn't the first time my dad did this.

426
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,000
- Be quiet. Be quiet.
- Se Ra.

427
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,520
He started businesses using my seal
and lost money a few times.

428
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,570
Illegal gambling and real estate scams.

429
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,920
It's impossible to count if you
include the ones without records.

430
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,060
I can't seem to reach your father.

431
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,440
Do you know where he is?

432
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,450
I wouldn't have come if I had known.

433
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,150
Yes, right.

434
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,410
Do me a favor.

435
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,830
Please find my dad.

436
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,150
And please put him away behind bars.

437
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,290
Okay.

438
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,510
- Pardon?
- W-What did she say?

439
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,150
Put him away?

440
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,540
- Put him away?
- Her dad? Behind bars?

441
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,850
Put a heart. Aigoo...

442
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,170
Thank you. Yes, yes.

444
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,050
You can use my back.

445
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,790
I think you should leave now.

446
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,510
- That's the last one.
- Thank you!

Look at this autograph.

453
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,920
Yes, sir. We just left.

454
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,310
Okay.

455
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,950
Noona, why did you come all the way here?

456
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,050
Why else? Because they called me in.

457
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,990
Well, you don't just show up
because you were called in.

458
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,870
Do you think so lightly of our law enforcement?

459
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,600
You scare me more, Noona.

460
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,350
Geez.

461
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,020
She went because they've been
harassing her like a stalker.

462
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,190
Who? Which bastard?

463
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,340
How dare they harass Se Ra-

464
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,080

Thanks to everyone's trust, love, and support,

I was finally able to be on this stage.

479
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,960
I lack in so many ways,

480
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,880
but I never thought I'd be acknowledged

481
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,110
purely for my acting.

482
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,730
Give me a break.

483
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,970
I've been through so many hardships and mishaps,

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,670

While returning home after the award ceremony,

510

the top star Ms. Im Se Ra's vehicle
collided with a 5-ton

511

- dump truck.
- Thank you.

Come again.

513
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,710
Due to this accident, Ms. Im's
vehicle was turned over

514
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,100
and she was sent to the hospital unconscious.

The entire country is hoping

516
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,760
she regains consciousness.

517
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,630
But Director Choi's filming
schedule was disrupted

518
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,800
and he's reportedly looking for another actor.

Right. The car accident.

Is this a hospital, then?

728
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,120
Yes.

[Last night at the accident at Obong intersection]
I mean, I was so tired that...

730
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,090
I dozed off. I turned the steering
wheel while braking.

731
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,810
Gosh, I didn't know there was someone there.

732
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,320
Did you drink, sir?

733
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,480
No.

734
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,330
I did the alcohol test. He didn't drink.

735
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,610
He fell asleep behind the wheel.

736
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,810
Where's the victim?

737
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,050
Don't you know me?

738
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,040
Geez, why... Who are you?

739
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,080
Im Se Ra.

740
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,650
Wow. She seemed mentally unstable.

741
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,760
The thing is...

742
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,400
She had memory loss.

743
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,300
Memory loss?

744
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,220
Isn't it a shame?

745
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,720
But it seemed more like she
was fabricating her memory.

746
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,830
Pardon?

747
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,180
She kept saying she was Im Se Ra...

748
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,970
I suppose an MZ won't know her.

749
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,690
Gosh, but still.

It can't be a serious illness, right?

Geez. Don't bring bad luck.

758

you were hospitalized last night

the hippocampus, which is important
in memory, was damaged.

To put it simply, your memory
rewound itself back to 25 years ago.

Twenty-five years ago?

777

When the memory is rewound due to shock like you,

778
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,410

happiest time of your life.
