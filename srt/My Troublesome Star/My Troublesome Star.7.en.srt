00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:30,787
Do you need Bong Cheong Ja or Im Se Ra?

182
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:37,147
<i>Whenever he's put on the spot,</i>

183
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:40,187
<i>he wets his lips and speaks with an accent.</i>

184
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,477
Both?

185
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,587
I want to ask you something before I answer.

186
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,277
Go ahead.

187
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,307
Twenty-five years ago,

188
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:05,527
you took me to an investor
of Director Choi's film.

189
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,347
You remember, right?

190
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:23,757
Who was that man?

191
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,757
Why are you curious about that now?

192
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:28,667
I asked a question.

193
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,207
Answer me.

194
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,547
Finding out won't do you any good.

195
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,597
I'll be the judge of that.

196
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,037
Must you know?

197
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,627
He must be someone important
since you keep dragging, huh?

198
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:48,587
Tell me.

199
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:53,877
It's because telling you won't do anything.

200
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,557
What do you mean by that?

201
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:59,907
He's already crossed the Jordan River.

202
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,657
He's already dead, I mean.

203
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:26,497
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

204
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,127
About what we discussed earlier.

205
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,167
I don't know how much your manager paid,

206
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,427
but we can easily cover the contract penalty.

207
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:34,947
I think I already gave you my answer.

208
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:38,667
Even if I pay you double?

209
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,737
Call me if you'll meet my contract requirement.

210
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:44,597
I'm not willing to compromise more.

211
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,127
I'm leaving.

212
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,277
<i>I only have one contract requirement.</i>

213
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:54,097
To join your company with my manager.

214
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:57,457
Do you really need to bring him to Two One?

215
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:02,047
Yes. He's as important as my life.

216
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,897
By chance, are you two...

217
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,617
No, right?

218
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,747
Geez...

219
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,407
He's dead already?

220
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,157
[Do Ik Hwan]

221
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,337
[Do Ik Hwan - Assemblyman]

222
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:07,827
[Former assemblyman,
Do Ik Hwan, died from illness]

223
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:32,577
Why did you kidnap Ms. Bong Cheong Ja?

224
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:39,967
You purchased a drug online to use for kidnapping.

225
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,447
You even put down a plastic sheet
at the kidnapping site.

226
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:47,217
You planned to discard the body after killing her.

227
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:50,737
A month ago, you feigned falling asleep
behind the wheel and struck her.

228
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,947
Were you planning to kill her then?

229
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,457
Mr. Kang Dae Gu, you're
an attempted murder suspect.

230
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,587
You attempted twice, not just once.

231
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,657
You kidnapped her and tried
to kill her with a weapon.

232
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,277
Your intent was already proven.

233
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:10,217
You can serve at least 10 to 20 years in jail!

234
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:19,867
I'm from the Law Firm Park and Kwon.

235
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:23,777
As Mr. Kang's attorney,
I'll attend the questioning.

236
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,647
All of you want to be here?

237
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,737
I already got approval from your higher-up.

238
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,387
Talk to me for a second.

239
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:43,857
Can I get out now?

240
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:47,957
That would be up to you, Mr. Kang.

241
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,827
What the hell...

242
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,737
Watch your mouth if you want to get out.

243
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,237
Okay.

244
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,867
Okay.

245
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:12,487
A truck driver can't afford this legal team.

246
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,367
Is it you again, Ju Seung Pil?

247
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:26,597
<i>The name is Kim Ji Ah. She was born in 2003.</i>

248
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:29,417
Her specialties are singing and dancing.

249
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,207
Yes, Mr. Ban.

250
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,197
Have you read the script I sent you?

251
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,097
<i>Yes. I liked it.</i>

252
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:38,647
I know.

253
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,207
As soon as I read the script,

254
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,207
I knew Mr. Won had to be the male lead.

255
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,857
He can act. He's handsome.

256
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,987
The programming is perfectly set up.

257
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,907
<i>He's considering it with an open mind, too. But...</i>

258
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:54,547
Is there some sort of an issue?

259
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,987
<i>As you've mentioned before,</i>

260
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:59,587
this definitely will be
Im Se Ra's comeback, right?

261
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,227
<i>Come on, Mr. Ban.</i>

262
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,837
Just make sure Mr. Won doesn't go anywhere.

263
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:07,047
We'll prepare everything and come pick him up.

264
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,457
Okay?

265
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,327
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

266
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,357
Congratulations on selling out.

267
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,927
Thank you. It's all thanks to you, Unni.

268
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:18,067
I redeemed myself after
being humiliated by Shably.

269
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

270
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,417
Why do you and Shably hate each other?

271
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,657
You used to be a team.

272
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:27,497
How many times did I tell you?

273
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:30,687
She's always been provoking me
since way back when.

274
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,807
She called me a low-born and whatnot.

275
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,067
That terrible girl.

276
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:37,967
Seon Yeong suffered a lot since she joined
the industry as a high schooler.

277
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,367
That makes her the real deal,
and I had connections.

278
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,407
And if we were a team,

279
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,717
she should've stayed loyal.

280
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,887
As soon as you got into the accident, she
sided with Go Hui Yeong immediately. I hate her.

281
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,057
They could've teamed up before that.

282
00:19:57,177 --> 00:20:00,687
You were at Im Se Ra's place during the accident,

283
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,507
but where was Shably?

284
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,947
I was so out of it then.

285
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:08,247
Gosh, thinking now, I don't think
I saw her at the hospital.

286
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:09,407
Is that so?

287
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:12,977
She left as if she knew you'd be in an accident.

288
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:17,087
Gosh. She must've been in Kang Du Won's car.

289
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,747
Something happened in the car, then.

290
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:21,517
They must've said, "Im Se Ra is coming to an end.

291
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:22,767
Work with Go Hui Yeong.

292
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,097
Forget about the setting sun
and focus on the future."

293
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:28,557
Watch your mouth. Don't say stuff like that.

294
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:33,837
What if they knew about the accident in advance?

295
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:37,187
Does that make them accomplices?

296
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:39,137
What do you mean?

297
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,777
Are you saying the accident wasn't an accident?

298
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,317
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

299
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:50,367
You think like a far-fetched soap
opera since you're in one.

300
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,247
What psycho would cause a car accident?
What for? A murder?

301
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:54,657
I know.

302
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:57,527
I did come back from death then.

303
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,207
[Dawon Inn]

304
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:29,127
There's a bag he left behind before leaving.

305
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:30,687
A bag?

306
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,967
<i>I did look inside.</i>

307
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,387
<i>There were only clothes.</i>

308
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,987
Geez. I'm sleepy.

309
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:22,627
Why do you keep bothering me?

310
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:26,237
Yes, it's me.

311
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:28,077
Yes.

312
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:34,547
What is it? Because I keep refusing to speak,

313
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:37,067
you switched players or something?

314
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:38,907
It's not going to work.

315
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:42,267
I won't speak without my attorneys.

316
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:46,357
I don't want to hear your voice, either.
Just shut your mouth and listen.

317
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,927
I just came back from somewhere.

318
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:51,087
Where you used to hide.

319
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:58,077
No matter how hard you look,
you won't find anything there.

320
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:03,837
Gosh, I know.

321
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:05,957
There wasn't much.

322
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:10,577
I thought it was a bust and was about to leave,

323
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:17,097
but the inn owner brought me a bag. You know?

324
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,967
But there wasn't much in there, either.

325
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,747
You can imagine how disappointed I was, right?

326
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:24,447
Geez.

327
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:28,197
I even craved a cigarette
that I quit a long time ago.

328
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:51,847
How did you even find this?

329
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,907
Open the latest file.

330
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,627
<i>I risked my life when I did that, too.</i>

331
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:02,547
<i>That ahjumma just won't die. What am I to do?</i>

332
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:03,847
Keep listening.

333
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,917
<i>An annoying bastard is after us.</i>

334
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,267
<i>It's better than going back to jail, right?</i>

335
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:09,337
<i>Five times more.</i>

336
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:11,747
<i>- No, no. Pay me ten times more.
- I'll pay you.</i>

337
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:15,877
<i>- Really?
- But do it right this time. Got it?</i>

338
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:19,047
<i>Could it be the same ahjumma? Again?</i>

339
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,047
What?

340
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,987
Do you have something to say?

341
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:33,607
Say it if you do.

342
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:40,067
As in who you met at Gayeon Hotel.

343
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:47,077
<i>Geez. You don't even pay me that much.</i>

344
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:49,567
Why do you keep bothering me?

345
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,437
Let's not make this troublesome for us.

346
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,717
You think I was secretly recording?

347
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,247
Geez.

348
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:58,597
You think I have no work ethic
because I do stuff like this?

349
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,297
What?

350
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,627
Will you steal my last cigarette now?

351
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:17,407
Hey, did you have to bring him to me?

352
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,157
You should've taken care of it.

353
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:21,237
It's a very important matter.

354
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:27,567
So, what's his job?

355
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,597
Well, I was told to take care of an ahjumma.

356
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:39,667
Take your hands out of your pockets.

357
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:49,167
So, how will you take care of her? Huh?

358
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,767
Well, probably one or the other.

359
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:56,067
I'll either kill her or turn her into a cripple.

360
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:05,007
Well, those options have different prices.

361
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:16,367
Whether you kill her or put her
into a coma, I don't care.

362
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,627
What's important is that...

363
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,337
Yes. Of course. I'll keep this shut.

364
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:24,067
The fact that you're meeting me
means one thing or the other.

365
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:28,167
Either you did a fantastic job that
I'll never have to see you again.

366
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:33,367
Or you messed up slightly,
and I'll never see you again.

367
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,247
Did you laugh?

368
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:51,967
Hotel? What hotel? I don't know about that.

369
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:55,307
You know, not the one who gave
you the job. His boss.

370
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:56,367
You really don't know?

371
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,807
I don't. I don't. How many times
do you have to ask?

372
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:02,307
You scared me. Fine, you don't. Why scream?

373
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:04,147
Okay, okay.

374
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:07,227
I'll ask Gwak Jeong Do if you don't.

375
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:09,677
Why? Why? What for?

376
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:13,527
Wait, what will you ask him?

377
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,747
I'll ask whose voice this is.

378
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:21,147
He must know since he was there.

379
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:28,307
Well, how did you know that was Gwak Jeong Do?

380
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:32,767
The other one was definitely Gwak Jeong Do, huh?

381
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,537
Your eyes shook just now. Yes.

382
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,357
I... I didn't say anything.

383
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,667
I'll exercise my right to be silent now.
Don't ask me anything.

384
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:45,217
What would happen if I played
this audio for Gwak Jeong Do?

385
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:49,437
No, no. It'd be better to say
you gave it to me. Right?

386
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:51,347
You bastard!

387
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:55,907
Kang Dae Gu, listen carefully.

388
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,077
You know better than me

389
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:01,907
how thorough they are when
it comes to killing someone.

390
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:04,107
Killing you?

391
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:06,307
It's probably nothing to them.

392
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:38,767
- Hello.
- Hello.

393
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,387
- Hello.
- Hello.

394
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,327
- Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,197
Just one second.

396
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,817
- Hello.
- Hello.

397
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:52,427
What's Aunt doing here?

398
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:58,947
Here. Let's sign the contract.

399
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,127
Are you meeting my requirement?

400
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:09,897
I am. I'm doubling the contract fee as I said.

401
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,847
Hold on, Noona.

402
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:24,427
Take this with you.

403
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:25,927
Huh? There it was.
[Miscasting]

404
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,217
I looked for it everywhere.

405
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,367
I love stories like that.

406
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:33,067
A nobody side character surviving
until the end, carrying the story,

407
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,987
and defeating all the lead characters.

408
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:36,127
Did you read it?

409
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:38,777
Im Sun sure is a powerful character.

410
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,557
You said my only good quality
was being light on my feet.

411
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:44,737
But I have good taste in scripts.

412
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:47,307
I recommended you "Jewelry Shop Girl," too.

413
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:50,927
Yes. You must be where you are for that reason.

414
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,127
What I meant is-

415
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:55,297
Let's stop talking about the past.

416
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,197
Noona,

417
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,327
look over there.

418
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,687
Let's only look forward from now on.

419
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:16,237
Wow. A contract for me?

420
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:19,317
Am I really joining Two One with you?

421
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,807
I'm telling you.

422
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:23,937
Okay. Sounds good. As a manager, I mean,

423
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:27,767
as your true manager, I'll make sure to help you.

424
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:32,667
What would help me is to catch
that son of a bitch who tried to kill-

425
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:36,717
It's to catch him.

426
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:38,967
Let's continue our phone conversation.

427
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:43,637
The man you met 25 years ago was
the late Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

428
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:47,497
I thought it was him because
he was wearing the same watch.

429
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,727
But no.

430
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:51,617
Do Ik Hwan.

431
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,567
Let's dig around him first.

432
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,577
There must be a connection somewhere.

433
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,297
Don't worry. I'll catch him soon.

434
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:01,647
Did you find anything?

435
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:06,687
I think I found conclusive evidence
that would force him to speak.

436
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,367
What?

437
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:19,767
The real culprit might be one
of the people I know.

438
00:31:21,117 --> 00:31:23,557
I thought you were ready to face that.

439
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:29,397
It's not like I have the memory of those 25 years.

440
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:31,917
Right now,

441
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:37,397
I feel attached and miss everyone around me.

442
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:43,697
The fact that they suddenly changed feels strange.

443
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:47,317
It might be better that you lost your memory.

444
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:50,247
You can judge things more clearly.

445
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:55,107
People usually try to ignore hard truths.

446
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:00,937
Right.

447
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:02,407
Here.

448
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,347
What's this?

449
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,987
Is it a gift?

450
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:26,707
Carry it around just in case.

451
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:33,787
Oh, no!

452
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,467
What? Gosh.

453
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,167
How does this work? Why won't it work?

454
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,327
Hurry. Hurry. Gosh.

455
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,457
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:43,627
Here. Take a look.

457
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:45,857
You see the safety pin here?

458
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,397
You always raise this and-

459
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:49,077
Don't bother.

460
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:50,867
I can just look it up on YouTube.

461
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:54,937
And I put a whistle on a chain. Always keep it on.

462
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,397
Gosh, fine.

463
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,267
Make sure to wear it, okay?

464
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,767
It's not even a gold necklace
or a silver necklace.

465
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,457
A whistle and a gas gun.

466
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:10,377
And let's share each other's location, too.

467
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:11,447
Why would we do that?

468
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,087
W-What are we, a couple or something?

469
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,567
You've been kidnapped recently.

470
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,537
Just in case. Come on.

471
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,867
It's okay.

472
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:22,547
I'll press No. 1 and call you
if something happens. Don't worry.

473
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,557
Don't be stubborn. Hurry-

474
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,777
Hold on.

475
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:30,907
My speed dial is No. 1?

476
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,267
- Who says?
- You just said No. 1.

477
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,267
- You said you'll press No. 1.
- No.

478
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,167
No. 121.

479
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:48,527
- I definitely said No. 121.
- I see.

480
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,167
No. 121? Okay.

481
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,477
I'll still save you as No. 1.

482
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,407
Do whatever you want.

483
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,987
[Bong Cheong Ja signed
with Two One Entertainment]

484
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,697
He ended up signing with her.

485
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:11,697
It turns out she's so below Two One's standard,

486
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:13,607
she signed under terrible terms.

487
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:16,997
She was paid double, as far as I know.

488
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:20,077
But the contract signing fee was so small already.

489
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:22,627
Why do you keep tiptoeing around me?

490
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:27,207
As if I was against signing her on.

491
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,867
She's just a minor role actor. Don't be silly.

492
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,567
I should give her a welcome gift.

493
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,507
Gift?

494
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:41,777
The latest commercial proposal
sounds perfect for her.

495
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:48,297
A commercial?

496
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:54,077
I didn't even imagine doing a commercial.

497
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:58,157
Are you sure it's for me?

498
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:00,727
Yes. Until the shoot day,

499
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:03,617
I'll be on a diet and do skincare-

500
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:09,007
You don't want me to go on a diet?

501
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,327
Okay, then.

502
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,527
Thank you so much. Okay.

503
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:16,677
You already have a manager?

504
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:18,217
Yes.

505
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:22,377
And I'm shooting a commercial.

506
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,797
Wasn't it voice phishing?

507
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:30,127
It's a proper commercial deal I got officially.

508
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:32,747
You have so much stuff.

509
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:33,847
There isn't.

510
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,247
Let's go.

511
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,297
Dad,

512
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:40,447
I'm here.

513
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,987
Your eldest daughter.

514
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,657
Im Se Ra.

515
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:55,867
Aigoo. I said there's no point telling him.

516
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:01,637
Se Ra.

517
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,137
Huh? Dad.

518
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:07,617
Dad, do you remember me?

519
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:12,067
Dad, yes. It's me, Se Ra. Your daughter.

520
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,267
You're Se Ra?

521
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:15,767
Yes...

522
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:21,817
- Se Ra.
- Dad.

523
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:23,777
My dad.

524
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:27,507
When did you age so much?

525
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,787
My pretty Se Ra.

526
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:33,007
You haven't changed.

527
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,537
You haven't changed. Aigoo...

528
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,447
No, Dad.

529
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:48,307
I've changed.

530
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,787
I changed a lot, too.

531
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:55,137
No.

532
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:58,927
You're the prettiest one.

533
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:04,787
You're the prettiest one on TV, Se Ra.

534
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:42,367
Hey, Noona. Are you that excited
about getting paid for the commercial?

535
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:47,047
I mean, you should've told me
about the storyboard.

536
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:50,637
You tricked me on purpose, didn't you?

537
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:52,247
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

538
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:55,177
<i>It was delayed because the
storyboard kept changing.</i>

539
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:57,657
But you got paid quickly. What's the problem?

540
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:59,677
You think there's no problem?

541
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,247
Let's talk later.

542
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,327
Is there an issue?

543
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,997
No.

544
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:09,057
I got the costume.

545
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:11,197
It's a bit flashy, though.

546
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:19,367
Could you be outside when I shoot?

547
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:22,267
What do you mean? I'm your manager.
I need to stick with you.

548
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:26,707
Well, I haven't done a commercial in a while.

549
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:30,567
I'd be too nervous. You can wait outside.

550
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,367
I knew you'd say that. Ta-da.

551
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:36,667
The company managers said I should
take extra care for commercial shoots.

552
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,257
Isn't that a great tip?

553
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:41,487
Ms. Go Hui Yeong is here.

554
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:45,167
Go Hui Yeong?

555
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:51,197
Is she the one who's shooting with me today?

556
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,757
I haven't heard that, either.

557
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,257
- Hello.
- Hello.

558
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:56,787
Ms. Go, you came.

559
00:38:56,787 --> 00:39:01,357
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

560
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,917
- Hello, Director.
- Hey.

561
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,297
I'm late, aren't I?

562
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:27,507
The main event always happens last.

563
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,317
I thought the storyboard was fun.

564
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:33,757
Skit-style commercials are trendy these days.

565
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:36,937
Hey, over there. Come here.

566
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:42,747
M-Me?

567
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,137
Yes.

568
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,207
You know each other, right?

569
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:56,017
She was recommended by Ms. Go's agency.

570
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:01,737
Well, I don't know her.

571
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:06,857
By chance, will she be my partner today?

572
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,167
Yes.

573
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:15,477
I look forward to working with you.

574
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,667
Is she out of her mind?

575
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:22,627
I know she'd be standing next to me
like a shadow. But still.

576
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:27,207
How could I shoot a commercial
with an ahjumma like this?

577
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:30,627
You've got to be kidding me.

578
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:31,807
Move.

579
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:34,117
- Noona, you can't suddenly do this.
- Wait...

580
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,197
Where are you going, Noona? Noona.

581
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:41,307
You follow her.

582
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:43,777
Why should I?

583
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,507
Ms. Go is upset because of you.

584
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:49,277
Geez. I thought your agency told you.

585
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,457
Will you get the shoot canceled? Huh?

586
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:54,487
Why would you yell at her?

587
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,637
W-What's with you?

588
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:00,837
I'll follow her.

589
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:09,907
Huh? Baek Ja.

590
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:12,587
You said you were shooting a commercial today.

591
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:15,277
So, I brought this for everyone.

592
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:22,497
I shouldn't have come.

593
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:24,467
I didn't know. I'd be in the way.

594
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:28,657
- I'll just leave this here and go.
- N-No, give that to me.

595
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:32,507
Wait, okay? You have to wait.

596
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,107
Hold on!

597
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:43,937
Hold on, Ms. Go! Hold on.

598
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,817
Hold on, Ms. Go.

599
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,627
You can't leave like this.

600
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:52,907
Doesn't make sense to cancel
the shoot because of me.

601
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:58,657
Whether it makes sense or not,
it's none of your business.

602
00:41:58,657 --> 00:42:02,337
But still. You can't leave like this.

603
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:06,527
What would happen to everyone else here?

604
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:10,187
Do you really not know why I'm doing this?

605
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:20,987
Tell me what the problem is.

606
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:23,937
Get yourself a commercial deal on your own

607
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:28,517
if you want it instead of relying on me.

608
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:32,067
Don't try to piggyback on me.

609
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,227
<i>Unni.</i>

610
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:40,037
<i>Unni, you know this is my first commercial.</i>

611
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,177
<i>But you're leaving like this? Really?</i>

612
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:44,537
<i>You aren't actually leaving, right?</i>

613
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:46,817
<i>Get yourself a commercial deal if you want it.</i>

614
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,217
<i>Don't try to piggyback on me.</i>

615
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:54,887
You...

616
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,617
You knew.

617
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:04,067
- You're doing this on purpose-
- I have no idea what you mean.

618
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,067
I see you're trying to screw me.

619
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,047
I do, but first...

620
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:14,667
Let's shoot first and...

621
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,027
Aren't we leaving?

622
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,317
Hold on.

623
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:20,057
Hold on. Hold on, please.

624
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:23,387
What? Will you kneel or something?

625
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,007
<i>You're acting cocky because
you got a bit famous.</i>

626
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,437
<i>So, I'm putting you in your place.</i>

627
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:31,687
<i>I'll act my place from now on.</i>

628
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:35,117
<i>Please help me just once.</i>

629
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:50,027
- Gosh, let's go.
- H-Hold on.

630
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,007
H-Hold on.

631
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:11,427
I apologize.

632
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:19,037
I told you what to do without knowing my place.

633
00:44:19,037 --> 00:44:21,617
It was my fault.

634
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,557
Oh, no...

635
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:29,257
I can't tell if you're sincere at all.

636
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:39,557
I was rude.

637
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:41,377
I sincerely...

638
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:44,907
apologize.

639
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,997
I guess you still have pride.

640
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,217
What did I do wrong?

641
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:09,867
How did you wait for decades
to bully me like this?

642
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:17,017
You must be thrilled that
I showed up looking like this.

643
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,587
Hey, you...

644
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:26,747
Don't act surprised.

645
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:28,977
You used me as your stooge to humiliate me.

646
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,977
You think I don't know that?

647
00:45:32,507 --> 00:45:33,777
Are you crazy?

648
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:36,107
That's enough now!

649
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,627
I refuse to shoot a commercial like this.

650
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:42,567
I refuse!

651
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,447
- What's with her...
- Oh, no...

652
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:49,777
Are you okay, Ms. Go?

653
00:45:49,777 --> 00:45:51,847
Director...

654
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:55,257
That ahjumma...

655
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:58,077
- Geez...
- What's happening?

656
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:04,167
- What's this?
- What else? It says right there.

657
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,967
They're suing to claim a contract breach fee.

658
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:09,067
- Contract breach fee?
- They paid you the contract fee.

659
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,547
You flipped out and scrapped the whole thing.

660
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:14,567
I didn't scrap it. Go Hui Yeong is the one-

661
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:16,507
Geez. Seriously.

662
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:20,777
<i>I refuse to shoot a commercial like this.</i>

663
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,717
<i>I refuse!</i>

664
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:25,897
I talked to Hui Yeong.

665
00:46:25,897 --> 00:46:29,787
She said she would've backed
down if you apologized.

666
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,457
Her acting skills improved a lot.

667
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,207
But why did she get even meaner?

668
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:38,137
Excuse me, you need to understand the situation.

669
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:39,997
You're the one who's desperate now.

670
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,027
If I knew she plotted this whole thing,

671
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:44,837
I wouldn't have set foot in there.

672
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:46,877
You did because you needed money.

673
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:48,867
You got paid in advance, too.

674
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:50,997
<i>That's because...</i>

675
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:55,747
<i>If you persuade Hui Yeong,</i>

676
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:59,387
the ad agency will take the hit for the reshoot.

677
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,597
What do you want me to do?

678
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:05,097
<i>What am I to do, then?</i>

679
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:11,147
Yes, Chief. This is Dokgo Cheol.

680
00:47:11,147 --> 00:47:14,437
Can I check Ms. Go Hui Yeong's schedule?

681
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:19,877
Let's see...

682
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,497
I don't like the pattern.

683
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:28,107
This is a new line Hermaire.

684
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:30,777
Should I be grateful for it, then?

685
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:32,947
Bring me something else.

686
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:40,307
By chance, is that the only thing you got?

687
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:45,387
Well, Hermaire is your favorite brand.

688
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:49,357
And we were the first one to have the new line.

689
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:55,407
Sa Seon Yeong, you've had
it too easy, haven't you?

690
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,907
So what if I love Hermaire?

691
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:02,057
They've never let me be their ambassador.

692
00:48:02,057 --> 00:48:04,007
What is this, unrequited love?

693
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,487
T-They said...

694
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:10,277
they'll consider you as their
global ambassador next time-

695
00:48:10,277 --> 00:48:12,297
Next time. Next time. Next time.

696
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:14,707
When is that next time, huh?

697
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:17,647
Can't you play hard to get?

698
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:19,957
They keep acting tentatively.

699
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:24,077
You want me to gladly accept their
products and promote them?

700
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,887
Calm down.

701
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:30,617
I'll try talking to them this time.

702
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,807
What can you do?

703
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:36,687
You managed to get here by piggybacking on me.

704
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:40,207
What can you do? Huh?

705
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:57,417
I think it's all about sincerity.

706
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:06,817
<i>Noona, should I tell them
to remove the third question?</i>

707
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:09,417
I've had romance rumors
with Won Ban plenty of times.

708
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:11,247
You'll work with him for the next project, too.

709
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,337
They could bring up this interview again.

710
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:16,237
No problem. It's good to bring more attention.

711
00:49:16,237 --> 00:49:19,777
Well, yes. It'd add to your chemistry.

712
00:49:20,717 --> 00:49:22,447
What's this?

713
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:25,807
I'm Dokgo Cheol, Bong Cheong Ja's manager.

714
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:28,767
Let me talk to you briefly. It won't take long.

715
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:30,647
You take care of him.

716
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:35,087
I heard you're very angry because of her.

717
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,207
I'm here to apologize.

718
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:40,847
Don't do this here.

719
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:42,437
Excuse me.

720
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:44,837
Go and tell her.

721
00:49:44,837 --> 00:49:46,537
That you can't apologize with just words.

722
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:50,397
Not through someone else's, especially.

723
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:53,447
Would you feel better if I knelt?

724
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,937
Why? Did Im Se Ra-

725
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:01,657
Did Bong Cheong Ja say she'd kneel in front of me?

726
00:50:10,647 --> 00:50:11,917
Are you crazy?

727
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:14,717
I'm kneeling because you said
you can't apologize with words.

728
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:16,777
I sincerely apologize.

729
00:50:16,777 --> 00:50:19,107
Please don't be upset and agree to shoot again.

730
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:20,347
I beg you.

731
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:22,417
Get up now. Please?

732
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:24,747
Get up. People can see you.

733
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:26,387
They're taking photos right now.

734
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:28,807
I'll get up if you accept the apology.

735
00:50:28,807 --> 00:50:30,207
What do we do?

736
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,177
We can't stop the photos from spreading.

737
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:33,827
Okay. So, get up.

738
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:36,027
I accept your apology.

739
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:40,557
- Are you sure?
- I said yes.

740
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:42,277
Will you shoot the commercial?

741
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:45,877
Please. Get up. I hear you.

742
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:54,077
Thank you.

743
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:56,507
<i>Gosh, gosh!</i>

744
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:58,177
Thank you!

745
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:02,897
Is he crazy?

746
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:11,957
Is it because I'm old?

747
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:14,727
My cheeks, arms,

748
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:16,527
and belly fat.

749
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,887
Why can't I get rid of it?

750
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:22,057
Is it really because of age?

751
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:26,067
Look. I'm still perfect.

752
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,877
This elasticity wand takes care of everything.

753
00:51:30,877 --> 00:51:34,127
Care for yourself and see the difference.

754
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:37,047
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

755
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:40,157
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

756
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:43,627
Geez. What are you doing right now?

757
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:45,197
"Jump with vigor."

758
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:47,447
Didn't you read it? Huh?

759
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:50,407
I did jump with vigor.

760
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,577
"You want the massage wand. You desire it.

761
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,087
You want to be as pretty as Go Hui Yeong."

762
00:51:56,087 --> 00:52:00,027
I can't feel your desire and passion.

763
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:03,697
I'll try to do better.

764
00:52:05,307 --> 00:52:07,727
Hey. Go again. Go again.

765
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:08,867
Geez.

766
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:12,007
This elasticity wand takes care of everything.

767
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:14,687
Care for yourself and see the difference.

768
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:18,557
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

769
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:20,447
Geez, Director.

770
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,947
Can't you do this? Can't you?

771
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:25,267
I'll try just once more.

772
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,517
Geez. How frustrating.

773
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:31,027
Hey, let's go again. Let's go again.

774
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,667
Care for yourself and see the difference.

775
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:39,297
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

776
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:40,547
Cut!

777
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:43,397
Don't stop me. Don't stop me. I quit. I quit.

778
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:45,417
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

779
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,827
I'll do better.

780
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:49,387
You're so slow.

781
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:51,627
Let's go again. Yes.

782
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:57,027
Look. I'm still perfect.

783
00:52:57,027 --> 00:53:00,017
Care for yourself and see the difference.

784
00:53:00,017 --> 00:53:04,407
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

785
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:06,137
Me, too.

786
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:24,147
Cut! Okay.

787
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:27,737
That was great, Hui Yeong.

788
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,037
You really are a great actor.

789
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:31,427
Come on.

790
00:53:31,427 --> 00:53:33,947
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

791
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:36,727
- Thank you.
<i>- Thank you!</i>

792
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:39,257
<i>Thank you!</i>

793
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:42,597
Thank you.

794
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,457
Are you okay?

795
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:47,017
You did well.

796
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:49,417
Get up.

797
00:53:50,467 --> 00:53:52,827
- What's wrong?
- My shoulder...

798
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:55,187
You hurt it when you fell.

799
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:57,357
Where? Here?

800
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:00,747
Get up.

801
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:03,577
Do your legs hurt, too?

802
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:06,037
I sprained it earlier.

803
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:07,747
Let's go for now.

804
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:11,847
There's a physical therapy center
I know. Let's go there.

805
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:15,707
You need to do the voice-over next.

806
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:18,467
Should I get the car ready?

807
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:23,297
Hey, can you kneel for me?

808
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:25,817
Why do you suddenly ask that...

809
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:29,187
Just answer me. Can you or can't you?

810
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:32,677
I've never knelt before in my life.

811
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,207
Seriously.

812
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:38,807
Noona, I will. I can kneel.

813
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:39,937
Noona?

814
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:42,327
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

815
00:54:59,147 --> 00:55:00,847
Thank you.

816
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,337
I don't know why you changed your mind,

817
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:14,507
but you decided to shoot again.

818
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:18,627
I sincerely thank you.

819
00:55:18,627 --> 00:55:21,747
Do you really not know or...

820
00:55:21,747 --> 00:55:24,647
are you pretending?

821
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:26,487
What do you mean?

822
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:29,517
You still have some pride left.

823
00:55:29,517 --> 00:55:31,667
You forced him to apologize for you.

824
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,777
Don't act ignorant.

825
00:55:35,217 --> 00:55:37,817
What are you talking about?

826
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:41,947
Your manager came to see me.

827
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:46,247
He apologized and begged in front
of everyone. What was I to do?

828
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:50,597
I decided to shoot to help him out.

829
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,227
I did it for your manager.

830
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:57,647
Is that true?

831
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,837
Wow.

832
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:05,367
You've always been an amazing actor.

833
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,867
Why don't you say,

834
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:11,337
"No. I didn't know."

835
00:56:12,427 --> 00:56:14,007
Why don't you?

836
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:21,547
You know, I did some humiliating
things, but I did them.

837
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,647
But what about you?

838
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,277
You acted as if you could do anything for acting.

839
00:56:26,277 --> 00:56:29,637
But you wouldn't do anything
you don't feel like doing.

840
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:34,307
But now, you made your manager apologize for you?

841
00:56:37,737 --> 00:56:42,287
You're in this mess
because you did it to yourself.

842
00:56:42,287 --> 00:56:45,407
You did it to yourself, I said.

843
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,977
What took you so long?

844
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,297
I talked to the physical therapy center.

845
00:57:25,297 --> 00:57:26,627
They close at seven normally,

846
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:29,427
but I begged them to stay open until eight.

847
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:30,997
Let's...

848
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:36,637
Why did you do that? Why?

849
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:40,057
Why? Why?

850
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,767
Did something happen?

851
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,637
Why do you make me so miserable?

852
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:49,787
Who... Who asked you to apologize for me?

853
00:57:54,077 --> 00:57:56,387
I don't know what you're talking about.

854
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,247
I didn't even know.

855
00:57:59,247 --> 00:58:03,567
I thanked Go Hui Yeong like a fool.

856
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,857
Why does it matter who apologized?

857
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:09,557
- It was an urgent situation.
- It matters to me.

858
00:58:09,557 --> 00:58:12,077
Because it's Go Hui Yeong, not just anyone else.

859
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:15,987
To Go Hui Yeong, of all people, you...

860
00:58:15,987 --> 00:58:19,567
you... of all people...

861
00:58:20,937 --> 00:58:23,917
Of all people, you...

862
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,987
Of all people...

863
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:55,607
I'm your manager.

864
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:01,677
It's my job to protect my actor.

865
00:59:02,637 --> 00:59:04,737
Why didn't you...

866
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:08,877
Why didn't you just persuade me? Why didn't you?

867
00:59:10,807 --> 00:59:12,787
I didn't want to do that.

868
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:16,037
You get your feelings hurt

869
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:18,887
by the actors who aren't as good as you...

870
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:22,147
I didn't want that to happen again.

871
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:28,957
What's so great about me?

872
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:32,237
What's so great about little old me?

873
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:35,917
I told you before.

874
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:39,207
As your true manager,

875
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:42,677
I'll help you by your side.

876
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:49,617
I can kneel in front of her a hundred
times if it's for my actor.

877
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:52,717
I'm good at kneeling. I did it a lot in school.

878
01:00:05,837 --> 01:00:07,477
Here. Let's get up.

879
01:00:07,477 --> 01:00:11,007
Here. Let's get up. Yes.

880
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:15,767
So, you'll extend your legs,

881
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:20,487
straighten your shoulders, and stand tall.

882
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:22,207
Okay?

883
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:28,677
Okay.

884
01:00:28,677 --> 01:00:30,187
Let's go.

885
01:00:30,187 --> 01:00:32,907
Let's go. Let's go.

886
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:35,867
Okay.

887
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:51,657
- It's Mr. Gu.
- Mr .Gu.

888
01:00:51,657 --> 01:00:53,517
Mr. Gu, how do you feel about the drama ending?

889
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,717
You've worked so hard.

890
