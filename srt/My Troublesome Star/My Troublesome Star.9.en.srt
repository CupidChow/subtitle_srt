Are you crying?

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,370
You remind me of how you used to be.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,240
You're just like the dazzling Lim Se Ra from back then.

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,080
Then why are you crying?

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,910
Because I'm happy for you.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,019
Se Ra.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,250
You're so beautiful.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,690
I'm just so happy for you.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,030
We're ready for you now.

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,300
- Do I look strange? - Yes.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
What part?

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,570
Tell me. What looks strange?

25
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,770
No. That's not what I meant.

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,010
You're beautiful.

27
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,180
You're so beautiful.

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,150
Oh, what a relief.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
What's that behind your back?

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,060
What?

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,360
Come on. You're hiding something this whole time.

32
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,270
Are you hiding some snacks from me or something?

33
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,100
No, that's not it.

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,470
Let me see.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,240
Actually, we got this as a sponsorship.

36
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,410
Really?

37
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,779
Of course. You're Lim Se Ra.

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,050
This is the least they can do.

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,180
- What is it? - Do you want to see?

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,050
- This is so pretty. - You think so?

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Yes.

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Absolutely.

43
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,630
Will you put it on for me?

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,030
Oh, of course.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Is this good?

("Ms. Casting")

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,260
Bong Chung Ja is going to make you shine.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Just you wait.

49
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,670
Gosh.

50
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,739
Isn't she the Radish Lady?

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,080
Bong Chung Ja or something.

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,450
Go, Bong Chung Ja!

53
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Ms. Lim Se Ra, could you share your thoughts on your comeback?

54
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,270
Yes, I've always dreamed of starring in one of Director Choi's films.

55
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,640
And to be able to fulfill that dream after 25 years...

56
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,450
I still can't tell if I'm dreaming or if this is real.

57
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,250
I will give it my all.

58
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,520
Director Choi. This must be very meaningful for you as well.

59
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,560
Did you have Ms. Lim Se Ra in mind for the role from the start?

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,990
As you all know, this role was cast through an open audition,

61
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,600
so that wasn't the case at all.

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,000
But I can't deny I've long hoped to work with her.

63
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,670
A question for Ms. Lim Se Ra. Could you describe your character?

64
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,779
We are also looking forward to your dynamic with Mr. Won Ban?

65
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,380
How does it feel to be reunited?

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Could you say something to the fans who waited so long for your return?

67
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,560
First, I'd like to thank the fans who have waited so patiently.

("Ms. Casting")

69
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,700
Oh, no.

70
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,740
- I think her dress ripped, right? - Are you okay?

71
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,620
- I'm so embarrassed. - Let's go.

72
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,720
It's all because of Lim Se Ra!

73
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,370
You shot yourself in the foot. Who are you going to blame for that?

74
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,540
Didn't you say Bong Chung Ja was going to make me shine?

75
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,640
That you'd put me in the spotlight!

76
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,070
Hey. Don't get me wrong. I had no idea she'd look so amazing.

77
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,140
She had zero support from the agency.

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,179
She lost all that weight and got in killer shape by herself.

79
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,110
What do you want me to do about her getting that gorgeous?

80
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,650
Why'd she get so gorgeous suddenly? Darn it.

81
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,850
Lim Se Ra.

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
It's me.

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,060
- Hold on a second. - Hey. Where are you going?

84
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,230
Just a second!

85

("Lim Se Ra's Perfect Look Versus Go Hui Yeong's Luxury Dress")

86
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Who's calling that you have to sneak out to answer?

87
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,080
It's them. About that damaged item you got from the sponsor.

88
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,190
What about it?

89
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
Do they want me to pay for it?

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,960
Instead of making you pay, they want to switch models.

91
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,600
- To Bong Chung Ja. - What?

92
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,500
- Well... - Don't tell me you agreed to it.

93
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,369
From the agency's perspective, instead of losing it to outsiders,

94
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,340
it's better to pass it on to one of our own.

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Besides, you get many offers anyway. Bong Chung Ja only has this one.

96
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,440
I want all my staff replaced.

97
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,649
How is it the staff's fault that you're getting sidelined?

98
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,820
- Seriously? - Goodness.

99
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,590
Come on. I can't fire them all now. There are contracts in place.

100
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,690
Then at least fire the stylist.

101
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,320
- She's on a rider contract. - You mean Chavely?

102
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,390
Chavely or Novely. I don't care! Fire them all!

103
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,100
You've really lost it.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,740
Go Hui Yeong, where are you?

105
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,410
Open the door!

106
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,049
Have you lost your mind? What do you think you're doing here?

107
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,350
- Darn you. - Gosh.

108
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,390
Is it my fault your dress ripped?

109
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,360
Do you really have to take it this far?

110
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,670
After all the years we've been through together...

111
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,680
We've been at this for two decades. I'd say I've been more than loyal.

112
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,610
You know that I can't stand clingy people.

113
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,490
Our relationship was never just about business, was it?

114
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,390
You'd better watch your mouth.

115
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,300
You haven't seen trouble yet.

116
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,669
And if it does? What could you possibly do?

117
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,310
About something that happened 25 years ago?

118
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,780
What can you possibly do without any proof?

119
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,580
Who says I don't have proof?

120
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,390
What do you mean by that?

121
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,160
That expression on your face is so convincing.

122
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,760
You should've used that acting gift on screen.

123
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,139
If you had, then Lim Se Ra, who just reappeared after 25 years,

124
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,800
wouldn't be trouncing you like this.

125
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,010
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,850
Are you sure you want me to talk about it all right here?

127
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,020
Have a good one, Hui Yeong.

128
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,690
Why do they have to cause a scene in my salon?

129
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,330
Something must've really happened 25 years ago.

130
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,300
She said she had proof.

131
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
Gosh, you scared me.

132
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,570
How long have you been there?

133
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,280
Ever since you started doing Go Hui Yeong's makeup.

134
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,580
Really? Gosh, how did I not notice you?

135
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,209
Nobody noticed. And it's not like I'm easy to miss.

136
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,550
Perfect. Then you must have heard everything.

137
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,949
What did she say? What proof?

138
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,189
What is it? Tell me!

139
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,620
- Hold on a second. - Hurry!

140
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,230
- I don't know either. - How could you not know?

141
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,430
I dozed off.

142
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,560
Are you kidding me? How could you sleep at that moment?

143
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Wait a second.

144
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,799
Then the accident from 25 years ago...

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,710
might not have been an accident at all.

146
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,410
But Go Hui Yeong acted like she had no idea there was any proof.

147
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,450
Oh, my. How come?

148
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,150
Was it incriminating evidence against Go Hui Yeong?

149
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,320
Don't tell me Go Hui Yeong did something to Se Ra...

150
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,430
I mean, she did hate her enough to want her dead.

151
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,400
Oh, my gosh. This is crazy. No, it couldn't be.

152
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,770
Actually, Go Hui Yeong would absolutely do something like that.

153
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,840
Remember the talk of how she took Lim Se Ra's spot after her accident?

154
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,740
If only we knew what it was. Seriously, what could it be?

155
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,110
- Should I get it out from Chavely? - How?

156
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,719
You know me.

157
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,680
Women used to fall for Gu Nam Ju with just a flicker of my finger.

158
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,050
Chavely was head over heels for me back then, too.

159
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,659
Gosh. What decade was that? Now, you're a shriveled radish.

160
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,530
Hey! I told you not to mention radishes!

161
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
- Darn it! - Gosh.

162
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,700
Gosh. He can be so cute.

163
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,370
So Chavely is the key to all this?

164
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,079
Se Ra.

165
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,719
You can't lose to Go Hui Yeong from the very first shoot. Got it?

166
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,589
Gosh. It's not like I'm going into battle.

167
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,649
Oh, honestly.

("Ms. Casting")

169
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,390
Look at her.

170
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,960
- Hi. - Director.

It's my first shoot in a long time. I'm in your hands.

178
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,440
No, I'm the one who should be asking that of you.

179
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,110
So were you able to get some sleep?

180
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
I was too nervous.

181
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,010
For this scene, I'm not sure if I should hold back my emotions...

182
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,549
- or play it more intensely. - Gosh.

183
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,790
How many times have you read it?

184
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,390
I have complete faith in you, Se Ra. Trust and follow your instincts.

185
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
I'll do my best.

186
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,630
What's this? What was that for?

187
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,270
I'm finally giving it back to you.

188
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,170
I should have done it a long time ago.

189
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,740
I had to catch the culprit first.

190
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,510
So I put it off on purpose.

191
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,480
With that hanging around my neck,

192
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,190
I never had a single peaceful night's sleep.

193
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,990
I'm so sorry.

194
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,230
Cut! That was great!

195
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
It was?

196
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,440
Gosh. I didn't know she had that look in her.

197
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,439
The focus was soft on Hui Yeong. Should we do another take?

198
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,780
No. It'd be hard to get that look again,

199
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,310
- so let's just use this one. - What?

200
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,450
Me?

201
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,920
Director. Did I hold back too much? Is that okay?

202
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,390
Are you kidding? It was great. It couldn't have been more perfect.

203
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,560
It was the best!

204
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,800
Where's my chair?

205
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,730
Hui Yeong! Here it is. Right here!

206
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,570
Gosh.

207
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,480
Gosh. It's not summer, but it's so hot.

208
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,880
Here.

209
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,850
Drink this. I thought you'd be hot and got this.

210
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,720
Did you run all the way out just for these?

211
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,559
Look how much you're sweating.

212
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,190
- I'm fine, really. - It's cool, right?

213
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,860
- Hey, I said I'm hot! - It's right here!

214
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,499
- Hey! - Gosh.

215
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,539
Oh, Hui Yeong.

216
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,340
What's wrong with your face? It's a total disaster.

217
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,640
Let me just fix your hair.

218
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

219
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,850
Today is just so much fun. It's just the best day ever.

220
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,720
I'm sorry for not being there for you.

221
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,930
For not being there for you.

222
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,200
You've read that 100 times now. Have you still not memorized it?

223
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
Of course, I have it memorized.

224
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,769
While Go Hui Yeong became Queen of Cannes,

225
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,470
I was out of the game for 25 years.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,170
If I want to even begin to catch up, I have to study until it's perfect.

227
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,780
Gosh. Why does it get harder the more I look at it?

228
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,049
But from what I could tell,

229
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,980
the director seemed to like it a lot.

230
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,720
As if. That was just a camera test. He was just being encouraging.

231
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,790
Gosh. Still, you actors are amazing.

232
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,690
How do you memorize all those lines? I couldn't do it for the life of me.

233
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,330
Anyway, is there any way I can help?

234
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,900
Actually, there is one thing.

235
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,270
What?

236
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,250
"Whenever I saw your face through that crack in the window,"

237
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,780
"I felt like I was back in the only happy moment of my life."

238
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,420
"What is it? Are you going to hold my hand?"

239
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,430
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

240
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,530
"No."

241
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,700
"You're already doing enough. You're here by my side."

242
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,200
"You haven't left me."

243
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,850
"I don't think I can go with you tomorrow."

244
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,619
"Let's say our goodbyes here."

245
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,220
"Then just promise me one thing."

246
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,130
"That you won't leave and you'll wait for me until I return."

247
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,900
"I promise."

248
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,569
"He moves closer."

249
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,570
Where to?

250
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,099
"He moves closer."

251
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,170
Where to?

252
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,470
Where to?

253
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,810
Where to?

254
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,810
Oh, seriously.

255
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,010
Gosh. This is a lot harder than it looks.

256
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,550
Goodness.

257
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,819
I'm so bad at this. I'm no help at all.

258
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,179
- Oh, never mind. - Gosh.

259
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,490
You were great. The problem is you were too great.

260
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,360
Really?

261
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,120
You really think I did a good job?

262
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,530
So it's true what they say. Right?

263
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,270
You know, when we do undercover work,

264
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,400
I've been told I'm a natural at this kind of thing.

265
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,139
Am I a natural actor or what?

266
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,909
Okay, let's do it again. Ready.

267
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,910
No, that's okay.

268
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,550
We're good. That's more than enough.

269
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,610
We're good.

270
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:03,909
No, I've got it now. I can do better.

271
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,220
Alright. "Then promise me one thing."

272
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,049
"That you won't leave and you'll wait for me until..."

273
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,220
Stop!

274
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,160
You're getting a call.

275
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,390
Right.

276
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,690
One second.

277
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,260
Yes, Dokgo Cheol speaking.

278
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,030
I praise him a little, and he really thinks he's a star.

279
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,510
And what's with that look in his eyes?

280
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,680
Okay. I'll head over right away.

281
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,180
It sounds like you're busy. You should get going.

282
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,450
No, it's okay. I can drop you off first.

283
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,850
I'm going to stay and practice more, so you go on ahead.

284
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,719
Oh, really? Then call me when you're leaving...

285
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,790
and when you get home. Promise me.

286
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,760
I was just getting the hang of it.

287
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,430
"So this is goodbye. Don't forget your promise."

288
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,630
Later then. I'll call you.

289
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,200
"Through the crack in the window..."

290
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,680
Excuse me.

291
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,150
I made myself clear, didn't I? Smile and be pleasant.

292
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,890
You do so well in practice, so why do you seem so stiff outside?

293
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll do better next time.

294
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,990
There are tons of trainees desperate for this chance.

295
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,030
Get it together.

296
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,410
Excuse me. You left this in the restroom.

297
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,380
- Thank you. - Do you want to grab a coffee?

298
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm still pretty new to the company,

299
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,520
and I don't really know anyone yet.

300
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,320
I was hoping we could be friends.

301
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,060
- I have to get to practice soon. - I see.

302
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,860
Well, maybe we can talk sometime later, then.

303
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,599
You know, we can talk about things we can't say out loud at work.

304
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
It's always nice to have someone to vent to.

305
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,670
Riley.

306
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,670
What is it?

307
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,110
I should get going.

308
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,190
There are tons of trainees desperate for this chance.

309
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,190
Do you really not know who made the movie investment?

310
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,730
I wasted the feast placed right before me.

311
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,400
Pathetic, aren't I?

312
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,570
No. That feast would've made you sick.

313
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,010
Forcing yourself wouldn't have been worth it.

314
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,410
No matter what others say,

315
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,220
nothing beats a simple, comforting home-style meal.

316
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,490
Don't you agree?

317
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,660
I wonder how he's doing.

318
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,530
He must be so old by now.

319
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,710
So he was fine when he fell asleep, then suddenly had a seizure?

320
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,919
Is the cell really so crowded that no one would notice a man die?

321
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,450
No, it's actually pretty spacious for the number of inmates.

322
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,219
Now that I think about it, wasn't Kang Dae Gu...

323
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,089
the last one to be placed in that cell?

324
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,860
So the other guys in there must be close, then.

325
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,760
- The guards don't track that. - Right.

326
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,630
I guess I can just ask Kang Dae Gu myself.

327
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,700
Has he regained consciousness?

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,770
Oh, yes. Thankfully, he's out of the woods.

329
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,470
The medical staff says he should be regaining consciousness soon,

330
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,440
so please let his cellmates know. They must have been worried.

331
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,550
- Yes. - Okay.

332
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,850
- All right, then. - Take care.

333
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,400
Goodness. Your batting average is awful.

334
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,560
Right?

335
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,200
How do you manage to whiff it every single time?

336
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,250
Does that wench have several lives?

337
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Or are we the ones with all the bad luck?

338
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,590
Are we in a race to the grave? Darn it!

339
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,599
While you have all your limbs, don't make your guys do it.

340
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,300
You have to finish the job yourself. Okay?

341
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,929
(Bong Dumpling Shop)

342
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,200
He may be your father. But to me, he killed my father.

343
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,870
Gosh, time is a scary thing. How has Lim Se Ra changed?

344
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,769
I saw her the other day, and she looked like she's had work done.

345
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,839
That's what money gets you.

346
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,209
- Procedures, surgery, you name it. - I heard she's totally broke.

347
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,049
I heard she married into the yakuza. Maybe she got washed up and dumped?

348
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,120
Wasn't she a chaebol's trophy wife? She's back now the money is gone.

349
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,190
Pathetic.

350
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,630
Is Lim Se Ra a piece of fruit? What do you mean, "let herself go?"

351
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,300
- Has this old lady lost it? - Who are you calling an old lady?

352
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,170
I'm way younger than you. Has this old lady gone senile?

353
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,130
Hey, what part of me looks like an old lady?

354
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,069
Shut it and get out. All of you, get out!

355
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,970
Seriously, are you crazy?

356
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,239
(Welcome.)

357
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,580
(Come again.)

358
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,320
They don't know anything.

359
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,470
Se Ra. I'm here.

360
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,740
You haven't eaten?

361
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,110
Se Ra.

362
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,550
Se Ra.

363
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,700
Se Ra. Please eat something today. It's already summer.

364
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,669
It's hot, isn't it? I'll put the fan here for you.

365
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,270
They're saying it's the first snow. Dad's parole hearing is soon.

366
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,179
I believe in you, Se Ra. You can get back on your feet.

367
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,010
Everyone is waiting for you.

368
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
Se Ra.

369
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,990
My college entrance exam is next week.

370
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,320
I really want to see you that day.

371
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,140
You should have asked me to come. Give it to me.

372
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,940
It's good exercise for me. I probably burned 50 calories.

373
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,280
You must be tired, driving all the way to Busan.

374
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,580
Don't worry. It's part of the job.

375
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,319
I've got a neck pillow, drink, and snacks.

376
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,479
I've got everything ready.

377
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,880
So you can just relax on the way.

378
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,950
All right, let's go.

379
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,560
Gosh. How long has it been since I've been to Busan?

380
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,330
Twenty-five years?

381
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,070
Are you talking about that police station in Busan you mentioned?

382
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,800
The gukbap I had back then was amazing.

383
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,610
Should we go have some when you're not filming?

384
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,720
- Is it still there? - I think so.

385
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,580
I'd love that.

386
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,720
I've actually always wanted to try the noodles at the place next door.

387
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,490
I see.

388
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,730
Why that noodle shop?

389
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,900
It's just one of those things.

390
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I see.

391
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,440
It's me. Yes.

392
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,470
What?

393
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,940
What are you talking about?

394
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,450
What happened?

395
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,719
He apparently had a seizure. We've checked the CCTV footage.

396
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,089
And besides the medical staff, no one went in or out.

397
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,160
Really?

398
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,500
If they're willing to pull a stunt like this, they'll stop at nothing.

399
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,670
From now on, this will be treated as the Kang Dae Gu murder case.

400
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,700
What about the body?

401
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,170
I'll handle the National Forensic Service,

402
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,839
so investigate all the medical staff in Kang Dae Gu's room last night.

403
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't leave anyone out.

404
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,360
(Busan Station)

405
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm so sorry. Something urgent just came up.

406
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Don't worry. The train was fast and comfortable.

407
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,170
This urgent matter is not something dangerous, is it?

408
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,840
It isn't. There's nothing to worry about.

409
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,940
I'll handle it quickly and head right down.

410
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,250
Don't worry about the shoot. Just focus on your investigation.

411
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,180
Catching the culprit is what's important.

412
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,150
I'll make it there today. Be careful until I arrive.

413
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
Okay.

414
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,420
Here's that file you asked for.

415
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,259
I've compiled all the information on people...

416
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,530
around Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan.

417
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,170
It turns out Assemblyman Min Guk Hee is tied to an entertainment agency.

418
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,399
("Assemblyman Min Guk Hee Caught in an Entertainment Gangster Scandal")

419
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,170
- Could it be an actress? - Nothing was officially reported.

420
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,180
The management agency that brokered the deal was Lim Se Ra's.

421
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,750
"Lim Se Ra?"

422
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,420
I met a horrible man today.

423
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,260
Actually, there's a movie I wanted to be in.

424
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,390
("The Sad Voice")

425
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,960
I scrapped it.

426
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,530
(Kang Du Won, 46)

427
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,320
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

428
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,120
"I'm sorry this is all..."

429
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,830
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

430
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
What was that?

431
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,910
Is he here already?

432
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,350
You're...

433
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,060
Whenever I saw your face through that crack in the window,

434
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,700
I felt like I was back in the only happy moment of my life.

435
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,970
What is it? Are you going to hold my hand?

436
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,610
I'm sorry this is all I can do for you.

437
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
You're already doing enough.

438
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,950
You're here by my side.

439
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,090
You haven't left me.

440
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,000
"You're already doing enough. You're here by my side."

441
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,160
"You never left."

442
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,370
Oh, I'm sorry. Where were we?

443
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,110
Oh, right here.

444
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,680
Right here. It's from here.

445
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,280
Right. Thank you.

446
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,280
You must be tired, but you're still running lines.

447
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm the one who asked you.

448
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,790
Should we go again?

449
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Okay.

450
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,700
High accident area ahead. Please drive safely.

451
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,660
Excuse me. Mr. Manager.

452
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,270
Do you want to get a drink with me?

453
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,040
We have an early shoot tomorrow. We should probably call it a night.

454
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,680
You never know. A drink might loosen our tongues.

455
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,220
It's just one drink.

456
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,760
When I make a promise, I keep it.

457
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,270
Come on. Just have one drink.

458
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,180
Fine. If you insist, I'll have one.

459
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
Gosh. What's this?

460
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,150
Gosh. This looks like the expensive stuff.

461
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,380
Nice.

462
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,820
I'll have one more.

463
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,460
Are you really just a manager?

464
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,989
I mean, what kind of a manager...

465
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,030
would get on his knees for an actress?

466
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,470
You just don't strike me as the manager type.

467
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,970
So what's the deal with you two?

468
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,170
Since you brought it up, let me ask you something.

469
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,280
I heard CEO Kang Du Won used to be your manager.

470
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,620
What's your relationship with him?

471
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,590
Where did that come from?

472
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,290
It's just that I saw you two before, and you seemed very close.

473
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,759
Us? We're practically family.

474
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,370
Inseparable.

475
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,470
For people to get that close, something must have happened.

476
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,170
Like surviving a brush with death together,

477
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,839
or sharing a deep trauma,

478
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,680
or maybe covering up a secret for the other.

479
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,820
You're not wrong.

480
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,649
We almost hit rock bottom together.

481
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,890
We were both scarred by it.

482
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,760
And we buried a secret together.

483
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,730
What secret was that?

484
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,910
If I told you, it's not a secret.

485
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,320
Come work for me.

486
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,120
I'll double whatever Lim Se Ra is paying you.

487
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,490
Is that the thing you couldn't say while you were sober? Is that all?

488
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,760
What do you mean, "Is that all?"

489
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,700
Financially and for your career, working with me is a better deal.

490
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,170
After 10 years, you get a feel. After 20, you can see the future.

491
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,710
I can tell just by the look in your eyes.

492
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,080
You didn't become a manager just to be under someone, did you?

493
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,620
A man with no ambition...

494
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,990
is so unattractive.

495
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,790
If I have ambition, that's why I work with Ms. Lim Se Ra.

496
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,919
What?

497
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,430
I took this job in the first place because of Lim Se Ra,

498
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,000
so there's no reason for me to get involved with you.

499
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,700
- If that's all, I'll be going. - No, wait!

500
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,739
You're not going to leave a drunk woman here all alone,

501
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,849
are you?

502
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,050
I'm drunk.

503
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,750
So drunk.

504
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,720
Gosh. I'm so drunk.

505
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,289
- Get in, quick. - No, this...

506
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,560
Seriously, why did you drink so much if you had such low tolerance?

507
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,300
Use your legs. Stand up straight.

508
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,630
Wait. Come on.

509
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,300
I can't believe you drank this much.

510
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,240
Hey! What floor? Hurry up and press it.

511
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,940
Take a guess.

512
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,680
Gosh. Seriously.

513
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,790
It's not what it looks like. This is a misunderstanding.

514
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,690
Wait.

515
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,860
Wait.

516
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,230
I was wondering why you were so late,

517
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,700
but now I see why.

518
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,369
No, it's not what it looks like.

519
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,829
Excuse me. Explain this, please.

520
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,600
Seriously.

521
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,169
- Wait. Excuse me. - Life is good

522
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,640
Let's get another glass of whiskey.

523
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,980
- Whiskey. - "Whiskey?" Come on.

524
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
Darn it.

525
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,450
I'm going to lose my mind.

526
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Gosh.

527
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,370
I've been set up, haven't I?

528
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,770
Seriously!

529
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,239
Driving drowsy is dangerous, so make sure you rest on the way.

530
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,770
Is everything okay?

531
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,170
I'm getting worried, so please text me back.

532
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,650
Do I answer her?

533
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,050
Wait.

534
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,820
She was fooling around with Won Ban, too. I'm not doing it.

535
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,869
Cut! Okay.

536
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,040
- Are you okay? - Here you go.

537
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,370
Oh, thanks.

538
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,570
Here. Let's eat this together.

539
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,810
Gosh.

540
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:10,150
This one's for you. Here you go.

541
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,850
I've never seen such beautiful lunchboxes.

542
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,790
Gosh. I can't take the credit for this.

543
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,050
It's all thanks to my amazing fans.

544
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,989
- Hello. - Won Ban!

545
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,090
- We love you! - Thank you.

546
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,060
You have such a way with words.

547
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,030
You haven't changed a bit.

548
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,170
Neither have you, Se Ra.

549
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
You're exactly the same.

550
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,510
As pretty and radiant as ever.

551
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,820
Excuse me for a second.

552
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,990
- What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything.

553
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,860
- I just saw you take a picture. - No, I didn't.

554
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,329
Come on. Give it to me.

555
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,870
Hey. This is an invasion of my privacy.

556
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,640
You're already violating privacy laws. Now let me see it.

557
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,310
Who do you think you are, Mr. Loner? Are you a cop or something?

558
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,920
This is unbelievable. Do you think if you glare at me,

559
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,750
I'm going to get all scared and just hand it over?

560
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,460
A candid shot of Lonely Dokgo Cheol.

561
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,860
He just got owned. This is hilarious!

562
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,069
Won Ban has already got his eye on her.

563
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,400
It's game over.

564
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,410
You think this is funny?

565
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,780
- Gosh. - You know they had a scandal.

566
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,950
- "A scandal?" - Yes.

567
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,320
People always say those scandals are fake.

568
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,130
Come on. Where there's smoke, there's fire, right?

569
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,800
Even my scandals were true.

570
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,470
Gosh. You're really something else.

571
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,500
I heard Won Ban chose this project only because of Lim Se Ra.

572
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,270
No way. Why would Won Ban do that?

573
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,879
Besides, that was ages ago. Why is this still a topic?

574
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,820
Come on. First loves are like wine. You just don't get it.

575
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,690
- Her first love? - Yes.

576
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,559
That's why he's still single even though he is a top star.

577
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,489
There has to be a reason.

578
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,229
A first love she can never forget...

579
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,300
is seared deep into her heart. None other than Lim Se Ra.

580
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,930
Are we in a drama?

581
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,700
"Seared deep into her heart?" As if.

582
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,639
But I'm still your fan, Mr. Loner. I mean Mr. Dokgo.

583
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Keep up the good work!

584
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,240
The sea hasn't changed in 25 years.

585
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,940
I told you, I'm not hungry. I had a huge lunch.

586
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,010
I'm not surprised.

587
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,480
That was no lunch. It was a hotel buffet.

588
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,480
Gosh. You saw that?

589
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,150
You two were sitting so close, all chummy.

590
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,920
It was kind of hard to miss.

591
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,260
Goodness. When were we sitting so close?

592
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,060
And who was holding someone so tight last night?

593
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,830
That's right. You were.

594
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,940
Wait. That was part of the investigation.

595
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,900
Oh, my. Look, we're here.

596
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,510
(Best Pork Gukbap)

597
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,850
How has this place not changed at all?

598
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,720
My gosh. Even the sign is the same.

599
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,500
- Help yourselves. - Thank you.

600
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,400
Thanks.

601
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,369
She hasn't changed a bit.

602
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,770
- It tastes the same, too. Try it. - Oh, right. The spicy paste.

603
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,909
Stop. For pork gukbap, you start with the clear broth.

604
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,750
Okay. Instead of the spicy paste...

605
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,220
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

606
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,990
That's why you need to add only a bit of salted shrimps.

607
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,320
Here. You have to season it with salted shrimp. Now, try it.

608
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,630
There.

609
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,640
Go on. Just try it. Trust me on this.

610
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,310
Okay.

611
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,150
Yes, this is it.

612
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,650
Is it good?

613
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,030
- Hey. - Hey.

614
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,060
- You go first. - No. Chung Ja. You go ahead.

615
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,700
- About last night... - Wait.

616
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,140
Let me explain last night first.

617
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,310
Okay? I was drinking with Go Hui Yeong.

618
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,610
You were drinking with her?

619
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,189
Well, we didn't start drinking together.

620
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,550
I just happened to join in halfway through...

621
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,529
That's unbelievable. I was waiting for you to come home.

622
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,359
Wondering if something was wrong, I was up all night and got no rest.

623
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,870
And during all that time, you were drinking with Go Hui Yeong?

624
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,869
- Gosh. - Let's be honest.

625
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,709
You didn't lose sleep because of me. You were too busy chatting away...

626
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,740
with that Won Ban, or Won Pan, or whatever his name was.

627
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,080
You think I don't know?

628
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,049
We were just practicing lines.

629
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,319
"Practicing lines?" What a convenient excuse.

630
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,349
Goodness.

631
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,550
Then I'll just say I had a little 1-on-1 drinking session, too.

632
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,119
Practicing lines sober...

633
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,259
and clinging to someone drunk. Are those the same thing?

634
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,030
"Clinging?" What do you...

635
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,469
So should I have abandoned a drunk woman in the middle of the night?

636
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,429
You looked like you were enjoying it plenty...

637
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,599
when Go Hui Yeong was leaning all over you.

638
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,999
Gosh.

639
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,069
- Gosh. Now I suddenly need a drink. - "A drinking session?"

640
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,539
- Excuse me. Bring us some soju. - Okay.

641
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,849
No. There's filming tomorrow. We can't drink.

642
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,279
Please bring it anyway.

643
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,519
Thank you.

644
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,320
Seriously, we have a shoot tomorrow.

645
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,990
You have a shoot. What is this...

646
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,120
The shoot isn't until this afternoon you know.

647
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,699
Practicing lines was just an excuse. You looked thrilled.

648
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,640
So was I practicing a kissing scene with him or something?

649
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,780
That's hot.

650
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,250
- A kiss? - And what if it was?

651
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,250
That's not okay. Right?

652
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,750
A kiss? Without telling me, your manager?

653
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,770
Darn it.

654
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,410
See? Look at that.

655
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,410
I can down a whole bottle of soju and still walk a straight line.

656
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,720
Sure.

657
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,520
Go Hui Yeong's always been like that.

658
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,430
You totally fell for her pathetic natural act, didn't you?

659
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,230
Fine. I was wrong. Are you happy now?

660
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,699
No, that's not it. I wasn't looking for empty words.

661
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,370
That's not the kind of apology I wanted to hear at all.

662
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,710
Look. I'm sincerely sorry.

663
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,180
No. From now on, I won't drink with anyone other than you, Chung Ja.

664
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,090
How's that?

665
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,920
I mean, you don't have to go that far.

666
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,060
- We're here. - Yes.

667
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,600
Here.

668
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,040
Bye.

669
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,839
- Wait. Hey. - What?

670
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,040
This won't do.

671
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,820
Tonight, I'm sleeping here.

672
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:48,060
Why insist on sleeping in my room? Our rooms are identical.

673
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,440
I don't see anything here.

674
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,620
Goodness. I knew you'd be here.

675
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,239
I see we've already met.

676
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,300
Right?

677
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,930
Hey. Why are you guys doing this?

678
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:51,950
Hey.

679
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,780
Who sent you?

680
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,850
It wouldn't do you any good to know.

681
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,920
- He doesn't care about us. - You...

682
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,730
Darn it.

683
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,270
Stop, you punk!

684
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,420
Stop!

685
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,430
Darn it.

687
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Hurry!

688
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,170
Okay. I just ran it.

689
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,570
You were right. It's a ghost car.

690
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,670
Anyway, I'm on it,

691
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,070
so I'll call you as soon as I get something.

692
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,610
Gosh. If I were on duty, I'd at least get overtime for this.

693
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,709
Why am I out of bed for this?

694
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,549
(CCTV Monitoring Center)

695
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,650
What?

696
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,420
That punk.

697
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,509
- Why is there a thief in the hotel? - Did they catch the culprit?

698
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,449
- They crept in. How scary. - Whose room was it?

699
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,479
If it was in the main building, it couldn't be a staff member.

700
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,749
- It could be an actor. - Wouldn't that be a bigger problem?

701
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,459
- Right. Was anything stolen? - What were the managers doing?

702
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,490
- Are you missing anything? - I don't know.

703
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,530
Tonight, I'm sleeping here.

704
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,430
Why insist on sleeping in my room? Our rooms are identical.

705
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,280
Oh, sorry about that. I should've left earlier.

706
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,610
- What happened? - Here.

707
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,150
- What do you mean? - Last night.

708
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,290
- Let's talk on the way. - Sure.

709
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Here you go.

710
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,130
Hello. We're going the same way. Can I join?

711
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,160
Where's your manager?

712
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,769
I don't get enough gigs to need one.

713
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,900
After their cut, I have nothing left.

714
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,840
Let's go. Let's get this show on the road.

715
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,940
Quick.

716
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:06,980
Hop in.

717
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:32,030
- You don't look so good. - I'm fine.

718
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,300
I just slept with the window open last night. I'm fine.

719
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,169
I overheard the crew talking earlier,

720
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,540
and they said something happened at the hotel last night.

721
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,910
Did something happen?

722
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,460
Are we close to the rest stop yet?

723
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,400
Just get some sleep.

724
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:16,509
Yes. Go lay low for a while.

725
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,119
According to recent polls on the upcoming Seoul mayoral election,

726
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,020
Candidate Min Guk Hee is the clear front-runner.

727
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,659
A former aide to Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan,

728
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,860
the party's former floor leader,

729
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,029
he inherited the assemblyman's seat and won three consecutive terms,

730
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,960
allowing Candidate Min Guk Hee to build a solid support base.

731
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,500
From now on, this watch belongs to you.

732
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,570
I'm passing everything on to you, my supporters and my donors.

733
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,150
Thank you.

734
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,350
I am Min Guk Hee, Candidate number seven.

735
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,350
Please put your faith in me.

736
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,620
For the citizens of Seoul,

737
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:04,689
I am prepared to give my all.

738
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:08,030
- Min Guk Hee. - Min Guk Hee.

739
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,940
(Manager Dokgo)

740
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,880
Did you get home okay?

741
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,650
Your voice sounds worse. Are you really okay?

742
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,820
I'm fine.

743
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,460
I'll...

744
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,390
I'll call you back later.

745
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,109
Starting now, all meat is 50 percent off!

746
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,109
- Come on over. It's 50 percent off. - It's 50 percent off.

747
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,110
Fifty percent?

748
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:56,739
- Meat is 50 percent off. - Meat is 50 percent off!

749
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,850
Fifty percent off meat?

750
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,279
- Here. - Here.

751
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,649
- Gosh. What is this? - Let me. I was first.

752
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,889
- You already got yours. Move. - What?

753
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,820
- What? - Move!

754
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,659
- Move over. - Goodness.

755
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,229
Starting now, for the next ten minutes,

756
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,759
we're having a 50 percent off sale.

757
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,030
- Here. - What are you doing?

758
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,999
- Is there more? - They have eels.

759
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,200
- Eeels? - Eeels!

760
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,800
They have eels!

761
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,510
I want eels.

762
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,520
Alright, one eel and two octopuses. I'll clean them myself.

763
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,689
- Okay. - Thanks. Hold on.

764
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,850
Yes. Two of them.

765
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,839
Yes. I'm sorry, but I'll have to call you back.

766
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,910
I'm here.

767
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,110
- You're where? - At your house, Detective.

768
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,220
You came all the way here? Why?

769
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,820
You got hurt because of me. How could I just ignore it?

770
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,530
I can't treat your wounds, but I can at least make porridge.

771
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,700
I'm telling you, I'm fine. Seriously.

772
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,229
Open the door.

773
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,799
What? You're already here?

774
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,439
I'm right outside your door. Hurry up!

775
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,740
This is really heavy.

776
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,139
Just a second! Hold on.

777
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,280
You must be in too much pain to even move.

778
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,110
Then just tell me the passcode.

779
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,080
You stay put, and I'll let myself in.

780
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,620
No, that's not it.

781
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,020
Come on. Hurry. This is really heavy.

782
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,390
Well...

783
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,189
It's 0728. I'll be right out.

784
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,230
Hello?

785
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,200
Zero, seven...

786
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,280
I dedicate this award...

787
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,420
to 0728, who gave me great strength and courage.

788
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,320
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

789
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,719
For pork gukbap,

790
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,459
- you start with the clear broth. - You need to add salted shrimps.

791
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,760
You have to season it with salted shrimp. Now, try it.

792
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,930
Isn't Busan your hometown?

793
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,370
How did you know?

794
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,070
To all the people expecting the old Lim Se Ra,

795
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,680
the way I am now must be such a disappointment.

796
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,980
Back then and now, you seem the same to me.

797
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,320
I'm glad you're okay.

798
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,490
I mean it.

799
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,220
Okay. I'm coming.

800
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:43,900
(Epilogue)

801
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,440
Excuse me, Mr. Manager. Would you like a drink?

802
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,010
Thank you. Yes.

803
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:56,110
Are you really a manager? I thought you were one of the actors.

804
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,250
"An actor?" No way.

805
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,310
You could have fooled me.

806
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,849
Because you're so handsome.

807
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:03,320
- Gosh. - I know.

808
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,249
Goodness. Look at Mr. Dokgo. He's so popular.

809
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,660
- My goodness! - I look better than Won Ban, right?

810
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:09,920
- Way better, totally! - Yes.

811
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,289
- Thanks. - Se Ra.

812
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,759
All the female staff are going wild for him,

813
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,060
from young to old.

814
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,500
Good grief. You'd think he has his own fan club.

815
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,040
He's just loving this.

816
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,080
Oh, yes. Did you need something?

817
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,680
I could really go for a coffee.

818
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,049
Okay. I'll run to the convenience store nearby and grab you one.

819
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,180
No, not convenience store coffee.

820
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,920
On the way to the set,

821
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,190
I saw there was a coffee shop at the edge of town.

822
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,820
Right. Yes.

823
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,929
I'll go then. Yes.

824
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,390
- Gosh. He's handsome. - Goodness.

825
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,000
Wait. You're sending him to a place that is 20 minutes away,

826
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,070
just to buy you a coffee from a cafe?

827
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,070
I just got a sudden craving for coffee from that shop.

828
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,340
- Oh, is that right? I see. - Yes.

829
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,009
It's not because you hate to see him talking with the other female staff,

830
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,080
would it?

831
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,810
This is just how I am. Did you forget?

832
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880
I guess I must have.

833
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,950
Here you go.

834
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,860
I figured it's hot out, so I got you an iced coffee.

835
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,160
- Did you run all the way for this? - Well...

836
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,560
- Gosh. Look at you sweating. - I'm fine.

837
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,330
Mr. Dokgo.

838
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,770
- Do you need coffee? - Yes?

839
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,630
- Coffee. - Hold on.

840
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,600
- Excuse me? - Gosh. My legs are killing me.

841
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,340
- There isn't even a chair. - Oh, no.

842
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,879
Hold on a second.

843
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,949
I'll get you a chair right away.

844
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,950
- Hold on a second. - I'm fine, really.

845
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,549
- He's pretty good-looking. - Oh, my gosh.

846
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,319
Why is the manager so handsome?

847
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,819
Right. He's more handsome than Won Ban.

848
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,959
That's what I'm saying. He could be a secret actor.

849
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,529
- He might be about to debut. - Are you sure he hasn't already?

850
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,260
Right. It's my first time seeing him.

851
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,240
(My Troublesome Star)

852
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:42,740
There's really nothing? Nothing you've hidden or lied about?

853
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,250
- What? - I heard Won Ban liked Se Ra best.

854
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,350
What is this?

855
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,549
I won't let my daughter ruin her life,

856
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,450
trying to become a celebrity like you.

857
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,860
Hey. I want to make the debut team, just like you.

858
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,860
Where did Da Hee go?

859
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,930
Don't make a move on your own.

860
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,360
- Help me! - Da Hee!

861
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,100
Aunt!
