00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,340
Don't shake your head. You shed dandruff.

184
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,020
Who has dandruff?

185
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,730
Look, look. What dandruff?

186
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,800
- Look.
- Gosh, you stink like a musty single dad.

187
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,610
What are you talking about? What smell?

188
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,690
I smell good. Geez.

189
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,370
I'm single. Don't call me a dad.

190
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,030
Gosh, you were a lonely old man.

191
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,360
How pitiful.

192
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,050
What are you if I'm a lonely old man, Ms. Im?

193
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,190
Geez.

194
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,250
Do you acknowledge that I'm Im Se Ra?

195
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,180
You keep saying you are.

196
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll just call you that. It doesn't cost me anything.

197
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,400
You believe me, right?

198
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,290
Yes, yes. Let's say that. Okay.

199
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,520
Let's see how it looks today.

200
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,230
Shit. It dropped again.

201
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,310
Why does this company keep going down? Seriously...

202
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,370
What?

203
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,520
I...

204
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,470
was in...

205
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,130
that sky until yesterday.

206
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,500
I was shining up there.

207
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,560
But when I woke up in the morning,

208
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,540
as if I fell like a meteor,

209
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,870
I was at the bottom.

210
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,680
The rock bottom, even.

211
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,990
You saw it earlier, right?

212
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,210
Everyone called me a thief.

213
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,390
That turned out to be a misunderstanding.

214
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,160
The old Im Se Ra would've put them in their places.

215
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,340
Why did you come?

216
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,840
Pardon?

217
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh, right.

218
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,740
I checked the CCTV.

219
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,510
I don't think the person who lured
you was trying to hurt you.

220
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,720
What was it, then?

221
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,340
I think he was spying on you.

222
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,200
Who was? Who would spy on me?

223
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
So, I was wondering,

224
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,580
did you have strange records or
unfamiliar numbers on your phone?

225
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,030
Or notes that you took?

226
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,160
I looked through everything.

227
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,910
There are no photos, call records,
or voice recordings.

228
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,450
It's suspiciously clean.

229
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,350
Be careful for now, just in case.

230
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,700
Don't be out alone late at night.

231
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,310
Who could this person be?

232
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,630
Wow. That was really Im Se Ra.

You'll hear back.

241
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,320
You obviously look like a celebrity.

242
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,330
What are you talking about?

243
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,680
You have different blood.

244
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,990
And get your eyes done, too.

245
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,040
That's what they do.

246
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,300
- Are you finished?
- I ate enough.

247
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,820
Hey.

248
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,930
Could we talk briefly?

249
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,360
Let's go. I'll carry that. Come.

250
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,580
Do you know why Baek Ja... I mean...

251
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,960
do you know why your mom hates me so much?

252
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,490
This is awkward, right?

253
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,540
I want to ask her directly,

254
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,140
but she won't answer my calls.

255
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,620
She ignores me when I visit her.

256
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm frustrated, too.

257
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,080
I don't really know because
she doesn't talk about it.

258
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,320
Right? You don't know, either, right?

259
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,670
Yes. How could you know when I don't know?

260
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,330
She just said...

261
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,840
you ruined her life.

262
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,150
How about Grandpa?

263
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,880
Is he alive?

[Golden Life Nursing Home]

265
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,360
He said he had an older daughter,

266
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,890
but this is my first time seeing you.

267
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,200
He's been waiting for the day for you to come.

268
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,700
Sir, your eldest daughter is here.

269
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,920
Ms. Bong Cheong Ja is here.

270
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,150
Dad, are you out of your mind?

271
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,860
You said it was the last time.

272
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,540
You didn't sign as a guarantor, did you?

273
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,970
You're mistaken!

274
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,100
What about these, then?

275
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,780
You...

276
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,280
should've died early like Mom.

277
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,190
Cheong Ja.

278
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,810
Don't call me that!

279
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm so sick of it.

280
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,220
I'm sorry, but I really-

281
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,670
It'd be better if you didn't exist.

282
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,280
We'd be better off without you!

283
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,050
Who are you?

284
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,110
Gosh, don't be like that. She's your daughter.

285
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,080
Don't you remember?

286
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,090
No.

287
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,580
Go away. Go away. Go away.

288
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,260
My daughter is Im Se Ra.

289
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,680
You see her right there.

290
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,530
This lady isn't her.

291
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,660
It's Im Se Ra. Im Se Ra.

292
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,370
Hold on!

293
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,990
He's been behind in payments for a while.

294
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,790
Your sister has been paying several months' worth,

295
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,190
but too much has accumulated.

296
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,100
- Hello.
- Ouch...

297
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,120
Aigoo, you must be seriously injured.

298
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,770
Are you from the insurance company?

299
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,600
Did you break it or sprain it?

300
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,240
You little.

301
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,520
Who are you?

302
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,550
I'm here about the Obong intersection accident.

303
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,080
Oh, w-we met when the accident happened, right?

304
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,590
I was so out of it then.

305
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,050
The victim, who got hit on the road,
was discharged.

306
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,700
But the driver is in bed instead.

307
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,800
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

308
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,630
Well, I received a greater impact than expected.

309
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,830
You should've swerved to the right and crashed.

310
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,640
But the handle didn't turn correctly, right?

311
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,230
That's right. The angle was off...

312
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,500
I-I was so flustered that I injured myself like this.

313
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,590
But you weren't even drunk driving.

314
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,290
Your eyesight is fine, too. Why did you do that?

315
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,970
I told you during the interrogation.

316
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,400
- I fell asleep.
- Right.

317
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,060
You fell asleep. Right.

318
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,780
But you always drive at night.

319
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,180
Were you only sleepy that night?

320
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,230
Why are you doing this?

321
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,130
I admitted my wrongdoing

322
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,340
and the victim will be covered by the insurance.

323
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,070
What's the problem right now?

324
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,760
You got hospitalized a few days ago.

325
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,060
Much later, after the accident.

326
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,030
Did you have a reason to hide in a hurry?

327
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,060
For an alibi, maybe?

328
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,890
Geez. What the f*** are you saying? Huh?

329
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,500
All right, fine.

330
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,450
Why would you scream like that? Geez.

331
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,590
You... Wait right there.

332
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,660
Seriously.

333
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,280
Calm down. That's enough.

334
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,010
Rest.

335
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,850
I'm leaving.

336
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,040
Is he crazy?

337
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,630
Hold on.

338
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,650
What?

339
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,730
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes. What?

340
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,740
I wanted to take some drinks.

341
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,090
I paid for these, okay?

342
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,320
Take them all.

343
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,460
Okay, then. Thank you.

344
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,410
Take good care of yourself, then.

345
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,540
Is he crazy?

346
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,510
Okay. Here's a gift.

347
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,140
- Take a break.
- Thank you.

348
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,460
Has Ms. Bong been coming to her appointments?

349
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,060
She had an appointment today,

350
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,000
but she canceled it, saying she's busy.

351
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
I see. What's she busy with?

352
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,650
I think she works.

353
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,920
Isn't it too soon to work already?

354
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,620
Do traffic officers check on the
victims' treatment process these days?

355
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,500
Well, the thing is...

356
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,900
It might not be a simple accident.

357
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,230
I'm originally from the crime division.
I'm just helping now.

358
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,440
What is it if it isn't an accident?

359
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,460
I should look into it further.

360
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,620
- If you notice anything, you know what to do.
- Yes.

361
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,740
- I'll call right away.
- Bingo.

362
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,070
Yes, it's me. Why don't you come
to your appointments?

363
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,420
I've been busy.

364
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,230
Something came up, too.

365
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,880
Don't you want your memory back?

366
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,540
You need to be treated to get better.

367
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,690
- Where are you right now?
- I can't afford

368
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,410
to be treated at a hospital right now.

369
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,380
So, where are you?

370
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,360
I'll head over there now. Let's meet and-

371
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,350
Please leave me alone.

372
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,400
Is something going on?

373
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,180
Why did you call?

374
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,250
Well, I wanted to go to the
accident scene with you.

375
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,190
But we can go later if you don't want to now.

376
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,080
I don't want to, but I should.

377
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,010
To get my memory back.

378
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,820
What do you think?

379
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,960
Does it bring back memories?

380
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,590
Not at all.

381
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,370
What exactly happened that day?

382
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,440
[4 days ago at Obong Intersection accident site]

383
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, I was so tired that I dozed off.

384
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,450
I turned the steering wheel while braking.

385
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,360
Gosh, I didn't know there was someone there.

386
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,850
Did you drink, sir?

387
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,970
No.

388
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,820
I did the alcohol test. He didn't drink.

389
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,680
He fell asleep behind the wheel.

390
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,510
Where's the victim?

391
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,300
I'll send her to the hospital.

392
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,740
A witness called 911.

393
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,400
- A witness?
- Yes.

394
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,460
Where are they right now?

395
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm not sure because they left before we arrived.

396
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,430
Really?

397
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,250
Secured the dash cam first.
Did you call the insurance company?

398
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,340
Yes, they are on their way.

399
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,860
Okay. Get his statement at the station
and check the dash cam.

400
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,470
One person will stay and
take care of the scene here.

401
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,980
I'll visit the victim now.

402
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,720
Text me the address of the hospital.

403
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,380
Yes, got it.

404
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,290
Yes, I'm at the Obong Intersection accident scene.

405
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,210
Got a statement from the offender.
Officer Lee will transfer him.

406
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,920
I'll get a statement from the victim
at the hospital and write a report.

407
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,990
Okay, thanks.

408
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,300
Thankfully, she was moved
to a hospital ward. Yeah.

409
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,760
Okay.

410
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,680
I'll get her statement and go back.

411
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,520
You know me, right?

412
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,850
The celebrity, Im Se Ra?

413
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,660
That's pretty much what happened.

414
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,910
But this is far away from the student apartment.

415
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,270
It's far away from my work, too.

416
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,340
Why did I come here?

417
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,030
Someone might've lured you like the other night.

418
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,950
If so, the person who followed me

419
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,920
could've lured me and caused the accident?

420
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,390
No. Nothing is clear yet.

421
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,740
Why didn't you go to the academy?

422
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,040
I was going to tell you.

423
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,170
Yes, let's talk.

424
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,240
Why? What is it? What's going on?

425
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,440
I want to quit the academy.

426
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,240
I'm not good at studying, anyway.

427
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,680
Should a student study based on talent?

428
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,030
Studying requires talent, too.

429
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,070
They say 80% is genes. Don't you know?

430
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,030
You weren't good at studying.

431
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,520
So?

432
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,530
You'll become a celebrity or something?

433
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,510
Becoming a celebrity is a big deal these days.

434
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,400
Why, why... Why are you doing this, too? Why?

435
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,980
Y-You said it yourself.

436
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,670
That 80% is based on genes.

437
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,860
Look at me.

438
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,360
Celebrity? Yeah, right.

439
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,450
Is that the only reason?

440
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,590
What else do you need, then?

441
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,150
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

442
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,730
I'm talking-

443
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,760
I told you not to lock the door.

444
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,130
I'll unlock the door.

445
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,660
Y-You... You're dead once I unlock the door.

446
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,880
Where's the key? Huh?

447
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,980
No way.

448
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
You...

449
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,060
I did it, Mom!

450
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,250
What? What? What? Oh, my...

Let's call it a day.

454
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,890
It's gotten pretty late, too.

455
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,340
I wish I remembered something. I'm sorry.

456
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,770
Take your time.

457
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,230
Forcing yourself won't get your memory back.

458
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,530
Wait here. I'll bring my car.

459
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,790
Nation's top actress, Go Hui Yeong

460
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,080
became the first Korean actress to win

461
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,790
the Best Actress Award
at the 77th Cannes Film Festival.

462
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:58,000
Her refined acting skills captured
the audience from all over the world.

463
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,820
The complicated psyche...

464
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,220
This is the first time a Korean
actress has won an award

465
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,640
as the lead at a major international
film festival such as Cannes.

466
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,100
Go Hui Yeong was the nation's actress,

467
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,330
but now she's an international actress.

468
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,060
It was my dream to win at Cannes.

469
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,560
It was my dream.

470
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,330
You achieved your dream, Se Ra.

471
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,330
How does it feel to achieve your dream so quickly?

472
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,040
I haven't achieved my dream yet.

473
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,450
According to my research,

474
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,510
your childhood dream was to become an actor.

475
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,670
Yes, to become an actor. An international one.

476
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,650
You're halfway there, then.

477
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,140
I read this in a book.

478
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,790
If you visualize your dream or a goal,

479
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,750
it makes them more likely to be achieved.

480
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,450
Isn't it a known method called imagery training?

481
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,750
Yes. So, every night, I imagine myself

482
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,650
not only the youngest to win
a Best Actress award in Korea

483
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:06,550
but also the first Korean to win
the Best Actress Award at Cannes.

484
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,080
Should we send a video letter, then?

485
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,350
To your future self who achieved that dream.

486
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,830
Pardon?

487
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,030
Se Ra,

488
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,810
it's probably 2020... I mean,

489
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,260
2025 by now.

490
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,410
I'm sure you achieved your dream.

491
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,710
Because you always work for your dream.
