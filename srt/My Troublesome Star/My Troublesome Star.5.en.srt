00:00:02,531 --> 00:00:05,261
(Year 1999)

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,601
(Police)

3
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,111
(Uhm Jung Hwa)

4
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,480
(Song Seung Heon)

5
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:22,811
(EL, Oh Dae Hwan)

00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,291
(Cha Chung Hwa, Hyun Bong Sik, Jo Yeon Hee)

7
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:37,931
(My Troublesome Star)

8
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,430
(Production Sponsors)

9
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:40,900
(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and KOCCA)

10
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:41,901
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

11
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:42,901
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

12
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:43,941
(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

13
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,611
Ma'am.

14
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,651
Let go of me.

15
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,381
Your husband will be home soon.

16
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,521
I told you to let go.

17
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,591
- Did she really slap her?
- Cut.

18
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,191
That looked so real.

19
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:10,401
It's been a while since I slapped anyone. I'm losing my touch.

20
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,261
Director Ju. Let's try this again.

21
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:16,431
I might have clenched my teeth too hard when I shook off her hands.

22
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,841
Didn't you see some wrinkles?

23
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,501
I think it looked good.

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,311
Okay.

25
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,011
Let's roll again.

26
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,481
Let's try again.

27
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:31,921
Ma'am.

28
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,521
Your husband will be home soon.

29
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,791
I told you to let go of me.

30
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,421
Cut. Okay.

31
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,990
That was great. Let's go to the next scene.

32
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,701
No. Let's do it again!

33
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,901
I think it looked good.

34
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,271
Let's do it again.

35
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,031
We'll do it again.

36
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,801
Let's roll again.

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,041
I told you to let go!

38
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,711
That crazy...

39
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:54,940
Don't do anything.

40
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,510
Let go. That lunatic...

41
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:58,080
- keeps on doing that.
- My gosh.

42
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,580
She's divorcing her husband, so she's a little sensitive.

43
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,610
Again?

44
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,520
But why is she taking it out on Chung Ja?

45
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,521
Let go!

46
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:09,751
Cut.

47
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:13,891
I think we have enough takes for this scene.

48
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,661
I haven't been on a roll like this in a while.

49
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,201
Let's try one last time.

50
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,731
One last time.

51
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,001
Unbelievable.

52
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,801
Hui Yeong. We really have to get going now. It's time.

53
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,981
Let's go. That's enough.

54
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,091
Get up.

55
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,731
What are you doing here?

56
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,761
Come on.

57
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,871
Who are you?

58
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,731
- What are you doing?
- I should be asking you!

59
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,141
What is this?

60
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,780
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

61
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,851
Wait. I'm not done with my scene.

62
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:11,681
You just approved the take, right?

63
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,551
Then you're done. Come with me.

64
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:17,761
- Hold on.
- Just come out already.

65
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:19,361
Wait.

66
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:20,561
Who is he?

67
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,601
What are you doing right now?

68
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,841
I should be asking you that. What are you doing?

69
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,111
Acting?

70
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,011
Haven't you learned your lesson even after that accident?

71
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,341
Besides,

72
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,811
you want to restart your career just to be treated like this?

73
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,051
That's because...

74
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,451
this is the kind of treatment I deserve for now.

75
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,591
Exactly, my point. Let's just go.

76
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,461
Don't put up with this humiliation any longer.

77
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,361
I didn't expect to be treated well when I decided to come back.

78
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,530
I'm Bong Chung Ja right now, not Lim Se Ra.

79
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,001
If I lose this opportunity,

80
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,101
I'll end up as an extra, waiting for another chance...

81
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:06,701
not knowing how long it will take.

82
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,711
If I leave like this now,

83
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,881
my career is over.

84
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:22,850
- We filmed this scene.
- Yes.

85
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,061
Director. I'm sorry.

86
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,820
I'm really sorry.

87
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:27,991
I thought you left.

88
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:31,261
I can't leave first when my senior actress is still here.

89
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,370
Let's wrap up here for the day.

90
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:38,700
- Clean up.
- Okay.

91
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,271
- Good work.
- See you tomorrow.

92
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,241
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,281
This is why I don't want to work with no-name extras.

94
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,381
Where are your manners?

95
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,081
How dare you leave the scene before me?

96
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,321
As for the guy from earlier...

97
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,951
He's...

98
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,161
He's my manager.

99
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,391
He was overly motivated.

100
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:08,101
Managers are as good as the actresses they manage.

101
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,841
How dare he raise his voice so rudely at the shoot?

102
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:12,841
Well...

103
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,940
I'll talk to the director and redo the scene.

104
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,181
As if you have any power.

105
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,881
Ms. Han.

106
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:37,661
Let's go.

107
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,871
Why did you come all the way here?

108
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,741
It sounded like there was something you wanted to discuss on the phone.

109
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:46,971
We can talk on our way.

110
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:48,971
Chung Ja.

111
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:50,910
Chung Ja, that must've hurt a lot.

112
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:52,641
Oh, no. Put this on your face.

113
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,281
Gosh, that was a tough scene.

114
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,721
Thank you for your help.

115
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,881
It was you who did all the work.

116
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:02,420
Your face is puffy because of the weight gain.

117
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,551
Now, it's puffier.

118
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,061
- My gosh.
- It was me who did all the work.

119
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,531
You drive me crazy.

120
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,930
Bong. You've been away from the industry for a long time,

121
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,161
so you must've forgotten some things.

122
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:13,461
You had to get slapped anyway,

123
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,171
so you should've gone down properly in the first take.

124
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:17,971
Do you know how much time we wasted because of you?

125
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:21,771
Who are you?

126
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,211
Well...

127
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,181
Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,380
I'm Bong Chung Ja's...

129
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:30,521
He's my manager.

130
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,321
I thought I might be busy,

131
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:36,991
so I got myself a manager.

132
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:38,990
Oh, my.

133
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,630
How do you know if you'll be busy or not?

134
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,291
Why did you hire a manager already?

135
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,530
So you were her manager. Oh, my.

136
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,931
Even a meeting like this must be fate.

137
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,630
This calls for a get-together.

138
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:49,930
Chung Ja had a tough day today.

139
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,340
- Let's go and have a get-together.
- No.

140
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:52,800
- Let's drink away this day.
- No.

141
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,770
- Drown out today with a drink.
- No. I...

142
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,940
- No. Let's not do this.
- Let's go.

143
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,640
- My gosh. Let's just go.
- No.

144
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,410
- Listen.
- I'll buy you a drink.

145
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,181
I'm not coming unless it's an omakase meal.

146
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:03,951
My gosh.

147
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:05,951
So we can place an order with this?

148
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,251
It's like living in a new world.

149
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,761
Chung Ja, I'm buying today. Order everything you want.

150
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,231
Are you sure you lost your memories?

151
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,231
You weren't in a vegetative state for 25 years.

152
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,801
Are you putting on an act?

153
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,301
Why would I do something like that?

154
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,210
- I really don't remember anything.
- Your order has been placed.

155
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,841
It's frustrating for me too.

156
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,111
How did I end up like this? What kind of life did I lead?

157
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,121
Who knows? You might have been happy.

158
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,420
You used to be so skinny. Seeing how chubby you are,

159
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,721
your life could've been better than you think.

160
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,290
- Tae Sook.
- Yes?

161
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,960
Can I beat up your husband?

162
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,661
Chung Ja. Come on, he's still my husband.

163
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,061
Let me beat him up.

164
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,700
Seriously. Why would you say something so silly like that?

165
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:54,730
- Bye.
- What?

166
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,600
- You're leaving?
- Please excuse me.

167
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,800
- My gosh.
- I'll get going.

168
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,270
I'm sorry. This is our first meeting.

169
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,370
But we were too busy talking about our old days. How rude of us.

170
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,940
And you're not going anywhere.

171
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,180
Join us on a good day like today.

172
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,580
I forgot to take out my laundry from the washing machine.

173
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,710
You didn't take out your laundry. You can wash it again.

174
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:09,150
It's going to smell even if you hang it now.

175
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,450
Sit back down. She had her first shoot today.

176
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:12,681
Come on.

177
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:16,721
I'm Min Tae Sook.

178
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,561
I'm the closest thing Chung Ja has.

179
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:21,830
You couldn't find her for over 20 years.

180
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,631
If you're the closest thing she has, then...

181
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,430
You must know who I am since I'm quite famous.

182
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,431
I'm Gu Nam Ju.

183
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,101
I'm Dokgo Cheol.

184
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,541
Even your name is so cool.

185
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,470
I was so surprised earlier.

186
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,741
What was that at the shoot? Come on. Seriously.

187
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,951
You grabbed her wrist and pulled her out.

188
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,611
I thought I was watching a drama.

189
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,451
What's your relationship with her?

190
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,921
I told you earlier. He's just my manager.

191
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,161
Why does an extra need a manager?

192
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,531
- Are you guys dating?
- Right?

193
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,331
Did you guys move in together when she disappeared?

194
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,460
Right? Aren't I right?

195
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,731
- Never.
- Never.

196
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,441
Right, that can't be true. He's way out of her league.

197
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,670
Come on.

198
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,571
Hey, Gu Dae Pal.

199
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,011
Don't call me by my real name when we're out.

200
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,640
How dare you call me by my name, Bong Chung Ja.

201
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,040
How dare I?

202
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,110
You called me by my name.

203
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:15,450
How dare you point your finger at me?

204
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,580
My gosh. They used to fight like this all the time.

205
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,381
They always fought whenever they saw each other.

206
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:22,191
They seemed to get along well in the drama back then.

207
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,021
Is that so? My gosh.

208
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,761
Hey, I'm a celebrity.

209
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,431
By the way,

210
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:30,730
have we met before?

211
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:32,501
- You guys have met before?
- Hold on.

212
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,341
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

213
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:38,641
Mr. Dokgo.

214
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,571
Isn't Busan your hometown?

215
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,751
How did you know?

216
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,251
See? You had to be from Busan.

217
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:52,881
Your accent gave it away.

218
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:54,651
You're speaking standard Korean,

219
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:56,750
but your Busan accent slips in at the end.

220
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,621
I know because my mother's hometown is Busan.

221
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,391
I thought I had fixed my accent. But you can tell?

222
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,760
I had no idea.

223
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,431
You're really not from Seoul?

224
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:10,300
Now that I think of it, you have quite a bond with Busan.

225
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:12,871
Remember how you went to the police station in Busan?

226
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:15,511
My gosh, why would you bring that up?

227
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,741
Do you know any detectives from police stations in Busan?

228
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,521
I can't think of anyone. I moved to Seoul a long time ago.

229
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,751
Is something wrong?

230
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,790
Chung Ja was interested in this detective from Busan.

231
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,191
It's ancient history, though.

232
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,560
My goodness. What are you talking about?

233
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,890
I was never interested in the detective.

234
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,090
Come on. I think he was a rookie detective.

235
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:38,601
He was totally your type.

236
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,970
Not at all. Seriously, he wasn't my type.

237
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,331
He could never be my type.

238
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,701
I get that he wasn't your type, but you don't have to emphasize.

239
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,341
I guess he was far from being her type.

240
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,110
Let's be honest.

241
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,681
If the detective asked you out, you would've said yes. Right?

242
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,480
My career was at its peak back then.

243
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,281
Why would I go out with a rookie detective?

244
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:59,421
Have you lost your mind? My gosh.

245
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,751
He had absolutely no clue how to dress.

246
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:05,361
And his face was so tanned as if it were stained with dirt.

247
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,261
Stained with dirt?

248
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:10,331
That's how tanned he was.

249
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:11,400
That wasn't all.

250
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:14,101
Whenever he opened his mouth, he spoke with that hideous accent.

251
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,071
My gosh.

252
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,370
Why would the national queen, Lim Se Ra,

253
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:23,411
date someone like him unless she was shot in the head?

254
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:24,611
Don't you agree?

255
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:25,681
Sure.

256
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:27,910
You sure must think so. Don't you?

257
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:28,911
Seriously.

258
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:31,121
Whatever you're imagining, imagine the worst.

259
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,881
I guess this had never crossed your mind.

260
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,621
That the rookie detective...

261
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:39,261
might not have liked you first.

262
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,661
Right.

263
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,931
We must respect the detective's opinion too.

264
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,701
It was clear that I was way out of his league.

265
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,731
How could he ever turn me down?

266
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:51,471
Well, you must consider the detective's type too.

267
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,641
You see.

268
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,541
I'm everyone's type.

269
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,911
I mean, I was.

270
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,551
If I were that detective,

271
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,891
I wouldn't like Lim Se Ra.

272
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:13,191
I mean, I wouldn't have then. That's all.

273
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,570
You two make a great couple. What a beautiful pair.

274
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,001
Stop talking nonsense. Just get in.

275
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,840
Chung Ja, we should go for another round.

276
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:29,540
- We should sing a duet.
- Just go.

277
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,540
Never hurt other people like this again

278
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,880
- It's enough that you hurt me - My gosh.

279
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,111
- We'll get going first.
- Okay.

280
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:38,451
Chung Ja!

281
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,551
- Sir, let's go.
- Chung Ja.

282
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:44,861
Let's go.

283
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,261
Whatever.

284
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,231
Use the other door.

285
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,640
Gu Nam Ju used to be so handsome back in the day.

286
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,411
My gosh, time did a number on him.

287
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,581
Oh, dear.

288
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,991
So that's where it was. It's my precious supplement. Gosh.

289
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,691
I sat on it.

290
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,131
It's all the same once it goes down.

291
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,101
Do you want it? Should I split it?

292
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:26,831
Forget it.

293
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,331
Suit yourself.

294
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,971
It seems you can stomach pretty much everything.

295
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,541
But I wonder why you particularly hated Lim Se Ra.

296
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,581
I can stomach anything,

297
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,051
but I have a nasty temper to wait on the queen.

298
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,280
Gosh, your breath stinks.

299
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,521
Look that way when you talk.

300
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,291
What? Why?

301
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:51,861
What was that?

302
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:54,561
Come on.

303
00:13:58,831 --> 00:13:59,861
By the way,

304
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,201
The woman from earlier, Tae Sook. Is she trustworthy?

305
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:04,700
Of course.

306
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,141
She's like my sister.

307
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:10,341
We lost touch for a long time, and I don't hold it against her.

308
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,580
Tae Sook must have been busy, trying to make a living.

309
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:14,711
It must have been tough on her too.

310
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,951
Don't trust anyone for now.

311
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,891
Are you suspecting Tae Sook?

312
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:23,721
I understand that you two are close,

313
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,921
but don't trust anyone until you get your memory back.

314
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,391
Anyone could be the culprit.

315
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,401
What were you going to say earlier?

316
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,941
Later.

317
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:41,871
It must've been important for you to have come to the shoot.

318
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:43,871
What is it?

319
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,740
Didn't you say you'd get me...

320
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,651
the witness's contact information from the Obong Intersection Case?

321
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,310
But I couldn't reach the witness, so when I checked,

322
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:51,451
it was a burner phone.

323
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,251
If I leave like this now,

324
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,121
my career is over.

325
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,891
I'll tell you once things get better.

326
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,421
What were you going to say earlier?

327
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,051
Later.

328
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,051
I'll tell you once things get better.

329
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,091
What did he want to talk about?

330
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,661
Curiosity is driving me crazy.

331
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,201
Stop!

332
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,671
You need to chop both the carrots and potatoes.

333
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,501
You've been chopping only carrots.

334
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,941
I was too focused.

335
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,681
Did a few days away from work give your brain a break too?

336
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,151
Well...

337
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,621
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something.

338
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:04,421
This will be my last month here.

339
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,420
Don't tell me...

340
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,391
you're quitting because you have too many carrots to cut.

341
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,431
Gosh, no. It's not about the carrots.

342
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,301
I'm making a career change.

343
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,430
- What? A career change?
- What are you talking about?

344
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,640
- You can't leave.
- What are you going to do?

345
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,940
- You can't quit.
- This is so sad.

346
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,141
If I have to skip work again like last time,

348
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:28,051
I'll be an inconvenience here.

349
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:29,680
I wanted to take this opportunity...

350
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,151
to pursue what I really wanted to do.

351
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,720
- Gosh.
- We should congratulate you.

352
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:36,790
But you should still stay. This is a very good job.

353
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,690
- Right.
- You should reconsider.

354
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:39,791
- Where are you going?
- Seriously.

355
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,371
What have you been up to?

356
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,301
Have you been following a celebrity?

357
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:52,571
Give them to me.

358
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,371
Hey, you've turned into a stalker fan now?

359
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:58,381
I'm not a stalker fan. I'm investigating.

360
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,181
Being a stalker fan sounds better.

361
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,650
You're a traffic cop. Just issue tickets.

362
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,380
Why are you investigating?

363
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,821
If you're free, go and make me coffee.

364
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:06,681
Yes, sir.

365
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,491
If she's been a target for 25 years,

366
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,261
the culprit is most likely from her close circle.

367
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,721
Rewind back to the beginning.

368
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:49,391
Could you rewind to before these two cars appear?

369
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,360
Could you send it over to my phone?

370
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,561
I want all the footage from the past week through today.

371
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,301
- Hello.
- Can I watch the CCTV footage?

372
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,370
The footage hasn't been saved for a while.

373
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,410
Is that so?

374
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:03,411
(Under surveillance)

375
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,640
(No Parking or Stopping)

376
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,411
Can I check the CCTV footage?

377
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:10,611
You look great now.

378
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,281
How beautiful.

379
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,951
This is excellent.

380
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,321
- All right. Good work.
- Good work.

381
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:22,091
- Great job.
- She's the best.

382
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,360
- She's the best.
- Amazing!

383
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,230
- The Queen of Cannes is the best.
- Gosh, stop it.

384
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,800
- She's the best actress.
- Good work.

385
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,331
- Thank you.
- You're the best.

386
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,600
- Great work.
- Gosh, you look beautiful.

387
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,170
- Let's clean up.
- Sir.

388
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,641
- Let's check it.
- That's great.

389
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:37,711
Tell Mr. Kang not to book photo shoots with magazines.

390
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,481
Do you know how difficult it is to stick to my diet for this?

391
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,981
When I do printed ads, I at least get paid a lot.

392
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:44,850
But you can capture...

393
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,350
your beautiful moment with photo shoots.

394
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,991
Tell him to book only commercials or photo shoots abroad for me.

395
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:50,850
I want a sense of mystery with my image,

396
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,221
so I don't want to come across as redundant.

397
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,731
You have a meeting with the director of an environmental documentary.

398
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:56,761
Cancel it.

399
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,401
Right. What about the renovation? Did you tell him?

400
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,701
I told you I'd make that happen.

401
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,001
Get a sponsor for the renovation.

402
00:19:05,741 --> 00:19:06,970
To maintain a sense of mystery,

403
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,911
she said she'd never reveal her house.

404
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,140
And for the next photo shoot, she wants to go to Paris...

405
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,511
to emphasize her award from the Cannes Film Festival.

406
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,781
- She asked for a private plane.
- You punk.

407
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,221
Filter out what you report to me.

408
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,951
A private plane?

409
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:22,521
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Sir.

410
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:25,521
This is an urgent matter. Could you approve of this?

411
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:31,361
She said it was the cost of the rookies riding her coattails.

412
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,830
When she was a rookie,

413
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:35,531
she benefited from the same system. Darn it.

414
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,001
What about the environmental documentary?

415
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:38,600
She's been painting herself...

416
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,341
as an environmental enthusiast on social media.

417
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,070
How does she plan on getting out of this commitment?

418
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,741
What do you expect me to do?

419
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,141
What?

420
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:47,951
Right. What should we do?

421
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,951
Come on.

422
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,051
("Jewellery Store Girl")

423
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,020
You have the leading role.

424
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:00,560
Go Hui Yeong has a supporting role.

425
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:01,690
You were afraid I might say no,

426
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:02,760
so you left that part out on purpose.

427
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,491
Se Ra.

428
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,631
Not even Lim Se Ra was that low.

429
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,611
I'll contact the documentary's director.

430
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:15,811
Off you go.

431
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,241
Yes, sir.

432
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:18,811
Bye.

433
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:20,810
Once you submit your parents' form,

434
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:23,651
you're 2ONE Entertainment's trainee from today.

435
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:26,181
Make sure you behave in public.

436
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,851
Didn't I tell you?

437
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:32,661
Training is not allowed without parental consent.

438
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:35,731
If your parents are overseas, don't you have relatives here?

439
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:38,231
Well, I do have an aunt.

440
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:39,961
- A maternal aunt?
- Yes.

441
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,531
Have her sign it.

442
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,211

It's 4829.

445
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:03,350
Make sure to verify within...

446
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:04,860
five minutes to mark your attendance.

447
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:05,990
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

That's it. Good girl.

452
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,011
Enjoy.

453
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:27,540
Ma'am.

Your husband will be home soon.

458
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:35,050
- I told you to let go of me.
- Ma'am.

460
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,121
Ma'am.

461
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:39,121
- Yes?
- I asked for more pickled radish.

462
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,561
It says "self-serve" in big letters here.

463
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,101
Stay put. I'll get it for you.

464
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,611
What do you think? Don't you look younger than before?

465
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,311
I contoured your jawline to make it slimmer.

466
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,380
When I make it big,

467
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,780
I'll pay you back for all the makeup.

468
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,780
Pay me back? What are you talking about?

469
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,021
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

470
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:13,621
"A debt of gratitude?"

471
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,231
Come on.

472
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:21,831
Remember? You took me in when I was nothing...

473
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:23,901
and helped me grow.

474
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,171
Thanks to you, I've come this far.

475
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,241
Right. You were a total baby back then.

476
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:33,811
But now, you've grown up enough to watch over me.

477
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:36,911
Se Ra, you'll bounce back in no time.

478
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,621
And you're going to achieve even more than before. Got it?

479
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,061
This time,

480
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,791
I'm going to give it my all.

481
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,471
Dismissed from my role?

482
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,101
It just happened. You don't have to come anymore.

483
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:01,871
Wait.

484
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,141
The director liked my acting.

485
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,711
Either way, I delivered the message.

486
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:08,811
No, wait.

487
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,351
But I already quit my job.

(Recruiting Talent to Lead GBS)

489
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:23,361
I heard you got fired.

490
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,600
Why'd you have to get on the main lead's bad side?

491
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,301
Can't you tell right away who's in charge on site?

492
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:35,771
No way.

493
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:38,811
Did I get fired because of her?

494
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,941
Did you lose your sense along with your memory?

495
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,380
So why did you have to act up?

496
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,821
- You...
- Are you sure?

497
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,680
Is that really the reason I got fired?

498
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,651
If so, are you going to wreak havoc?

499
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,191
I won't back down like this.

500
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,191
Especially when the reason is unfair...

501
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,091
and not because of my poor acting.

502
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,801
I won't quit.

503
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,440

who played the housekeeper in the drama.

505
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:16,211
May I talk to the writer, please?

506
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,981
She's busy writing. You can talk to me instead.

507
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:23,191
It's not something I can talk over the phone.

508
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,721
Then send it by text.

509
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,761
Hello?

510
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:30,561
What a rude wench.

511
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,001
Why is it so hard to meet the writer now?

512
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,571
They used to beg to have a meeting with me.

513
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,851
They fired you? What are you talking about?

514
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:51,651

Don't go empty-handed. Settle the matter at any cost.

517
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,490
They were killed a long time ago.

518
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,091
What do you expect me to do now?

519
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,191
The body's already buried.

520
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,361
Did I say we should kill them?

521
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,571
Since we've already killed one,

522
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,871
I told you the next one needs to look like an accident.

523
00:26:09,691 --> 00:26:12,501
Keep this up, and I might just lose it.

524
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,671
I'll kill everyone without thinking twice.

525
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:30,951
I didn't hear a thing.

526
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,121
I really didn't.

527
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,991
I heard nothing.

528
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:37,621
The call just now...

529
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,260
Stop. Don't come closer.

530
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:42,861
No, stop. I won't let you kill me!

531
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:50,131
I'm terribly sorry.

532
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:53,501
I had no idea you were the writer and made an awful mistake.

533
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:55,771
Make yourself at home.

534
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:57,441
There's no need to kneel for me.

535
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:02,811
I saw you in the drama.

536
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,851
It wasn't all that good, was it?

537
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:12,491
I liked it.

538
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:19,201
Actually, the director did too, on set.

539
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:21,971
I felt bad about it.

540
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:26,671
You were dismissed because of me.

541
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:30,211
- What do you mean?
- I changed the script.

542
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,041
The housekeeper had more scenes.

543
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:35,351
But the main lead got mad about it.

544
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,751
Knowing what happened...

545
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:42,391
makes me feel even worse about what I did to you.

546
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,561
There's no need for you to apologise.

547
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:48,531
The one who should apologise...

548
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:52,461
is the TV station that keeps forcing trashy storylines all the time.

549
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,741
How about I pour you a glass?

550
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:11,981
Even right now, my drama is full of absurd plots.

551
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:15,951
The cheating husband, the nasty wife,

552
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,951
a murder, and a revenge plot.

553
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:22,191
What more am I supposed to add?

554
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,871
Rather than bringing a dead character back to life,

555
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,830
wouldn't it be better...

556
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:33,671
to make a new one that's more well-rounded?

557
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:35,811
"A new one?"

558
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:39,511
The husband was not the only one having an affair.

559
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:43,011
Even the pretentious wife was cheating on her husband.

560
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,251
You mean Ms. Han's role?

561
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,820
Come on.

562
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:49,421
An affair on both sides isn't even considered that extreme anymore.

563
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:51,691
But that's not all.

564
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,091
Turns out,

565
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:56,031
the housekeeper...

566
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:00,101
is actually the secret daughter of the husband...

567
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,761
and his mistress.

568
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:04,371
To get revenge on the wife,

569
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:06,471
she disguised herself as a housekeeper.

570
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:09,971
But isn't the housekeeper a little bit too old for that?

571
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:12,341
Even a mole is enough to change you.

572
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,911
Plastic surgery isn't a big deal.

573
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,621
The daughter had her face done...

574
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:20,351
to look old and ugly.

575
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:22,921
Won't I get criticized for going too far?

576
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:26,291
That's what a soap opera is for.

577
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,091
What's this? A lover?

578
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:32,461
Better than just a guy who plays guitar, isn't it?

579
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,901
- You owe me one now.
- Director Ju.

580
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,441
Director Ju!

581
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,701
This wasn't in the synopsis.

582
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,671
Does this sudden development even make sense?

583
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:45,910
You know it's common for the plot to change...

584
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,181
and for new details to be added while filming.

585
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:50,781
That woman.

586
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:52,581
Wasn't she fired?

587
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:53,981
Why is she back here?

588
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,420
It's weird for her to disappear out of the blue.

589
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,521
The writer probably wants the scenes to connect more naturally.

590
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:01,291
How frustrating.

595
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,681
I'm innocent, okay?

596
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,681
We have no relationship whatsoever.

597

Let's see what your dashcam has to say about that.

598

Sorry. I overdid it.

Yes, I'm fine.

604
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:47,170

605
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,311
I love how lively it is. It feels almost alive.

606
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,810
The scenes do look more energetic.

607
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:55,481
How about we turn up the intensity in the next scene?

608
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:57,051

609
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,050

00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,471
"Kwak Jung Do?"

720
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,600
- It sounds familiar.
- A four-time convicted criminal.

721
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,341
His most recent offence was aggravated assault.

722
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:28,940
Kwak Jung Do of the Silver Axe Gang, right?

723
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:30,711
He's in Pilseung Gang now.

724
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,141
"Pilseung Gang?"

725
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,781
Pilseung Gang as in...

726
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:37,781
Ju Seung Pil?

727
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,230
It's not a serious meeting.

728
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,701
All you need to do is put on a smile. Okay?

729
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:25,231
What?

730
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:43,911
Are you looking for something?

731
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:45,881
Well...

732
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,881
I need to use the restroom.

733
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:49,251
There's one in the room.

734
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:51,491
Right.

735
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:53,890
It's number two.

736
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,361
- I see.
- Yes.

737
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,491
Go straight down the hallway to the end, then turn right.

738
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:01,201
- Thank you.
- Of course.

739
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:18,881
This isn't the parking lot.

740
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:21,920
Did you get lost,

741
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:24,251
or were you really headed here?

742
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:26,691
This isn't the place.

743
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:29,291
I need to use the restroom.

744
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:31,091
But the building is just huge.

745
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,501
- Take him there.
- Yes, sir.

746
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:35,871
Great.

747
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:37,871
Bye.

748
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,311
Shouldn't we get rid of him?

749
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:44,611
Leave him be.

750
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,441
He's just a traffic officer.

751
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:00,121
My gosh, Chung Ja.

752
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,321
Chung Ja, are you all right?

753
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:02,931
My goodness.

754
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:08,031
- What happened?
- My gosh, Chung Ja.

755
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:10,900
You collapsed during your shoot.

756
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,300
You should lie down, all right?

757
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,100
I didn't even push her that hard.

758
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:16,710
At this rate, you're going to get someone killed on set, you fool.

759
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,240
- That hurt.
- It hurt?

760
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,581
How dare you say that in front of Chung Ja?

761
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,641
It's not Nam Ju's fault.

762
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:23,380
Didn't he push you during the shoot?

763
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,151
Isn't that how you ended up with a concussion?

764
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:28,221
I remembered something at that moment.

765
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:33,621
Then I suddenly got dizzy. I think that's why I fell.

766
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:35,490
Right. The doctor said...

767
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,430
that it did not appear to be caused by external trauma.

768
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:38,690
See? I told you.

769
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:41,560
It's all thanks to me. The memory came back because I pushed you.

770
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:44,301
My gosh, Chung Ja. What do you remember?

771
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:46,901
Before that,

772
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,641
I want to ask you something.

773
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:53,881
Me?

774
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,381
Yes.

775
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:57,951
Okay.

776
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,951
Here. Drink this, Chung Ja.

777
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:07,191
What's up?

778
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:10,061
Don't trust anyone for now.

779
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,631
I understand that you two are close,

780
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:15,631
but don't trust anyone until you get your memory back.

781
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:17,771
Anyone could be the culprit.

782
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:21,541
There's something...

783
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:23,941
I've wanted to ask you ever since we met again.

784
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:25,610
What's there that we can't talk about between us?

785
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,681
What is it?

786
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,211
That day,

787
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:31,381
why was I left by myself?

788
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,281
- What?
- Twenty-five years ago,

789
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,451
on the day I got into the accident.

790
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:38,691
Oh, that day...

791
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,921
You mean the day you won Best Actress at the awards ceremony?

792
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:43,490
I don't know about other people,

793
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,991
but you were always by my side.

794
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:48,131
You even tagged along to the restroom with me.

795
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,631
So why was I alone back then?

796
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:54,041
The truth is, that day...

797
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:56,111
(Lim Se Ra)

798
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:58,640
When I was on my way to the van after leaving the waiting room,

799
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,911
carrying your flowers...

800
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,741
Hey, Tae Sook. Wait.

801
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:07,380
We're throwing a surprise party at Se Ra's place today.

802
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:09,180
- A surprise party?
- That's right.

803
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:11,151
So you should go there on your own.

804
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,621
Am I preparing the party?

805
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,891
Yes, so make sure everything looks nice.

806
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,091
She'll be so surprised.

807
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,231
She could open a flower shop.

808
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,470
I was told we were throwing a surprise party at your place,

809
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:28,271
and that I should go there on my own to get things ready.

810
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:31,110
I thought everyone else was in the van.

811
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:33,541
I really had no idea you were alone in the car.

812
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:36,811
I excitedly went to your place and started preparing for the party.

813
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:38,881
But then...

814
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,250
- Early this morning, - I saw on TV...

815
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:43,290
- a van carrying Lim Se Ra...
- that you'd been in an accident.

816
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,490
- collided with...
- I was so shocked.

817
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:46,691
a five-ton dump truck.

818
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:48,821
As a result of the accident, Lim Se Ra was rushed...

819
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:52,291
My sister must've been there too.

820
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,631
Your little sister, Baek Ja?

821
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:57,831
(Intensive Care Unit)

822
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,601
(Central Surgery Center)

823
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:02,711
Baek Ja.

824
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,661
What did you mean earlier when you said you remembered?

825
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:24,631
You said you remembered something before the accident.

826
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:28,131
Yes. About a month before the accident,

827
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,531
I think I met someone back then.

828
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:32,531
Who?

829
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:37,371
That I don't remember, so I don't know who it is.

830
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:40,841
But that person was wearing a watch.

831
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:43,181
"A watch?"

832
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,981
It's your fault!

833
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:54,991
The watch was unique, so I remember it.

834
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:59,231
I know it's the exact same watch from back then.

835
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:09,441
So the man from 25 years ago showed up again?

836
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:10,741
But why?

837
00:44:11,111 --> 00:44:14,511
Twenty-five years ago, I got into the accident after meeting him.

838
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:16,451
And it happened again.

839
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:18,410
Then what does that mean?

840
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:21,721
That man could be the culprit who did this to you.

841
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:23,891
Who is this crazy jerk?

842
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:26,191
I'll find him.

843
00:44:26,921 --> 00:44:29,961
But how? You've lost your memory and don't even know his name.

844
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:32,491
Thankfully, there's someone who might know who that man is.

845
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,461
My gosh. Who?

846
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:37,831
Kang Du Won.

847
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,341
Kang...

848
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,411
I have to go. Bye.

849
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:47,411
No, wait. Chung Ja!

850
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:49,880
You're leaving now? Leave a little later.

851
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:51,380
I don't have time for this.

852
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:52,881
Then go with your manager.

853
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,521
My manager?

854
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:55,680
The one who came with you the other day.

855
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,791
Mr. Dokgo Cheol.

856
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:02,991
Who are you?

857
00:45:04,991 --> 00:45:07,801
Sorry, wrong room. My apologies.

858
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:13,001
(VIP Room, Patient)

859
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:16,911
Excuse me.

860
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:18,941
When were you admitted?

861
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,741
Two days ago.

862
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:22,781
I see. Thank you.

863
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,850
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

864
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,190
The car accident victim who was hospitalized in this VIP room.

865
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:32,491
When was the patient discharged?

866
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:36,761
Three days ago.

867
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,990
The patient originally planned to stay a while...

868
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:40,701
but suddenly insisted on going home.

869
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,001
I see.

870
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,341
The number you have dialled does not exist.

871
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:54,681
Please check the number and try again.

872
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:58,011
So I looked that person up in the system.

873
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:00,781
He didn't just change his number. He got rid of the phone altogether.

874
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:02,781
There's no new number.

875
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,091
I bet he got a burner phone. Yes.

876
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:07,060
Thanks anyway.

877
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,421
Check his home address and text it to me.

878
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:12,760
He's busy.

879
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,230
What do you mean he's busy?

880
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:16,170
He's your manager.

881
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:18,831
Also, do you think Du Won will meet you if you show up unannounced?

882
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:21,500
Do you think he'll kick out Lim Se Ra,

883
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,670
who's there to see him?

884
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:24,970
My gosh. Then let me tag along.

885
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:27,311
No. You've already helped me out so much.

886
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,981
It's really fine. I'm off.

887
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:31,151
Wait. What's this?

888
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:33,651
Yes. Hello?

889
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:36,051
Where are you? Hurry up.

890
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:39,521
Hey, where are you? I'm at C. How many times must I tell you?

891
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:40,861
My gosh!

892
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:42,691
Mr. Dokgo.

893
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:44,690
Yes, it's you.

894
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:47,000
- My goodness. Hello.
- Oh, hello.

895
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:49,101
How did you know to come here? Thank goodness.

896
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:52,030
Pardon? I'm here on business.

897
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:54,540
Right, you're not here because Chung Ja contacted you.

898
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,541
Gosh, what should I do?

899
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,541
Contact me about what?

900
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:00,141
She went to meet Kang Du Won, who used to be her road manager.

901
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,041
"Kang Du Won?"

902
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:03,580
Why all of a sudden?

903
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:05,910
It's really complicated, but it's urgent.

904
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,450
You must know too.

905
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:09,281
The biggest entertainment company in the country, 2ONE Entertainment.

906
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:10,891
"2ONE Entertainment?"

907
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:17,760
Come on. Don't just say no.

908
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,261
Please pass the message along to Mr. Kang.

909
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:21,761
You should contact him first.

910
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:25,070
But how can I contact him?

911
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:27,470
I called the company, but they won't let me through to him.

912
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,370
So how am I supposed to contact him?

913
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:31,411
If you keep being unreasonable like this,

914
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,981
we'll have no choice but to take legal action.

915
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:34,540
Sure, that's great.

916
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,581
A good friend of mine is a cop as well.

917
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,051
- Hey, lady! Stop!
- No, let go!

918
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:51,791
Seriously, you guys are making a big mistake now.

919
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:00,270
The thing is, she hurt her head during her shoot,

920
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:01,971
and she remembered something.

921
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,070
It seemed important,

922
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,471
so she went to see Kang Du Won to ask him about it.

923
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:20,461
(2ONE Entertainment CEO Kang Du Won, Leading the Entertainment Industry)

924
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,400
I mean...

925
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:36,471
My gosh.

926
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:39,980
Why do you think I'm asking you this?

927
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:43,181
Du Won and I are very close.

928
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:44,950
The moment he hears that I'm here,

929
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:47,821
he'll come running barefoot all the way from over there.

930
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:50,351
This isn't something we can do just because you're begging us.

931
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:54,991
Whatever! I'm just going to lie down here, so suit yourself.

932
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:59,390
The police will be here in five minutes if we call them.

933
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,500
So, stop making a scene and...

934
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:01,631
Police, here.

935
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:03,971
That was so fast.

936
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:20,421
Darn it.

937
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:26,790
This isn't trespassing,

938
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:28,261
and I vouch for this person's identity.

939
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:32,260
But meeting Mr. Kang without an appointment...

940
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,131
Right, so please give him a call.

941
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:37,231
He'll decide whether or not he wants to meet her.

942
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:38,931
Please.

943
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:46,541
Thanks for your help.

944
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:48,441
You don't need to thank me.

945
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,281
I have some business here too.

946
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:53,151
What business do you have with 2ONE Entertainment?

947
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:13,641
Who knew Lim Se Ra could get nervous?

948
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:16,541
Nervous? Please.

949
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:21,080
The CEO of this company used to work for me.

950
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:24,481
He was just a lackey who couldn't even look me in the eye.

951
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:25,911
Right.

952
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,790
You were a top star, a rookie cop like me didn't even dare to look at.

953
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,650
He was a mere road manager.

954
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:33,721
I doubt he could've even dared to have a 1-on-1 with you.

955
00:50:34,621 --> 00:50:35,621
Don't tell me...

956
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:38,531
you're being like this because I called you my manager once.

957
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:41,960
- What do you mean?
- That's what you're doing.

958
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:44,131
You've been making fun of me sarcastically ever since that day.

959
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,271
My goodness.

960
00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:47,570
How could a mere detective make fun of a top star like you?

961
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:48,941
Not a chance.

962
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:50,440
Good grief.

963
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:52,210
I made a big mistake.

964
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:54,410
I deeply apologise for mistakenly calling you my manager.

965
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:56,210
I apologise. Are we good now?

966
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:57,281
- Forget it.
- What?

967
00:50:58,511 --> 00:51:00,080
Never become my manager.

968
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:01,480
You'd better not volunteer for it.

969
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:03,121
I'm not even interested.

970
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:06,760
Just so you know, I was the one who declined first. Not you.

971
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,490
Even if you begged me for the job,

972
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:10,730
I still wouldn't want to give it to you.

973
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:13,531
Even if you beg me in tears, I won't do it.

974
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:17,031
That petty jerk.

975
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,051
Do you like that actress?

976
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:32,681
She looks familiar for some reason.

977
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,181
She's an actress. You must've seen her on TV.

978
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:12,751
("Jewellery Store Girl")

979
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:19,291
You know how, when you wake up from an endoscopy,

980
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:25,031
a good amount of time has already passed?

981
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:29,441
It felt like that when I opened my eyes at the hospital.

982
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:32,971
I just closed my eyes and opened them again.

983
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,281
For me, nothing had changed,

984
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:43,591
except that I had aged without accomplishing anything,

985
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:47,491
looking the way I do now.

986
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:01,371
He's waiting for you.

987
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,520
Oh, my gosh.

988
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:19,851
Is it really you, Lim Se Ra?

989
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:21,361
Gosh.

990
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:22,961
You've gotten so much prettier...

991
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:25,131
that I...

992
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,131
I could hardly recognise you.

993
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:30,071
Come here. How long has it been? Come on.

994
00:53:32,771 --> 00:53:34,401
I came to check something with you.

995
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,471
I'll go first.

996
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:37,411
The truth is, I wanted to meet you,

997
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:38,571
but you beat me to it.

998
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,011
You wanted to meet me?

999
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:42,711
Why?

1000
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,781
Can we talk in private?

1001
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,750
It's fine. Say it.

1002
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:52,391
It's a private matter between just the two of us.

1003
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:54,521
Who's he?

1004
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,230
He's my...

1005
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:00,231
I'm her manager.

1006
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:08,500
There's only so much you can investigate...

1007
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:10,240
while following a celebrity.

1008
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:12,171
You're a traffic officer now, not a detective anymore.

1009
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:14,540
To catch a shark, you need to go at least to the freshwater,

1010
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:15,710
if not the sea.

1011
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,380
But this place is just a well.

1012
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:20,651
All you can do is ticket some frogs.

1013
00:54:20,951 --> 00:54:22,221
Are you off to catch a frog?

1014
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:23,821
No, to catch a shark.

1015
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:27,591
Come on. Your manager? No way.

1016
00:54:29,691 --> 00:54:31,191
Is he really your manager?

1017
00:54:31,961 --> 00:54:33,801
The thing is...

1018
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,001
Yes, I am.

1019
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:40,141
So please contact me to speak with Ms. Lim from now on.

1020
00:54:58,851 --> 00:55:01,691
(Epilogue)

1021
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:07,001
(Busan Bunam Police Station)

1022
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:10,001
I was sure I had it memorized, but I'm confused now.

1023
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:11,930
Was it 011...

1024
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:13,071
No, was it 017?

1025
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:14,741
What do you need Won Ban's number for?

1026
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:16,041
Who knows?

1027
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:18,711
If I ever open my own shop, I might contact him to be my first client.

1028
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:19,971
Then, what?

1029
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:22,240
From actresses to singers,

1030
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:24,451
so many girls are in love with Won Ban.

1031
00:55:24,681 --> 00:55:26,110
So if Won Ban becomes my client,

1032
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:28,121
all those girls will follow like a chain of sausages.

1033
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:30,421
He's not really my type.

1034
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,421
What? If Won Ban's not your type,

1035
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:35,991
who is?

1036
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:39,891
Oh, Leonardo DiCaprio? Brad Pitt?

1037
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:41,631
I'm not attracted to pretty boys.

1038
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:45,601
Right. Since you're so perfect, who's your type?

1039
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:47,541
My type is...

1040
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:53,541
someone with sun-kissed skin that makes my fair skin stand out,

1041
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:58,281
hair that's just a bit rough to make mine shine more,

1042
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:01,681
a moderately masculine build,

1043
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:04,421
and intense eyes that seem to look only at me.

1044
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:08,421
Oh, here's the most important thing.

1045
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:12,331
Unlike my dad, who's a smooth talker and can come off as insincere,

1046
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:15,161
I like someone who talks a little awkwardly but warmly,

1047
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:17,971
with an honest voice...

1048
00:56:18,531 --> 00:56:19,831
and a down-to-earth manner.

1049
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:22,741
What's taking her so long?

1050
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:31,081
Se Ra. When you go out with a guy, you need to run him by me first.

1051
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:33,581
You're in no position to criticize my taste in men.

(Busan Bunam Police Station)

1053
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,501
Hello?

1054
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:50,031
It's me, Lim Se Ra.

1055
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,001
Yes, are you here now?

1056
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:53,641
I'm afraid...

1057
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:56,811
I don't think I can keep my promise.

1058
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,281
What?

1059
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:06,680
You said the rule was no makeup when going to the police station,

1060
00:57:06,681 --> 00:57:08,081
so why do you suddenly want to wear full makeup?

1061
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:10,991
I've done nothing wrong, you know.

1062
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:13,861
Excessive modesty can be perceived as rudeness.

1063
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:17,531
Where are the high heels?

1064
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:18,991
The ones our new brand sponsor sent.

(Busan Bunam Police Station)

1066
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:27,141
I'm here for questioning.

1067
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:28,341
- I see.
- Goodness.

1068
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,071
Even her voice is pretty.

1069
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,371
- Gosh.
- Sorry.

1070
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,931
I'll take you to the interrogation room.

1071
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,331
- Oh, my.
- Did you see her?

1072
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:01,801
Isn't she drop-dead gorgeous?

1073
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:05,441
Yes.

1074
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:08,281
Sorry?

1075
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,811
I don't find her that pretty.

1076
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:13,581
Is she really that gorgeous?

1077
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,281
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Goodness.

1078
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:17,190
- Hey.
- What?

1079
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:18,721
Watch where you're going.

1080
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:20,591
Yes, sir.

1081
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:06,531
(My Troublesome Star)

1082
00:59:06,631 --> 00:59:07,900
You're so successful.

1083
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:09,801
How come you didn't stay in touch all these years?

1084
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:12,441
How am I supposed to find someone who's gone into hiding on purpose?

1085
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:13,911
Do you think I'm a cop?

1086
00:59:14,811 --> 00:59:15,911
What are you after?

1087
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:17,951
Why did you drag Lim Se Ra into this?

1088
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:21,220
The world you want to return to.

1089
00:59:21,221 --> 00:59:22,821
I'm certain the culprit is part of it.

1090
00:59:23,621 --> 00:59:25,221
We were supposed to meet.

1091
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:27,021
You promised to pay me the settlement money.

1092
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:29,961
You guys need to shut your mouths and watch.

1093
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:33,431
It means these two car accidents can't be a coincidence.
