1
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,069
Hey, we have to go.

2
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,280
- Gotta go.
- quick!

3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,365
Everyone, hurry up and leave!

4
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,159
quick!

5
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,577
Go away!

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,494
Walk!

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,412
quick!

8
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,208
- Hey, go!
- Fuck you!

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,710
Let me go! Shit!

10
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,545
I have to kill that guy to get the money!

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,713
Get the fuck out of here!

12
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,100
You know, right?

13
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,312
Once pulled out

14
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,813
You will die

15
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,611
Fuck! It's over.

16
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,323
How do I clean this up?

17
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,873
I'm Han Seok-yoon from the Wide Area Investigation Team.

18
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
A murder occurred

19
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,584
The location is…

20
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,325
《Unforgiven Revenge》

21
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,536
(Ambulance)

22
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,997
Good hold on!

23
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,374
Turn around! Good!

24
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,587
Okay, put it down like this. Slow down and be careful.

25
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,631
Yes, put it down

26
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
Shall we retreat?

27
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,014
I guess they were all washed away by the water.

28
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
I want to withdraw too

29
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,687
But it says we must salvage it at any cost.

30
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,316
Maybe I'll check it out soon.

31
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,319
A report was received that a drowned body was found near Turtle Island

32
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,737
receive

33
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,071
Departure to Turtle Island

34
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,115
Go to Turtle Island! Remove the cranes too!

35
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,950
- Lift the blockade over there first!
- Set off

36
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,100
Doctor, we are on our way

37
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,645
Please prepare for rescue

38
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,366
He had an accident right after he killed Gu Junmo

39
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,327
Should I check again?

40
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,928
You know why I called you, right?

41
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,056
Let's meet

42
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,003
I'm sorry about Junmo.

43
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,433
Did you kill the benchmark?

44
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,185
What do you think?

45
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,857
The body of his only child lay before him

46
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,819
What do you think is going on in my mind?

47
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,656
Revenge, of course.

48
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,825
yes

49
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,619
Since you know

50
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,205
Why are you still doing this?

51
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,723
Squad leader Han took the money
Nam Ki-seok's case was tampered with

52
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,976
I traced the source of the money

53
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,813
It turns out that it is a shell company established by your company.

54
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,065
(Transfer record payee: JW Gallery)

55
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,067
Want to hear my speculation?

56
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,278
you…

57
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,241
I never intended to hand over the company to Nam Ki-seok from the beginning.

58
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,078
Instead, they wanted to get rid of Nam Ki-seok and put the blame on Jun-mo.

59
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,291
Then let Nan Ji-joon come and kill Jun-mo

60
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,375
at last…

61
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,421
Then kill the South Base...

62
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,595
Leave everything to your precious prosecutor son.

63
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,100
Is this the only thing you guessed?
Write a third-rate detective novel?

64
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,361
Right?

65
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,905
This is the Li Yun I know

66
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,283
We've known each other for so many years, yet you still don't understand me?

67
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,284
No

68
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,745
You don't understand me

69
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,790
Now

70
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,668
Jiyun and Fengshan

71
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,879
One of them must disappear for this matter to be over.

72
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,391
In this case

73
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,684
Then let's decide the winner

74
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,643
Why

75
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,272
What era is this? Still thinking about seeing blood?

76
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,149
What else can we do?

77
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,819
Do you just sit there and wait for death?
Waiting for the people from Fengshan to kill us?

78
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,573
Gu Fengshan has lost his mind

79
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
There's no way to reason with him.

80
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:40,538
(Fengshan Headquarters)

81
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
What is the situation now?

82
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,334
All available personnel have been notified
The meeting point has also been notified

83
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,421
(Fengshan Gang Headquarters)

84
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,672
Where is the president?

85
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,590
On the Road

86
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,924
Why choose this place to meet?

87
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,635
Hong Hyun-seok said he was afraid that the Jiyun Group would find out

88
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,012
So I chose a secluded place.

89
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,346
Hong Hyun Seok said that?

90
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,307
When did we in Fengshan start to be afraid of bad luck?

91
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,349
- who?
- Stop it!

92
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,267
Why!

93
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,811
- We are from the Prosecutor's Office
- Stand against the wall

94
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,233
Is everyone here?

95
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,443
Who are you?

96
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,738
This is a search warrant for violence and solicitation of murder.

97
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,573
I'll tell you the details when you get there.

98
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
I hope everyone will cooperate

99
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,659
Take all

100
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,952
Start from there

101
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,412
Can you bear the consequences?

102
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,330
Take all

103
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,374
How did you know we were here?

104
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,884
Our people were arrested.

105
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,971
The Procuratorate suddenly dispatched and we couldn't stop it.

106
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,515
Li Jiyun

107
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
This bastard started...

108
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,104
Please withdraw first, President.

109
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,328
Gu Fengshan!

110
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,537
He's over there!

111
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,374
damn it!

112
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,546
Prosecutors are launching a large-scale investigation into Fengshan Group

113
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,093
At the same time, we are looking for
Chairman Gu Fengshan disappeared during the investigation

114
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,552
When you execute a search warrant

115
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,513
If you wait a little longer

116
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,306
Then we can catch Gu Fengshan too.

117
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,852
You can't even control your time, right?

118
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:33,234
According to investigators
You arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled

119
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,737
Why? Was it your father who ordered it?

120
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,244
Your father asked you to do this to save his friend?

121
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,210
I'll put you in charge of this case.
You stabbed me in the back?

122
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,090
You wait
You must take off your prosecutor uniform this time.

123
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,552
Fucking gangsters

124
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,096
Didn't you tell me this before?

125
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,559
Let me prove which side I'm on

126
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
This is my answer

127
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,111
I'm really scared by you.

128
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,290
After Gu Fengshan, my father was next

129
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,791
(Search and seizure application Li Yiyun)

130
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,836
Are you ready?

131
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,088
Prepare?

132
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,550
From the day I first put on the prosecutor's uniform...

133
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,553
I'm ready

134
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,030
President

135
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,531
Um

136
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,951
Why didn't you call in advance?

137
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,788
You came so suddenly?

138
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,290
Well, here's the problem

139
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
When did it start

140
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,128
Only when you want to see me
Can I see you?

141
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,214
Why am I doing this?

142
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,634
Did something happen?

143
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,635
Um

144
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,137
You told me before

145
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,557
I am the one who can take charge of the situation.

146
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,062
11 years ago I had no choice but now it's different

147
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,815
right

148
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,775
I remember I said

149
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,236
But now I have no choice

150
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,492
Why did you do that?

151
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,577
Mr. Kim?

152
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,995
No, it's Cha Young Do

153
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,457
Wait a moment

154
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,840
You don't think I'm dealing with Fengshan Group, do you?

155
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,551
I'm not talking about Fengshan Group.

156
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,933
The money in my account was transferred away without my knowledge.

157
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,311
But this money was paid to squad leader Han

158
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,897
It wasn't long before Ki-seok was killed.

159
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,402
Squad leader Han was in charge of the case and closed it quickly.

160
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,073
As far as I know
There is only one person who can do all this.

161
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,577
That's why I ask you

162
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,954
Why do this?

163
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,795
President, there is a big problem with your statement.

164
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,967
Setting up shell companies and bribing police officers

165
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
Manipulating cases...

166
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,597
etc.

167
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,060
Can do these things
Not only me, but also another person

168
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,395
A person in the prosecution system

169
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,109
Why do you think
Isn't this person one of your insiders?

170
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,027
wrong…

171
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,781
You just want to think so, right?

172
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,702
If you really involve my son
I will smash your head

173
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,664
President, I heard someone say

174
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
As we age

175
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,712
People will believe more and more what they want to believe

176
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,426
President, take care

177
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,097
Take care of your body

178
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
Thanks

179
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,593
- Have you had lunch?
- have eaten

180
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,858
This is the thing you mentioned.

181
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,907
And Kisik's car keys

182
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,124
I changed the license plate
You can drive without worrying about being tracked.

183
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,261
Thanks for your hard work

184
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,930
Why

185
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,808
That bastard Gu Fengshan disappeared
It's such a relief.

186
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,729
All because of his stupid son
We have suffered so much.

187
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,522
Yeah, this bastard

188
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:09,069
By the way, raid on Fengshan Group
Could it be the idea of Li Yunyun’s son?

189
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,738
Who knows?

190
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,907
Maybe it's to make a name for himself

191
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,243
It may also be that Li Yun was behind this.

192
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,124
But who cares? What does it have to do with us?

193
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,880
- Hey, growing plants
- Um

194
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,803
Let's not think too much, okay?

195
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,305
- What do I always say?
- Um

196
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,307
The one who survives is the strongest

197
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,684
Look at the South Benchmark

198
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,644
Since this rubbish has retired from the business world

199
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,855
You should just shut up and live your life

200
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,483
He's still thinking about revenge.

201
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,152
What’s the point of dying no matter how powerful you are?

202
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,446
Yeah, fucking stupid.

203
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,617
So fucking stupid.

204
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,996
I spared his life before.
In the end, he died such a pathetic death

205
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081
I really don't understand

206
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,001
I want to talk to him

207
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,294
- Um?
- Private chat

208
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
OK

209
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,424
Fuck! Not bad.

210
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,428
At least say hello first.

211
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,477
Sit down

212
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,689
Who is it?

213
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,399
What happened again?

214
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,026
Kill my people

215
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,154
Hey, how would I know the benchmark?

216
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,200
Aren't you alive?
Since you are alive, how can there be someone to “kill you”?

217
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,619
- How would I know? Why...
- Check

218
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,330
Not begging you

219
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,166
It's giving you a chance to live.

220
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,880
Where are Chunxi and Binghao?

221
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,008
(Deceased: Choi Byung-ho and Kim Chun-seok)

222
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,387
I wanted to handle it my way.
But I always feel bad

223
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,306
So I helped them collect the body and hold the funeral.

224
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,434
Spent a lot of money

225
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,894
More than 14 million won

226
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,273
But never mind who pays.

227
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
These two fools

228
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,115
Do you have to live so handsomely?

229
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,245
Can't you just bow your head like me?

230
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,727
You are here

231
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,493
Do you have anything to say to me?

232
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,123
If it's Fengshan Group's business, I can't do anything about it.

233
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,960
This was planned by the top management.

234
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,962
I'm just following orders.

235
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,589
Have you met anyone recently?

236
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,468
who?

237
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
Cha Young-do

238
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
That is Mr. Jin

239
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,266
What did he tell you?

240
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,770
Did they ever tell you to join the industry?

241
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,150
Did I promise to let you sit in my seat?

242
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,781
Father, what are you talking about...

243
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
Father, you always say

244
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,293
There is no place for me in Jiyun Group

245
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
I see

246
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,673
I know very well

247
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,094
I honestly don't understand what you're talking about

248
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,764
I'm in my place
Do your best to do your own thing

249
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,518
And as long as you are still here, father

250
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,437
Nothing will change, right?

251
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,318
Take a break

252
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
parking!

253
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,683
The lucky person is here!

254
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,393
Son of a bitch!

255
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,939
The president's lucky guy is here

256
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,693
Please avoid it first.

257
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,949
I have been a bystander since President Wu died.

258
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,370
I always give the choice to others.

259
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,373
Don't get your hands dirty

260
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,167
So I can live till now

261
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,754
But I was so wrong

262
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,008
My hands are already dirty
And I didn't even notice it

263
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,885
so…

264
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,971
Since it's already dirty

265
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,475
Then just get dirty one last time

266
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,658
I'll stop them.

267
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,120
Take the president away

268
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,939
Why!

269
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,442
Don't move!

270
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,407
Why!

271
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,053
bring it on!

272
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,097
Come on!

273
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,438
Wait a moment

274
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,643
Get everyone out

275
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,533
Sorry

276
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,702
There's nothing to be sorry about.

277
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,542
The end of people like us...

278
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,505
That's how it should be

279
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,013
I'm just like you

280
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,558
Willing to do anything for the children

281
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,186
I hope you understand

282
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,649
Hang on.

283
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,611
You're almost there too

284
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,734
Let's go

285
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,950
Chairman Gu…

286
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,119
Really dead

287
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,079
Good, thank you for your hard work.

288
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,248
As agreed

289
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,293
From now on, Fengshan will be under the management of Director Hong.

290
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
Yeah

291
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,935
Did you see that? You should have behaved yourself a long time ago.

292
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,062
(Gu Fengshan and Gu Junmo)

293
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,401
(Lee Eun-woon, Nam Ki-seok)

294
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,616
(Li Yuyun)

295
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,827
Someone from Jiyun Group called me

296
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,371
Said he would shut down Fengshan Group and let me clean up the mess.

297
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,249
But something doesn't feel right

298
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,254
The Li Yun I know is not this type.

299
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,424
He has made up his mind

300
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,137
He has something to protect.

301
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,723
Even if it means killing Ju Fengshan,

302
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,832
Which one?

303
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,404
haven't seen you for a long time

304
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,248
How are you doing lately?

305
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,147
It's just as I expected.

306
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,274
You can't die that easily.

307
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,194
You probably have some questions for me, right?

308
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,446
President...

309
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,908
Did you order me to be killed?

310
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,787
Just like you, the president of the Killing Tool?

311
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,629
There is someone you don't know

312
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,386
If the current situation is caused by you

313
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,434
Then after you leave
He is maintaining and controlling this situation.

314
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,188
We call him Mr. Jin

315
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,105
Come in

316
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,742
Get to know each other

317
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,787
Please take care

318
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,457
This person was found by Chairman Wu through his police connections.

319
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,758
Senior Superintendent Che Yingdao's other information remains unchanged

320
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,261
He is responsible for providing internal intelligence to the police

321
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,598
Covering up our illegal activities

322
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,318
(Veterans Apartments)

323
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,828
At first, Mr. Jin had no ambitions.

324
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,122
- Have you got a meal yet?
- have eaten

325
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,050
- Hello
- Hello

326
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,888
Mr. Jin did not retire after Chairman Wu's death.

327
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,813
He gained a lot from staying with Fengshan and me.

328
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,316
(Mr. Kim's Secret Office)

329
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,736
Much more than when Chairman Wu was in power

330
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,792
But he was not satisfied

331
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,672
He preys on our weaknesses

332
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,634
Subtly manipulating us behind the scenes

333
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,595
but

334
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,180
That’s why

335
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,350
We have been able to maintain peace until now

336
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,022
But then…

337
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,776
I suddenly doubt

338
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,862
Then and Now…

339
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,035
The beginning of all this may not be the benchmark you
Mr. Kim

340
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,705
Because I've been thinking

341
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,041
11 years ago, Kisik was still a rookie

342
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,462
How can I get information about Chairman Wu’s son?

343
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,636
so

344
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
If I kill Chairman Wu's son...

345
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,724
I didn't ask you to kill him.

346
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,978
I'm just telling you that he's targeting your brother.

347
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,230
That's all

348
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,613
The person who provided information to Ki-seok was Mr. Kim

349
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,617
Don't believe me, it's okay

350
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,702
But there is one thing you have to remember

351
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,996
He's taking control again.

352
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,417
Killed Ki-seok and now drags you into this

353
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,712
Just like 11 years ago

354
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,055
Hand over the company to Kisik

355
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,182
I really mean it

356
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,852
But now he is gone

357
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,563
No one can trust Jiyun Group anymore

358
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,692
so…

359
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,322
I hope you can take over the Jiyun Group.

360
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,451
Whether in the past or now

361
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,662
My choices are the same

362
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,922
Where can I find that person?

363
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,008
I will force him to show up.

364
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,674
(Director Li Yunyun called)

365
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,802
Hello, President

366
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,097
Now?

367
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,226
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

368
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:44,373
《Unforgiven Revenge》

369
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,252
But why choose me?

370
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,546
Fengshan Group has so many directors

371
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,674
Director Hong

372
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,844
I want to ask you in return

373
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,931
What about Jiyun Group?

374
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,520
After Li Jiyun
Who do you think is the most suitable successor?

375
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,983
Nam Ki-seok's death doesn't count

376
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,569
Park Chang-chang is too old-fashioned

377
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,863
Exclude others

378
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,824
Is Choi Sung-cheol the only one left?

379
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,784
That’s why

380
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,871
That’s why I chose you, Director Hong.

381
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,755
Because after eliminating everyone else, you are the most suitable

382
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,764
please

383
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,232
Well, come in.

384
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,741
haven't seen you for a long time

385
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,412
I know him

386
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,750
Really? But as far as I know you don't know each other.

387
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,713
He is not on your shortlist, Director Hong.

388
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,382
In fact, in the Jiyun Group

389
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,552
There is already a more suitable candidate

390
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,432
He's here

391
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,446
How about it?

392
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,658
Are you ready?

393
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,978
