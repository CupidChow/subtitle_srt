Kisik is my friend

188
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,652
Do you know?

189
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,737
He was my friend before I joined the Yun Group.

190
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,239
Yes, friend.

191
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,076
Aren't you pretty good at stabbing your friends in the back?

192
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,578
You were originally from our side.

193
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,456
Maybe these young people nowadays don’t know this?

194
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,541
The police said...

195
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
The police said it was done by gangsters.

196
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,132
Stop overthinking.

197
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,805
You are hiding something, right?

198
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,023

Where is the funeral hall for Director Nan?

202
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,877
You must be tired, right? Why don't you go back and rest early?

203

206
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,681
The president is inside

207
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,725
so what?

208
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,484
Do you know what the president means?

209
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,279
He doesn't want you to get involved in the company's affairs.

210
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,116
For you, you can just pay your respects and leave.

211

212

I've said it before

220
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,840

222
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,721
Is it really that simple?

223
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,194
So what are you going to do?

224
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,114
Nam Ki-seok is gone

225
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,284
You have to find someone else to be your successor, right?

226
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,999
Stop being stubborn and give Jin Shan a chance.

227
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,877
Anyway, you always want to support your son
Isn’t this time just right?

228
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,671
What's good?

229
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,091
Do you think Kisik's behavior is a good thing?

230
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,219
Hey please

231
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,430
You know I don't mean that.

232
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,599

But today I can't do it

238
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,211
sorry

Okay, today I understand.

Of course the elder brother must be present at his younger brother's funeral.

Of course I remember

243
