1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,224
What the hell is going on? It's not going up at all?

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,939
Do you know why I'm looking for you?

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,233
Of course I know

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,943
Boss

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,988
But the question is simple

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,115
IMHO

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,827
As long as one person accepts his fate,

8
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,042
It was originally because of Junmo, wasn't it?

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,668
11 years ago

10
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,130
You told me and Chairman Li

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,341
Everyone wants to coexist

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,802
We must have our own rules

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,845
I said it

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,599
Junmo broke this rule

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,185
I'm not talking about rules.

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,896
But coexistence

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,816
Oh, it's so frustrating to talk like this.

18
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,781
If you want to coexist, you must follow the rules

19
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,657
If Junmo dies, there will be no coexistence

20
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,994
I have made it clear to Chairman Li.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,833
Jiyun Group will not interfere in this matter anymore.

22
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
real?

23
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,216
It is true that money makes the world go round.

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,885
I thought he cared about Director-General Nan.

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,137
Now there's only one question left

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,181
South Base

27
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,935
Once he dies, everything will be over.

28
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,936
But Boss

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,521
You also know

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,066
Nan Ji is not that easy to deal with

31
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
That's why I'm looking for you

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,699
Aren't you the one who wants to coexist the most?

33
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,287
No matter what you do, find a way to solve it

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,877
Just like 11 years ago

35
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,562
Like father, like son

36
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,845
《Unforgiven Revenge》

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,014
You wait

38
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,474
I'll come to you

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,816
"Wait"? Fuck it.

40
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,874
There will be a confrontation before the fight, right?

41
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,334
Is anyone coming?

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,462
Is there any special notice above?

43
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,548
They are probably a couple who came to play. Send them away.

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,677
This isn't a hotel.

45
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,892
Civilians are not allowed to enter and drive away

46
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,018
What?

47
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,812
damn it

48
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,649
In my opinion, you are the common people.

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,650
Is Director Gu in there?

50
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,276
Brat

51
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,290
Son of a bitch!

52
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,960
Everybody come out!

53
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
quick!

54
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,800
how?

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,013
You want me to fight with some hooligans?

56
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,600
Mr. Executive, don’t you know who I am?

57
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,687
I am the champion Jung In Seok

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,105
Know

59
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,900
Jung In-seok was stripped of his title for taking drugs

60
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,947
Didn't I tell you?

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,451
If you mention this to me again, you're dead.

62
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
Didn't I tell you?

63
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,457
This round of one billion

64
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,672
but…

65
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,302
I might actually kill him.

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,226
That's good.

67
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,984
You idiots! There are so many of you!

68
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,528
Why did you let him run away?

69
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,531
The Jung In Seok that I know?

70
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,036
Answer me

71
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,370
Yes, that's him.

72
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,834
Contact Jung In Seok's agent first

73
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,586
Then check all the places where the general manager might go.

74
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,755
Hotels, clubs, saunas, golf courses

75
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,674
Even if it's a place he doesn't think he'll go.
Have you understood everything?

76
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,931
What are you still standing there for?

77
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
Move, damn.

78
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,574
General Manager

79
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,743
Where are you?

80
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,579
Nan Ji is still alive

81
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,874
What?

82
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,959
So I came out to kill him myself

83
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,587
Where can I find him?

84
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,465
Not the same as it used to be, right?

85
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,929
Even if you were hurt before
I will still hold on until the end and say I am fine

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,014
really

87
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,143
I heard about Ki-seok's story.

88
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,563
No matter what I say

89
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,566
You will still go find the other person, right?

90
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,950
Okay, I won't stop you.

91
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,831
But let me bandage you first before I go and take revenge.

92
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,959
Don't be late

93
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,633
(Tai Guang Clinic)

94
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,718
Can you hold on tight, bro?

95
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
Don't let go

96
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,488
Um

97
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,282
I have an appointment with Brother Yun to meet tomorrow

98
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,371
Benchmark Brother Yun will solve this matter according to the rules

99
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,957
I told you not to do anything.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,167
Benchmark

101
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,751
As long as we deal with Chairman Gu's son

102
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,547
You'll stop, right?

103
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,425
Kisik must want you to do this too.

104
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,510
Hey, who do you think you are?

105
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,930
I'll call you later

106
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,645
Who do you think you are? Why do you say you want to kill me?

107
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,272
(benchmark)

108
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,024
Are you talking to Nan Jiben on the phone?

109
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,484
Ask him to come over

110
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,737
The person he's looking for is here.

111
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,491
Are you Gu Fengshan’s son?

112
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,871
Calling each other by name when you first meet?

113
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,500
I heard that you look exactly like Chairman Gu when he was young.

114
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,085
But I don't think so at all

115
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,380
Even if I don't want to kill you, there are many people who do.

116
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,883
So you should go back today.

117
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,969
Wouldn’t it be nice to live a few more days?

118
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
When will I...

119
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,646
Please spare my life?

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,659
Why do you all talk so much fucking nonsense?

121
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,202
General Manager!

122
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
General Manager!

123
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,997
General Manager! Please stop!

124
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,332
What are you doing?

125
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,000
Stop it, executive!

126
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
stop!

127
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,052
Sorry, General Manager

128
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,721
But we can’t fight anymore, okay?

129
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
Binghao

130
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,524
Why is it so fast today?

131
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,694
Aren’t you always late, Director Jin?

132
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,987
Why!

133
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,952
Come, let me ask you a question.

134
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,789
You came here because you were worried about me.

135
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,044
Or is it because of concerns about the South Korean base?

136
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,425
explain

137
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,302
You bastard!

138
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,095
- Son of a bitch!
- Let go

139
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,556
I told you to stop!

140
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,850
I asked you to leave this matter alone
I said I would fix it!

141
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,184
- Let go!
- You want to know?

142
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,145
Okay, I'll tell you, bastard.

143
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,565
Because you're a worthless bastard!

144
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,861
Ki-sik and Byung-ho were both killed by you, you bastard!

145
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,446
open

146
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,784
What the fuck

147
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,046
Are you finally telling the truth?

148
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,217
You son of a bitch

149
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,935
Don't do this!

150
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,521
This is indeed true.

151
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,983
Once unfaithful, never again

152
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,443
Why!

153
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
But let me make it clear

154
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,407
Why did this guy die?

155
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,495
He died because of you

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,207
You bastard, it’s all because of you!

157
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,754
Because you failed to solve the South benchmark, do you understand?

158
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,714
Do you understand?

159
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
Son of a bitch!

160
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,930
Shit! That's enough.

161
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
“That’s enough”?

162
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,111
If you're going to do it, do it thoroughly

163
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,325
Hey come

164
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,035
Come

165
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,039
(benchmark)

166
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,794
I understand what you mean, Byungho...

167
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,045
Hello Mr. Nan Ji

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,214
Your friends

169
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,592
All died because of you

170
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,055
If you're going to do it, you should do it thoroughly.

171
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,726
I'll send you the address, come here quickly

172
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,812
You can run, right?

173
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,519
Shen Chengyuan is me

174
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,453
Who are you? I'm a police officer!

175
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,662
I know

176
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,873
You are a police officer

177
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,791
Chairman Gu

178
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
Have you been here before?

179
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,007
Thanks to you, I haven't been here for a long time.

180
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,972
Those who are caught here either die or disappear.
You don't want to end up like me.

181
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,849
Just be honest

182
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,017
President

183
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,812
Why is this happening suddenly?

184
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,151
I read Nam Ki-seok's report and it was quite interesting.

185
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,989
Squad Leader Han, you are the first one to arrive at the scene, right?

186
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,577
With your qualifications
Surely it wasn't discovered by accident while on patrol?

187
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,665
But no one reported it.

188
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,963
You knew that a long time ago, right?

189
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,632
You knew Nam Ki-seok would die.

190
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,681
Damn it

191
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,561
- Call someone quickly
- yes

192
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,814
Hey, this place is really nice

193
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,775
Even if someone died, no one would know.

194
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,618
Why the hell did you ask us to come to a place like this?

195
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,624
Hey, this is where we should prepare.

196
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,587
What the fuck?

197
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,255
Hey! The door won't open.

198
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,882
Come down quickly

199
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,303
What is going on again?

200
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,805
He looks fierce, so fucking cruel.

201
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,473
- What?
- Who are you?

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,475
- You wanna stab me?
- That's really interesting.

203
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
Get everyone off the bus

204
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,150
- What happened?
- what the hell?

205
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,067
What's wrong?

206
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,655
Damn it

207
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,159
It's true that money makes things easier.
So many big names are here

208
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
What's going on?

209
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,912
What an honor!

210
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
What nonsense is he talking about?

211
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,291
Some of you may already know

212
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,669
I am Chairman Gu's son.
Will take over Fengshan Group in the future

213
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:26,425
After I take office, all the people will be replaced by new ones.

214
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,303
Change to my people

215
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,725
Security companies can also expand their business

216
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,438
In conclusion

217
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,524
Today is an interview

218
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
Selecting future talents for Fengshan Group

219
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,696
The task is simple

220
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
Someone will come here soon.

221
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,161
Just bring him to me.

222
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,587
- What is that?
- what the hell?

223
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,214
Check it out

224
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,094
What is that?

225
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,680
It's cash

226
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,891
- Is it money?
- Why!

227
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,102
- A lot of money?
- Damn, that's a lot of money.

228
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,145
Here I come!

229
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,691
That's right.

230
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,067
Listen to him

231
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,987
Whoever catches that man will get the money in the bag.

232
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,532
You can deal with him in any way you want.

233
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,909
Just don't kill it.

234
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,162
Because I want to do it myself

235
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,913
Are you kidding?

236
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,583
Why would you place such a big bet on such a person?

237
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,752
Why are you so serious?

238
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,839
Enjoy it, it's a game!

239
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,816
Hey boy, you came here alone?

240
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,318
what the hell?

241
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,911
If you think you might regret...

242
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,997
You can go now

243
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,167
No way? What did he say?

244
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,002
- Get out of the way
- You're quite courageous.

245
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,524
- Don't push me!
- Get out of the way!

246
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,235
Son of a bitch!

247
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,866
What are you waiting for?

248
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,494
Son of a bitch!

249
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
Oh shit!

250
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,175
Back off you bastard!

251
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,427
Son of a bitch!

252
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,694
Come on, bastard!

253
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,706
damn it!

254
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,668
Security Team

255
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,462
- team leader
- Don't bring him to me, just kill him.

256
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,881
Just kill the fuck off!

257
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,924
Go quickly!

258
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,932
Son of a bitch!

259
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,988
Why!

260
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,711
Fuck him!

261
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,341
Fuck! Back off!

262
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
Why

263
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,372
What? Are you scared?

264
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,291
You can kill him, right?

265
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,502
Please, you know I can

266
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Um?

267
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,760
Then we have to recalculate.

268
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,805
- Double
- Are you fucking kidding me?

269
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,392
joke?

270
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,188
Am I kidding?

271
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,530
I have a recording

272
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,243
The recording of the call with that guy
It's all in my phone

273
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,953
Listen

274
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,180
The guys who killed Nam Ki-seok will turn themselves in.

275
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,225
Monitor, you just need
Just clean up the traces of others.

276
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,144
And what about “others”?

277
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,944
Hey, go get that bastard.

278
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,126
Hold!

279
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,256
Son of a bitch!

280
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,927
Hold!

281
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,514
Why

282
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,599
Double 2 billion

283
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,911
If you regret it now, you can leave.

284
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
Why

285
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,056
How is it? Do you regret it?

286
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,351
Son of a bitch

287
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,112
waste

288
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,377
Mr.

289
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,088
I'm waiting for you up there.

290
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,475
damn it

291
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,661
Damn it!

292
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,038
Oh, I really want to kill him.

293
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,206
Get started

294
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,792
Son of a bitch

295
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,114
Hey South Benchmark

296
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,117
Your brother Nam Ki-seok?

297
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,494
Yes, I killed him.

298
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,997
Fucking trash

299
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,514
Fuck! My eyes!

300
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,182
Fuck it!

301
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,940
You are such a fucking coward!

302
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,949
Why

303
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,951
Why!

304
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,746
Hold!

305
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,632
Where the hell are you? Shit!

306
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,598
Don't come over here

307
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,875
Come on, you bastard!

308
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,829
Mr. Nam Ki-jun

309
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,624
Let's stop here

310
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,127
Is that enough?

311
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
Please give me a way out

312
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,512
Oh shit!

313
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
damn it!

314
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,231
Why

315
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,612
Does this work?

316
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,532
Will your brother survive?

317
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,499
Answering the phone

318
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,254
The number you dialed cannot be reached...

319
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,473
Hey Junmo, are you okay?

320
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,141
Are you okay?

321
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,311
Why aren't you speaking?

322
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,771
It's me

323
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,607
How come Junmo's phone is in your...

324
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,319
Benchmarks Listen to me first

325
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,905
It wasn't Junmo's doing.

326
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Gu Junmo

327
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,159
It has been handled according to the rules

328
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,288
you…

329
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,875
What did you say?

330
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,295
Your son

331
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,964
Dead

332
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,842
No

333
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,802
Let Junmo listen

334
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,345
Let him listen!

335
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,180
Accept the reality

336
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,645
Listen to me South Base

337
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,982
Damn it! You bastard!

338
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,511
handsome model

339
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,264
handsome model

340
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,438
No

341
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,192
My son won't die.

342
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,111
No

343
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,447
No

344
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,959
I've been thinking

345
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,422
When you went to see Chairman Wu on my behalf

346
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,716
What's the mood?

347
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,762
But now…

348
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,140
I don't need to ask.

349
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,520
Yeah, this dress.

350
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,023
I'll bring it to you next time

351
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,527
We will meet again

352
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,364
South Benchmark…

353
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,118
Already solved
