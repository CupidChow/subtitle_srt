1
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,310
sorry

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,856
I'm afraid I can't take this up.

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,316
Why? Not enough money?

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,277
It's not because I'm not qualified.

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,073
No matter how much money you give me, it won't work.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,702
Are you afraid of South Korea?

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,663
Yes

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,916
I was also at

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,502
11 years ago in that place

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,106
Do you believe it?

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,275
Nanjixi

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,404
Do you believe that those young boys killed him?

13
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,241
Do you think it's possible?

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,544
- Hello, Pastor.
- Good evening

15
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,505
- Hello
- Let's go in.

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,923
This weather is really

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,889
Where is Junmo now?

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,016
With Director Kim Chun-seok

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,477
Let him go to Yang Ping's safe house immediately

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,939
No, Director, please take him there yourself.

21
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,568
Also, have your men check with the police.

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,905
Go to the police to check?

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,659
Find out who was the first person to call the police in the Nam Ki-seok case

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,285
Who are the police officers in charge of the investigation?

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,121
Confirm whether it was those guys who did it

26
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,997
Find out all the circumstances

27
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,999
Understood

28
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,201
《Unforgiven Revenge》

29
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,454
(De Kro Hotel)

30
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,004
General Manager!

31
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423
We have to go now

32
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,592
There is a safe house in Yangpyeong

33
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,802
The president asked me to take you there directly.

34
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,971
Let's go now

35
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,101
Just because my dad tells me to go, I have to go?

36
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,187
General Manager

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,273
South Benchmark is looking for you

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:22,243
Because of that bastard
Is that what made you so anxious?

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,080
You may not fully understand the situation.
South Benchmark…

40
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,166
What exactly is the South Benchmark?

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,628
Make you all so scared?

42
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,424
What's wrong?

43
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,302
What's going on?

44
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,470
All out

45
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,264
Who is this person?

46
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,183
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,937
Come on, I'll take you there.

48
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,939
What are you doing?

49
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
Send you to Yangping

50
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,738
How long do we have to clean up his mess?

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
yes

52
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,701
Can't pass this way

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,455
"Send Junmo to Yangping

54
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,083
If he doesn't obey, I'll beat him up."

55
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,125
This is the president's instruction.

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,669
Director Li, are you crazy?

57
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,839
Director Jin, you are incompetent, so you asked me to come

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,638
You bastard!

59
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,641
Is Gu Junmo upstairs?

60
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,150
Fuck! Let go!

61
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
Let him go!

62
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,319
Are you crazy?

63
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,863
Listen to the general manager, bastard!

64
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh shit!

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,210
You have to leave now.

66
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,962
Leave now!

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,006
let go

68
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,176
Oh, please listen to me this time, okay?

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,762
- Hey, I'd like to see it.
- The General Manager is really...

70
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,556
This bastard is really here

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,225
Please stand up and listen to me, please!

72
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,862
Son of a bitch!

73
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,996
Brother Jiben! Please don't do this, okay?

74
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,206
Stop it for my sake!

75
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,583
Please!

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,876
Walking quite steadily

77
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,105
Is the executive all right?

78
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,608
Get up, stand up!

79
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,525
Take him away

80
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,735
Get up quickly!

81
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
Let’s go, let’s go quickly!

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,714
Hold!

83
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,342
How many times have I told you? You just won't listen!

84
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,137
Who the fuck is this?

85
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,850
Quan Haifan this madman

86
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
Goo Joon Mo!

87
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,812
- Why!
- Take your hands off!

88
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,564
- Stop the car!
- Get out of the way!

89
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,108
Damn it! Get out of the way!

90
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,366
What the fuck are you doing?

91
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,162
Is Junmo okay?

92
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,290
Well, I was just a little scared, but it's okay.

93
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,958
I'm taking him to Yangping now.

94
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,042
Strengthening security

95
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,378
No one must know where he is, understand?

96
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,504
Please rest assured

97
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,897
How far do we have to drive?

98
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:10,948
General Manager

99
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,201
arrive

100
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,381
Team leader, do you want to crush this one too?

101
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,674
Oh, I don't know either.

102
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
It’s up to you!

103
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,556
We're really going to be caught now.
He will definitely be severely punished.

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,266
Can we really just run away like this?

105
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,644
You bastard, do you think you are Kong Ming?

106
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,103
I asked you to clean up after dinner.

107
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,731
You took a shit for 40 minutes, you bastard

108
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,109
Run while there's still time, idiot.

109
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,987
- Look...
- Mr. Shen...

110
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,366
Fengshan Group
Now the South Base is in a mess

111
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,702
Now is the only chance to run.

112
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,330
I'll get you some coffee.

113
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,919
Are you going somewhere?

114
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
Nowhere to go

115
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,597
Just came back

116
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,891
Just got back from a business trip

117
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,393
I'm so exhausted.

118
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,979
Do you know where Gu Junmo is?

119
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,152
oops

120
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,989
I told you I just came back from a business trip.

121
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,783
This time he probably decided to hide.

122
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,868
Even if you dig three feet deep, you won't find it.

123
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,203
Find it out

124
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,331
Give you a day

125
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,841
What do you think, Director?

126
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,637
Will it really be worth the effort?

127
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
Prosecutor Lee

128
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,433
Why?

129
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
what why?

130
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,230
Eavesdropping Device

131
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,274
Why did you reveal this to me?

132
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,739
Director Cui

133
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,371
I'm a gangster in a prosecutor's uniform

134
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,666
So I know very well
Compared to individuals, organization is the most important

135
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,086
In this respect, prosecutors are very similar to gangsters.

136
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,214
Director Cui, what do you think?

137
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,925
Cover up the death of Director Nam

138
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,137
Is it really good for the company?

139
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,685
The chairman's decision is my idea.

140
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,895
I understand my father.

141
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,567
If Gu Junmo died, it would cause a violent conflict.

142
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,485
Of course he'll be scared.

143
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,448
I am afraid that everything I have worked so hard to build will collapse in an instant.

144
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,744
But I think this is an opportunity

145
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,749
Completely destroy the Fengshan Group

146
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,756
Let us take control of everything

147
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,637
My wife's garbage sorting this week
Can you handle this?

148
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,598
I really can't go home recently

149
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,516
- Can you...
- Director Kim!

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
Wait a moment

151
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,606
Wife, I have to hang up. I'm hanging up.

152
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,983
Director Kim Chun-seok!

153
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,737
You called me?

154
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,450
I will continue what I was halfway through saying yesterday.

155
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,244
What's up?

156
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,498
South Base

157
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,666
Tell me more about this guy.

158
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,585
Benchmark brother?

159
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,261
Are you finally curious now?

160
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,556
South Base

161
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,477
General Manager

162
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,065
How much do you know about the South Bend?

163
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,568
The South Base

164
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,946
To us, it is God

165
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,283
Because now Jiyun Group and Fengshan Group
The reason for existence

166
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,910
It's all thanks to Nanji

167
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,413
President! Busan Gang...

168
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,875
When Lee Eun-woon and Gu Bong-san were still under Chairman Oh

169
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,253
They clash with the biggest gang in Busan

170
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,047
Chairman Wu wants to enter Japan

171
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,299
Busan Port must be controlled

172
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,889
So they sent them both to Busan, but they were too late.

173
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,475
Busan Gang strikes first

174
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,907
They fought hard but couldn't hold on.

175
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
It's about to collapse

176
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,202
Kill them all!

177
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,788
At this time, the South Base appeared

178
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,347
Kill him!

179
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,184
Son of a bitch!

180
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,689
Go to hell!

181
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,901
You bastard!

182
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,495
What's going on?

183
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,347
We once again realized

184
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,516
No matter who the opponent is, no matter how many people there are

185
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,019
It doesn't matter to the South Datum

186
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:43,359
From that day on
The status of Lee Eun-woon and Gu Bong-san has been significantly improved

187
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, here comes Seungwon.

188
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,532
There are even rumors that
Chairman Wu intends to hand over the company to the two of them

189
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,992
Instead of giving it to your son

190
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,787
What's wrong, son? Do you want to say something?

191
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,332
nothing

192
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,417
grateful

193
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,169
Rumors sowed seeds of hatred

194
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,214
Angered Chairman Wu's son

195
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,346
Are you sure it was Chairman Wu’s son who gave the order?

196
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,847
Yes!

197
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,895
I'm thinking
I can only confess to both of you and ask for forgiveness.

198
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,188
Only then can there be a way to survive!

199
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
Please believe me, please!

200
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,651
this

201
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
Please listen to this

202
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,656
Listen to this

203
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,116
Listen!

204
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,077
How many times have I said

205
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
Li Yunyun and Gu Fengshan! Kill them both

206
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,208
In the end, Chairman Wu’s son went too far

207
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,335
Hire someone to kill them both

208
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,378
The truth came to light

209
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,799
Then something happened.

210
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,009
- Oh shit!
- Is there a power outage?

211
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,468
Turn on the lights

212
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,679
What the fuck are you doing?

213
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,403
Lee Eun-woon and Gu Bong-san

214
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
Bring them to me

215
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,370
What's going on?

216
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,212
I want to kill Chairman Wu's son.
It is good for the future of the company.

217
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,007
Are you fucking kidding?

218
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,261
- You're such a fool
- Boss, you have to make a decision.

219
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,972
Or just sit there and wait to be killed by President Wu.

220
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,267
Either we take the initiative

221
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
Benchmark

222
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,608
President!

223
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,778
This was all done by Jiyun himself.

224
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,238
I really don’t know!

225
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,615
I really don't know

226
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,384
You saved the president while I was away.
I thank you very much

227
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,054
I really hope...

228
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,849
This is not what you did.

229
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,976
sorry

230
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,566
Benchmarks

231
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,777
Why did you do that?

232
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,488
I really don't understand

233
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
I really don't understand why you would do this.

234
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,286
The president's son...

235
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,707
You didn't kill him, did you?

236
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,884
Does this matter?

237
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,658
sorry

238
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
I'm late

239
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,430
Just one day

240
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,017
Chairman Wu fell.

241
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,569
at the same time

242
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,072
Lee Eun-woon and Gu Bong-san

243
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,867
Take control of the overall situation

244
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,709
After that incident

245
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,128
In order to maintain balance, a new rule was born.

246
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,758
“Anyone
If you cause trouble, you must pay the price."

247
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,887
The first victim of this rule was Nan Jijun

248
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,390
He helped them get everything.

249
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,518
But he is also the source of the problem

250
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,687
But he did make great contributions after all...

251
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,399
So you only cut his hamstrings?

252
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,944
right

253
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,280
Maybe they are afraid of South Korea

254
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,032
Li Yun is afraid

255
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,702
Chairman Gu is the same

256
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,247
so…

257
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,377
You expect me to believe this bullshit?
Then stay here.

258
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,088
Right?

259
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,299
All right

260
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,761
Just live in fear all your life

261
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,514
sorry

262
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,768
I couldn't stop Gu Junmo

263
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,646
Don't worry about it.

264
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,364
I heard that it was Chairman Gu's son who killed Ki-seok.
Right?

265
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,451
Think about the benchmark again.

266
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,245
I understand your feelings

267
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,456
But only on our own
Unable to fight against the entire Fengshan Group

268
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,501
I'll solve it myself

269
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,921
That's not what I meant.

270
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,466
I'm worried about you

271
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,469
How about this?

272
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,763
I'll go talk to the president of the Jiyun Association...

273
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,433
The company has decided to cover up the matter.

274
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,852
What?

275
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,939
He knew it was Gu Junmo who did it but told everyone to forget it.

276
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,903
In the eyes of the chairman, Ki-seok is nothing.

277
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,009
Oh shit!

278
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,427
Let me out

279
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,554
You bastards

280
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,973
Let me out!

281
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,192
Is this where people live? It's basically a prison!
You bunch of bastards!

282
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Let me out!

283
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,653
Let me out! Shit!

284
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,700
I want to go back to Seoul

285
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,079
- If anything happens, call me right away.
- yes

286
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,465
(Gu Junmo)

287
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,053
What's wrong, brother?

288
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,556
Hey, I have a job for you guys.

289
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,809
Big Job

290
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,315
I'll make it clear

291
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,526
This time

292
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,237
To get people

293
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,614
Make sure to do it neatly

294
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,660
Any work?

295
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,829
We will do it tonight and he will tell us the location when he comes back.

296
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,955
How many people?

297
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,165
Just one

298
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,125
Just one?

299
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,633
(Executive Director Gu Junmo)

300
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,551
Director

301
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,928
Director, what do you mean?

302
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,515
The problem is that Nan Ji Ben is still alive

303
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,727
As long as Nan Ji is dead

304
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,023
There's no problem.

305
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,277
What?

306
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,403
South Benchmark

307
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,531
I'll get him.

308
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,327
I looked into Nam Ki-seok's case.
Something feels wrong

309
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,582
“The first person to discover and report it to the police

310
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,168
Han Seok-yoon"

311
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:26,673
The police officer in charge of this case is Han Seok-yoon
He was also the first person to call the police

312
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,134
Go find him

313
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,220
Bring him to me

314
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,182
Go now

315
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,516
clear

316
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,362
Benchmark Brother

317
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,532
Were you not hurt last night?

318
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,160
haven't seen you for a long time

319
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,120
How are you?

320
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,714
It seems that Director Gu is not going to give in this time.

321
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,343
Brother Benchmark, no matter how great you are

322
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,262
The opponent is not just Gu Junmo
The entire Fengshan Group

323
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,349
It's really dangerous if you continue like this.

324
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,810
Does the entire Fengshan Group include you?

325
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,110
Hey, don't say that.

326
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,950
Now think about it

327
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,245
I used to follow you everywhere...

328
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,457
The square was the most imposing at that time.

329
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,462
At least people back then were willing to take responsibility for what they did.

330
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,132
Why did you ask me to meet you?

331
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,764
Take this

332
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,432
Gu Junmo is hiding here

333
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,103
What's wrong?

334
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,607
Am I going to run away forever?

335
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,359
Don't worry about me

336
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,237
I was planning to leave the company anyway.

337
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,785
Benchmark brother!

338
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,246
Go ahead

339
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,250
Just finish what you're going to do, okay?

340
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,554
(Renovation notice: 10th to 13th floors are temporarily closed)

341
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,569
Sorry, Benchmark

342
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,613
You go see Nan Ji

343
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,158
He will ask me where I am.

344
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,911
You just pretend to be helpless

345
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,830
Lead him into my trap

346
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,334
I heard your daughter just learned to walk.

347
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,544
Don't you want to watch her grow up?

348
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,298
Oh, Director Kim!

349
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,301
Is Nan Ji Ji more important than your family?

350
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,512
I want your family to survive.

351
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,849
He must be killed.

352
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,615
(Okur)

353
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,334
Is the mission accomplished?

354
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,715
Speak

355
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,052
Is that bastard dead?

356
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,178
You wait

357
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,305
I'll come to you

358
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:03,069
《Unforgiven Revenge》

359
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,408
(11 years ago)

360
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,278
The president's son...

361
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,989
You didn't kill him, did you?

362
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707
Does this matter?
