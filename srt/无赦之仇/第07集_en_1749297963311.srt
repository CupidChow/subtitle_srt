1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,232
The funeral is ready

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,708
Now…

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045
It's time to send dad off

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:22,624
(Li Yun's Christian name: Michael)

5
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,601
boss

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,604
If you want to escape to Russia

7
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,067
Danny should be named
Maybe Alexander or Sergei?

8
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,196
Do you think I'm going to run away, little brat?

9
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,240
I was setting a trap idiot!

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,534
I know

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,702
These bastards

12
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,705
Wait and see who survives to the end

13
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,334
No, it's been 20 minutes.
Where the hell is the captain?

14
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,419
Now is not the time to be damn late

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,755
- Hey, go take a look.
- OK

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,968
Get out of the car and take a look at that brat!

17
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:15,885
OK

18
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,436
- Where is the captain of the King's Star?
- I have no idea

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,856
Where is the captain of the King's Star?

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,858
have no idea

21
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,285
I'll call the captain.

22
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,988
Why!

23
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,239
Come here

24
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,491
Let's take a photo today since there are new people here.

25
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,743
Come over here, everyone.

26
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,952
A rare opportunity

27
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,996
Hey, didn’t you guys listen to what the elders said?

28
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,915
Photos are the most precious memories

29
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
Come here soon

30
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,125
OK, come on.

31
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm so full. Did I eat too much?

32
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,922
Hey, you guys, come here quickly!

33
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,423
Hey, new guy, come here

34
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,217
Newcomer, please stand in front.

35
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,595
Can you guys smile? Smile.

36
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,096
Stand Here

37
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Come

38
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,601
Ready to shoot, get a little closer

39
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,645
Everyone smiled and took a photo.

40
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
one two three

41
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,338
Who are you?

42
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,716
Fucking bastard!

43
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
Who sent you here, you bastard?

44
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,386
Who is it?

45
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,596
Son of a bitch

46
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,517
Dog mongrel

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
Shen Chengyuan will not die, bastard!

48
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,771
These bastards

49
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,986
That's fucking awesome, son of a bitch.

50
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,742
Where's my money, bastard?

51
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,785
My Money

52
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,038
I'm not going to die, you bastards.

53
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,129
You son of a bitch

54
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,758
Shen Chengyuan will never die, bastard!

55
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,551
Go tell them I'm still alive, you bastards!

56
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,978
Cultivate!

57
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
Cultivate!

58
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,149
Boss, I'm here!

59
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,777
You are bleeding!

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,320
Where the hell have you been?

61
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,530
I was stabbed four times.

62
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,616
Go get a towel or something.

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,121
Hold!

64
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,795
I will tell them

65
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,631
This is how Shen Chengyuan died

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,258
You son of a bitch

67
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,054
Fucking bastard

68
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,150
Damn it

69
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,528
What a stubborn old man.

70
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,254
Shen Chengyuan has been eliminated

71
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,880
Thanks for your hard work

72
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,680
Shen Chengyuan has been eliminated

73
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,015
Thanks for your hard work

74
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,979
It's almost done.

75
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,399
It's the section chief. We're going up now.

76
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,360
Wait a moment

77
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,321
Where is Cha Young Do?

78
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,842
Have you decided?

79
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,600
South Base

80
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,102
You're out of luck.

81
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,605
I wanted to kill Cha Young Do first.

82
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,521
There's nothing special about you.

83
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,608
Just like your brother

84
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,988
It's you

85
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,032
You killed Ki-seok.

86
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,447
Listen carefully

87
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,783
I will build a new square

88
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,954
Unlike my father's generation who had to hide in the shadows

89
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,332
I want to stand upright in the sun

90
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,380
Create a new square that no one can touch

91
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,760
As Lee Jin-sun, Lee Yoon's son, Lee Jin-sun couldn't do that.

92
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,972
But as Prosecutor Li Jinshan, I can do

93
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,873
Hold!

94
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Are we seeing each other too often?

95
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,037
They're not his fucking family.

96
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,708
I want to ask you something.

97
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,420
Do you really know?

98
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,966
Didn’t you say that in the interrogation room?

99
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,971
Tell me who planned all this with me

100
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
(Lee Jin-sun and Lee Jun-yun)

101
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,070
I told these idiots to be careful!

102
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,159
Do you know what's in these USB flash drives?

103
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,206
Li Jinshan said:

104
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,669
"Provoke Jiyun to start a war with Fengshan
Then wait for an opportunity to take control of the situation."

105
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,047
All the evidence

106
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,758
All in it

107
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,560
How about this?

108
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,771
You kill Li Jinshan

109
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,233
Become the new owner of the square

110
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,905
Lee Eun-woon and Gu Bong-san can
Why don't you benchmark?

111
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,450
Just do it, I will fully support you

112
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
You shouldn't make conditions...

113
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,541
Instead, you should ask for mercy

114
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,130
You didn't even take the chance I gave you.

115
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,925
What? Do you think you are the Buddha?

116
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,321
Oh shit!

117
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,541
You bastard!

118
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,943
Do you want to live?

119
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,032
Please don't kill me...

120
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,848
I am sorry for your loss

121
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
Is that blood?

122
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,776
Who is this person?

123

125
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,062
Why

126
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,108
It seems that Shimane has failed.

127
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,820
Where is Cha Young Do?

128
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,448
Is he dead?

129
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,121
That's not bad, at least the guy is dead.

130
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
Why did you do that?

131
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
Nan Ji, why did you do this?

132
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,257
My father asked you to take over the business.
Why do you refuse?

133
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,097
A position that everyone covets and envies

134
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,017
Some people can't get what is right in front of them
I'm going crazy.

135
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:10,065
Why you two brothers?
But you don't take it seriously?

136
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,024
Just because of this?

137
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,114
Just because of this reason?

138
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,330
Now that you are here, let's eat something before leaving.

139
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,501
I guess this is
Your last hot meal out

140
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,173
It's your last meal.

141
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,134
Now you're the only one left

142
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,432
The funeral is tomorrow, right?

143
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,354
Don't die before the funeral...

144
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,483

Wrapping up everything

161
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,256
It must have taken you a while to find this?

162
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,972
Even my overseas accounts were checked
And used it to threaten me

163
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,598
Yeah?

164
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,107

Let Yun and Fengshan merge?

168
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,583
Now there is no leader

169
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,753
Wouldn't it be more convenient for us to take over?

What's in it for me?

174
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,277
You can stay in this seat longer.

175

Thank you all for coming. I am Li Jinshan.

189
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,444
As you all know, today we are gathered together

190
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,823
Celebrating the merger of Jiyun and Fengshan

191
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,037
From today
I officially become the new CEO of Jiyun Group

192

At the same time I am still

193
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,337
It's fucking cold

(Report the current prosecutor for inciting murder
Attachment: Recording)

195
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,684
I did what you said.
But does this really work?

196
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,065
Oh shit

197
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,653
If something goes wrong
It really has nothing to do with me, right?

198
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,570
(Mail sent)

199
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,115
I want to build a new system

200
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,993
But don't worry, everyone

201
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,497
I just want to try a new way

202
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,337
All members retain
Just tweak the system a little bit

203
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,256
All problems will be solved

204
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,677
The illegal benefits that everyone has enjoyed in the past

205
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,264
It will no longer be considered illegal

206
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
The square I want to build

207
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,312
The boundary between shadow and sunlight

208
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,481
Will disappear completely

209
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,652
No one will blame you anymore.

210
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,571
No

211
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,407
I guess no one will blame us anymore.

212
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,702
This is the new square I want to build.

214
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,976
To make this happen
Our director has put a lot of thought into this.

215
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,186
Exaggeration is not a thing

216
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,317
So what do we get?

217
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,362
Why don't I ask?

218
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,491
What seats do you two want?

219
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,046
I'm sorry, Director.

220
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,297
Please take a look

221
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,425

225

A current prosecutor is suspected of involvement in a murder case

229
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,299
Caused an uproar

230
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,804
It is reported that the prosecutor is
Lee Jin-sun of the Special Investigation Department of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

231

Let's listen to the recording file

234
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,648
I'll say it again

235
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:18,321
I want both Jiyun and Fengshan

236
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
damn it

237
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,330
What's going on?

238
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,172
The Procuratorate decided to immediately remove the prosecutor from his post

239
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,590
And promised to launch a swift investigation...

240
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,717
You're in big trouble.

241
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,139
What a new system that is hyped up
What's the result?

242
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,725
Just to let us see you in this miserable state?

243
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,437
What's the big deal?

244
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,150
Don’t you understand yet?

245
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,235
You are done

246
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,987
it's all over

247
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,782
It’s not over yet

248
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
Call them all back

249
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,828
That's fucking stupid.

250
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,710

251
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,629
Want to drag us down

252
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,714
Then give up this idea immediately.

253
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,050
The game is over, understand?

254
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,761
Fucking bastard

255
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,389
What a fucking lunatic.

256
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,733
Fuck you

257
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,249
Fuck you

258
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,045
Stop fighting

259
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,631
I'll take care of it

260
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,717
You should go

261
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,221
Why should I leave?
This is my place, call everyone back

262
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,138

263
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,390

We all trust you.
I have come this far.

265
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,316

266
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,204

269

270
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,938
Are you guys coming over?

271
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,734
Or should I go over there?

272
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,698
stop!

273
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,662
Let him come

274
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,133

Could you please...

277
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,334
That’s it?

278
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,091
I haven't heard you call me like this for a long time.

279
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,219
As the same generation...

280
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,807
I beg you for the sake of our past friendship.

281
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,643
Stop it

282
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,483
Well, I thought you wouldn't agree.

283
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,490
Let's go

284
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,201
I'll show you the way

285
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,665
This is my job

286
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
Do you understand?

287
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
fine

288
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,876
Go finish your work

289
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
good

290
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,135
We'll see you soon

291
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,043
How does it feel to sit in this seat?

292
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,923
All this you did

293
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,844
Just to sit in this seat, right?

294
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,471
Who knows?

295
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,185
Not as good as expected

296
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,897
I've done so much to get this position.

297
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,232
I knew it was so boring...

298
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,904
Everyone is like this

299
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,823
Do whatever it takes for this position

300
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,368
But after actually sitting on it

301
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,621
All that's left is emptiness

302
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,335
Because it's only downhill from here on out.

303
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,923
Damn, that's just your idea.

304
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,635
What about me?

305
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,596
I really like fighting.

306
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,225
I like the tension before the fight.

307
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,103
I like the thrill of hitting the target with one shot.

308
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,856
But my favorite

309
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,946
It's the way my friends looked at me after I won.

310
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,282
My father

311
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,328
I should be surrounded by this kind of gaze for the rest of my life.

312
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,621
I'm envious

313
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,875
That look of respect and admiration

314
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,714
No

315
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,510
That's not respect or admiration.

316
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,721
It's fear

317
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,849
Then it creates a heavy burden

318
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,314
President, he...

319
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,111
Maybe I don't want you to bear such a burden.

320
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,530
Because he knows the pain

321
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,199
Fuck! Don't mention it now that the person is dead.

322
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,412
I'm really curious

323
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,289
I really don't understand

324
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,042
Why did you go to this extent?

325
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,005
So many years have passed
Why do we have to do this now?

326
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,758
It was you who dropped everything and ran away.

327
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,679
Because it all started with me

328
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,766
Ki-seok's problem was also caused by me.

329
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,273
This is the line

330
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,407
Once you start...

331
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,328
It won't end until death

332
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,245
Don't do this

333
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,497
Fuck it!

334
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,667
I said don't do this!

335
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,815
Good shot.

336
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,659
My father is right.

337
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,496
You people

338
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,791
I have nightmares every day

339
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,504
Fuck! I'm really not cut out for this

340
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,426
but…

341
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,391
Thank you for listening to me.

342
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,909
Hold!

343
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
you…

344
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,622
Don't deserve to die so easily

345
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,560
Come…

346
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
Ask for forgiveness

347
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,486
It's none of your business what I should do, bastard.

348
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,276
I was thinking who would come to a place like this?

349
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,240
Actually, it's pretty good here.

350
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,827
elder brother

351
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,041
Otherwise I'll just come here to work.
Put everything down

352
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,711
OK

353
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,881
No problem, put everything down

354
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,968
Run this campground with me

355
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,431
