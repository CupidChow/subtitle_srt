1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,014
Why

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,437
Hello

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,199
I like it here

4
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,287
Because the view is beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,955
But what's the use? Shit!

6
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,750
Yes, but there are too many people here.

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,339
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

8
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,262
I have a little brother in the Central District Prosecutor's Office
So come visit us

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,228
The Fengshan Group's affairs have finally been dealt with.

10
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,567
Chairman Li has indeed made up his mind

11
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,781
Now it's your turn, prosecutor, to make the decision.

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,700
I need some more time

13
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,745
Your father is not an easy person to deal with.

14
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,290
If you delay too long, you will miss the opportunity

15
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,212
The choice is yours, prosecutor.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:33,468
Is to continue doing nothing like now?
Just hovering on the edge?

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,553
still…

18
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,228
Become the new owner of this square?

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,932
《Unforgiven Revenge》

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,280
Damn, aren't you dead?

21
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,325
Chairman Li is such a fucking bastard

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,745
Hey wait a minute
Don't let your brother's affairs cloud your judgement...

23
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,333
Hold!

24
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:50,920
damn it!

25
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,276
haven't seen you for a long time

26
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,854
See you next time

27
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,112
Are you setting off?

28
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,365
Arrive in ten minutes

29
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,832
Damn it

30
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,045
I almost went to see God.

31
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,178
South Base Good

32
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,807
This guy really lives up to his reputation.

33
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,817
(Director Lee Yoon)

34
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,987
Why do you have to do this bastard?

35
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:44,867
You want me to find out who got away with this car?

36
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,577
This is the last time

37
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,372
I won't look for you again

38
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,466
Hey, benchmark!

39
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,179
You know I'm a piece of shit.
Why are you still alive today?

40
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,563
What kind of work can be done and what kind of work cannot be done
I can tell the difference clearly.

41
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,774
Damn, I can’t do this job!

42
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,194
I can't do this even if I die. This is a police officer.

43
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,281
Don't mess with the police or you'll get into trouble.

44
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,243
You mean it's okay to mess with Ki-seok?

45
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,957
(Senior Superintendent Che Yingdao, Planning and Budget Division)

46
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,379
Um

47
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,760
- Aren't you off work yet?
- I have something else to do, please leave first

48
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,678
Ok see you tomorrow

49
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
Well, thank you for your hard work.

50
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,030
Thanks to you, I met Nan Ji

51
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,909
This is not like your style.

52
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,496
Doing this behind my back

53
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,249
Let's meet up soon.

54
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,044
To replay your message...

55
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,848
Aren't you going to work?

56
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,768
Didn’t you say you were going to hold a board meeting?

57
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,652
I am here to attend on your behalf, father.

58
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,281
Where are you going again?

59
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,203
I don't know where to start

60
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,665
From the first time I met Mr.

61
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,002
We said we should reorganize the situation together?

62
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,171
still…

63
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,092
From the first time I made up my mind
Do you want to sit in your father's seat?

64
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
Are you crazy, you bastard?

65
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,517
Do you know how crazy Cha Young Do is?

66
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,769
Why blame him?

67
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,106
This is not all because
Father, do you really want to exclude me?

68
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,902
How can a bastard who does this job take my seat?
I have nightmares every day!

69
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,072
I do all this for you!

70
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,367
Because I don't want you to live like me
Son of a bitch!

71
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,122
But this is your idea, father.

72
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,041
Not my idea

73
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,837
Me

74
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
I've always wanted to be like you, my father.

75
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,426
I've always wanted to sit in your seat, father.

76
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,971
Never gave up

77
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,809
But father, you gave it to others so easily.

78
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,489
(Name: Li Yunyun)

79
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
(Search and Seizure Application)

80
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,036
Little bastard!

81
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,581
Do you think this piece of paper can stop me?

82
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,584
Do you think Advisor Shin and Director Park will listen to you?

83
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,752
If you don't listen

84
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,506
I'll let them listen

85
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,722
Let's wait and see

86
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,724
It’s time to go

87
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,068
sorry

88
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,933
Hello, Minister An

89
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,227
Are you bored of waiting?

90
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,897
It's time to end things between you and Nan Ji

91
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,235
You drive my car

92
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,666
Nan Ji will come to you on his own

93
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:50,756
(No entry for external vehicles)

94
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,512
Team leader! Look over here.

95
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,609
I found the policeman.

96
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
Sent you the address.

97
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,030
OK, got it.

98
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,742
But what do you want to do, benchmark?

99
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,994
It's time to end it

100
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
All settled

101
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,715
Why is the prosecutor here?

102
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
Where is the president?

103
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,510
(Harvest)

104
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,428
I don't know either

105
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
Please take care of me in the future.

106
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,221
I see

107
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,558
You want to win over Sung-chul to launch a coup

108
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,894
Listen carefully, Master, don't waste your energy.

109
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,481
When you are still leisurely flipping through the book

110
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,902
We have been with the president
Countless escapes from death

111
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,447
Treat you as my own...

112
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,159
There's none here

113
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
Those who do not accept

114
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,500
You can go now

115
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
What are you standing there for? Why don't you get up?

116
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,978
What's going on? You bastards!
Get out of my way!

117
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,146
You bastards!

118
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,775
What's going on?

119
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,279
I am different from my father.

120
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,788
My father doesn't want to get his hands dirty.

121
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,374
But I am not

122
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,960
If necessary

123
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:38,174
I don't mind getting my hands dirty

124
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,139
Taehwan

125
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,391
Why?

126
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,394
11 years ago

127
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,981
Why didn't you just kill me then?

128
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,988
Hold!

129
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,867
It's fucking embarrassing.

130
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,780
Let's finish it soon

131
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,852
Pick it up

132
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,252
That's it, Taehwan.

133
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,138
damn it

134
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,645
So…

135
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,485
You should have killed me then.

136
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,061
Hold!

137
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,023
Are you going to humiliate me in the end?

138
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,800
Benchmarks

139
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,221
Do this business...

140
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,893
Everyone must die

141
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,896
It's over

142
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,232
I know

143
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,536
Go ahead

144
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,540
Go find him

145
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
(Mr. Jin)

146
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,595
welcome

147
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
Is this our final farewell?

148
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,521
Finally, I have come to this step

149
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:31,902
Do you regret having come to this point?

150
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,452
In the final analysis
President, you are such a selfish person, aren't you?

151
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,705
There are so many opportunities

152
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,126
But never corrected the mistake

153
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,253
Obviously knows everything

154
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,295
Why?

155
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,465
Because it's so beautiful

156
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,845
Because you don't want to lose everything you have.

157
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,767
You want to get your hands dirty with blood?

158
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,146
This wasn't in the plan.

159
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,482
But I always feel that if you were alive

160
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,943
I will be dangerous

161
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,654
Do you understand?

162
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,950
Don't worry too much about your prosecutor son.

163
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,785
I will take good care of him

164
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,330
You made a big mistake by involving Jin Sun

165
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,373
Yeah?

166
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,001
Not necessarily?

167
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,593
good

168
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,470
Calm down.

169
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,225
You son of a bitch

170
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
You fucking...

171
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
President

172
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,341
Don't move!

173
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,239
You are suspected of murdering President Li Yunyun
I want you to be arrested now.

174
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,156
Brother Yun

175
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,159
Everything you say could be used as evidence in court.

176
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,537
You have the right to hire an attorney...

177
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,747
The right to remain silent

178
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,833
Go out first

179
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,127
Hey, what's going on?

180
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,467
Why did you do that?

181
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,683
We meet again so soon

182
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,476
Um?

183
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,188
how?

184
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,317
Feeling wronged?

185
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,631
It's him

186
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,290
damn it

187
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,586
Hey, this old man is quite strong.

188
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,051
Did you see it?
Why do you have to do such a meaningless thing?

189
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,386
Um?

190
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,223
Can't you just pretend you didn't see it?

191
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:19,606
Can't you just pretend you didn't see it?

192
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,444
Isn’t this how you have been living for the past decade?
Damn it

193
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,074
It's because of your son.

194
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh shit

195
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,288
Have a nice journey

196
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,918
Stop worrying about your son.

197
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,172
Hold!

198
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
Our Plan

199
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,473
Thanks to Mr. Nam Ki-joon, you can achieve this

200
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,934
11 years ago

201
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,145
Same thing now

202
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,313
So you killed him?

203
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,651
To pull me in?

204
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,028
And Kisik...

205
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,615
Was this the reason for killing him?

206
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,956
How can I put it? The final result is this

207
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,460
But even without our plan

208
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,296
Your brother will still die.

209
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,213
Why?

210
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,594
Because Chairman Li designated him as his successor.
From that moment on

211
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,181
He only has two choices

212
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,265
Either die

213
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,685
Or ascend the throne

214
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,402
Don’t you want to ask?

215
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,532
I just said "our plan"
Isn’t it?

216
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,285
Aren’t you curious?

217
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,372
Except me

218
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,375
Who is the other person?

219
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm from the Wide Area Search Team.

220
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,808
for you

221
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,726
South Base

222
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,313
From now on, his case is under our control.

223
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,475
(Under construction, no entry allowed)

224
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,816
Are you going to kill me here?

225
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,660
Hey! Bastard

226
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,453
This kid is fucking

227
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,142
Son of a bitch!

228
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,226
Let go!

229
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,647
Let go!

230
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,565
Why!

231
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,478
Son of a bitch

232
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,940
You're dead, bastard.

233
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,881
Well, at least pretend to be surprised?

234
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,967
How did you find this place?

235
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,722
Cha Young Do called me and asked me to clean up the mess

236
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,059
And said if I deal with you properly
Will benefit me

237
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
Shit! Who knows?

238
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,481
Then why did you help me?

239
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,613
Shen Chengyuan just called

240
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,158
It was confirmed that Nam Ki-jun died on the spot

241
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,078
How is the scene being arranged?

242
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,580
A traffic accident occurred during the escort

243
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,501
OK

244
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,628
Thanks for your hard work

245
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,974
Damn it

246
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,436
Life is fucking hard.

247
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,646
Cha Young-do

248
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,151
Chief of Planning and Budget Division, one of the most promising talents in the police force

249
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,820
The strange thing is

250
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,197
Generally, after becoming a section chief

251
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,367
Either transfer or promotion within a few years

252
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,704
But Cha Young-do
Spent 11 years in that position.

253
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,374
Anyway, I didn't graduate from the police university.

254
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,001
There is also limited room for advancement

255
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,711
So he probably stayed on purpose.

256
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,966
So these 11 years
He has been covering for the Jiyun and Fengshan Group.

257
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,051
Um

258
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,889
You haven't answered my question yet

259
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,892
Why are you helping me?

260
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,022
You will kill yourself

261
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,193
That's right

262
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,029
Oh yeah

263
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,156
Come

264
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,743
This phone number is anonymous.
You can use it with confidence

265
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,661
besides…

266
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,290
This is Li Yunyun's pipe

267
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,959
It should be meaningful to you, right?

268
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,462
Why

269
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,050
I'll go abroad to avoid the limelight while there's still time.

270
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,011
Do you understand what I mean?

271
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,265
Let's go

272
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,368
Have a nice journey

273
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,663
Stop worrying about your son.

274
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,966
I'll handle it

275
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,425
Don't

276
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,642
Cha Young-do's hidden secrets of the Jiyun Group

277
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,478
Got to get these things first.

278
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,366
(Search and Seizure Warrant Cha Young-do)

279
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,419

280
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,837
action

281
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,966
We are from the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

282
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,725
Hurry up, everyone.
You hear me, we need to check the ground carefully too?

283
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,226
Can't contact him

284
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,437
Looks like he's noticed.

285
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,564
Don't miss any

286
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,399
- Wait, the safe cannot be taken away.
- Take all away

287
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,442
Why

288
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,361
If Section Chief Cha Young-do doesn't come, you will suffer.

289
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,071
This is too much!

290
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,032
What's going on?

291
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,825
hurry up!

292
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,456
Please, have you taken enough?

293
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,042
What the fuck is this kidding?

294
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,586
Hello, what's wrong?

295
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,422
The section chief cannot return to the office now.

296
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,008
Prosecutors are conducting search and seizure operations

297
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,928
- Section Chief?
- damn it

298
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,810
Hey, Prosecutor Lee

299
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,355
Isn't this stabbing me in the back?

300
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,149
Didn’t I tell you before?
I will do my job well

301
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,233
Fuck…

302
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,863
Why

303
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,492
I don't know why you do that.

304
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,662
But let’s stop here, okay?

305
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,581
You were doing great before, are you going to ruin it all now?

306
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,709
Do you really think I know nothing?

307
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,799
My father...

308
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,386
It wasn't Nan Ji who killed him.

309
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,847
It clearly takes a little more time but you can't wait

310
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,893
Wait a minute, Prosecutor Lee

311
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,064
There must be some misunderstanding.

312
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,107
Misunderstand?

313
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,443
But this is indeed your usual method, isn't it?

314
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,155
Creating misunderstandings, provoking conflicts and sowing discord

315
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,033
How about this, let’s meet and talk?

316
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,243
Next time

317
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,953
If there is a next time

318
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,422
Fuck it

319
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,267
The number you dialed is powered off
Will be transferred to voicemail

320
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,185
After the beep, the billing starts.

321
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,108
Hey, bastard
I asked you to call me back and you haven't called me yet?

322
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:51,195
Do you want me to give you your name?
Put it back on Interpol's wanted list?

323
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,948
Call me back right away

324
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,621
Section Chief Cha Young-do seems to be furious

325
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,458
Just say it.

326
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,086
There's no benefit in seeing each other all the time, right?

327

328
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,715

Wanted by Interpol

332
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,060
Cha Young-do helped clear his identity
Established a symbiotic relationship

333
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,313
A symbiotic relationship

334
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,440
In fact, it is just being used, isn't it?

335
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,154
I can help you stay in Korea

336
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,074
Not as Kanayama or Shimane

337
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
But in the identity of Jin Jilu

338
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,539
Why are you helping me?

339
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,542
There are people you need to kill.

340
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,795

00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,257
The route of action of Cha Young-do's men has been confirmed

342
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,094
Follow that car and you will find Cha Young Do

343
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,387
This is really the last time I help you

344
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,079
Where are the things?

345
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,747
I got it. I'm coming now.

346
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,083
Be careful not to be followed

347
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,584
Okay, I'll be there soon.

348
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,553

You are Chairman Li's son.

352

How did you find me?

353
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,687
No, you should ask why you came to me?

354
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,194
The police internal monitoring unit plans to investigate you.

355
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,114
I can help you suppress it.

356
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,077
Are you quite courageous?

357
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,332
So what do you want?

358
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,254

seat?

I want to merge Jiyun and Fengshan Group

361
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,970
Then take that seat.

362
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,077
What about the method?

363
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,372
Do you want to do it my way?

No

368

The most difficult is the South benchmark

372
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,902
He will definitely intervene

373
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,038
My father always told me

374
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,835
There are things he wants but can't get.

375
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:21,507
And I can get everything I want

376
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,427
The problem is

377
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,055
He never asked me

378
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,349
What do I want?

379
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,478
I'll say it again

380
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:41,527
I want both Jiyun and Fengshan

381
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,187
Use Gu Junmo

382
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,899
Removed Executive Director Nam Ki-seok

383
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,028
I'll say it again

384
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:28,908
I want both Jiyun and Fengshan

385
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,793
(Li Yuyun)

386
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,169
(Gu Fengshan)

387
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,340
(Li Jinshan)

388
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,842
Let's cooperate well in the future

389
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,470
Mr. Prosecutor

390
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:53,988
