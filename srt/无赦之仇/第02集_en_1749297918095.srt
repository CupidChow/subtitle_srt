1
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,946
(Sincerely condolences)

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,961
Are you okay?

3
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,047
The benchmark has come

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,301
South benchmark?

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,304
This name has a sense of age.

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,183
So he's still alive?

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,101
But he asked me a strange question

8
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,896
He asks about Ki-seok’s death
Is there anything else he should know?

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,528
My brother died suddenly.
Is it a weird question to ask?

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,781
I think it's normal

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,991
So I want to ask you

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,786
Is there anything else I should know about Ki-seok's death?

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,959
This is what I want to ask you

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:32,467
I heard that Executive Director Nam Ki-seok
I recently told you, the president, that I want to leave the company.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,137
You must be very unhappy, right?

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,140
You know I just like to worry about things.

17
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,521
Go check it out
Was Ki-seok's death caused by those guys?

18
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:47,982
yes

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,062
《Unforgiven Revenge》

20
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,233
Executive Director Nam Ki-seok is the second in command of the Gang-un Gang

21
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,819
He is also a key figure in corporatizing the organization.

22
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:39,033
He is believed to be in charge of running the gallery under Jiyun
Money laundering for the group

23
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,327
Going back further

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,872
The Yun Gang and the Fengshan Gang

25
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,209
The Panyongdong Gang, which once controlled Seoul,
Split

26
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,253
The leader of the Panyongdong Gang at that time was this person

27
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,380
President Wu

28
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,467
His right-hand men, Yi Yeon-yun and Gu Fengshan, rebelled.

29
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,596
Events that triggered the rebellion

30
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
The death of his son Wu Shengyuan

31
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,476
The current case of Nam Ki-seok is highly similar

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
You mean like back then?

33
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,732
Heir Nam Ki-seok is dead
Will this also lead to fierce conflict?

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,650
Are you overthinking it?

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,861
Overthinking?

36
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,282
The incident happened just five months before the presidential election.

37
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,161
Gang fight leaves dozens dead in central Seoul

38
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,414
Because of this matter
How many people have been dismissed from the police and prosecutors?

39
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,957
Did you know?

40
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,713
Nam Ki-seok's Case
Are you sure it was those guys who did it?

41
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,634
This is what the police report says

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,638
Don't use the police as an excuse
I'm asking you, are you sure?

43
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,182
I think...

44
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,353
You guys go out first.

45
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,270
Um?

46
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,147
Go out for a while

47
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,785
Prosecutor Li, please stay.

48
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,330
You finally got into the Special Investigation Department.

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,249
But they were treated as outsiders.

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,293
It's just a decoration at home.

51
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,840
I didn't even get a bowl of beef soup at the funeral yesterday.
Was rejected

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,760
Are you still monitoring me?

53
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,345
Surveillance?

54
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,805
You're not some great person.

55
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,848
I went to the funeral, too.

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,729
Chairman Li is not the same as before.

57
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,569
Wait until your father retires

58
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,657
You will resign as prosecutor.
Go to Jiyun Group to be a lawyer?

59
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,785
I never thought about it that way.

60
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,869
real?

61
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,955
But everyone here thinks so

62
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,252
At this point, should we be honest?

63
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,587
You are like this now

64
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,924
There's no way to climb up anymore.

65
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,929
But I didn't go to Jiyun Group
No one welcomes you, right?

66
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,890
What exactly do you want to say?

67
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
I'll give you a chance

68
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,531
The opportunity to choose your side and climb up

69
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,451
Nam Ki-seok's Case

70
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,078
Please do it for me

71
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,832
Where are you?

72
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,002
Brother, please listen to uncle, okay?

73
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,756
He's fine for now.

74
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,507
Speak

75
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,343
Who ordered you to do this?

76
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,017
good

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,438
damn it

78
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,941
You win

79
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,737
Uncle

80
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,281
Have you heard of the "tomb chamber"?

81
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,080
Oh, you are so old-fashioned

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,290
There is a chat room called "Tomb Room"

83
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,585
They specifically look for runaway kids like me to work for them.
Get some money to spend

84
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,046
But this time

85
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,757
Suddenly a big order came in

86
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,552
The highest amount of orders in the history of "Tomb Chamber"

87
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,971
I really don't know anything.

88
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
Just gave me a location and told me to kill someone.

89
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,560
It doesn't matter to me who the target is.

90
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,437
Right?

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
Are you done?

92
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,407
The bastards in the tomb
I got a lawyer.

93
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,659
Just ask the lawyer.

94
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,411
I'll call someone over for you.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,038
(Confession by Zheng Xican)

96
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,416
Well written.

97
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,751
I told you you could do it

98
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,505
Oh, I'll say one more thing.

99
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,590
Don't be clever

100
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,844
It's best to listen to professionals at this time.
Do you understand?

101
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,308
Wait a minute, lawyer.

102
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,479
goodbye

103
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,273

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,902
Yeah, I just got the confession.

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,613
Yeah, there shouldn't be any problem.

107
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
Once you enter the police station, you behave yourself.

108
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,036
Um

109

By the way, please transfer the balance as soon as possible.

Then you can start

112

Um

113
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,673
Okay, I'm hanging up.

Who are you?

116
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,769
I am the brother of the deceased Nam Ki-seok

117
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,697
Are you crazy?

118
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,993
Do you know where this is?

119
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,787
This is the police station. I'm a lawyer.

120
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,959
Are you going to threaten the lawyer here?

121
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,630
how?

122
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,883
Have you done anything to be threatened?

123
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,845
You know the "tomb chamber", right?

124
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,475
Okay, I'll tell you.

125
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,477
This so-called "tomb chamber"...

126
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,358
Just like the food delivery software that connects stores and riders

127
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,985
Connecting customers with scapegoats

128
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,447

Someone commits a crime but doesn't want to go to jail.

140
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,396
As long as you pay, someone is willing to take the blame and go to jail

141
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,730
When this demand and supply exist

142
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,067
The tomb connects them.

143
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,864
Demand has been strong, but supply is the key.

144
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,910
But there are many "tombs"
Teenagers who ran away from home and did not serve in the military

145
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
Hey! Something's happening in the tomb

146
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,414
- Is there something going on in the "tomb chamber"?
- Wait a moment

147
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,873
- What's going on?
- oops

148
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,294

But it will change to public indecency...

Let an expert like me finish.

You came here because you knew about this, right?

183
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,984
What's going on?

184
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,319
Take him out

185
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,196
Get this bastard out of here.

186
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,716
What about Jiyun Group? Still no movement?

187
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,634
Yes, we are monitoring it.

188
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,928
It seems that they plan to
Just treat this as a normal incident.

189
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
But just in case

190
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,559
Let the "tomb chamber" temporarily close

191
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,769
yes

192
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,943
(Headquarters Reception)

193
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,487
What's up?

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,531
Shen Chengyuan

195
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,871
What the fuck is going on? Who are you?

196
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,707
It's my South Base

197
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,418
Do you know why I called?

198
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm waiting for you

199
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,473
How could I forget the most important person?

200
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,932
Damn it

201
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,605
Hey, how many people are in the office now?

202
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,478
Go to hell!

203
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:42,988
Hold!

204
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
boss

205
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,233
Hey, look who's here!

206
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,528
Hey, long time no see!

207
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,780
Why

208
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,909
Get up, you unruly little brat!

209
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
hurry up!

210
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,542
Long time no see, Director Nan

211
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,085
wrong

212
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,462
What should I call you now?

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,465
Mr. Nam Ki-joon?

214
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,518
Benchmarks

215
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,980
Although I seem to be doing well now

216
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,483
But it's the same as when you were here before

217
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,028
They said, "Clean this up."
I said, "Yes."

218
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,113
They said, "Cover that side up."
I said, "Yes."

219
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,781
You understand, right?

220
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
I just followed orders.

221
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,747
So you already knew that the target was Kisik

222
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
Who said that? These bastards

223
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,418
I am taking orders as usual!

224
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,296
I really didn’t know!
At first, I was completely in the dark

225
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,217
But what can I do now that I have already received the money?

226
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,928
I…

227
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,805
I really had no choice.

228
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,974
Damn, my legs can't take it

229
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,228
I'm not crazy if I knew...

230
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,523
If I knew, I definitely wouldn't have accepted it.

231
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
Are you done?

232
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,404
Benchmark

233
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,282
Director Nan, can we please think about this rationally?

234
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,993
If I really wanted to kill him
Would you just send a few young boys there?

235
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,163
The opponent is Nam Ki-seok.
If I really want to kill him, I will definitely send a professional killer!

236
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,167
I didn't expect he was really dead.

237
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,090
Who is it?

238
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,135
Um?

239
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,180
I asked you who you are?

240
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,062
You know the benchmark.
In this line of work, credit comes first

241
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,858
If I leak the client's information
How will I live in the future...

242
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
If I told you you would be in trouble too

243
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,492
I will judge for myself

244
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,219
Gu Junmo

245
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,888
Chairman Gu Fengshan's son

246
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,390
It's his order.

247
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,329
how?

248
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,875
Do you want to go to war with the entire Fengshan Group alone?

249
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,303
real?

250
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,639
Are you sure it's Junmo?

251
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,391
Yes, sure

252
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,686
I'll get everyone ready.

253
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,480
Chairman Gu

254
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,442
I'll go meet Fengshan first

255
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
OK

256
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,211
Is it time for us to make our position clear?

257
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,129
Can Li Yunyun let us go?

258
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,092
Why not take this opportunity to draw a clear line with the Jiyun Group?

259
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,593
Completely stand on the side of Fengshan Group...

260
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,929
Shut up! You're giving me a headache!

261
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,264
I'll pay you a salary
Is it to let you chirp here?

262
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,645
I'm thinking carefully. Give me some peace.

263
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,689
The boss, Jin Chunxi, the director of Fengshan Group, is here.

264
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
Just say I'm not here

265
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,820
Brother Jiben was here last night, right?

266
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,030
I have no idea

267
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,033
Do I have to report everything to you?

268
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,035
Kisik's story

269
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,039
Did General Manager Gu entrust you with this?

270
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,625
Yeah fuck it!

271
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,918
I don’t care!

272
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,878
You guys made this mess yourself.
Clean up after yourselves!

273
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,004
Damn it.

274
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,138
go out

275
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
You son of a bitch

276
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,728
Still don't understand the situation?

277
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:12,568
Hey, why are you swearing?

278
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,528
How much does Benchmark know?

279
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,283
Don't try to bluff me. Answer me honestly. Come on, tell me now.

280
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,452
What Director Gu asked you to do
Does Benchmark know?

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,873
What do you want me to do?

282
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,669
Don't you know who Nan Ji Ben is?

283
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,462
What else can I do when Nan Jiben comes to see me?

284
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,548
What the hell are you talking about here, you bastard?

285
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,888
What about you?

286
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
Can it handle the South Standard?

287
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,605
damn it

288
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,487
That old witch is such a bullshit
Someone must take care of her.

289
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,165
What's going on?

290
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,460
President Li, you actually came to me first

291
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,593
When do we start
Sitting here drinking together?

292
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,764
It seems that I can't drink easily this time.

293
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,515
you tell me

294
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,186
Why can you and I
To meet peacefully like this?

295
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,814
Because of the rules

296
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,150
The rules we set when President Wu died

297
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,653
Yes

298
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,158
"Anyone who messes with the other party will have to pay the price"

299
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,871
Whoever messes up must pay the price

300
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,915
Either pay with your life

301
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,626
Or come up with something of equivalent value

302
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,505
oops

303
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,841
Stop beating around the bush.

304
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,135
Speak your mind

305
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,766
Even if it's your son

306
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,686
No exception

307
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,903
brother

308
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,031
What do you mean?

309
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,660
I heard that Ki-seok was in trouble.
What was the first thing that came to my mind?

310
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,664
"It must be an accident, someone didn't deliberately harm him.

311
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,749
It's just a bunch of ignorant kids getting into trouble."

312
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,002
Didn't you hear what I said?

313
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,586
What exactly do you want to say?

314
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,842
Your son Junmo asked Shen Chengyuan to do it.

315
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,220
So the benchmark was last night
We destroyed the N cleaning company.

316
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,474
You are responsible for this.

317
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,518
Do you think I didn't check?

318
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,190
Now you understand
Why did I mention that rule?

319
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,152
I see

320
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:05,032
But you haven't forgotten who that rule was made for, right?

321
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,911
If it weren't for Nan Ji's misfortune 11 years ago

322
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,205
There won't be such a rule.

323
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,208
What you just said

324
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,211
True or false

325
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,589
It'll cause big trouble.

326
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,301
How dare you threaten me with my son's life?

327
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,679
If you dare to touch a hair of Junmo

328
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,766
Do you think I'll just sit there and do nothing?

329
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,892
good

330
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,854
Now that you know the truth
You must act

331
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,898
Or you have no choice but to act.

332
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,736
Either let your son follow the rules
Either go to war with me

333
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,032
But Chairman Gu

334
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,161
I didn't come to you today to talk about this.

335
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:57,542
Didn’t I say that?
Benchmark wiped out N Cleaning Company

336
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,547
Don't you understand what's going to happen next?

337
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,426
- Benchmark Brother
- Are they in there?

338
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,669
I'll ask you one last time

339
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,714
Are you involved in Ki-seok's death?

340
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,508
South benchmark!

341
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
Please answer my question

342
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,013
You little bastard!

343
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,014
Benchmark

344
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,269
Your brother's death is not just your business.

345
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,147
It's also the business of Jiyun Group.

346
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,982
I'll take care of it

347
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,983
"deal with"

348
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,862
Does it mean handling it according to the rules?

349
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,613
You've already retired

350
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,575
The rules have nothing to do with you.

351
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,246
It will be handled according to the rules, right?

352
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,585
good

353
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,547
Shen Chengyuan and those little brats
We will solve it ourselves

354
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
Don't interfere

355
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,885
There's no need for that.

356
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,554
I already know...

357
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
Who is behind this?

358
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,153
President, you did not participate

359
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,280
Right?

360
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,995
I believe you didn't participate

361
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,841
In this case

362
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,469
Just don't do anything

363
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,305
Just watch

364
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,716
Let me make up for what Junmo did.

365
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,970
If you have any request, just tell me
Casino? Duty-free shop?

366
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,137
Or something else?

367
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,767
You can't just sit there and watch, can you?

368
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:06,064
You can't let Nan Ji Ben do this.

369
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,321
Do you want me to kill him?

370
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,202
If Joon-mo dies...

371
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,415
Our relationship ends here.

372
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,293
Remember what I said

373
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,880
Looks like this is the last time we drink together.

374
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
Here you go

375
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,935
Even if you start building a hotel now

376
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,854
You won't see the day when you can make money.

377
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,482
Why make it yourself?

378
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,068
Just take mine.

379
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,405
Hotel De Croo

380
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,743
You take it.

381
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,879
President...

382
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,007
You are here, President.

383
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,635
Did you really do this?

384
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,766
Did you do this?

385
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,559
Answer me!

386
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,772
Always know what you are talking about first
Can I answer that?

387
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,608
Nanjixi

388
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,569
Was it you who did this?

389
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,160
Damn it!

390
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,499
yes

391
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,085
I did it

392
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,795
What's wrong?

393
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,590
"What's wrong?"

394
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,717
"What's wrong?"

395
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,803
You little bastard!

396
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,730
It's not enough to attack the cab captain
Do you still want to touch Nam Ki-seok?

397
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,898
Why on earth?

398
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:22,617
That bastard cursed me in front of my men.

399
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,620
Just because of this?

400
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,331
Isn't it common for you to be scolded?

401
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,250
Haven’t you been scolded enough in your life?

402
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,502
What’s the big deal if I get scolded for one more day?

403
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,337
Did you see it?

404
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,633
Even my own father

405
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,680
They all treat me like a worthless piece of trash!

406
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,642
So I have to prove myself!

407
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,817
Why do you have to prove yourself?

408
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,403
Aren't you proud?

409
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,364
Isn’t he my son?

410
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,079
You really don't understand why I do this?

411
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,980
If you don't want to die in Nan Ji's hands

412
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,150
From now on, ask me before doing anything.

413
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,444
Do you understand?

414
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,785
Zhihao uses his waist to exert force

415
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,661
One Two

416
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,038
Give it a try

417
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,457
Are you here to play ball?

418
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,294
We have to teach the children this time.

419
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,254
Benchmarks

420
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,932
I went to the funeral

421
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,144
I thought I should say goodbye to Ki Seok.

422
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,149
But I don't want to meet those bastards
So I left after not staying for long.

423
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,820
Was Ki-sik being plotted against?

424
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,864
You know who it is, right?

425
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,578
Ki-seok came to see me before the incident

426
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,706
Did he say anything?

427
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,709
Nothing

428
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,670
But I can see

429
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,755
Something is not right

430
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:48,847
So now I need a bat
Just like the one I had before

431
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,066
Ok no problem

432
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,738
It takes a while to make a bat

433
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,412
This is for you first

434
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,339
The person in trouble is not an ordinary person, but Director Nan

435
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,803
If we just leave it like this, brothers can't accept it

436
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,764
Are we going to go to war with Fengshan Group?

437
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,479
The cost is not worth the gain

438
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,523
If the president sets this precedent, then...

439
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,441
Why!

440
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,612
I'm tired

441
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,608
What's wrong?

442
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,693
Why are you here?

443
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,279
I have something to say to the president.

444
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,823
Is that so?

445
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,329
Okay what's up?

446
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,914
Tell me

447
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,670
Talk to me

448
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,343
Didn't I already tell you that?

449
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,554
He had a conflict with Gu Junmo that day and then...

450
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,516
He was killed that night.

451
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,312
I understand that I have to wait until the funeral is over.

452
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,440
But it’s time for the president to deal with it now, right?

453
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,778
He knew it was Gu Junmo who did it

454
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,614
What?

455
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,451
We can only do what the boss wants.

456
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,413
So he doesn't do anything? You have no problem with that?

457
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,330
Why!

458
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,293
Don't forget your identity

459
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,131
Yeah, I know my identity.

460
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,093
You must feel great, right?

461
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,348
Soon I will be able to take Kisik's seat.

462
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,944
Head

463
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,448
I can't bear to watch it.

464
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm teaching him the rules.

465
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,621
But hitting people like this isn’t a good idea, right?
Like a gangster

466
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,095
This is a company matter and has nothing to do with you, the prosecutor.

467
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,395
What do you think, Director?

468
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,692
Will it really be worth the effort?

469
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,507
This is my business

470
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,926
Don't worry about it

471
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,720
The company decided not to process

472
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,973
You should obey the decision.

473
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,475
yes

474
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,062
Someone told me the same thing.

475
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,065
Said to do as the boss said

476
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,362
But I will never treat this kind of person as a boss

477
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,326
This isn't just your business.

478
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,204
It's my business too.

479
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,259
Damn, I'm starving.

00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,103

- What's wrong?

489
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,297
No, he keeps looking.

490
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,631

- Looks exactly the same)

I haven't found anyone yet but I'm already talking about the price

496
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,683

Damn it!

500

501
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,049
Oh I found it!

502
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,550
real?

504
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,230

I knew he would get into trouble sooner or later.

Are you sure it's Junmo?

509
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,968
To confirm that Bongsan Group’s General Manager Gu Junmo

510
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,846
He hired N Cleaning Company to kill Executive Director Nam Ki-seok

511
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,475
I knew he would get into trouble sooner or later.

512

Do you know the benchmark?

513
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,397
Well, he has already wiped out N Cleaning Company.

514
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,483
But President

515
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,362
This may not be the end but the beginning

516
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:07,326
The rules were set 11 years ago when Nam Ji-joong left.

517
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,289
Now that he's back, it's time to redefine the rules.

518
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,623
What?

519
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
What I mean is

520
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,169
Or follow the old rules

521
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,339
Let Gu Junmo pay with his life

522
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,385
Either you make a deal with Chairman Gu
Let this matter pass.

It's not Nam Joo-jung nor Gu Bong-san

528
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,819
But President You

529
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,614
So please remember

530
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,410
You didn't have a choice in the past

531
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,831
But now it all depends on your decision
