1
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,038
What's up with all those kids?

2
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,372
It's a taekwondo demo team.

3
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,833
Sit down. Put your seat belt on. Hey!

4
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,129
Flight B357 which departed Incheon
and headed to Morocco last night,

5
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,673
crashed down into the Moroccan seas.

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,967
It was announced by the airline

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,554
that all 211 passengers,
including the cabin crew,

8
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,264
were killed in this accident.

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,891
They say,

10
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,852
even the falling leaves can cause trouble
in the final years.

11
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,523
Look at all the troubles I'm facing
with only a year left to go.

12
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,942
It must have been a tiring trip.

13
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,903
I'm Go Hae-ri from the Korean Embassy
in Morocco.

14
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,322
This bastard is alive

15
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,325
from the plane crash.

16
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,537
What you're saying is...

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
-The plane crash was--
-An act of terrorism.

18
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,876
You were right. The plane was attacked.

19
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,214
Don't do anything. Those people...

20
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,466
They are terrifying...

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,385
Who are those big shots?

22
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,679
Why did they kill
all those innocent people?

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,933
There is an accomplice. It's Kim Woo-gi,
the co-pilot of the plane.

24
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,685
Where is Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot?

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
Why are you doing this to me?

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,606
You don't trust John &amp; Mark, do you?

27
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Did you get every penny from John &amp; Mark?

28
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,446
I have what we need to find Kim Woo-gi.

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,699
The estimated location of Kim Woo-gi

30
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,411
is a slum in the northwest region
of Tangier, Morocco.

31
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,954
Get ready and get moving.

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,040
What's going on?

33
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,585
Give me everything you know
about Kim Woo-gi.

34
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
Check your sections

35
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,381
and find out if an Asian man
has been buying lots of water.

36
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,507
I found them.

37
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,467
Can't we just talk in Korean?

38
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,097
-Mr. Kim Woo-gi.
-Kim Woo-gi is in custody.

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,893
Kim Woo-gi will be dead tomorrow.

40
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,693
We were ambushed.

41
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,529
It's going to be difficult
to take Kim Woo-gi back home.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,656
Are you going to operate?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,335
Dear citizens.

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,214
Our nation has developed

45
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,383
by using its hardships and challenges
as a stepping-stone

46
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,469
to take a leap forward.

47
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,184
"Our people have been strong
in hard times,

48
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,811
and brave in challenging times."

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,315
Wow.

50
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,734
I love this sentence.

51
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,030
"We have overcome crises by joining hands

52
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,575
with one another
and that is a beautiful tradition,

53
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
only a few other countries have.

54
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,663
During the currency crisis,

55
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,916
we gathered scraps of gold
from our wardrobes

56
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,501
with our own hands!

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,046
It was those hands put together

58
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,259
that saved the Republic of Korea
from such crises."

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,636
Did you confirm this speech, Yun?

60
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,097
-Yes.
-What is wrong?

61
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,350
I can't find anything awkward
about this speech.

62
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,813
I say we revise all the verbs. Verbs need
to convey power but this is too weak.

63
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,068
For example, instead of "we will commit"
"we must commit" is more powerful.

64
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,613
The Quintilian method.
Isn't that too old-fashioned?

65
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,951
Do you think this is about the method?

66
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,913
No, I'm saying that you don't get
the target and the goal of this speech.

67
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
What are you suggesting,
that I don't understand?

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,043
Who's the target of this speech?

69
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,462
The opposition party
opposing the budget revision.

70
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,298
So what?

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,925
We don't convince those fellows,
we threaten them.

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,719
That is the goal of this speech.

73
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,306
This is just too weak.
It's not even convincing enough.

74
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,141
The budget proposal will be passed.

75
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,394
Is it necessary to arouse the people
in this state of affairs?

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,898
It's the nature of the people to want
a powerful leader in difficult times.

77
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,943
But I see no sticks in your speech,
only carrots.

78
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,655
How will you control the public
when a more pressing time comes?

79
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,450
That's Goebbels' logic from World War II.

80
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,161
It might make the President
look like Hitler--

81
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,080
I think it's for the best
to fix the entire speech, sir.

82
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,376
You need to rethink the concept, Yun.

83
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,796
"We need to spend a trillion won
in this F-X plan,

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,673
or our national security fails.

85
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,967
Should something go wrong
and a war breaks out,

86
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,596
it will be because the opposition party
voted against the budget."

87
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,098
The public will be watching,

88
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,893
so the President should show
at least this much charisma.

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,523
You should fix the budget speech,
Prime Minister Hong.

90
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,275
Me?

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,112
You wrote my speeches
for my presidential election campaign.

92
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,408
If it gets a sophisticated touch
by someone like you,

93
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,204
I would feel relieved.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,165
-Mr. President--
-Yes, sir. As you wish.

95
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,150
Done.

96
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,860
Good job.

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,530
Good job, sir.

98
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,040
What?

99
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,001
-What?
-What's wrong with him?

100
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,838
-What's wrong?
-What the...

101
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,674
Doctor, he's suddenly convulsing!
What's happening to him?

102
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,261
He bled too much.
Without a blood transfusion, he could die.

103
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,638
Kim Woo-gi, wake up!

104
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,307
-What's your blood type?
-It's O.

105
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,521
-How do you know?
-I read all about him before coming here.

106
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,608
Mine is O, too. Give him my blood.

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,031
Hang in there. Don't fucking die.

108
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,743
Take my blood now!

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,509
How is Kim Woo-gi?

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,012
He's touch-and-go.

111
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
Why don't you get some sleep?

112
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Never mind me. You can sleep.

113
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,077
Those glaring eyes of yours
make me uncomfortable.

114
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,080
I know how to go without sleep
for twelve days.

115
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,252
You should've joined the circus.
Could've been rich by now.

116
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,797
Girl.

117
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,008
Don't be sarcastic.

118
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,718
Or I'll crush your mouth.

119
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,846
If there is a guy who can crush my mouth,

120
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,974
I'd propose to him.

121
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,144
Men these days.

122
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,939
They are a bunch of chickens.

123
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,191
I'm never touching your mouth, then.

124
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,343
We should stop now.
It's too risky for you.

125
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,427
Leave it.

126
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,222
I'm perfectly fine.

127
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,724
You die if you lose more
than two liters of blood!

128
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,393
Do I have a choice?

129
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,103
That bastard...

130
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,939
If he dies,

131
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,942
I will never know
why my nephew was killed.

132
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,843
Kim Woo-gi. Wake up!

133
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,520
He's not going to die,
take the needle out.

134
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,113
Are you okay?

135
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm fine.

136
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,414
You're not fine.

137
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,625
Let's get you laid down, okay?

138
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,798
You will need it.

139
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,514
Eat it. Come on.

140
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,016
I don't like sweet food.

141
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,853
We don't need another patient.

142
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,191
Eat if you don't want to slow us down.

143
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:58,282
He's right. Eat. Here.

144
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,134
The situation doesn't look good.

145
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,681
If a video suggesting Kim is alive
is uploaded online,

146
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,516
it will hit us hard.

147
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,187
I think you should stop
with such useless concerns.

148
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,276
This is a secret mission
that only a few know about,

149
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,071
and I control that team
so what is there to worry?

150
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,032
But you can't control Cha Dal-geon.

151
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,744
You can never guess
what that wacko is up to.

152
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,125
If you can't hide it,
revealing it can be another way.

153
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,296
Here comes Mister Shadow himself.

154
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,550
What do you mean by that?

155
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,220
We have a hidden card up our sleeves.

156
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,013
You must have forgotten.

157
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,308
A hidden card?

158
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,319
O Sang-mi is one of the easiest people
to control.

159
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,781
The greedier you are,

160
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,284
the easier you fall for temptations.

161
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,746
So use her to nullify all the evidence?

162
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,581
But there is one condition.

163
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,126
It won't work if Kim Woo-gi is alive.

164
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,880
It will be hard to get rid of him
while he's at the embassy.

165
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,345
Man, I can't keep quiet anymore.

166
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,017
I was going to take care of this
without sharing it with you guys.

167
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,897
Before Gang was arrested,
he did something very commendable.

168
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,570
He said he'll send a backup team
to the embassy.

169
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,285
The mercenaries can't get in there,
but our agents will be welcomed.

170
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,747
The embassy is the best place
to deal with it quietly, right?

171
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,916
Well, then.

172
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,254
-Could we bring forward the schedule?
-Yes, you should. As much as you want.

173
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,007
You can think of Kim as a dead man.

174
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,445
Mr. Min told us you'd come.

175
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,239
Come this way.

176
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,325
Wait for me here.

177
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,395
It must have been hard,
staying in such a harsh place.

178
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,815
You know me, right?

179
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,109
John &amp; Mark's Director of Asia.

180
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,407
It was you?

181
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,411
You kidnapped me and kept me here.

182
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,539
Do you really think
you can get away with this?

183
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,794
You make it sound
like you are an innocent person.

184
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,380
You're an accomplice
in the terror attack.

185
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,673
You people did it.

186
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,759
It was you people!

187
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,763
You were the ones
who talked my husband into it!

188
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,518
Do you know why humans have
only one mouth but two ears?

189
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,606
We are designed to talk less
and listen carefully.

190
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:05,112
I haven't even got to my point
and you're already running your mouth.

191
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,072
I don't care what you say.

192
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,535
You can try to persuade me all you want
but whatever it is you want,

193
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,163
I'm not giving it to--

194
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,958
Persuade you?

195
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,668
Don't be stupid.

196
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,962
I don't persuade.

197
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,381
I'm not that generous.

198
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,217
Listen.

199
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,804
If you leave here with me, you will live.

200
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
If you stay,

201
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,477
those beasts outside will come in here

202
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,979
and rip you apart into pieces.

203
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,524
So that there's no trace of you.

204
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,448
Those eyes are telling me
that you will die soon.

205
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,623
Spare me.

206
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,795
Please...

207
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,361
Find Chief Yang
in the Intelligence Division.

208
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,030
He will take care of everything.

209
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,245
An opportunity...

210
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,165
is like a bird sitting on a tree.

211
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,920
Catch it before it flies away.

212
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,758
Please,

213
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,636
please keep your word.

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,015
Please, please keep your word, too.

215
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,683
Ms. O Sang-mi.

216
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,620
SEOUL POLICE STATION

217
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,380
Can we trust her?

218
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,884
I wouldn't if she was dumb.

219
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,636
But she is a smart woman.

220
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,279
Chief Yang, Intelligence Division.

221
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,156
What do you need him for?

222
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,116
I'm turning myself in.

223
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm O Sang-mi.

224
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,369
What?

225
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,246
I'm probably on the wanted list...

226
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,665
for taking down the plane.

227
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,586
Oh, please come in.

228
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,386
There's a vehicle at twelve o'clock.
Eleven o'clock.

229
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,472
Ten o'clock.

230
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,351
Two o'clock.

231
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,609
Three vans and a sedan.

232
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,071
If we count in the blind spots,

233
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,074
we have 20 minimum
to 30 maximum.

234
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,078
I bet they're all armed
with heavy weapons.

235
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,579
This is way too intense.

236
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,500
We can't even trust the cops here.
What should we do?

237
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,795
PRESIDENT

238
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,713
Yes, sir.

239
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,799
NIS DIRECTOR GENERAL AN GI-DONG

240
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,843
Gang briefed me on the current status.

241
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,679
How is Kim Woo-gi doing right now?

242
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,556
The worst is over.

243
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,474
I believe he is going to live.

244
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,395
Are you still in a standoff?

245
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,649
Yes, and we are completely isolated
from the outside.

246
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,235
When will the backup team arrive?

247
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
They are leaving soon. Wait for two days.

248
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,873
Chief Gang's not answering my calls.
Is something going on?

249
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,713
He's busy working on Jessica's arrest.

250
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,715
You can communicate with me
until tomorrow.

251
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,802
Do not take any action
until the backup team arrives.

252
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,557
-If something happens, call me right away.
-Yes, sir.

253
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:50,397
Argh, Kim Woo-gi, that bastard...
He is holding up for too long.

254
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,859
It would have been great for all of us
if he just died.

255
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,153
Any word from Yun?

256
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,324
Excuse me? About what?

257
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,828
No matter how I look at it,

258
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,415
going behind the President's back
and doing this--

259
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,502
What is up with you, sir? I told you
Yun will take care of everything.

260
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,593
To be honest, he is the one
who provides girls to the President.

261
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,887
Trusting the second-in-command
is a safe bet.

262
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,222
Don't you think so?

263
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,044
RESTRICTED AREA

264
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
The door is now open.

265
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,509
The Chief is here.

266
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,808
Hwang Pil-yong.

267
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,352
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,855
You know that I consider you
the best among the Blacks, right?

269
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,732
Thank you.

270
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,277
The fate of the NIS is now in your hands.

271
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,654
Kim Woo-gi and Cha Dal-geon.

272
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,739
Those two must die.

273
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,369
How should I deal with Gi
and the other agents?

274
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,455
Isn't it obvious?

275
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,458
Get rid of them if they get in the way.

276
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,670
Isn't that a basic rule of our missions?

277
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,339
Don't worry too much.

278
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,967
You will not be taking the blame.

279
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,469
The ones in charge, like me,
will take responsibility.

280
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,972
Okay?

281
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:48,932
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,269
Do you know why

283
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,813
this operation is named "Silk Road"?

284
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,858
The journey itself is long and dangerous,

285
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,194
but when you get back,
there will be a big reward.

286
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,740
Good luck!

287
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,916
Got toilet paper in the toilet?

288
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,464
Even the world's worst criminals
are allowed to take a dump, guys.

289
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,007
Open it.

290
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,686
Why don't you come in and watch me?

291
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
Get on with it, sir.

292
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,665
Chief, there's a problem.

293
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,344
This is Bae Dong-chan
from Pyeonghwa Daily.

294
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,138
This is Gang Ju-cheol.
Are you at the Blue House?

295
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,016
Yes. What is going on?

296
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,478
We found Kim Woo-gi in Morocco.
But people are trying to kill him.

297
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,437
What?

298
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,735
Go on.

299
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,496
Gang Ju-cheol, that crazy nut job...

300
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,793
Hey, Gang!

301
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,378
What are you doing?

302
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,215
-Gang Ju-cheol!
-Can you pass that onto the President?

303
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,134
I'll make it happen.

304
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,094
Are you cleaning the toilet?

305
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,682
TEAM THAT ARRESTED KIM WOO-GI
IN MOROCCO

306
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,225
AT RISK OF BEING ASSASSINATED

307
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,318
You could always have your men
do the cleaning.

308
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,989
Aren't you too old to be doing chores?
Huh?

309
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,533
Hey! Stay back.

310
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,494
Shit.

311
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,876
Stop right there.

312
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,962
-Take the phone.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,553
You are a piece of work.

314
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,138
NO CALL HISTORY

315
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,308
Who were you calling?

316
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,976
Your mother.

317
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,270
I told her you're a bad boy.

318
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,857
Fucker!

319
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,195
Take this and find out who he called.

320
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,746
Who?

321
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,790
Bae Dong-chan from Pyeonghwa Daily.
He's a Blue House journalist.

322
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,710
Can't you even handle Gang Ju-cheol?
What the hell!

323
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,406
Ms. Seo.

324
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,040
That memo... Hand it over.

325
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,130
I need to give it to the President myself.

326
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,299
Give it.

327
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,848
-No, sir.
-Seo Yeong-ji!

328
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,642
What's going on?

329
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,190
What do you have there?

330
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,151
It's confidential information.

331
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,946
A Pyeonghwa Daily reporter
wanted to relay to the President.

332
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,698
Let me see.

333
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,745
I said let me see it.

334
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,794
You're opening a Pandora's box.

335
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
Don't read it,

336
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,302
if you're not confident enough
to handle it.

337
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,224
It could become big trouble, even for you.

338
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,877
It seems that...

339
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,921
we now share a secret.

340
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,201
Hey there, friend.

341
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,540
I have so many worries thanks to you.

342
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,627
You arrested me
but there are no charges against me.

343
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,006
And releasing me would be too risky,
even with a confidentiality agreement.

344
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,301
Can you call it a shoe factory
if it has no shoes in it?

345
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,595
What do you mean, no charges?

346
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,389
This is a factory for charges.

347
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,812
Senior Secretary Yun Han-gi
is the one holding your leash, right?

348
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,691
What are you going to do?

349
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,736
Now that Kim Woo-gi is found,
that boat you're on is about to sink.

350
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,241
You are so stupid.

351
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,537
I wasn't going to tell you about this.

352
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,374
But Kim Woo-gi...

353
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,918
is not coming back home.

354
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,255
I sent a backup team to Morocco.

355
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,882
The team I had handpicked myself.

356
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,635
You piece of shit.

357
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,487
Um...

358
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,491
I already signed the agreement
on keeping my mouth shut.

359
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:08,788
That's the classified intel Gang shared
with North Korea's Security Department.

360
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,585
But why are you showing this to me?

361
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,004
Because you are the eyewitness.

362
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,760
There is a signature block
on the last page.

363
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,052
Stamp your thumbprint.

364
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,434
What's going to happen
if I stamp my thumbprint here?

365
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,935
You seriously don't know?

366
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,022
He'll be punished for violating
the Security Act,

367
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,566
and you will be considered
as one of my own.

368
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,657
Why? Don't like it?

369
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,368
I'm not forcing you.

370
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,872
There are plenty of people
who can do it instead.

371
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,551
Aren't you reading it first?

372
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,429
It would take me ages.

373
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,056
NIS NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

374
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,610
Escort Chief Gang, down to the basement.

375
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,831
And you.

376
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,585
You might have to take the stand
as a witness.

377
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,628
That's okay, right?

378
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,880
I have no other wishes,

379
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,259
but to keep my job for a long time
working under you.

380
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,054
This kind of attitude from my subordinate.

381
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,682
I love it very much.

382
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,688
If you liked it so much,
could you allow me a few days off?

383
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,815
Don't you know that we're short-handed?

384
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,693
Get back to your work.

385
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,111
Of course, sir.

386
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,238
You have to work to get paid.

387
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,823
Screw vacation.

388
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,200
Thank you, sir.

389
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,512
Jang Cheol-su, come out.

390
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,693
Where are they taking us one by one?

391
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,948
They'll make you sign an agreement
before getting back to work.

392
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,410
I'm the only person
that Min wants to take out.

393
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,413
Then what should I do?

394
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,419
No matter what they ask from you,
just do as they say.

395
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,090
That's the only way we can save
Gi Tae-ung and Go Hae-ri.

396
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,890
Thank you for listening.

397
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,644
Hoon, you're next.

398
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,580
When I grow up, I want to be...

399
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,290
my uncle.

400
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,042
Keep it down, kids.

401
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,963
Do you want to become a stuntman
like your uncle?

402
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,464
No.

403
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,882
Then?

404
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,012
My mother left me at the orphanage.

405
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,183
But my uncle took me in and raised me.

406
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,563
He swears a lot...

407
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,733
and spits on the streets...

408
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:12,949
but to me, my uncle is the greatest person
in the world.

409
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,705
So my dream is to be like him...

410
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,168
and take care of him when I grow up.

411
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,267
Jin-hee!

412
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,519
-Ji-su!
-Mom!

413
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,520
Se-hyeon!

414
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,358
Hoon!

415
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,193
Hoon.

416
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,570
Hoon!

417
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,477
Hoon...

418
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,190
Hey, Cha Hoon!

419
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,692
Hoon?

420
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:35,907
Hoon...

421
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,743
Hoon!

422
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,364
Oh, you're awake. How are you?

423
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,574
-I'm good.
-I see.

424
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,576
Where is Hae-ri?

425
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,954
In the kitchen, cooking some healthy food.

426
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,914
Alright.

427
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,357
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,610
Don't be discouraged. Cheer up!

429
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,364
Elsa.

430
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
What would we have done without you?

431
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,335
I wish I had a sister like Elsa.

432
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,703
Don't interrupt her.

433
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,252
Let her deal with it alone.

434
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,298
That will make her stronger.

435
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,773
-Ta-da!
-Wow!

436
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,691
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

437
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,445
I cooked lamb because there's no pork.
I'm not sure how it'll taste.

438
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,371
Wow. It's so good.

439
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,665
This is amazing!

440
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,419
Mr. Gi has never failed his operations.

441
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,798
When the backup team arrives,
we are taking Kim back to Korea.

442
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,841
So don't you worry, okay?

443
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,770
You lost a lot of blood today.
You should eat and recover.

444
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,025
Don't worry about me and eat.

445
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,242
You should eat well
and get well, too, sir.

446
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:10,955
It's so delicious.

447
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,542
This tastes like a whole new dish.

448
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,506
Why are there only three eggs?

449
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,634
We only had three eggs left.
You can have them. I'm fine.

450
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,177
Go Hae-ri.

451
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:27,930
Take mine.

452
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,726
That's okay. You should have it.

453
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,437
I'm allergic to eggs. You can have it.

454
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,355
Oh, dear.

455
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,357
You're allergic to eggs?

456
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,362
Last time you worked out,
I saw you eating a bunch of boiled eggs.

457
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,990
The allergy must come and go or something.

458
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,583
I said I'm okay. I cooked it for you.

459
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,628
-If you're not having it--
-Mix it.

460
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,631
Mix it well, okay?

461
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,971
Man, look at this soup.
I've never seen anything like it.

462
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,270
AGREEMENT

463
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,527
I've signed it.

464
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,820
LIES CAN'T BEAT THE TRUTH

465
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,821
Thank you.

466
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,031
WE NEVER GIVE UP

467
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,619
I hope this agreement could bring

468
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
some comfort to your hearts.

469
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,753
How is the lawsuit going
against John &amp; Mark?

470
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,672
It will start this week.

471
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,590
I see.

472
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,136
I guess I'm late.

473
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,517
Coming early wouldn't have made
a difference.

474
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,560
That agreement...

475
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,063
will soon turn into a complaint.

476
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,817
Hey, how dare you come into this place?

477
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,943
Get the hell out.

478
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,486
Get out before I throw you!

479
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,863
Mr. Park!

480
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,450
O Sang-mi is holding
a press conference now.

481
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,869
Did you say O Sang-mi?

482
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,746
Why is she holding a press conference?

483
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,456
-What?
-She's shameless.

484
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,127
Turn on the TV.
I bet it's going to be interesting.

485
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,547
This is ridiculous.

486
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,760
REPRESENTATIVE
OF B357 BEREAVED FAMILIES

487
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,053
I am here today...

488
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,721
URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

489
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,974
standing before you all

490
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,853
because I have a confession to make
with a heavy heart.

491
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,523
I solemnly swear that what I'm about
to say is nothing

492
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,775
but the truth.

493
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,531
My husband, Kim Woo-gi...

494
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,535
is alive.

495
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,289
-What is she saying?
-But he's dead!

496
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,259
Kim Woo-gi...

497
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:11,969
will die soon.

498
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,181
My husband

499
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,766
was accused of crashing the plane.

500
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,479
And it is true.

501
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,482
If he dies,
you will receive his five billion won,

502
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,692
which adds up to ten billion in total.

503
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,612
The company that offered

504
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,698
ten billion won to my husband
for taking down the plane

505
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,366
was not John &amp; Mark.

506
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,160
If you say no,

507
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,913
you'll die here right now.

508
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,582
It was Dynamic.

509
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,211
-What the hell?
-Mr. Park, what is she saying?

510
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,670
Dynamic offered me

511
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,215
ten billion won to lie

512
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,760
and say that John &amp; Mark
had ordered the bombing

513
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,095
to my husband.

514
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,097
This is your last chance.

515
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,611
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

516
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,532
The entire truth...

517
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,828
will be revealed in court.

518
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,831
Can you tell us who it was
that directly gave the orders?

519
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,917
Please give us the details!

520
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,296
Please tell us the truth!

521
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:46,021
O revealed in a press conference
that the B357 bombing

522
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,107
was orchestrated by Dynamic System

523
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,360
to win the Next Generation Fighter Plan.

524
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,780
Civic groups and the opposition party
have officially called upon

525
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,742
the government and prosecution
to investigate and find out

526
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,869
who exactly is behind the plane crash.

527
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,002
I'll never forget
the humiliation I faced...

528
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,504
at the NIS.

529
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,883
That was a surprising twist.

530
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,428
Bold and sophisticated.

531
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,388
But...

532
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,682
foolish.

533
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,810
Do you still have a card to draw?

534
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,438
You're asking for an all-out war,

535
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,357
but you should know better, Jessica.

536
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,069
You've seen what happened to those
who crossed me.

537
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,865
Never have mercy,

538
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,992
but always take revenge.

539
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,161
That's right.

540
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,413
No mercy for you.

541
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,499
Glad I came.

542
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,545
I was actually worried
that you might give in.

543
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,839
But this is what I wanted.

544
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,385
To me,

545
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,555
this is much more enjoyable.

546
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,773
Good luck.

547
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,490
I mean it, Jessica.

548
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,331
I'm hungry.
What should we have for dinner?

549
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,921
The survivors must live on.
Lighten up, people!

550
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,383
-What do you want?
-Shall I order from the same place?

551
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,468
Aren't you sick of rice and soup?

552
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,389
This is my treat.
How does roast chicken sound?

553
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,683
Are you really paying for it?

554
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,602
For god's sake.
I just got out of jail, man!

555
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,896
Chickens are no big deal.

556
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,649
Hang on...

557
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,068
There is a great chicken place
around here.

558
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,445
Hold on.

559
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,950
Let's see...

560
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,077
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN

561
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,332
How many of Gang's minions
are left in the building?

562
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,293
There are five we are watching,
including Gong Hwa-suk.

563
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,966
Keep your eye on them.
Don't let them out of your sight.

564
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,883
Yes, sir.

565
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,359
This is Bullet Chicken.
We deliver chicken faster than a bullet.

566
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,697
Oh, hello?
Do you have the chicken I'm looking for?

567
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,949
What was the name? It was...

568
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,661
"Vagabond", I believe it was?

569
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,792
Yes, we have those. Place your order.

570
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,881
Two seasoned chickens
and two classic chickens, please.

571
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,091
I'll be paying with card.
How long will it take?

572
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,427
Okay.

573
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,936
Jang-su!

574
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,824
Don't you get sick of chicken?

575
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,409
Get out.

576
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:28,911
Okay.

577
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,415
I told you not to go in there.
You might get locked inside.

578
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,209
I like it dark.

579
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,879
If you like it dark, you should stay in
your room and keep your eyes closed.

580
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,423
It's a delivery.

581
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,760
It's not just a delivery.

582
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,220
It's a signal.

583
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,190
Wow.

584
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,737
Hey, that was so quick!

585
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,615
I'll take that.

586
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,951
-Jae-yeong, take these upstairs.
-Yes, ma'am.

587
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,411
How much?

588
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,372
It's 64 million won.

589
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,331
Sixty-four...

590
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,418
You mean 64 thousand, right?

591
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,879
-Yes!
-Here is my card.

592
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,470
-Signature.
-Yes, let me.

593
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,768
Your payment was successful.

594
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,026
-Goodbye.
-Yes, thank you.

595
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,865
"Bullet Chicken"?

596
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,242
What is that?

597
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,579
It's a secret base that only Gi and I use.

598
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,499
When Code Zero strikes,
call Bullet Chicken.

599
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,046
The codename is...

600
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,424
"Vagabond."

601
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,532
Hey.

602
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,368
Were you high on the plane as well?

603
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,457
Was it Jerome?

604
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,167
The terrorist.

605
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,838
How did you meet him?

606
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,132
Wow, you're so energetic.

607
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,886
Look at you, working out
after giving me blood...

608
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,272
That pisses me off, alright?

609
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,192
Giving blood and making porridge
for a scum like you.

610
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,986
It's all fucked up.

611
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,866
You said you're pleading the Fifth, right?

612
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,577
While you're with me,

613
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,497
I'm going to make you feel
like you want to die.

614
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,291
So let's see who wins.

615
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,421
Dal-geon!

616
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,466
The backup team's here.

617
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,728
They're finally here.

618
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,778
Are you out of your mind?

619
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,530
You told me you don't sleep.

620
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,324
You were dozing off all the time
like a sick chicken.

621
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,784
So you tear off my skin?

622
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,956
The stakeout. It ends today.

623
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,224
What's up?

624
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,351
It's weird.

625
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,770
Why are they letting the backup team in?

626
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,482
Maybe they have no other choice.
They don't want to take the risk.

627
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,694
But they came at us
like there's no tomorrow.

628
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,583
Good to see you.

629
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,084
You've been through a lot.

630
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,503
I'm Go Hae-ri. Thank you for coming.

631
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,257
This is Cha Dal-geon...

632
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,425
I've heard about you.

633
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,595
You've done a great job
together with Agent Go.

634
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,393
The local government will be
sending support, by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

635
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,437
Do we have to wait until then?

636
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,651
I think a helicopter is all we need
to get away from here right now.

637
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,822
I understand your concern.

638
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,241
But now that we're here, don't worry.

639
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,714
Where is Kim Woo-gi?

640
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,508
Take him to the room.

641
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,426
Please follow me.

642
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,359
What's wrong?

643
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,737
-They are not Chief Gang's men.
-What?

644
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,163
Yes. What's the matter?

645
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,957
I have a message for you.

646
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,917
Did the backup team arrive?

647
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,502
Yes.

648
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,170
They're assassins.

649
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,676
TAE-UNG, BACKUP TEAM, ASSASSINATION

650
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,763
Don't die. This isn't part of the message.
It's from me.

651
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,015
Come for chicken when you get back.

652
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,943
PRESIDENT

653
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,991
Yes, Director.

654
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,034
Is the backup team there?

655
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,661
Yes.

656
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,166
Listen to me carefully.

657
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,210
They're there to kill Kim Woo-gi.

658
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,256
And Cha Dal-geon, too.

659
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,175
Cooperate with Hwang.

660
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,843
On whose orders?

661
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,265
I know it's not coming from you.

662
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,725
Who gave this pathetic order?

663
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,018
Gi Tae-ung!

664
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,356
Think wisely.

665
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,360
Do as I say or you, Go Hae-ri
and the others will get killed.

666
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,823
What if I take out the backup team?

667
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,076
You'll become a traitor.

668
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,038
Min is back in the TF team

669
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,665
and Gang was arrested
for benefiting our enemy.

670
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,085
Mark my words.

671
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,675
This is your country's order.

672
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,272
What is happening here, sir?

673
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,834
We will use this room.

674
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,879
As for Kim, we will protect him.

675
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,049
I can't let you do that.

676
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,179
Until he stands in court,
I'm staying with him.

677
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,308
Then we'll have to share the room,
Mr. Cha.

678
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,771
It's our job to protect you, too.

679
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,900
I would prefer to be
under Agent Go's protection.

680
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,320
This is an emergency.

681
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,197
Should the enemies strike in--

682
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,074
That's exactly why I prefer Go.

683
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,120
She has amazing skills.

684
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,957
Mr. Cha...

685
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,044
-As long as we are here, you must follow--
-We have a room for you.

686
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,469
I don't think this room
is big enough anyway.

687
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,805
You can use a bigger room.

688
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,870
Get some sleep.

689
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,913
I'll be on guard.

690
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,791
That guy I talked with...

691
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,251
You mean Hwang?

692
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,838
I have doubts about him, too, but...

693
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,257
I'm heading out.

694
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,976
We have two targets.
Kim Woo-gi and Cha Dal-geon.

695
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,688
If anyone gets in our way,
no matter who they are,

696
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,025
we take them out.

697
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:24,672
Who is it?

698
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,719
Stay over there.

699
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,645
It's Go Hae-ri.

700
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,070
Do you need something?

701
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,156
You must be tired.
Why don't you get some shut-eye?

702
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,118
-We are checking our gears.
-Oh...

703
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,287
We have cup noodles. Would you like some?

704
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,705
We're fine.

705
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,342
His pistol has a silencer.

706
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,677
A silencer?

707
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,264
They're trying to do something quietly.

708
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,016
But they're here to fight the men outside.

709
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,060
It doesn't make sense.

710
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,314
You should take Kim Woo-gi to Gi's room.

711
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,526
-What about you?
-I'm going to find out more.

712
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:27,819
Be careful.

713
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,461
We don't want cup noodles.

714
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,547
I'm Cha Dal-geon.

715
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,720
I want to talk to you about Kim Woo-gi--

716
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,420
Kim Woo-gi! Wake up!

717
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,173
-Get up.
-What the hell, are you mad?

718
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,716
Put your shoes on.

719
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,386
Yes, this is Cha Dal-geon's phone.

720
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,346
Ms. Go?

721
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,431
Who is this?

722
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,933
I'm Edward's secretary.

723
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,976
Oh, Dal-geon is out right now--

724
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,937
You must do as I tell you right away.

725
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,106
What is going on?

726
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,693
Turn on the timer on your phone
and move to a safe zone right now.

727
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,654
Tell me what's going on.

728
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,114
Just do as I say
or you're all going to die.

729
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,133
Drop your guns, bastards.

730
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,310
Have you killed a man before?

731
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,856
It's not as easy as it looks.
You'll never shoot me!

732
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,236
I can't kill men.
But I can kill those worse than animals.

733
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,948
He's not going to shoot me,
so just take the shot!

734
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,617
-Drop it, damn it!
-Shoot him!

735
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,789
Deputy, this is an order. You shoot.

736
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,791
Shoot!

737
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,508
What the hell are you doing?

738
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,099
-Are you going to watch and do nothing?
-We don't make decisions.

739
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,476
We follow orders.

740
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,230
They are all going to get killed!

741
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,151
I'm following my country's orders.

742
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,763
