1
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,389
SAMAEL SENT A MESSAGE

2
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,000
Engine number three failed.
The cabin altitude is rising.

3
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,253
Do we have a hole in the aircraft?

4
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,180
Why aren't the panels working?

5
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,891
The latitude, altitude and airspeed panels
are all out, sir.

6
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
Stand by. Let's use the manual controls.

7
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,312
The lever isn't working.
What's wrong with it?

8
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,903
That's the end of the audio recording.

9
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,589
Fill it up, please.

10
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,633
My gosh.

11
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,761
I'm thirsty and hungry.

12
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,597
I'm sorry...

13
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,809
Can you go inside and buy me something?

14
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,575
What is it?

15
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,745
-What's wrong?
-Get in the car!

16
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,558
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE SAYING

17
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,520
The phone call isn't enough to conclude
that it was a terrorist attack.

18
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,190
I think they were talking in code.

19
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,525
I don't get what these times mean.

20
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,526
Miss Go...

21
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,114
over 90 percent of the evidence
points to aircraft failure.

22
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
Please try not to cause confusion.

23
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,953
Okay.

24
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll come back
when I find conclusive evidence.

25
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,298
Thank you for your help.

26
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,926
The times are identical.

27
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,932
Look. The plane first started
having problems at 13:15.

28
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
The panels malfunctioned at 13:20.

29
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,480
Why aren't the panels working?

30
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,357
The lever malfunctioned at 13:23.

31
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,942
The lever isn't working.

32
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,694
And the plane crashed...

33
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,659
at 13:30.

34
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,040
Help!

35
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,417
Where is...?

36
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,837
Over here! Gunshot--

37
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,173
Over here!

38
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,219
-Doctor, hurry!
-He got shot!

39
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,637
What's up?

40
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,312
-What's wrong? Calm down.
-He got shot! Do you understand?

41
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,943
We must find out what really happened
for the sake of the victims.

42
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,029
Please help, doctor.

43
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:12,033
The ICAO won't acknowledge anything
without any concrete evidence.

44
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,414
I have a video clip of the terrorist.

45
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
I'll send it to you by email.

46
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,547
Let's do this.

47
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,300
We'll dig up the truth about the crash.

48
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,427
Thank you, doctor.

49
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,974
Go Hae-ri speaking.

50
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
Ho-sik was shot.

51
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,687
What? What happened?

52
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,400
I know the hospital.
I'll come there after I stop by my house.

53
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,319
Wait.

54
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,197
You were right.

55
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
We found evidence
from the flight recorder.

56
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,702
The plane crash...

57
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,455
was due to a terrorist attack.

58
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,627
I'll fill you in later.

59
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,649
What?

60
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,693
Where did my laptop go?

61
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,628
Take off your mask right now!

62
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,595
You... You're the hotel cleaner.

63
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,349
Tell them he's working with the man
who crashed the plane.

64
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,184
Turn around.

65
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,438
Get down on your knees.

66
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,026
Who sent you?

67
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,235
I don't know.

68
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,655
I was promised 10,000 euros

69
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,281
if I killed you
and made it seem like a suicide.

70
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,868
If I killed you right now,
it'd be considered an act of self-defense.

71
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
Tell me the truth if you want to live.

72
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,957
I'm telling you the truth.
We only talked on the phone.

73
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,460
Take out your phone.

74
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,262
Call the person that asked you to do this.
If you don't, I'll shoot.

75
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,693
Hello...

76
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,614
-Hey, say something.
-Dal-geon?

77
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,994
Why are you answering this phone?

78
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,663
Ho-sik's still in surgery.

79
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,626
Are you saying this is Ho-sik's phone?

80
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
You're the one who called.

81
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,846
Listen carefully, Dal-geon.

82
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,599
The person who owns this phone

83
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,477
just tried to kill me.

84
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,562
What?

85
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,647
Catch Ho-sik.

86
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,233
He's working with the terrorist.

87
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,409
If we catch Ho-sik,
we can solve this case.

88
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,940
Where did that guy go?

89
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
Where's the guy that got shot?

90
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,277
That guy...

91
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,645
Ho-sik? It's Cha Dal-geon.

92
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,355
Do you know where
Ms. Go Hae-ri is staying?

93
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,899
Why do you ask?

94
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,670
The video clip is gone?

95
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,255
Don't worry.

96
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,300
I sent a copy to a colleague at the NIS.

97
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,760
We'll identify the terrorist
by tomorrow.

98
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,890
That's a relief. I'll wait for your call.

99
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,829
Go on.

100
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,749
We have a problem.

101
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,586
I'm listening.

102
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,566
-Don't come near me!
-Mr. Kim.

103
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,945
You see this?

104
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,448
One bite and I'm dead.

105
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,951
-Stop acting crazy.
-Crazy?!

106
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,746
You're the crazy ones.

107
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,373
Cut the crap!

108
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
Why did you kill my nephew?

109
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,419
Why did you blow up the plane?!

110
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,562
Let's calm down and talk.

111
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,191
Don't throw your life away.
Think about your wife and daughter.

112
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,152
This is the only thing I can do...

113
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,364
to protect my wife and daughter.

114
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Kim!

115
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,876
Mr. Kim!

116
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,712
Stay with me, Mr. Kim.

117
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,713
Mr. Kim!

118
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,969
Don't...

119
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,305
Don't do anything.

120
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,307
Those people...

121
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,686
They're terrifying.

122
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,897
-Mr. Kim!
-Hey. Hey!

123
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,358
Talk to me before you die.
Who are those people?

124
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,946
-Stop it.
-Tell me, you bastard!

125
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,489
Who are they?

126
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,366
Who killed my nephew?!

127
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,368
-Tell me!
-Stop it!

128
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,666
Christ!

129
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,927
Is this the police? We need help.

130
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,555
I called the police.

131
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,656
-Give me the gun.
-What? Why?

132
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,034
Your hands are shaking. Give it to me!

133
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,452
Shut up.

134
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,497
You're a civilian,
and I'm a special agent.

135
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,917
I'm not going to let you die.

136
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,920
So don't worry, and just trust--

137
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,966
Fuck.

138
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,635
Hey!

139
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,721
What a psycho!

140
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,078
Hey!

141
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,040
Come on!

142
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,169
-Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-That's what I'd like to ask.

143
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,755
If you get shot, I'll be in big trouble.

144
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,676
Wait right here.

145
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,302
What are you doing?

146
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,140
Do you know how hard I trained
for a situation like this?

147
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,850
This injury is not--

148
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,393
What the--?

149
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,277
See that truck?

150
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
Can you get there in three seconds?

151
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,409
He's using a bolt-action rifle.

152
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,120
He needs to rotate the bolt manually
after each shot,

153
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,789
which takes three seconds.

154
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,041
It's harder to aim
when the target's moving.

155
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,546
We'll have a better chance
if we get to the truck.

156
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,882
It's out of range from the roof.

157
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,427
We need to get there in three seconds.

158
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,554
Can you do it?

159
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,475
Four seconds.

160
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,741
Run!

161
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,179
-What?
-Do you want to get shot?

162
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,140
Even a slight scratch
will leave a hole under your chin.

163
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,436
A special gadget for special agents?

164
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,612
No one's there.

165
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,376
Where did he go? Shit.

166
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,845
Damn!

167
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,343
MEMORIAL TOWER

00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,928
PLEDGE TO THE NATION

169
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,807
We're here for a security inspection.
Everyone get up.

170
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,144
-Your cooperation is appreciated.
-Bear with us.

171
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,187
Why?

172
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,939
What is this? This is so embarrassing.

173
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,274
You're new, right?

174
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,568
Hey, watch your hands.

175
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,946
Stop groping me, you bastard!

176
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,531
For God's sake.

177
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,928
Do you have everything?

178
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,180
Let me take one video file.

179
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,226
We're from the same town. Come on, Kim!

180
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,978
Do you have something to hide?

181
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,564
It's a picture of me butt naked.

182
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,066
It'll damage your eyes.

183
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,071
No worries.
My insurance will take care of it.

184
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,159
What a jerk. I should gouge his eyes out!

185
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,621
What's this?

186
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,998
What the hell is going on?

187
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,752
There's been a security breach
in this office.

188
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,505
So you just barged in here
to do an inspection?

189
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:44,881
Who gave the order?

190
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,175
Mr. Gi Tae-ung, sir.

191
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,469
Goddamn it.

192
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,013
Where is that prick?

193
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,521
Hey, Gi Tae-ung.

194
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,316
Did you order an inspection of my office
without telling me?

195
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,068
You've grown some balls.

196
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,738
Seven years ago today...

197
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,825
a colleague of mine died.

198
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,619
I believe you knew him.

199
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,873
His code name was Blaise Pascal.

200
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:22,752
Your predecessors always gave a heads-up
before an inspection.

201
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,881
That's how things work,
as a courtesy to your superiors.

202
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,468
His mission was a success,
and he had time to escape, but...

203
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,512
Do you know why he died?

204
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,351
Because the command unit
broke a very minor rule.

205
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,312
-Hey, that was--
-That's why...

206
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,608
my friend died in vain.

207
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:51,031
I'm going to discard unnecessary customs,
and I'm going to stick to the rules.

208
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,750
Damn that cocky bastard.

209
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,425
Honorable Chief Gang,

210
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,761
can I ask you for a small favor?

211
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,180
Go Hae-ri sent me a video,

212
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,016
but the Inspection Team took it.

213
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,768
Your authority would--

214
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,646
Sir?

215
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,482
Sir, please help me out just this once!

216
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,196
You know very well
Mr. Gi always listens to you!

217
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,531
Sir?

218
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,616
Come on, sir!

219
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,326
Just this once--

220
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,538
That's disgusting.

221
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,374
He must have drunk his ass off last night.

222
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,334
Oh, forget it.

223
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,920
He has no authority at all.

224
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,006
Gross.

225
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,780
Don't...

226
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,907
Don't do anything.

227
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,412
Those people... They're terrifying.

228
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,171
Loss of secret intelligence,
use of unauthorized equipment, hacking...

229
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,591
There are 27 security breaches.

230
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,886
That's a 30 percent increase
compared to last year's first quarter.

231
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,601
Now, please turn to page five
of the report in front of you.

232
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,768
GO HAE-RI

233
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,441
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable...

234
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,526
He's ignoring my call again.

235
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,197
Fine, you do that.

236
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,159
I'll make you regret it.

237
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,622
Any unauthorized equipment
found during a full inspection

238
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,873
will be strictly dealt--

239
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,380
Sorry I'm late.

240
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,258
Don't bother coming
if you're going to be late.

241
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,968
Oh, really? I can do that?

242
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,021
How many times have I told you
to turn off your phone during meetings?

243
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,064
Sorry, sir.

244
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,443
Yes, I'm in a meeting. Bye.

245
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,361
The plane crash...

246
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
It was a terrorist attack.

247
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,782
What?

248
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,370
I just uncovered a huge secret
from the flight recorder.

249
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,708
We have become a laughing stock,
but if we catch this terrorist,

250
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
we can get back at those jerks

251
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,671
who screwed us over.

252
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,756
Gang, what are you doing?

253
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,174
Hang up the phone and--

254
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,596
The B357 crash
was the result of a terrorist attack.

255
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,015
-What?
-What?

256
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,022
Chief? Hello?

257
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,484
The director general is here.
Tell him what you told me.

258
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,488
This is Director An.

259
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,031
What do you mean
it was a terrorist attack?

260
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
This is Agent Go Hae-ri from Morocco.

261
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,625
I've secured the terrorist's phone
conversation from the flight recorder.

262
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,966
There was an accomplice.

263
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,554
Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot of the plane.

264
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,098
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes, sir.

265
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,351
I checked with Dr. Kevin,
an investigator with the ICAO.

266
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,439
I sent Agent Gong Hwa-suk
a video clip of the terrorist.

267
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,400
I'll fill in the details
once I return to HQ.

268
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,653
Who said you could come back?

269
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,740
First, write up a detailed report--

270
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,824
Come back immediately.

271
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,827
Right away, sir.

272
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,167
I've been ordered to return.

273
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
We should hurry back to the hotel to pack.

274
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,045
You go alone.

275
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,385
The terrorist and the co-pilot
are hiding here somewhere.

276
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,222
I'm not going home until I catch them.

277
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,018
Do you think this is a zoo or something?

278
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,354
Do you think they'll show up
because you want them to?

279
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,024
They will show up again,

280
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
because they want me dead.

281
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,279
If I get those two, I can end this.

282
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,783
You need to understand the situation.

283
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,786
They fabricated the airport
security footage in just two hours.

284
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,830
Isn't it obvious that they're working
for powerful people?

285
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,209
And who are they?

286
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,669
Why did they kill
all those innocent people?

287
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,798
Why did my nephew have to die?! Why?!

288
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,102
We should go back to Seoul
to get to the bottom of this.

289
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,857
We can't do anything here.

290
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,693
Our lives are at stake.

291
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,203
Your country has what it takes.

292
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,623
The NIS is going to carry out
an investigation...

293
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,126
so don't worry, and come with me to Seoul.

294
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,860
There's no need to delay this.
Who will take charge?

295
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,736
I will, sir.

296
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,364
Go Hae-ri is under my command.

297
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,699
I'll take charge.

298
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,288
Six years ago, Mr. Gang worked with MI6

299
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,249
to apprehend Abu Sayyaf,
an international terrorist group.

300
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,961
-When it comes to terrorists, Mr. Gang--
-Min, you take charge.

301
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,131
Yes, sir.

302
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,010
The Inspection Team
has the video that Go sent.

303
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,553
Let's check that first.

304
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,686
-What?
-It's not working.

305
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,238
What happened?

306
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,533
It's a virus.

307
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,994
How could we get attacked by a virus?!

308
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,162
We're trying to find out.

309
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
I don't care. Just restore the video.

310
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,457
How long will it take?

311
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,375
We've called in an expert.

312
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,045
We don't have time.
Have it restored today.

313
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,589
Min, keep this confidential.

314
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,757
Yes, sir.

315
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,524
Does that mean
I don't have to worry about the NIS?

316
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,029
By the way, when can we meet?

317
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
You're turning me down again?

318
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,494
You should treat me better.

319
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,455
Or else I may harm you--

320
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,218
I came up with the perfect nickname.

321
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,681
The way Shadow works
is just like a stealth aircraft.

322
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,349
Silent and precise.

323
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,477
I'll tell Dr. Kevin not to worry
about the NIS.

324
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,855
Tell him to hurry up and report it

325
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,608
-as Dynamic System's aircraft failure.
-Yes, ma'am.

326
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,405
Mr. Minister!

327
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,782
What a coincidence.

328
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,453
I heard that you're a great golfer.

329
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,915
We should play together one day.
I'll do my best to accompany you.

330
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,876
I don't fraternize
with defense contractors.

331
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,967
Why is he so stiff?

332
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,845
Do you have the documents ready?

333
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,806
Lieutenant General Lim Pil-gyu,

334
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,391
head of Policy Advisor
to National Defense.

335
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,560
He's in charge of the F-X project.

336
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,105
Jang Dong-gyu
of the Institute for Defense Analysis.

337
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,940
He hosted the press conference.

338
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,570
Choi Sang-bae. He's the policy advisor
to the Ministry of National Defense.

339
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,532
These three are close aides
to Minister Park Man-yeong.

340
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,243
They're deeply involved
in the F-X project.

341
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,790
Lim Pil-gyu was involved in corruption
back when he was in Logistics Command.

342
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,669
Jang Dong-gyu received a huge bribe
for helping an acquaintance's son

343
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,004
avoid military service.

344
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,630
When Choi was in the military...

345
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,925
he was accused
of sexually harassing a female officer.

346
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,095
Lim Pil-gyu's files...

347
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,224
send them to Jang.

348
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,727
Send Jang's files to Choi,

349
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,272
and Choi's to Lim.

350
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,818
We need to think smarter
to trap Minister Park.

351
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,361
LIM PIL-GYU

352
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,325
There can only be one second-in-command,

353
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,619
so these three colleagues are also rivals.

354
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,041
MILITARY POLICE UNIT 1

355
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,125
PETITION

356
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,836
What can be more fun
than a rival's weakness?

357
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,963
Send them a signal,

358
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,466
they will all come running.

359
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,729
What brings you here?

360
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,484
I'd like to ask the same.

361
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,989
So you all came.

362
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,410
Thank you very much
for accepting my invitations.

363
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,038
Let them in.

364
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,628
Today's event is my treat for you,

365
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,213
so please enjoy.

366
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,675
What's the meaning of this?

367
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,219
Those who feel uncomfortable may leave.

368
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,681
But the rest of us
will have a serious discussion

369
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,767
about the one who leaves first.

370
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,912
What do you think you're doing?

371
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,320
Thank you for coming, minister.

372
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,072
Where are they?

373
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,866
Come this way.

374
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,633
I whisper in your ears

375
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,843
And stay by your side

376
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:06,140
But I always feel so sad

377
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,810
Why can't you accept

378
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,772
My love?

379
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,234
You are my Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

380
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,861
You make me feel sad

381
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,822
What the hell is this?!

382
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:25,993
Mr. Minister.

383
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,161
Get out!

384
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,225
Damn it...

385
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,784
If I were you...

386
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,747
I would think this is a good time
for us to have a drink.

387
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:29,557
Do you think I will surrender
to your dirty threat?

388
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,684
Do you think it's a threat?

389
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,439
I haven't asked you anything yet.

390
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,149
You picked the wrong fight.

391
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,693
You can't take over the F-X project.

392
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,612
One for corruption.

393
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,364
One for bribery.

394
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,575
One for sexual harassment.

395
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,744
You didn't know that, did you?

396
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,372
The top of the stream is clean,
yet the bottom is filthy.

397
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,586
If you choose Dynamic System,

398
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,630
I'll release today's video
and your men's files

399
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,132
to the press.

400
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,970
The public is already all worked up
after the plane crash.

401
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,057
How will you deal with all the criticism?

402
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,398
I feel bad.

403
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,651
It's not my intention
to pick a fight with you.

404
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,118
I know a lot of dirty secrets
about the US Department of Defense.

405
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,416
I also have some information
that the Blue House might like.

406
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,171
In other words...

407
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,176
I have a lot to offer you.

408
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,553
Are you offering me a deal?

409
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,516
A deal built on trust is easily broken...

410
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,771
but that's not the case when a deal
is built on a person's weakness.

411
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,899
I don't know any of your weaknesses.

412
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,609
In that case...

413
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,363
let's make one.

414
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,032
I think...

415
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,662
you could become a great weakness for me.

416
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,074
I told you we should hurry.

417
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,161
Happy now? We missed the plane.

418
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,371
I can't even turn the lights on
in my own house.

419
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,250
This is why
you should have a good partner.

420
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,421
Aren't you eating?

421
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,922
I'll eat all of it.

422
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,632
Don't whine about it later--

423
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,510
If the NIS starts investigating,
will you take part?

424
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,597
That question sounds borderline insulting.

425
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,850
Of course I will.
I'm the one who uncovered it all.

426
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,522
Why? Don't you trust me?

427
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,108
I'm a promising agent, you know.

428
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,110
Once I solve this case...

429
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,617
You have trouble trusting people,
don't you?

430
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,411
I can read people like an X-ray machine.

431
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,163
You are full of doubts.

432
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,875
Quick-tempered and feisty all the time.

433
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,293
How about you?

434
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,004
You struggled to trust me.

435
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,257
That's because of my job.
But you have a problem.

436
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,721
Still, that crooked personality of yours
got us somewhere.

437
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,731
No applause for me?
I discovered something huge today.

438
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,030
How did you come to raise Hoon?

439
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,075
You don't seem like a guy who likes kids.

440
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,538
Go to sleep. I'll stand guard.

441
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,706
Excuse me, Mr. Civilian?

442
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,669
Guard duties
are not for civilians like you,

443
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,629
they're for special agents like me.

444
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,382
Get some sleep. I'll protect you.

445
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,593
Go--

446
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,973
Protect me like this?

447
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,850
You won't stand a chance against him.

448
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,149
I was caught off guard that time.

449
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,777
The NIS pays me for a reason.

450
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,956
I don't sleep with just any woman.
Suit yourself. I don't care.

451
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,423
Excuse me, you're not my type.

452
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,843
I like tall, intelligent,
fair-skinned men.

453
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,263
What? "Just any woman"?

454
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,890
Do you need medication?

455
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,851
You're seriously delusional.

456
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,686
Jesus.

457
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,443
Fine. Let's see who falls asleep first.

458
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,071
When you snore,
I'll stick this up your nose.

459
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,775
Can you please stop looking around?

460
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,945
I'm sure they're watching us.

461
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,489
Doesn't that man look suspicious?

462
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,282
You're the most suspicious guy here.

463
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,826
Just look at him.

464
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,619
Two o'clock.

465
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,206
I am looking at him.
That's what the shades are for.

466
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,459
This is why I can't work with amateurs.

467
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,260
You're right. He's really suspicious.

468
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,679
I'm sure they're having an affair.

469
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,889
Good instincts, Mr. Cha.

470
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,460
I didn't betray you.

471
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,213
I wanted to find the co-pilot

472
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,381
and take care of him myself.

473
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,559
If it wasn't for Cha Dal-geon,
I could've taken him out.

474
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:57,731
Samael will take care of
Cha Dal-geon and the co-pilot.

475
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,068
Please let me do it.

476
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,447
I won't make any mistakes this time...

477
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,138
The NIS will take care of Go Hae-ri.

478
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,558
What about Cha Dal-geon?

479
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,853
Obstacles are meant to be removed.

480
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,479
We're already on thin ice.

481
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,567
Find out where Lily is.

482
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,154
-She should be in the US.
-Call her now.

483
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,073
There's no one else I can entrust this to.

484
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,809
Gosh, you should've called earlier.

485
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,064
I was planning to go on vacation
to Miami Beach tonight.

486
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,275
Right now?

487
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,909
I'll spend my vacation in Korea then.

488
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,244
In return...

489
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,501
book me a first-class ticket, please.

490
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,796
Me?

491
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,926
I beg you. I ask you...

492
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,388
-Don't kill me.
-I'm working.

493
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,437
Are you certain, sir?

494
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,400
NIS DIRECTOR GENERAL
AN GI-DONG

495
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,985
I understand.

496
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,990
Yes, sir.

497
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,167
How strange.

498
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,336
He's like a ghost.

499
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,257
He's on the plane,
but not on the passenger list?

500
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,591
Is that possible?

501
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,635
Something's wrong.

502
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,598
Am I right?

503
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,854
Maybe they were mistaken.

504
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,647
Passenger lists are never wrong.

505
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,524
Two people saw the video.

506
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,110
They can't both have been mistaken.

507
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,654
Is it possible to restore the video?

508
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,158
-No, sir.
-Who knows about this apart from Go?

509
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,037
Everyone who attended the meeting
and a few Inspection Team employees.

510
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,582
Drop the case.

511
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,753
-Sir...
-The video never existed.

512
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,631
Min, keep Go's mouth shut.
Gi, take care of your men.

513
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,133
I'll handle the other directors.

514
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,469
Two hundred people died in the crash.

515
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,888
One hundred and eight of them
were our citizens.

516
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,431
Just because the video--

517
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,932
Just do as you're told!

518
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,064
We just lost conclusive evidence
of a terrorist attack!

519
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,358
Do you think we'll be fine
if word gets out?

520
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,569
We will be as good as dead!

521
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,911
The ICAO will conclude
that the aircraft malfunctioned.

522
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,204
Let's just wait and see.

523
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,998
We can start investigating if they suggest
that it was a terrorist attack.

524
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,090
Don't tell Go Hae-ri the details.
It's risky because she's a rookie.

525
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,217
Yes, sir.

526
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,227
I don't get it. There could--

527
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,521
Stop causing trouble.

528
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,357
Look at us. It was all for nothing.

529
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,485
You blew my shot at a promotion.

530
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,113
Is that all you care about right now?

531
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,532
What did you say?

532
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,409
You may not give a shit

533
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,496
because your family is rich
and you lead a comfortable life,

534
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
but getting promoted is important to me.

535
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,877
Raising three kids isn't an easy task.

536
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,089
Gi Tae-ung...

537
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,134
I'm curious.

538
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,136
The video...

539
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,099
Don't you think
it was destroyed on purpose?

540
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,354
I mean, the timing is so perfect.

541
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,900
A video file is confiscated
after a security inspection,

542
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,902
and a virus destroys it.

543
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,991
The only image of the terrorist is gone,
just like that.

544
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,873
Are you suggesting that it was me?

545
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,461
I'm just saying.

546
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,424
Who cares now?

547
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,843
We're dropping the case.

548
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,420
DELETE

549
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,267
Welcome.

550
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,984
I guess you've made
a lot of money, Jessica.

551
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,156
But you've aged.

552
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,034
She's a CEO. Have some respect.

553
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,246
Come on, there's no need for respect
between us.

554
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,372
Am I right?

555
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,791
You haven't changed. You're still a bitch.

556
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,460
A bitch employee for a bitch employer.

557
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,425
I'm a bit tired, so let's talk business.

558
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,346
Cha Dal-geon. He's a stuntman.

559
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,765
A stuntman?

560
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,185
Did a movie investment go bust?

561
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,314
A family member of his was on the flight.

562
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,570
This is going to cost a lot.

563
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,741
Really? That's not what we agreed on.

564
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,451
I guess you don't know.

565
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,872
I charge regular prices for bad guys,

566
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,166
but there's a premium for good guys.

567
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,126
Hey, Lily.

568
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,920
Follow-up service is included.

569
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,463
I'll finish the job perfectly.

570
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,550
-If you keep this up--
-Take it or leave it.

571
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,803
I'll just take a tour of Korea instead.

572
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,890
I like places with a lot of tombs.

573
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,935
Gyeongju is the place to go to!

574
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,145
No guns.

575
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,731
No poison either.

576
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:23,069
Don't leave any marks
that might show he was killed.

577
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,578
This is potassium chloride.

578
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,623
When this enters a body through the veins,
it strains the heart.

579
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,626
The autopsy report will say
it was a heart attack.

580
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,381
You're planning to inject that
into Cha Dal-geon's neck?

581
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,925
Can you put a bell on a cat's neck?

582
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,097
Are you trying to insult me?

583
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,016
I'm Lily.

584
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,064
I'll pay ten percent as a deposit.
You'll get the rest when it's done.

585
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,276
I usually get half in advance.

586
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,287
So... where is our dear client right now?

587
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,844
I'll have it if you don't want it.

588
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,068
So your appetite is back?
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

589
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,129
Excuse me.

590
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,423
Could you...?

591
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,134
Thank you.

592
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,221
This will make you feel better.

593
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,777
-Let me prick your finger.
-I'm fine.

594
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,822
Just do as I say and give me your hand.

595
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,952
God, your hand is so cold.

596
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,925
I know how you must be feeling.

597
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,928
You blame yourself.

598
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,516
I felt the same way when my dad died.

599
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:04,147
Blaming yourself makes you sad and angry.

600
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,861
But we'll get the terrorist,
thanks to you.

601
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,572
You can stop feeling sorry.

602
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,625
Jeez, look at that dark blood.
It's worse than I thought.

603
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,676
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you're going.

604
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,679
Are you okay?

605
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,808
I'm sorry.

606
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,775
-Dal-geon, what's wrong?
-Let me see him.

607
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,694
-Dal-geon!
-Are you okay, sir?

608
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,196
I think he's having a heart attack.
Call an ambulance!

609
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,826
This is an emergency.
Please send an ambulance.

610
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,412
Incheon Airport arrivals hall. Hurry!

611
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,913
Dal-geon, wake up!

612
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,460
We'll pick him up

613
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,838
and inject the potassium chloride
into his veins.

614
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,260
And the bell's on the cat's neck.

615
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:41,512
What do you think?

616
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,682
He's coming.

617
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,106
We just arrived. Where are you?

618
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,151
Let's begin.

619
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,540
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you're going.

620
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,653
Who are you?

621
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,280
Who the hell are you?!

622
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,579
