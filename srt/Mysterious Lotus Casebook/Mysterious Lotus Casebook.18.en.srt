[Episode 18]

4
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,259
Yes.

5
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,360
Who are you?

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,780
You're such a hindrance.

7
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,300
I'll scratch you more.

8
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,070
Who are you?

9
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,750
Sister Qiao.

10
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,490
When people in the martial arts world talk about beauties,

11
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,250
we're tied.

12
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,910
Tell me.

13
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,000
Between us, who is prettier?

14
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,870
But I'm not here to compete with you.

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,790
I'm here to tell you

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Li Xiangyi

17
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,170
is still alive.

18
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,060
Where is he?

19
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,730
I also want to know where he is.

20
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,010
After going through the pear trees,

21
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,570
you'll see the Heaven Prison.

22
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,329
Miss Pear Tree Formation?

23
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,690
I've heard of it before.

24
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,490
What's the solution?

25
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,260
The Miss Pear Tree Formation

26
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,680
was based on the Later Heaven Bagua.

27
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,290
Yin and Yang were reversed here.

28
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,910
The Death Gate is in Qian.

29
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
The Life Gate is in Kun.

30
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,070
The Open Gate is in Gen.

31
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,900
Li Xiangyi.

32
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,110
Are you playing tricks on me?

33
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,680
Director Di.

34
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,780
If you hadn't explored the way,

35
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,880
you would have gone through the trees safely.

36
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,250
But that copper coin

37
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,850
made the Life Gate the Death Gate.

38
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,730
Do you think it can trap me?

39
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,280
Of course not.

40
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,920
But today,

41
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,360
all sects are here.

42
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,410
You can't make trouble easily.

43
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,760
He's in the direction of the Heaven Prison.

44
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,690
I'm leaving.

45
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,540
Di Feisheng is trapped in the Miss Pear Tree Formation.

46
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,210
The final boss voluntarily gave us a chance

47
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
to catch him.

48
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,000
The formation has been destroyed.

49
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,090
Be careful.

50
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,490
You're all old faces.

51
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,660
Unfortunately, all of you were defeated by me before.

52
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

53
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,930
I wonder why

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,620
you came here today?

55
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,070
I haven't seen you for ten years.

56
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,090
You're still bad at martial arts.

57
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,380
You have no right to ask me.

58
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,350
I'm not the number one in the martial arts world.

59
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,840
But if you want to disrupt

60
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,600
my wedding,

61
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,659
don't blame me for being rude.

62
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,590
Zijin.

63
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,450
Your martial art skills improved a lot.

64
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,580
I heard Weeping Guanyin

65
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,200
greatly helped you to cure your internal injuries.

66
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
But it's still hard for you to defeat all of us.

67
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Let's fight him together.

68
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,130
Don't pull any punches.

69
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll come again.

70
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,880
Bad news!

71
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,550
Bad news!

72
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,540
Something happened in the bridal chamber.

73
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,950
Ms. Qiao was poisoned and fainted.

74
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,690
Wanmian.

75
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,920
Wanmian.

76
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,010
Her hands are so cold.

77
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,980
[Iced Cicada. Cold Frost. Detoxify the poison. Use Yangzhouman.]

78
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,600
Iced Cicada.

79
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,300
Cold Frost.

80
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,800
Detoxify the poison.

81
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,380
Use Yangzhouman.

82
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,290
It's Jiao Liqiao.

83
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,990
She poisoned Sister Qiao.

84
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,370
Mr. Guan.

85
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,060
You're good at detoxifying poisons with golden needles.

86
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,140
You can definitely detoxify this poison.

87
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,040
Please save Wanmian.

88
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,840
I just examined Ms. Qiao.

89
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,640
Iced Cicada and Cold Frost

90
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,890
are two types of deadly poisons.

91
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,710
When the poison enters the viscera

92
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,430
through the mouth,

93
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,940
it can freeze the viscera in an hour.

94
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,160
There's no way to detoxify the poison.

95
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,310
You can only use the purest internal power of a man

96
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,980
to protect her viscera

97
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,740
and battle with the deadly poison.

98
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,890
After Iced Cicada is removed,

99
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,830
the patient will be safe.

100
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,670
The purest internal power of a man?

101
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,750
If the internal power which is used to resist cold

102
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,210
is strong,

103
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
it will hurt the extremely fragile viscera

104
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,660
which was caused by frostbite

105
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,180
and make the patient die soon.

106
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,100
The only purest internal power in this world which can do this

107
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,330
is Yangzhouman.

108
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,780
That's why it writes

109
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,940
that we should use Yangzhouman to detoxify the poison.

110
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,060
Otherwise, six hours later,

111
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,670
the attack of Iced Cicada will be unavoidable.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,270
Ms. Qiao will freeze to death.

113
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,730
Yangzhouman?

114
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,750
That's Li Xiangyi's unique internal power.

115
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,580
If he could really save Wanmian,

116
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,830
I would kneel and beg him.

117
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,770
But Li Xiangyi is already dead.

118
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
What does Jiao Liqiao want?

119
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,770
You don't have to use internal power to save her.

120
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,490
May I examine Ms. Qiao?

121
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,780
It's none of your business.

122
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,670
Don't touch Wanmian.

123
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,070
Do you have another way to save her?

124
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,950
Actually, I've discussed a method of using poisons to detoxify poisons

125
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,130
with Mr. Guan before.

126
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,370
I only saw Bhante Wuliao, who's from Pudu Temple,

127
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,350
use this method to detoxify poisons before.

128
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,490
Bhante Wuliao

129
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,590
has verified this method before?

130
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Of course the process is not simple.

131
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,750
The poison must be neutralized by another posion.

132
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,090
The cold caused by Iced Cicada can be resisted by Arsenic.

133
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,110
Use special medicinal soups to stop the toxicity of Arsenic.

134
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,630
And then use acupuncture

135
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,440
to send it directly into the viscera

136
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,460
and make it work.

137
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:14,650
But

138
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,430
it takes six hours

139
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,030
to take Bhante Wuliao here.

140
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,280
It's too late to invite him.

141
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,450
When Abbot was detoxifying poisons,

142
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I was beside him.

143
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,350
I learnt a little from him.

144
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,410
If you trust me,

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,170
could you let me have a try?

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,690
Can it really be detoxified?

147
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,390
Do you know the consequences

148
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,100
if you talk through your hat?

149
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,370
It's a matter of life and death.

150
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm serious.

151
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,060
But I need Cold Winter Plum Blossom,

152
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,090
Early Spring Prunus Salicina,

153
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,210
Late Summer Lotus,

154
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
and Early Autumn Chrysanthemum, 60 each.

155
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,950
Make Arsenic Medicinal Soup on a big fire

156
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,230
to help me detoxify the poison.

157
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,590
How can we find the things you mentioned

158
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,980
in a short time?

159
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,740
Don't fool us.

160
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,310
They can be collected from the pharmacies,

161
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,230
the fruit shops,

162
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,720
and the tea shops in the town.

163
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,980
Let's look for them together.

164
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,740
We can definitely find them.

165
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,450
I trust Mr. Li.

166
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,220
There's no need for you to go.

167
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,980
We can help.

168
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,350
I'll go and look for them.

169
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,570
Cure Ms. Qiao without worries.

170
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,040
Leave the rest to us.

171
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,860
Please prepare three buckets of hot water.

172
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,580
Ms. Qiao will use them when the poison is being detoxified.

173
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,690
Yes.

174
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,540
She was here for me.

175
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,220
You were involved in it because of me.

176
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,610
Mr. Li.

177
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,790
I've boiled the water.

178
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,140
How is Miss?

179
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,410
Can I open the door?

180
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,590
Mr. Li.

181
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,290
My Lord.

182
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,440
Situations of Mumian Villa have changed.

183
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,810
Xiangyi.

184
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Xiangyi.

185
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,460
For her, you abused your true force

186
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,510
and was seriously injured.

187
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,770
Is it worth

188
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,070
risking your life?

189
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,090
How is she?

190
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,300
How's the situation inside?

191
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,650
Mr. Li keeps the door closed.

192
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,560
He hasn't responded.

193
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,150
Li Lianhua.

194
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,150
We've prepared what you need.

195
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,420
Mr. Guan and the others are making the medicinal soup.

196
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
How's the situation inside?

197
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,700
Li Lianhua.

198
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,670
What's going on?

199
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,710
Tell me.

200
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,610
If you don't want them to know,

201
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,020
I can help you.

202
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,900
What do you want to do?

203
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,740
What are you doing?

204
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,820
Don't come.

205
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,100
Di Feisheng, you…

206
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
If you want her to live,

207
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,030
come to the gazebo on the back hill after two hours

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,570
and bring King Xunming of Yama in exchange for her.

209
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,310
Wanmian.

210
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,180
Are you hurt?

211
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,390
Was it Di Feisheng who hurt you?

212
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm fine.

213
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,760
It's just an attack of my illness.

214
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,810
Go after him.

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,030
Why do you have an attack at this time?

216
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,690
Sit down.

217
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,370
How are you?

218
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,620
Where is your medicine?

219
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,900
It's in the Lotus Tower.

220
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,880
Go and get it for me now.

221
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,190
Go.

222
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,220
Go.

223
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,420
Okay. Hold on.

224
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,410
I'll be right back.

225
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,619
When you have an attack of Bicha Poison,

226
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,829
it feels as if there are insects eating your bones.

227
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,520
The poison will eventually pierce your internal organs and the marrow of your head.

228
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,910
At first, you'll temporarily become deaf and blind.

229
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
Then you'll gradually lose all five senses,

230
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,330
become crazy, and die.

231
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,270
My Lord.

232
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,060
The toxins in her body have already been removed.

233
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,210
She's still not awake because her acupuncture point for sleep was hit before.

234
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,780
I didn't expect you

235
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,870
to cover for Li Xiangyi.

236
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,120
Li Xiangyi still owes me a competition.

237
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,580
I can't let him die easily.

238
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,460
Besides, our competition

239
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,870
doesn't need such dirty tricks.

240
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,980
Jiao Liqiao did this behind your back

241
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,370
because she found Li Xiangyi is still alive

242
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,540
and wanted to smoke him out.

243
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,210
Why does Jiao Liqiao

244
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,420
care whether or not Li Xiangyi is dead?

245
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,430
She and I are not on the same side anymore.

246
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,410
Go back and keep an eye on her.

247
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,380
Check how many people in the Jinyuan Alliance

248
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,110
can still be used.

249
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Yes.

250
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,250
Di Feisheng.

251
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,450
I've brought the person you want.

252
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
I just want Wanmian to be safe.

253
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,480
The poison has been detoxified.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,890
She's fine now.

255
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:55,700
Wanmian.

256
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,780
Wanmian.

257
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,980
Wanmian.

258
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,350
Xiangyi.

259
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,870
Xiangyi.

260
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,030
Come.

261
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,420
This way, please.

262
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,500
He said he has heart disease before.

263
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,810
I didn't expect the disease to be so scary.

264
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,320
He's still unconscious after taking the medicine.

265
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,160
The doctor didn't find anything wrong after examining him,

266
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,290
so he couldn't prescribe medicine.

267
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,090
Guan.

268
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,500
Please examine him.

269
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,760
I thought it's because you have grudges against him

270
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,700
that you always target him.

271
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,010
Why are you so worried about him?

272
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm just angry with him.

273
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,130
His life matters.

274
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,220
Mr. Guan,

275
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,110
please examine Mr. Li.

276
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,590
Didn't I tell you to rest well?

277
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,280
But I'm worried about Mr. Li.

278
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,230
His pulse is hard to feel.

279
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,730
Why is it so strange?

280
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,630
His pulse is thin and soft.

281
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,900
He's quite weak.

282
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,950
His Qi and blood have dissipated.

283
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,140
They can't be regained.

284
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,580
The pulse

285
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,560
is insufficient.

286
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,710
What do you mean?

287
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,480
Is it serious, Mr. Guan?

288
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,780
His Qi and blood are insufficient.

289
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,450
It's caused by his congenital heart disease.

290
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,090
Although his life is not in danger,

291
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,130
he should stop worrying

292
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,710
and rest well.

293
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,570
Only in this way can he be fine.

294
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,320
It's good to hear he's fine.

295
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,400
I was poisoned with Iced Cicada.

296
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,350
Jiao Liqiao said only Yangzhouman can save me.

297
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,100
Then...

298
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,640
The Jinyuan Alliance was just creating panic

299
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,580
because they wanted to put pressure on us.

300
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,630
Di Feisheng threatened me with your life.

301
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,260
He asked me to let King Xunming of Yama go.

302
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,530
King Xunming of Yama

303
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,620
is much less important than you.

304
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,660
I did as he asked.

305
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,600
Di Feisheng detoxified the poison?

306
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,280
Of course.

307
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,760
Li Lianhua claimed that he could detoxify the poison.

308
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,990
I believed him

309
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,940
and let him mess around.

310
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,730
Fortunately,

311
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,050
the Jinyuan Alliance wanted something.

312
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,700
Except Di Feisheng,

313
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,000
no one has this ability.

314
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,800
But

315
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,260
today is our wedding day.

316
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,860
I failed to protect you.

317
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm fine now.

318
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,290
We expected that the Jinyuan Alliance would come to provoke us.

319
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,220
But

320
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,730
they did this

321
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,100
only for King Xunming of Yama?

322
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,940
Wanmian.

323
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,660
Just now...

324
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,790
I mean

325
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,010
no matter it's the Jinyuan Alliance or anyone else,

326
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
I won't let them have chances

327
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,960
to hurt you again.

328
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,450
I have something to discuss

329
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,800
with Ji Hanfo and the others.

330
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,250
You're still weak.

331
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,700
Get more rest.

332
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,850
I'm here to tell you

333
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,110
Li Xiangyi

334
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,290
is still alive.

335
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,540
Xiangyi.

336
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,650
Yangzhouman.

337
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,540
I have the internal power, Yangzhouman, in my body.

338
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
I've seen Xiangyi.

339
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,700
It's not a dream.

340
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,490
How is that possible?

341
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,810
Your favorite osmanthus cakes.

342
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,940
I queued up for a long time.

343
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,080
You tied the knot yourself,

344
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,770
right?

345
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,360
It's different from the knots tied by others.

346
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,560
I can't even untie it.

347
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,360
Why are they

348
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,330
the same?

349
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,230
It's you.

350
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,150
I'm so stupid.

351
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,140
You're alive.

352
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,050
You're still alive.

353
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,900
[Wulin Inn]

354
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,220
Mr. Li.

355
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,030
How are you now?

356
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,460
I'm fine.

357
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,730
I just feel a little dizzy.

358
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,780
I feel much better.

359
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,740
Mr. Guan gave you a prescription.

360
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Fang Duobing went to get the medicine.

361
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,500
Drink some water

362
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,310
to moisten your throat.

363
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,900
I can't drink it now.

364
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,570
I'm not thirsty either.

365
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,010
I'm really worried about you.

366
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,710
My illness

367
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,630
is not serious.

368
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,640
Miss Su,

369
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,840
your wound...

370
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,200
I'm fine.

371
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,320
Mr. Guan said

372
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,980
he has a method.

373
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,250
He'll cure me.

374
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,470
Don't worry.

375
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,510
By the way, Mr. Li,

376
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,330
I received a letter from my grandfather today.

377
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,460
He wrote that he didn't find the information about the ice and the script.

378
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,280
But the incense you got

379
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,740
is Nanyin Incense for sure.

380
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,360
Is the effect of Nanyin Incense

381
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,620
the same as what Miss Zhiyu said?

382
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,480
This is the second magical technique of Nanyin.

383
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,690
The knockout incense was made by Wuxin Huai.

384
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,060
Burning it

385
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,120
can make people fall into a pleasant illusion,

386
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,280
lose the feeling of pain,

387
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,230
and be manipulated.

388
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,060
They don't struggle even if they're being peeled.

389
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,460
If a large amount of Nanyin Incense are used

390
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,280
to deal with people who practice martial artists,

391
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,860
they will ruin the martial artist skills

392
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,710
which those people practice.

393
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,750
Who on earth used Wuxin Huai

394
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,030
to deal with my senior?

395
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,300
If King Xunming of Yama of the Jinyuan Alliance had intended to kill my senior,

396
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
he wouldn't have used it.

397
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,370
But

398
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,090
Nanyin is no longer in existence.

399
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
There is less and less Wuxin Huai.

400
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,570
The incense is quite rare and precious.

401
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,380
Not everyone

402
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,020
can get a lot of

403
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,150
Nanyin Incense.

404
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,180
By the way, Mr. Li,

405
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,580
speaking of Nanyin,

406
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,350
when I met Jiao Liqiao today,

407
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,950
she was speaking Nanyin dialect.

408
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,350
Although I don't know the meaning,

409
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,510
I'm sure that was Nangyin dialect.

410
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,080
My grandfather learnt it before.

411
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,230
She doesn't know I heard it clearly.

412
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,350
Otherwise, she'll kill me.

413
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,480
Jiao Liqiao?

414
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,770
Actually,

415
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,790
my grandfather wrote this letter

416
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,060
also to urge me to go home.

417
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,140
But Mr. Li,

418
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,340
I want...

419
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,220
Actually...

420
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
Actually, I want...

421
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,820
What do you want?

422
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,490
In three days,

423
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,400
your grandfather will know

424
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,870
what happened today.

425
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
Do you still want him to worry about you?

426
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,220
Besides,

427
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,420
if you want to recover soon,

428
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,350
you have to go home and recuperate.

429
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,700
This matter can't be delayed.

430
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,860
Go back and pack your things.

431
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:47,880
Set off tomorrow morning.

432
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Fine. Mr. Li.

433
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
I'll come to you when I'm recovered.

434
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,370
Mr. Li.

435
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,800
This is the jade whistle of the Su family.

436
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,650
If you need anything, you can blow this whistle

437
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,070
and let my family's homing pigeon send me a letter.

438
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,600
Guan.

439
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,760
Is the wound on Miss Su's face

440
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,140
severe?

441
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,490
What happened to you?

442
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,920
I can't tell the poison you were poisoned with.

443
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,040
Who on earth are you?

444
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm just

445
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,350
an unlucky ordinary person.

446
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,700
Judging by your pulse,

447
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,900
you have no more than four months to live.

448
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,050
You already knew you can't live long.

449
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,840
I have

450
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,540
no more than four months.

451
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,330
Since you know your situation,

452
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,660
don't have designs on Miss Su

453
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,640
and let her be heartbroken because of you.

454
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,740
Take care.

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

457
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,910
Ms. Qiao.

458
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,780
Why don't you rest at this hour?

459
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,220
I was poisoned with Iced Cicada.

460
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,730
Thank you for saving me.

461
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,470
But the poison was detoxified with Yangzhouman.

462
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,480
What do you want to say?

463
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,520
Ms. Qiao.

464
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,790
The poison was not detoxified by me.

465
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,160
It was Di Feisheng who helped you detoxify the poison.

466
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,060
Really?

467
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,400
You took the sachet I made for Xiangyi

468
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,610
and told me Xiangyi is already dead.

469
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,050
You watched me throw the sachet into the fire

470
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,710
and told me to let go of the past

471
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,290
and move on.

472
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,410
Did you do it on purpose?

473
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,350
You said he is dead

474
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,520
and deliberately described his death as horrific.

475
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,530
You asked me to keep him in the story.

476
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,290
But tell me.

477
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,730
How did the dead person

478
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,470
come back to life?

479
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,370
And how did he save my life?

480
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,120
Xiangyi acquired Yangzhouman when he was 18.

481
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,960
I was with him every day.

482
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,520
Every move.

483
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,360
Every day.

No one knows him better than me.

You can fool others,

486
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,330
but you can't fool me.

487
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,760
Why don't you turn around?

488
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,630
Are you still blaming me?

489
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,030
You're blaming me

490
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,740
because of the letter I wrote before you went to the East Sea,

491
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,410
right?

492
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,000
If you want to fool me,

493
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,590
can you look at me?

494
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,960
Xiangyi.

495
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,760
You still hate me, right?

496
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,440
You're so close to me.

497
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,260
How could I not recognize you?

498
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,360
I've been waiting for you for ten years.

499
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,300
Are you blaming me?

500
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,400
So you'd rather...

501
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,730
You'd rather run away for ten years

502
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,580
than come back to let me not worry,

503
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,300
right?

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,540
Look at me.

506
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,760
I'm fine now.

have your own life now

509
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,040
makes me feel happy

510
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,900
for you.

511
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,740
Xiangyi.

512
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,950
Why?

513
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,190
Why have you changed a lot?

514
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,080
You're not like

515
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,700
who you used to be anymore.

516
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,830
What has happened

517
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,310
in the past ten years?

518
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,300
When I fell into the sea that year,

519
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,240
I was hung on the ship of Di Feisheng.

520
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,180
I didn't sink to the bottom of the sea.

521
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,740
I went back to the Sigu Sect before.

522
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,280
I also saw the letter you wrote to me before.

523
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,860
Later,

524
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,250
I just wanted to live a different life.

525
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,139
No.

526
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,420
That's not what I meant.

527
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,199
Is it because you hated me for breaking up with you

528
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,600
that you left?

529
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:27,620
That's not true.

530
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,090
Mian.

531
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,100
I suddenly figured it out.

532
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,530
The bossy and arrogant

533
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,870
Li Xiangyi

534
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,190
is indeed dead.

535
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:41,980
No.

536
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,500
That's not what I meant

537
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,460
when I wrote you that letter.

538
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,270
He's the light that people pursue.

539
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,270
His brilliance will also hurt people's hearts.

540
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,020
He's also the one who I can never catch up with.

541
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,830
But how could it be his fault?

542
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,550
Do you know how much I regret it?

543
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,050
During these ten years,

544
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,620
I've been dreaming of you.

545
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,120
I dreamt that the moment you stepped out of the door,

546
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,230
I tried my best to pull you and stop you.

547
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,990
But when I woke up,

548
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,410
I realized there's nothing reversible.

549
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,850
Since you came back,

550
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
why didn't you tell us?

551
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,870
It's been so long.

552
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,760
I'm tired.

553
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,500
I just want to be free.

554
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,250
Then why did you

555
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,570
appear at my wedding?

556
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,140
I've promised you before

557
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,600
that I would give you the sweetest

558
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,980
wedding candies.

559
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,680
In the past,

560
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,040
I've broken my promise to you many times.

561
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,890
At least

562
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,970
I must keep this promise.

563
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,200
In Pudu Temple,

564
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,210
if you hadn't told me he is dead,

565
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,150
I wouldn't have married Zijin.

566
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,360
It's not beaucse you married Zijin that you're sad.

567
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,130
It's because you don't regret marrying Zijin.

568
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,830
Xiangyi.

569
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,750
You're still...

570
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,520
You're still the same.

571
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,960
You can kill someone with one sentence.

572
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,340
Mian.

573
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,640
You like Zijin

574
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,520
and rely on Zijin.

575
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,930
It's not wrong.

576
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,980
You don't love someone anymore.

577
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,090
You don't have to blame yourself for it.

578
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,540
Then...

579
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,340
Don't you hate me?

580
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,060
Yes.

581
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,300
I hated you before.

582
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,050
In the early years, I hated everyone.

583
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,910
Then I figured it out.

584
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,330
It was my fault.

585
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,430
I was too conceited.

586
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,700
I acted willfully.

587
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,970
Why should Li Xiangyi be invincible

588
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,250
and do everything successfully?

589
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,500
Mian.

590
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,790
When we met and knew each other,

591
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,930
I was young and ignorant.

592
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,800
I also didn't know

593
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,720
what our relationship was.

594
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,220
What do you mean?

595
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
What do you mean?

596
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,940
You mean

597
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,400
you never loved me?

598
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,860
We were both young at that time.

599
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,530
Don't take what we said seriously.

600
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,440
Mian.

601
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,630
Time flies.

602
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,800
You and I are no longer young.

603
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,810
Forget

604
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,220
what should be forgotten.

605
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,760
I saved you

606
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,720
because of our friendship.

607
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,450
Don't get me wrong.

608
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,000
You know me well.

609
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,180
I hate

610
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,650
being involved in many things.

611
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,220
The world is vast.

612
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,720
Living a life of freedom

613
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,660
is what I want.

614
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,590
Please

615
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,190
don't let others know I'm still alive.

616
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,030
I really hope

617
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,560
you and Zijin

618
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,470
can grow old together

619
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,840
and love each other forever.

620
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,290
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

621
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,880
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

622
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,560
What else should I say?

623
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,740
Ten years is a very long time.

624
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,330
Mian.

625
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,030
Today,

626
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,900
we should say goodbye.

627
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,370
Live the life you want.

628
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,940
Okay.

629
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,350
Okay.

630
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,000
Let me ask you again.

631
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,470
Is Li Xiangyi really not coming back?

632
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,610
No.

633
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,350
You like candies so much.

634
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,380
They're not what masters like.

635
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,620
Who says masters can't eat candies?

636
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,530
At our wedding,

637
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,870
I'll let everyone eat this kind of candy.

638
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,060
Is it delicious?

639
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,270
Not bad.

640
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,570
Eat one more.

641
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,340
You're busy with those big things every day.

642
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,760
You always let me look at your back.

643
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,840
I'm really tired.

644
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,450
Something really happened to the Feiying Gang.

645
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,110
Mian.

646
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
I need to go out now.

647
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,860
By the way, Mian,

648
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,180
what did you say just now?

649
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,330
Forget it.

650
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,630
Let's talk when I'm back.

651
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,060
The world is vast.

652
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,980
I can't keep you.

653
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,840
I'm tired.

654
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,130
I respect you, but I can't accompany you anymore.

655
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,090
I can't love you anymore.

656
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,040
I wrote this letter to say goodbye to you.

657
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,100
I wish you good health

658
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,780
and a happy life.

659
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,780
I hope you can fulfill your dreams.

660
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,540
Mian.

661
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,160
You want to die without letting everyone know.

662
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,300
I don't understand why you're pathetic and stubborn.

663
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,310
You scared me.

664
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,390
Why didn't you walk through

665
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,340
the front door?

666
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,980
Since we have chosen our own paths,

667
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,430
why should I bother them?

668
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,480
I don't understand.

669
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,270
But I respect your persistence.

670
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,080
No need, Director Di.

671
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
Just don't make trouble for me.

672
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,580
I didn't let Jiao Liqiao poison you.

673
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,190
I know.

674
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,810
You

675
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,580
killed a large amount of people.

676
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,500
But you do things

677
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,710
above board.

678
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,130
You don't like to argue.

679
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:15,940
I

680
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,380
just wanted to confirm it.

681
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,620
Compared to who you used to be,

682
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,800
you're much more cunning now.

683
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,770
You tried to cover for me this time.

684
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,420
I owe you a favor.

685
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:31,980
Why did you bring him here?

686
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,160
Don't you always blame the Jinyuan Alliance

687
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,830
for killing your senior?

688
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,410
My Lord asked me to explain to you.

689
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,590
Ten years ago,

690
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,700
I, King Bai of Fire, and Four-faced Qingzun

691
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,430
[King Xunming of Yama]

692
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,270
received a challenge letter from Shan Gudao.

693
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,240
Of course we didn't think he could defeat us.

694
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,500
But when we arrived at the place,

695
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,490
we found that Shan Gudao had already died.

696
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,450
It was my senior who challenged you?
