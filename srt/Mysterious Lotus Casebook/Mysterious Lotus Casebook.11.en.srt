[Episode 11]

4
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,330
It doesn't seem like she has been beaten up.

5
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,720
But Young Master Guo,

6
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,910
what happened

7
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,970
before the bride died?

8
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,500
Nothing special.

9
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,450
After dinner that night,

10
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,740
Su went back to her room alone to try on the wedding dress again.

11
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,250
After the bride went back to her room,

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,930
nobody knew what happened?

13
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,780
Didn't the bride have a maid?

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,290
The bride lost the wedding shoes her mom made.

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,820
Her maid

16
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,820
went to her parents' home to take the wedding shoes a few days ago.

17
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,140
Actually, our Guo family's ancestral wedding dress

18
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,329
is accompanied with wedding shoes.

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,000
But according to local customs,

20
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,290
if the bride doesn't wear the wedding shoes her mom made

21
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,810
when she gets married,

22
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,940
it will be inauspicious.

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,660
She was not used to being served.

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,380
So she didn't ask other maids to serve her.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,170
Who knew

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,820
something like this would happen?

27
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,940
How was the body found?

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,380
It was found under the bridge in the manor

29
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,440
by a servant.

30
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,579
The bodies of two wives my father remarried

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,540
were found there too.

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,980
Maybe the pond there is deep.

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,650
The long grass makes the shore slippery.

34
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,590
That's why they accidentally lost their footing.

35
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,900
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,950
These bodies

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,540
were found at the same place.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,420
But according to the file, the way the bride died

39
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,550
is the same as the one in this coffin.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,820
However,

41
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,690
Weiyuan Escort Agency

42
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,210
is located by the sea.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
Didn't the daughter of the escort agency

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,420
know how to swim?

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,210
Since she knew how to swim,

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
why did she drown?

47
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,680
The maid said the bride drank some wine that night.

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,110
On the night before the wedding,

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,620
the bride was drunk in her wedding dress.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Don't you think it's strange?

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,380
Why didn't I think of it?

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,040
Could it be that she didn't die accidentally

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,780
but was killed by someone?

54
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,260
But she just came to Cailian Manor not long ago.

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,960
She has no grudge against anyone.

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,630
Who would harm her?

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,880
My father told me

58
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,110
you're looking for Six Fingers Monster.

59
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,040
He had came to Cailian Manor,

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
but he's nowhere to be found.

61
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,380
Could it be...

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,100
You suspect it's him?

63
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,070
What is this?

The handwriting of Shi Hun.

70
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,200
He is really in Cailian Manor.

71
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:21,980
It was found in the backyard.

72
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:22,780
Follow me.

73
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,530
This is where we found the painting of Shi Hun.

74
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,659
This is the first wife

75
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
my father remarried,

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,250
Xu Heyue's room.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,070
She was the first woman

78
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,320
who died in Cailian Manor ten years ago.

79
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,000
The Six Fingers Monster you're looking for

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,310
really had contact with Madam Xu.

81
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,140
Is he the murderer?

82
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
He killed Madam Xu.

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,330
He killed my fiancée.

84
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,100
He has been killing people in Cailian Manor.

85
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,280
Young Master Guo.

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,780
You can't be so arbitrary.

87
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,670
But the ways these victims died

88
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,490
are the same.

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,870
Maybe these cases are related.

90
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,810
Let's see

91
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,520
what we can find in this room.

92
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,370
Look at this.

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,390
What's wrong?

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm good at calligraphy and painting

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,720
and have read many books.

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,980
Let me explain it to you.

97
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,490
Look at this painting.

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,580
Its stroke style and ink movement

99
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,340
are basically the same as that one.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,800
So I can conclude

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,540
this painting was also drawn by Shi Hu

102
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,770
Besides, the paper used for this painting

103
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,370
is batik rice paper in a moire pattern

104
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,170
interspersed with gold dust.

105
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,780
If I'm not mistaken,

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,660
this should be the work of Hanyue Studio.

107
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,340
When I was young, it was popular for a while.

108
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,900
It was about ten years ago.

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,250
But the paper was not well dip-dyed by ink washes.

110
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,700
It hasn't been released since then.

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,700
So these two paintings

112
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,560
were indeed drawn by Shi Hun at the same time.

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,700
It should be in May or June ten years ago.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,410
Because this paper has a name

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,390
called May Gold Rice Paper.

116
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,670
That means

117
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,300
when Miss Qiao received

118
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
Shi Hun's safe letter,

119
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,330
it was in May ten years ago.

120
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,340
In that case,

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Shi Hun has been missing

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,980
since then.

123
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,140
In the temple every day,

124
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,380
The sixth is born.

125
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,380
The mirror is formed.

126
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,460
A small eye.

127
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,240
What does it mean?

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,580
Look.

129
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,460
Why are these flowers and trees so messy?

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,750
The other painting

131
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,730
is very neat.

132
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,360
Have you found all?

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,980
In this room,

134
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,260
only these two paintings are drawn by Shi Hun?

135
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,330
These are the only ones we can find now.

136
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,780
Why are you so rude?

137
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,740
How dare you break into my backyard?

138
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,020
F... F... Father.

139
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,460
You're getting more and more bold.

140
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,930
This is the old residence of my late wife Xu.

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,830
I respect you as heroes of Baichuan Academy.

142
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
So I treat you well.

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,580
I didn't expect you to be so rude.

144
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,409
You're such a liar.

145
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,750
Is this your courtesy?

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,790
What do you mean?

147
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,250
Since you've never seen Shi Hun,

148
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,270
why do his calligraphy and paintings appear in this room?

149
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,730
I remember it now.

150
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,630
So the Shi Hun you're looking for

151
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,510
is that person.

152
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,020
Ten years ago,

153
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,580
before Madam Xu married me,

154
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,590
she saved a person.

155
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,780
But he stayed in Cailian Manor for two or three days

156
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,460
and then left.

157
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,900
It's been a long time.

158
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,260
I almost forgot it.

159
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,220
Master Guo.

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,410
He left.

161
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,610
Where did he go?

162
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,700
I don't know.

163
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,420
As for this painting,

164
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,530
he probably drew it

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,230
to thank Madam Xu for saving him.

166
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,220
It has been here for so many years.

167
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,289
In that case,

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,030
Shi Hun indeed

169
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,990
lived in Cailian Manor for a while.

170
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,520
The murders in the manor

171
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,130
have nothing to do with him.

172
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,280
We were wrong about it.

173
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,890
Of course.

174
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,620
I told you

175
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,930
these were accidents.

176
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,730
All of you have checked it today.

177
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,340
You should believe it.

178
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,290
We think too much.

179
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,430
I have a favor to ask.

180
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,020
Detective Fang

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,940
has never been used to the noise in inns.

182
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,930
May he stay here for a night?

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,880
We only serve poets and artists.

184
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,340
What a coincidence.

185
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,100
I love poetry.

186
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,180
I'll write a Lotus poem for Master Guo

187
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,150
for tonight's stay.

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,570
Will you say no?

189
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,910
Cailian Manor has always been upright.

190
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,200
We'll open the door to welcome poets.

191
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,460
You can stay here.

192
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,420
Thank you.

193
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,210
Thank you.

194
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,550
Back then, the Thousand Shadows Traceless sect was powerful.

195
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,270
But Shi Hun wasn't that good at martial arts.

196
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,180
He covered it up.

197
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,220
What Thousand Shadows Traceless?

198
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
What Shi Hun?

199
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,060
What are you talking about?

200
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
Ten years ago,

201
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,690
in the East Sea battle, after Jinyuan Alliance

202
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,370
was defeated,

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,790
the Central Plain martial arts world wiped out their force.

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Thousand Shadows Traceless

205
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,630
was the most powerful organization.

206
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,820
But I heard from Miss Qiao

207
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,290
that Shi Hun

208
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,670
was targeted by them at that time.

209
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,130
When he was injured,

210
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,920
he just rested for two days and then left.

211
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,590
I think

212
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,330
there must be something wrong.

213
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
That means Shi Hun didn't leave at all.

214
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,290
Guo Qian lied.

215
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,650
Yes. Mr. Fang.

216
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,460
You've made progress.

217
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,940
Since you know it,

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,580
why did you stop me from asking him more?

219
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
How could someone who deliberately concealed it

220
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,110
tell you the truth?

221
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:32,880
Wait.

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,740
Can you make it clear?

223
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,460
Don't talk in riddles in front of me, okay?

224
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,460
Ignorant.

225
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,930
Who is ignorant?

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,420
Calm down. Calm down.

227
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,700
Well.

228
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,940
It was ten years ago.

229
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,820
Back then, you were still young.

230
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,340
It's my fault for not telling you clearly.

231
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,340
It's my fault.

232
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,150
Let's go.

233
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,810
Can't you talk properly?

234
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,410
This is where the three bodies were found.

235
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,580
Besides the long grass on the slippery shore

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,180
indeed making it easy for people to fall into the water,

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,550
there seems to be nothing wrong.

238
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,810
But after all this time,

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,410
if there are any clues,

240
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,660
I'm afraid they've already been gone.

241
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,810
Not necessarily.

242
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,860
For example, when you just arrived at Cailian Manor,

243
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,930
you knew at once people are easy to fall from here.

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,470
Then why did people living here

245
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,590
lose their footing one after another?

246
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's look around.

247
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,990
[Xueyu Town]

248
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,800
We've searched for a long time,

249
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,700
but didn't find any new clues.

250
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,100
[Cuihua Restaurant]

251
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,680
This restaurant.

252
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,330
Don't think about anything.

253
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,110
Let's go eat first.

254
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,940
Why do you only care about eating?

255
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,420
Since we're here,

256
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,220
let's try the local food

257
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,220
and taste local customs.

258
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
Maybe we'll find something new.

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,700
Let's go.

260
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,910
There're the most gossips in teahouses and taverns.

261
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,200
Fei,

262
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,400
you're smarter.

263
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,340
It's just to ask for information.

264
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,540
Everyone can think of that.

265
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,220
Waiter.

266
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,780
Sir.

267
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,940
Give us the best private room.

268
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,180
No need.

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
We sit there.

270
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,660
One meat dish and one vegetable dish. Thank you.

271
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,820
OK. OK.

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,750
Mr. Fang,

273
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,820
it's the money you earned.

274
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Save it.

275
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,060
I heard that a few more bodies in the suburban graveyard

276
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
went missing.

277
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,320
Don't make a fuss.

278
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,460
Newly buried bodies

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,580
might have been taken away by some beasts.

280
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,980
It has happened many times these years.

281
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,450
Exactly.

282
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,510
Speaking of strange things,

283
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,370
recently,

284
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,780
another bride died in Cailian Manor.

285
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,850
Do you know it?

286
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,900
It's very abnormal.

287
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,340
Brothers,

288
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,180
I heard you mention Cailian Manor.

289
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,220
Yes.

290
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,060
Are you here to see the lotus too?

291
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,060
Yes.

292
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,420
May I ask

293
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,080
if Cailian Manor is hospitable?

294
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,140
Every year,

295
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,820
people come to Cai Lian Manor to see the lotus

296
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,940
in an endless stream.

297
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,230
But sir,

298
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,230
I advise you not to go there recently.

299
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,490
There,

300
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,740
someone just died.

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,010
Quite abnormal.

302
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,620
No bride

303
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,580
of Cai Lian Manor

304
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,820
can live until the wedding day.

305
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,540
The evil spirit haunts there.

306
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,170
It's so scary.

307
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,960
What evil spirit?

308
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,340
Maybe the lord of Cailian Manor

309
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,040
is meanspirited.

310
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
God is punishing him.

311
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
The lord has such a bad temper.

312
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,520
All servants in the manor aren't treated as human beings.

313
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,540
If anyone makes the lord unhappy,

314
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,790
he will be beaten to death.

315
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,730
I heard that Master Guo's first wife

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,180
was forced to death by him.

317
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,440
He's really bad.

318
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
In that case,

319
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,820
why did Madam Xu

320
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,300
marry him ten years ago?

321
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
You don't know.

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,560
I heard that Madam Xu was a musician.

323
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,820
Someone bought back her freedom

324
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,860
and she can live a luxurious life.

325
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,300
Everyone wants it.

326
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,190
Since then,

327
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,700
the Guo family replaced all the servants.

328
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,290
They may want to hide

329
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,930
something.
I’m sorry.

330
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,870
Please spare my life.

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,740
Please spare my life.

332
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,750
Beat her up!

333
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,990
Remember this.

334
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes.

335
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,830
Brothers,

336
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,610
don't talk of people behind their backs.

337
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,450
It's not appropriate.

338
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,740
What?

339
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,820
I can't talk about that?

340
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
Look at the mad man in their family.

341
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,940
I guess the Lord forced him to be mad.

342
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,340
Yes.

343
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,620
I guess his honest son will be so soon.

344
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,980
Master Guo.

345
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,150
You three are here too.

346
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,790
Young Master Guo, are you out for a drink?

347
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,340
My uncle is sick again.

348
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,540
He likes the Eight Treasure Duck here.

349
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,340
So my father asked me to buy some.

350
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,610
I didn't expect to meet you here.

351
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,720
It's better to meet by chance.

352
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,630
Let's eat together.

353
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,770
Young Master Guo.

354
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,530
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
The guests said something harsh just now.

356
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,650
Please don't mind.

357
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,100
These dishes are

358
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,390
to apologize on their behalf.

359
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,810
It doesn't matter.

360
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,140
We didn't treat you well today.

361
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,440
Don't mention it.

362
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,550
After such an accident,

363
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Young Master Guo is the saddest.

364
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,940
The manor is in chaos.

365
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,500
I treat you to a meal here.

366
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,200
We're flattered.

367
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,540
It's just a simple meal.

368
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,420
A squirrel mandarin fish.

369
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,090
Pork joint stewed with rock sugar.

370
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,820
Beef served with cilantro.

371
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,460
Steamed pork ribs.

372
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,220
Crispy chicken wings.

373
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,100
Braised pork tendons.

374
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Stewed lamb chops.

375
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Okay, wait a moment.

376
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,110
I'm really sorry.

377
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Our cilantro is sold out today.

378
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,190
I've changed a plate of beef with celery for you.

379
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,900
It's okay.

380
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,750
Come on. Eat it while it's hot.

381
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,450
Please enjoy.

382

[Cailian Manor]

383
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,250
Granny Jiang, it's you.

384
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,840
Granny Jiang.

385
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,550
What are you doing here?

386
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,630
Drive out evil spirits.

387
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,870
Avoid ghosts.

388
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,780
There's a vengeful spirit here.

389
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,569
There's a vengeful spirit!

390
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,150
A vengeful spirit!

391
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,290
It's not far from the place where the bride drowned.

392
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,589
This is really scary.

393
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,069
Wait. Granny.

394
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,660
Do you remember

395
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,990
the situation when Six Fingers Monster

396
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,220
appeared in the manor for the first time?

397
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,300
Ten years ago,

398
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,700
he suddenly appeared under your window

399
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,500
like a ghost.

400
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,420
The servants of Cailian Manor were all replaced ten years ago.

401
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,260
What happened?

402
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,540
All servants had to be replaced.

403
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,740
It's so late.

404
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
He went to his room.

405
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,130
He must be hiding something from me.

406
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,920
You're busy?

407
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,140
I thought about it.

408
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,340
Although there are inner walls in Cailian Manor,

409
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,630
the pond in the manor is connected with the outer river,

410
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,700
Lion Spirit probably fell into the waterway in the river

411
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,260
to escape from being traced

412
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,810
and swam into the manor.

413
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,470
Fortunately, Madam Xu saved him.

414
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,950
Strangely,

415
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
he disappeared

416
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,810
three days later.

417
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,320
And no one in the manor saw him.

418
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,110
Maybe he went out along the waterway?

419
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,290
I don't think so.

420
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,700
A person has been missing for ten years without sake.

421
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,900
I have a bad feeling about this.

422
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,260
Shi Hun has a habit of keeping records

423
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,820
after dealing with bodies.

424
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,420
As long as we find his notebook,

425
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,460
we can also find the body of Shan Gudao.

426
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,890
Di,

427
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,640
if you want to get rid of the Asura Grass,

428
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,810
don't waste your energy.

429
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Nothing can do that

430
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,710
except the Xijing Trick.

431
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,530
You just

432
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,980
help me find Shi Hun.

433
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,850
I'm not like you.

434
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,750
Even without the Xijing Trick,

435
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,460
I won't let myself

436
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,650
lose all internal power.

437
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
You don't need to provoke me.

438
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,620
I think I'm living well now.

439
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,540
You liked to be a hero,

440
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,530
but now you'd rather be a disabled person.

441
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,860
Haven't you said that before?

442
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,220
My biggest weakness

443
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
is to be fond of being a hero.

444
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,090
I've changed.

445
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,380
If it weren't for

446
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,060
Fang protecting you,

447
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,380
how could you have gotten away with all dangers?

448
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,900
But haven't I been living well

449
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,120
in the past ten years?

450
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,430
Speaking of Fang Duobing,

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,330
Di,

452
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,500
I want to give you some advise.

453
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,530
At least your identity is

454
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,970
my old friend for many years.

455
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,060
Can you just pretend a little

456
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
and stop making him suspect?

457
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,680
Are you afraid that he'll find out who you are?

458
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,860
You don't know how troublesome he is.

459
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,300
Afraid of trouble?

460
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,210
I'll kill him when I regain my power.

461
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,870
Di,

462
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,670
he is just an unimportant junior.

463
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,220
It's not that serious.

464
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,660
What are they talking about?

465
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,820
Why can't I hear anything clearly?

466
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,770
Who?

467
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,150
Guo Kun.

468
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,850
You know martial arts?

469
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,310
You can't run away.

470
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,600
You can't run away.

471
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,700
Where is he?

472
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,060
I'm tired.

473
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,220
Let him go first.

474
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,880
But I know who he is.

475
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,350
It's that mad Guo Kun.

476
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,760
Li Lianhua.

477
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,780
Why didn't you give me any response?

478
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,180
Have you already known it?

479
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,180
Mr. Fang,

480
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,220
Guo Kun is mad,

481
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,470
but can't you see that?

482
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
He walks very steadily.

483
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,020
It's like the long-lost Arhat Qian Kun Step.

484
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
As for Guo Qian,

485
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,180
when I asked him about Shi Hun,

486
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,620
he looked clearly flustered in his eyes.

487
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,740
He wants to use his internal force

488
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,190
to stop such breath,

489
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,840
but exposed his inner power.

490
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,670
He's a member of the Southwest Bagua Sect.

491
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,900
Can't you tell it?

492
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,250
Then why didn't you tell me?

493
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,090
We didn't expect you wouldn't be able to tell it.

494
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
I did.

495
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
I just didn't say it.

496
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,220
But you two

497
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,210
are not good at martial arts.

498
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,030
You're quite good at judging character.

499
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,860
We're not skilled in martial arts.

500
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,360
So we need to observe carefully.

501
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,330
Everyone in Cailian Manor is skilled.

502
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,610
They pretend not to know martial arts

503
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,860
and have nothing to do with Baichuan Academy.

504
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,460
I think they're just making excuses to stop our investigation.

505
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,920
In the middle of the night,

506
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,970
someone sneaked around my room with skeletons.

507
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,570
Cailian Manor really likes to play tricks.

508
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,630
Why did you

509
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,020
stayed together stealthily

510
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,050
In the middle of the night?

511
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,780
We...

512
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,980
It just occurred to us that

513
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,070
since it's said this wedding dress is the murderer,

514
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,570
we don't know

515
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,560
what this wedding dress looks like.

516
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,590
Right.

517
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,460
Guo Kun can't be found

518
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,300
in a while.

519
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,560
Let's go.

520
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,060
I'll show you myself.

521
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,500
[Cailian Manor]

522
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,360
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

523
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:21,750
Go away! Go away! Go away!

524
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,580
It's just a wedding dress.

525
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,750
But here a complicated eighth-way Pan Wen lock is used.

526
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,060
It's a pity that it can't defeat me.

527
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,270
The clothes and jewelry are so plain.

528
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Shouldn't the bride

529
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
be gorgeously and colorfully dressed?

530
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,340
This is not a wedding dress.

531
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,650
This is a silver mountain.

532
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,560
No taboo, no taboo.

533
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,210
You look so ignorant.

534
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,980
This is called pomegranate dress.

535
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,540
The crown is made of silver.

536
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,860
Plus this dress,

537
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,070
I'm afraid they'll weigh dozens of kilograms.

538
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,200
So heavy.

539
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,730
They will tire the bride out.

540
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,850
Guo Huo told me before

541
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,740
that this dress

542
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,220
was left by his ancestors.

543
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,370
It's very precious.

544
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,290
However precious it is,

545
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,150
it carries several lives.

546
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,760
I don't think anyone else

547
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,050
will wear this wedding dress.

548
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,380
Especially the daughter of Weiyuan Escort Agency.

549
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,020
She comes from a wealthy family.

550
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,090
There's no reason for her to compromise.

551
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,950
So I think

552
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,180
the murderer is very strange.

553
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,860
Because every time he killed someone,

554
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,180
he especially targeted at women in this wedding dress.

555
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,450
So, Fei.

556
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,430
If... I said if.

557
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,180
If someone is the bait,

558
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,330
the murderer might appear.

559
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,010
Good idea.

560
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,780
Right?

561
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,620

562
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,570
Not only have you grown up,

563
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,260
but also you've become more and more perceptive.

564
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,740
Okay.

565
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,120
Put it on.

566
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
I have nothing to do with the case.

567
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,300
Excuse me.

568
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,350
Fei.

569
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,550
Have you forgotten what you promised?

570
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,300
Fang Duobing.

571
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,530
Why don't you have a try?

572
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,990
I guess none of us

573
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,020
want to wear this pomegranate dress.

574
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,260
To be fair,

575
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,000
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

576
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,130
Admit defeat.

577
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
The clothes are too heavy.

578
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,270
Well.

579
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,290
Let me go to kill someone.

580
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,410
I'll go with you.

581
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,850
Stop laughing. What's so funny?

582
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,870
Let me take a look.

583
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,370
Why is there no mirror in this room?

584
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,350
This is the bride's wedding room.

585
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,370
Without a mirror,

586
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,670
how can the bride make up

587
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,290
and try on the wedding dress?

588
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,410
Did someone move away the mirror?

589
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,180
It's outside.

590
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,940
Is this a mirror stone?

591
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,220
Did the bride come here every time

592
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,420
to look into the mirror in the wedding dress?

593
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,710
Be careful.

594
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,800
It's okay.

595
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,870
I see.

596
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,850
You can't run away!

597
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,290
Go to hell!

598
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,010
Where are you going?
Don’t move.

599
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,510
You can't run away.

600
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,500
Your martial arts skills haven't improved these years.

601
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,040
You're quite good at swimming.

602
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,270
Stop talking to me.

603
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,820
Listen.

604
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,260
This outfit is too heavy,

605
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,420
especially in the water.

606
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,980
Ordinary people can't get up.

607
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,890
You can't even handle a lunatic.

608
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,860
Do you still care about the reputation of the Sigu Sect?

609
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,850
The Sigu Sect has long been disbanded.

610
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,470
Why should we care about its reputation?

611
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,390
Besides,

612
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,080
can reputation solve the case?

613
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,050
Clean the bruises on your neck yourself.

614
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,910
Thank you.

615
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,780
You can't run away.

616
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,270
You can’t run away.
Li Lianhua, are you okay?

617
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,820
I'm fine.

618
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,420
It's nothing.

619
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,200
What happened?

620
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,200
Uncle.
Brother.

621
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,650
You...

622
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
What's going on?

623
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,220
I should ask you that.

624
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,590
Why did Mr. Guo

625
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,410
carry skeletons and

626
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,670
act like a ghost near our room in the middle of the night?

627
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,420
He attacked us when we are not prepared.

628
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,600
Did you conspire

629
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,820
to harm us

630
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,370
and then cover up the truth

631
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,670
in Cai Lian Manor?

632
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:53,930
Mr. Fang.

633
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,040
Is there any misunderstanding?

634
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,300
My uncle does know a little martial arts,

635
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,130
but he won't harm anyone.

636
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,910
Our Cailian Manor also

637
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,240
won't intend to harm you.

638
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,200
Master Guo,

639
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,310
I heard the opposite room

640
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,820
is for the bride who's married far away.

641
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,650
Because it's a long journey,

642
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,940
the bride will live there in advance, right?

643
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,010
So what?

644
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,870
Our Zhao clan has always been like this.

645
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,190
Why is there no mirror in this room?

646
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,850
The geomantic master came to see it before.

647
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,290
He said the mirror is not suitable for this room.

648
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,240
There's a raised stone here.

649
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,260
There's a row of Shoushan Stones by the lake.

650
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,710
Could it also be

651
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,450
the cause of geomantic omen?

652
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,270
This is a downhill.

653
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,310
The fortune and good luck can flow away

654
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,000
alongside the downhill.

655
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,650
I use Shoushan Stones to block it

656
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,560
and change the pattern.

657
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,790
As for this stone,

658
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,060
it's more normal.

659
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,780
What are you trying to say?

660
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,990
I risked my life

661
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,870
to react the way three brides died.

662
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,550
You acted so well.

663
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,670
You talk too much.

664
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,380
Actually, I really don't understand

665
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,610
what's wrong with this wedding dress.

666
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,600
So,

667
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,310
I just tried it.

668
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,530
Because there is no mirror in the room,

669
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,090
I came here to look into the mirror stone.

670
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,680
I didn't expect Guo Kun to show up with skeletons.

671
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,430
This is downhill.

672
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,900
Li Lianhua's dress

673
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,900
is very heavy.

674
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,630
So when a person falls,

675
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,510
it'll be hard to get up

676
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,940
due to the weight on his body.

677
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,150
He will also roll down the slope

678
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,570
because the body is too heavy.

679
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,340
The dress is too narrow.

680
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,140
It's hard for people to get up quickly.

681
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,450
That's why

682
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,440
Li Lianhua rolled down all the way

683
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,620
and fell into the lotus pond.

684
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,590
No wonder the brides

685
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,260
have fractures and scars everywhere.

686
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,270
That is thanks to your Shoushan Stones.

687
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,330
Yes.

688
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,520
If you pass out and fall into the water,

689
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,680
you'll drown.

690
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,600
If you didn't pass out,

691
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,920
since the wedding dress is so heavy,

692
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,350
you also can't save yourself in the water.

693
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,450
Li,

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,070
you mean

695
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,300
the three brides who died in our manor

696
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,130
fell into the pond

697
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,150
and drowned

698
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,390
due to the pomegranate dress.

699
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,250
That's right.

700
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,850
But their bodies

701
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,250
were found there.

702
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,970
How did they die here?

703
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,300
The water in the Lotus Pond is not stagnant.

704
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,780
Because the water leads to the outside river,

705
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,860
there is a hidden stream.

706
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,260
So the bodies were pushed to the bridge by the water.

707
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,530
The blooming lotus

708
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
blocked the bodies.

709
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,980
Li Lianhua.

710
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,090
When you were looking for clues

711
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,240
near the bridge where the bodies were found,

712
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,680
you had known the water there

713
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,120
actually lead to the bride's room,

714
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,340
right?

715
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,860
That's why you said you wanted to see the wedding dress.

716
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,960
What else?

717
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,400
Even then,

718
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,170
when those brides

719
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,740
looked into the mirror stone,

720
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,800
why did they suddenly trip?

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,240
You should ask Guo Kun.

722
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,010
Didn't someone

723
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,090
fall down like this?

724
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,700
Uncle went mad and scared the brides.

725
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,360
That's why…

726
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,450
You can't run away.

727
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,150
You can't run away.

728
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,500
I see.

729
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,140
It's my junior brother.

730
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,380
Bastard.

731
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,220
To be honest,

732
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,620
my brother has been mad since he was young.

733
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,450
At the age of marriage,

734
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,340
he would rush towards the brides in a wedding dress.

735
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,700
So I had to find someone to keep an eye on him

736
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,280
to avoid scaring others.

737
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,110
But I never thought...

738
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,700
It's all my fault.

739
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,870
He killed three people in a row.

740
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,850
I'll kill him today!

741
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,870
Guards!

742
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,500
Wait.

743
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,650
Mr. Fang.

744
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,630
Master Guo.

745
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Even if he started it,

746
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,930
we can't punish him without permission.

747
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,390
I will take the criminal

748
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,900
back to Baichuan Academy first.

749
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,980
I wonder

750
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,340
if the chaos just now

751
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
harmed the Lotus Tomb in the pond.

752
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,670
Take a look.

753
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,000
I still think something is wrong.

754
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,280
Every time the brides

755
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,159
looked into the mirror stone,

756
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,960
why did Guo Kun happen to go mad there?

757
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,830
And Master Guo

758
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,060
is so harsh on the servants.

759
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,300
How could he allow such a stone

760
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,460
to be unmoved for ten years?

761
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,239
Besides, that road just now

762
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,570
is a twin-star oriented.

763
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,139
There's no need for Shoushan stones to change the fate.

764
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,110
It doesn't match the geomantic theory.

765
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:42,810
Something is wrong.

766
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,989
There are too many coincidences.

767
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,739
Are you listening to me?

768
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,190
How is that possible, Mr. Fang?

769
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,380
I just

770
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,980
said my guess.

771
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,780
Guo Qian immediately believed Guo Kun did it.

772
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,070
There's something wrong.

773
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,870
Not to mention that after Madam Xu died,

774
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,450
where did Shi Hun go?

775
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,910
Wasn't it all for nothing?

776
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,000
You knew it very early?

777
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

778
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,730
I was thinking of

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,610
the Lotus Tomb that Guo Qian mentioned.

780
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,870
I think

781
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,410
it's a secret technique.

782
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,650
I heard a little about it.

783
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,900
Right?

784
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,320
I remember many years ago,

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,950
Jinyuan Alliance also learned

786
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,380
many strange secret techniques from the Blood Realm.

787
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,850
Yes.

788
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,800
You two are so knowledgeable.

789
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,410
Only I know nothing.

790
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,930
Mr. Fang,

791
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,260
today,

792
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,420
you are the most tired.

793
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,730
I'll make you a midnight snack tonight.

794
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,620
No need.

795
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,740
You want to run?

796
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,450
Come back.

797
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,050
What is it?

798
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,190
What is this?

799
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,070
I added chili in the lotus seed soup.

800
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,770
This is specially prepared for you.

801
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,270
Spicy wolfberry lotus seed soup.

802
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,860
The lotus seed in the pond is big and round.

803
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,510
It's a pity not to taste it.

804
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,570
Come on, try it.

805
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,490
Fei.

806
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,360
You did well tonight.

807
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,740
This soup is for you.

808
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,490
No need.

809
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,120
Save it for yourself.

810
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,810
Strange.

811
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,130
The lotus nut has a strange fragrance.

812
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,610
What did you add?

813
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,570
There is something wrong.

814
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,290
The lotus nut is red.

815
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,770
They do like these strange things.

816
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,310
Do they use this?

817
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,560
It depends.

818
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,220
What are you talking about?

819
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,430
Who are they?

820
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,880
Also,

821
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,520
where did you find this finger bone?

822
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,530
It is at the bottom of the lotus pond.

823
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,220
I touched it in the mud.

824
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,390
There are bodies in the lotus pond?

825
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,090
Yes.

826
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,880
There were many people just now.

827
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,060
We shouldn't alert them.

828
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,450
They have left now.

829
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,620
Let's go and have a look.

830
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,960
Guo Qian treasures the lotus pond.

831
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,730
Let's be careful.

832
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,580
Don't get caught.

833
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,290
Let's go.

834
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,930
This.

835
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,790
Go into the water.

836
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,330
You've always been weak.

837
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,300
You can't go down.

838
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,400
Fei.

839
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,360
Go down and have a look.

840
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,060
What?

841
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,290
You aren't even willing to help us with this?

842
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,450
Then you'd better not follow us.

843
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,100
I don't need you

844
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,240
to order me around.

845
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,810
What's the matter?

846
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
Can you keep your voice down?

847
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,000
Fang Duobing.

848
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,600
Fang Duobing.

849
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,010
Why did you provoke him?

850
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,600
After the case in Cailian Manor,

851
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
you'd better stay as far away from Fei

852
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,340
as possible.

853
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,420
What do you mean?

854
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,190
Do you think I bullied him?

855
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,870
I'm helping you.

856
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,900
I can't explain it clearly to you.

857
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,660
Lower your voice.

858
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,970
I...

859
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,360
What is this?

860
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,050
I'll remember it once.

861
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,930
Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

862
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,790
Bodies at the bottom of the pond are all like this.

863
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,650
This is indeed the style of Shi Hun.

864
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,970
So this is the Lotus-cultivating Magic of Cailian Manor.

865
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,010
If such roots were planted by the pond,

866
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,300
they would have been discovered long ago.

867
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,190
The lotus was cultivated by human bodies.

868
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,930
You...

869
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,970
Many people know Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

870
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,430
But only Shi Hun

871
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,710
knows how to do it.

872
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,100
It's impossible for him

873
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,660
to stay in Cailian Manor only for a while.

874
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,490
That's right.

875
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,000
Guo Qian is lying.

876
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,100
Jinyuan Alliance likes

877
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,010
these abnormal tricks.

878
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:41,880
It's not strange.

879
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,420
On the other hand

880
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,460
why do you know so much

881
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,260
about Jinyuan Alliance?

882
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,320
Here's the thing.

883
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,590
You'll naturally know it

884
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,770
after having been in the wide world for long, right?

885
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,140
Is that true?

886
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,450
Don't treat me like a fool, okay?

887
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,810
Shi Hun is just a small potato in Jinyuan Alliance.

888
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,430
He only has a little records in the file.

889
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,850
But you two know so much about Jinyuan Alliance.

890
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,450
Why are you looking for Shi Hun?

891
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,330
Fine.

892
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,360
Since you have discussed all the way

893
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,140
and have a tacit understanding,

894
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,730
but you're only not honest with me.

895
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,130
You can investigate this case yourselves.

896
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,120
I

897
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:16,920
quit.

898
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm the detective.

899
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,280
Why did I end up

900
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,350
becoming an outsider?

901
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,630
Forget it.

902
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,040
I said I don't care.

903
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,500
That's not right.

904
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,540
Why does Fei know so much

905
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,340
about strange secret techniques and Jinyuan Alliance?

906
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,470
Won't Li Lianhua be in danger?

907
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[This is Li Lianhua, the owner of Lotus Tower. Find out who he is.]

908
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[This is Fei from South Sea Sect. Find out who he is.]

909
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[Fang Quality]

910
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,700
Tianji Hall has been

911
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
in the wide world for so many years.

912
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,650
It's not difficult

913
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,280
to investigate their background.

914
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,700
You can hide your secrets if you want.

915
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,970
One day,

916
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,080
I'll let you ask me in person

917
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,300
to trust you again.
