00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,310
We're having bad luck as soon as we met.

194
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,380
-Bye.
-Wait.

195
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,460
You can leave.

196
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,650
If you don't want to travel with me,

197
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,980
I won't force you.

198
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,700
After all, we're friends.

199
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,290
But we need to have a farewell dinner.

200
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,580
It's your treat.

201
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,920
W-Why?

202
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,150
Because I'm hungry.

203
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,310
I'm hungry too.

204
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,070
Yes.

205
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,770
It's Yipin Tomb.

206
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,460
Yes.

207
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,220
I remember now.

208
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,820
It's called Yipin Tomb.

209
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,020
Have we met before?

210
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,460
Yes.

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,420
Are you talking about the strange case at Mount Puchu?

212
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,730
Yes.

213
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,220
It's Mount Puchu.

214
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,450
Several days ago,

215
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,620
seven headless corpses appeared in the mountain.

216
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,870
The constable said the people who saw said they were still moving.

217
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,640
They were all grave robbers.

218
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,300
They wanted to rob

219
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,680
Yipin Tomb.

220
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,820
That's why they died.

221
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,050
Yipin Tomb is strange.

222
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,500
Let me show you something.

223
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,740
This is the evidence

224
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,710
the magistrate's office got from the corpses.

225
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,100
The half skull is the insignia

226
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,060
of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld.

227
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,060
This is the grave robbers' badge.

228
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
I heard the leader of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

229
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,010
disappeared ten years ago.

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
Seven headless corpses suddenly appeared

231
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,800
holding Prince Fangji's treasures

232
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,790
and carrying the grave robbers' badge.

233
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,090
Do you think

234
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,550
they were the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?

235
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,010
Also,

236
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,190
I heard that this has something to do with

237
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,300
the legendary Yipin Tomb.

238
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,560
It’s pretty interesting.

239
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,070
I can cast aside our former grievances and bring you along with me

240
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,650
to investigate this case of the seven thieves‘ corpses.

241
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,810
However...

242
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,620
Young Hero Fang,

243
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
you’re talking on your own again.

244
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,940
When did I say I want to investigate the case with you?

245
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,700
You...

246
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,410
Besides,

247
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,560
I don't understand

248
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,570
a single word

249
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
of what you said.

250
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,350
It made me sleepy.

251
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,060
We'd better not see each other again.

252
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,740
Fine.

253
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,620
I don't need you to investigate the case.

254
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,420
Take care.

255
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,460
Buddy.

256
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,990
Let me ask you.

257
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,780
Is there a black market selling antiques nearby?

258
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,640
Antiques?

259
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,480
Yes.

260
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
In the mountain.

261
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,050
It's called Wei's Manor.

262
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,620
Thank you.

263
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,180
I'm here to investigate.

264
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,020
What are you doing here?

265
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm here

266
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,810
to sell something.

267
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,480
To sell something?

268
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,630
Selling something in a black market in the mountains?

269
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,950
Are you selling Fox Spirit?

270
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,630
You said Yingzhu Armor is very valuable.

271
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm here

272
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,830
to ask about the price.

273
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,310
Maybe I can sell it at a good price

274
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,310
and my Lotus Tower

275
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,260
can be renovated.

276
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,630
Yingzhu Armor is the martial arts world's great treasure.

277
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,140
You want to sell it to renovate your shabby building?

278
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,650
You...

279
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,570
Forget it.

280
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,400
I said I won't bother with you.

281
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,660
[Wei Manor]

282
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,800
This is private property.

283
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,620
It's off limits to unauthorized personnel.

284
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,310
I'm here to do business.

285
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,080
According to our rules,

286
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,320
you need to pay 100 taels of deposit to do business.

287
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,490
100 taels?

288
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,910
Don't tell me you didn't bring money with you to do business?

289
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,010
When one does business out in the world,

290
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,950
they need friends everywhere.

291
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,130
I'll pay his deposit.

292
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,180
Look.

293
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,670
We're together.

294
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,680
I can't just watch you get kicked out, right?

295
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,750
At least you have a conscience.

296
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,660
Take it.

297
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,610
This piece of hetian jade

298
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,450
is enough for our deposit, right?

299
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,300
Let's go.

300
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,040
Please.

301
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,300
You've gone too far.

302
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,340
How could you use my jade pendant

303
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
to pay your deposit?

304
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,470
Think about it.

305
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
This jade pendant is the only valuable thing on you.

306
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,130
You had to hand it over anyway.

307
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,730
Since you paid, I won't have to.

308
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,800
It's more worth it for both of us to come in.

309
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,460
Right?

310
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,580
You have a point.

311
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,700
Forget it.

312
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll spare you this time.

313
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,590
Don't let me see you again.

314
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,390
This way, please.

315
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,210
Qiutuo.

316
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,790
Who do you think you are?

317
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,540
How dare you eat with us?

318
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,160
[Zhang Qingshi, Zhang Qinghu]

319
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,320
Z-Zhang Qingshi.

320
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,500
[Qiu Tuo]

321
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,960
Why are you glaring at me?

322
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Wei's is having a banquet.

323
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,940
Everyone has a share.

324
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,100
I don't think you deserve it.

325
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,890
[Duan Hai]

326
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,490
Brother Qingshi.

327
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,300
We are guests.

328
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,650
Let’s not argue with him.

329
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,070
Give Master Wei some face.

330
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,270
Brother.

331
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,580
Duan Hai is right.

332
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,450
Forget it.

333
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,680
[Ding Yuanzi]

334
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,930
You look unfamiliar.

335
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,460
Are you here for the banquet too?

336
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

337
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,980
Let me ask

338
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,340
when did you set off

339
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,280
and which road did you take?

340
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,500
The day before yesterday.

341
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,740
I took the official road.

342
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
Bamboo whistle and panpipes both make music.

343
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,170
This friend

344
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,030
is listening to music with us.

345
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,710
We're all in the same boat.

346
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,500
Everyone,

347
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,860
this young man

348
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,380
is a meathead.

349
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,340
He doesn't usually come out,

350
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,150
so he doesn't know our code.

351
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Please forgive him.

352
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,740
What meathead?

353
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,360
How ominous.

354
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,000
Since when were meatheads allowed to the banquet?

355
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,980
When did you set off

356
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,570
and which road did you take?

357
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,740
I left at 20th watch

358
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,810
and I took

359
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,990
a solo road.

360
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,290
You're a veteran.

361
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,260
Since you took a solo road,

362
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,230
may I ask if you carried a flag,

363
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,450
and how many words were on it?

364
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,500
I carried a golden flag.

365
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,390
The four words left on the tower of the imperial mausoleum

366
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,660
in the south of the capital 13 years ago.

367
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,339
Greetings, Scholar Sushou.

368
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:29,980
Sir.

369
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,300
I didn't expect you to be here.

370
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I am Ding Yuanzi

371
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,040
of the Gilded Gold Sect.

372
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,230
I am Duan Hai

373
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:38,970
of the Remnant Ink Sect.

374
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,350
I am Ge Pan

375
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,290
[Ge Pan]

376
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,460
of the Mountain Mortise Sect.

377
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,770
We are the brothers

378
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,190
Zhang Qingshi and Zhang Qinghu

379
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,050
of the Heavenly Clock Sect.

380
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,770
I've long heard your name, Sir.

381
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,120
Gu Fengxin!

382
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,260
Sir Sushou took the solo road

383
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,590
like you.

384
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,100
Come and pay your respects.

385
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm not interested.

386
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,920
Sir, please forgive him.

387
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,950
Gu entered into this trade halfway.

388
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,610
He doesn't know the rules.

389
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,260
Please forgive him.

390
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,910
It's okay.

391
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,820
I'm here for the banquet, not to socialize.

392
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,120
Please make yourselves at home.

393
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,080
What did you mean just now?

394
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,750
It was code.

395
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,510
It's grave robbers' code.

396
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,650
You've followed me all the way here.

397
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,730
You should know where this is.

398
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,380
Of course I know.

399
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,450
The outer courtyard of Wei Manor is a black market for antiques.

400
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,880
The inner courtyard is a gathering point for grave robbers.

401
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,990
Someone discovered the tomb and came here to gather a team

402
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,740
to go down the tomb together.

403
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,540
I just don't understand

404
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,580
why they suddenly attacked me.

405
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,360
That's because you said something wrong.

406
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,770
The time you set off

407
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,940
is the number of years you've been in the trade.

408
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
The road you took

409
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
is the sect you're from.

410
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
The Heavenly Clock

411
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,950
[Heavenly Clock]

412
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,950
[Crimson Phoenix, Green Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise]

413
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,410
observes the sky to look for openings.

414
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,590
The Mountain Mortise looks for tombs based on the terrain.

415
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,010
[Mountain Mortise]

416
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,300
The Remnant Ink references ancient scrolls.

417
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,610
[Remnant ink]

418
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,730
The Gilded Gold uses burial goods that have surfaced as clues.

419
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,110
[Meijin]

420
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,990
As for the Bronze Pan, Fire Money, they're all small sects.

421
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,050
You didn't mention any of these

422
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,880
and instead said that you took the official road.

423
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,370
The official road means the magistrate's office,

424
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,780
which is their enemy.

425
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,180
Of course they'll have to kill you.

426
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,160
What does the solo road mean?

427
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,360
It means I entered the trade halfway

428
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,220
without an affiliation to any sect.

429
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,320
These people enter the tomb with their skills

430
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,100
and are often killers.

431
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,530
So when they asked if you carried a flag,

432
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,360
it's to ask if you have killed anyone.

433
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,230
You're smart.

434
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,720
A gold flag means I'm a wanted criminal.

435
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,980
In that case,

436
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,490
they wouldn't dare to provoke us.

437
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,710
Thirteen years ago, the imperial mausoleum in the south of the capital was robbed.

438
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,130
23 guards were killed.

439
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,280
The arrogant robber left his name, Scholar Sushou,

440
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,740
in front of the tower.

441
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,540
His Majesty was furious.

442
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,250
He ordered the criminal's arrest, but he hasn't been found.

443
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,740
You're pretending to be Scholar Sushou?

444
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,340
You're familiar with

445
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,360
the imperial court's files.

446
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,400
That's right.

447
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,940
So I pretended to be a famous person

448
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,410
to sneak in.

449
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,850
You said you're here for the black market but you came to the inner courtyard.

450
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,080
You're also so fluent in grave robbers' code.

451
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
More importantly,

452
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,080
the case of Scholar Sushou is a secret order from the imperial court.

453
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,440
You know it too?

454
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,690
Li Lianhua.

455
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,620
There must be something wrong with you.

456
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,910
Don't point at me.

457
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,060
It's rude.

458
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,660
Do you know why

459
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,010
they haven't found Scholar Sushou?

460
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,090
Why?

461
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,690
Because he died.

462
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,850
I buried him myself.

463
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,520
He was badly injured.

464
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,170
I pitied him,

465
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,340
so I allowed him to stay with me

466
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,890
until he passed away.

467
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,260
So

468
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,380
in order to thank me,

469
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,710
he taught me grave robbers' code.

470
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,380
Aren't you familiar with the imperial court's files?

471
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,720
You should know that

472
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,020
Scholar Sushou's name is Qi Zhiyuan

473
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,770
and he has a birthmark on his forehead.

474
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,890
Right?

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
Then why did you come to the inner courtyard?

476
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,850
Because someone was stupid.

477
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:20,920
Who are you talking about?

478
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,360
Because you're oblivious

479
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,530
and I was afraid you would be exposed.

480
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,870
As expected,

481
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,940
you were outed as a meathead and almost got yourself killed.

482
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,940
Think about it.

483
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,140
I got confused again.

484
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,630
What is a meathead?

485
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,220
Some people rob graves,

486
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,100
meathead rob corpses.

487
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,980
They even take corpses hostage for a ransom.

488
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,300
They're small fry.

489
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,390
Understand?

490
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,960
Since it's dangerous

491
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,180
and you're here,

492
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,650
let's work together again.

493
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
One more time.

494
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,010
You're calculating.

495
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,020
No need.

496
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm quite safe

497
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,940
posing as Scholar Sushou.

498
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,670
You were angry at me for leaving you behind

499
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,880
and borrowing your jade pendant.

500
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,990
You told me to stay away from you.

501
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,500
I think you're right.

502
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
It makes sense.

503
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,780
You don't know martial arts.

504
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,140
If you are in danger,

505
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,170
I can protect you.

506
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,440
Thank you.

507
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:10,930
No need.

508
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,450
Goodbye.

509
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,270
I think the Zhang Brothers

510
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,820
are related to the seven thieves' corpses case.

511
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,660
I just saw the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld's insignia

512
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,960
on their badge.

513
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,450
What does that have to do with me?

514
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,970
You can use your status

515
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,160
to help me.

516
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,080
Besides,

517
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,610
we came in together.

518
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,300
If I get caught,

519
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,880
you won't be able to escape either.

520
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,900
Fine.

521
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
You're ungrateful.

522
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,940
That's right.

523
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,300
Li Lianhua.

524
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,700
Do you agree?

525
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,260
I only guarantee your identity won't be revealed.

526
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,390
The investigation has nothing to do with me.

527
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,890
Deal.

528
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,930
Thank you all for gathering at my manor.

529
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,070
[Wei Manor]

530
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,030
I am very honored.

531
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,480
I've long heard of Scholar Sushou's reputation.

532
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,130
I'm the Master of this Manor.

533
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,080
I am very honored

534
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,950
[Master Wei]

535
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,520
that you are attending my banquet.

536
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,220
I've just been idle for a long time

537
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,020
and am looking to earn some money.

538
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,070
You came at the right time.

539
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,210
Everyone,

540
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,570
I have a treasure.

541
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,420
Please give me a hand.

542
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,220
Penglai Jade Mountain Vase?

543
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,390
This is one of Prince Fangji's burial goods.

544
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,920
You should know

545
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,610
why I invited you here.

546
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,740
Master Wei’s banquet is indeed

547
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,080
because of Yipin Tomb.

548
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,630
You must have heard about

549
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,930
the case of Mount Puchu's headless corpses.

550
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,530
You came here after hearing the news.

551
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,830
I will make sure you have a good time.

552
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
Prince Fangji

553
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,620
was the eldest son of Emperor Xicheng 100 years ago,

554
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,820
His Majesty's granduncle.

555
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
He was the Crown Prince

556
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,620
but got into trouble and was ordered to commit suicide by Emperor Xicheng.

557
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,870
That's how the throne got passed to

558
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,780
His Majesty's grandfather, a member of the royal family.

559
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,670
His tomb is called Xi Mausoleum,

560
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,530
and in it are extraordinary treasures.

561
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,630
The martial arts world calls it Yipin Tomb.

562
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,800
Prince Fangji had many martial arts world contacts.

563
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,630
Rumour has it that there are many martial arts treasures,

564
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,410
brilliant weapons, and martial arts mental factors in the tomb.

565
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,120
Over the past hundred years, countless people have been searching for it.

566
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,150
But all have failed.

567
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,540
The tomb seemed to have disappeared.

568
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,870
Do you know why Yipin Tomb disappeared?

569
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,540
It had something to do with the reason Prince Fangji was ordered to commit suicide.

570
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,830
Back then, the Nanyin Kingdom hadn't been annihilated.

571
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,980
They sent a princess to our kingdom for a marriage alliance.

572
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,500
She married Crown Prince Fangji as his consort.

573
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,010
Prince Fangji was so enamored by her that

574
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,310
he wanted to force his father to abdicate.

575
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,360
Emperor Xicheng was terribly sad and angry

576
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,600
so he ordered them to commit suicide,

577
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,030
and forbade them from being buried in the imperial tomb.

578
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,490
Nanyin craftsmen were ordered to build their tomb.

579
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,550
Yipin Tomb was built in the Nanyin style.

580
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,710
Nanyin was known for its strange and evil magic,

581
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,430
so it's no wonder no one could find the tomb using the Central Plains' techniques

582
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,730
for over a hundred years.

583
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,730
But now, we're going to find it.

584
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,860
The seven headless bodies on Mount Puchu

585
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,840
had not only the treasures Prince Fangji was buried with,

586
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,030
but also

587
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,970
a map of Yipin Tomb.

588
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,500
I didn’t expect that so many years after Wei Manor was established,

589
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,290
Yipin Tomb would show up at my doorstep.

590
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,860
It’s a blessing from the Heavens.

591
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,130
I invited you here

592
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,820
to make a fortune.

593
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,500
Master Wei,

594
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,590
those seven corpses came out with treasures.

595
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,670
That means they'd entered the tomb.

596
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,360
But why did they die in the wild?

597
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,460
Why did they lose their heads?

598
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,610
Yipin Tomb was built with Nanyin's techniques.

599
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,670
Their traps were strange and powerful.

600
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,740
My guess is

601
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,970
they were beheaded in the tomb.

602
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,940
Their bodies were then flushed out of the tomb

603
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,950
by the heavy rain.

604
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,140
We got lucky.

605
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
Everyone here is a master.

606
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,820
We won't repeat their mistake.

607
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,750
If anyone is afraid,

608
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
you can leave now.

609
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,370
What do you think?

610
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,490
Everyone,

611
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,380
what do you think?

612
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,690
I'm not afraid of making money.

613
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,720
Let's do something big together.

614
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,780
Good.

615
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,340
I've prepared a banquet

616
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,410
to welcome you.

617
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,180
Come with me.

618
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,330
Let's go.

619
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,170
Brother.

620
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,380
The Weeping Guanyin we're looking for

621
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
is in Yipin Tomb.

622
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,170
What should we do?

623
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,620
No matter what, we must find it.

624
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,220
Let's enter the tomb with them first.

625
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,710
Then,

626
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,310
we'll kill them all.

627
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,240
[Wei Manor, Yipin Tomb]

628
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,460
[Lotus Tower]

629
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,500
Master Wei, the banquet is at Canglu Garden today?

630
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,310
I heard that your Canglu Garden is very auspicious.

631
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,900
Holding the banquet here

632
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,980
is sure to guarantee success.

633
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,600
Everyone,

634
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,960
may we make a fortune.

635
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,700
Great!

636
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,350
Where did you come from?

637
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,140
You want to die?

638
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,770
Guys,

639
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,760
don't fight.

640
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,660
This is my distant elder.

641
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,270
Although he's young,

642
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,850
he is very senior.

643
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,700
Please be seated.

644
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,770
Master Wei.

645
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,540
Why are all sorts of things

646
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,810
at your banquet?

647
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,570
A cowardly Qiutuo

648
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,780
and a meathead are fine.

649
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Now, there's even a rude little turtle.

650
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,590
I've always paid my crew

651
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,980
according to their contribution.

652
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,010
Yipin Tomb is no exception.

653
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,100
If when the time comes,

654
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,670
this young elder of mine is useless,

655
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,810
he won't get paid.

656
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,940
Don't worry.

657
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,250
Here.

658
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't ruin the mood.

659
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,380
Let's have a drink.

660
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,220
This wine is good.

661
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,850
Good wine.

662
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,090
Come.

663
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,450
Brother Gu.

664
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,540
Long time no see.

665
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,830
I was worried

666
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,570
when you first entered the trade

667
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,700
that the disciples of the Dunjia Sect would want to make a fortune too.

668
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,430
After that, you joined the trade with your sister.

669
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,170
I finally

670
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,510
felt relieved

671
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,560
and at ease.

672
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,190
What is real in life?

673
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,560
Gold!

674
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,990
Here.

675
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,540
Let's drink.

676
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,720
Good wine.

677
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,460
Kid,

678
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,150
Master Wei insisted on taking you with him.

679
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,110
Tell me.

680
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
What can you do?

681
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,410
In our business,

682
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,780
if you follow us,

683
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,690
you can't just eat.

684
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,830
Come on.

685
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,330
Have a drink.

686
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,910
You're real man when you have some hair.

687
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,530
Get lost.

688
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,180
My hand!

689
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,180
Come on.

690
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,860
Take Ding Yuanzi to get bandaged.

691
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,810
Be careful.

692
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,220
Bastard!

693
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,830
I'll teach you a lesson on the behalf of your Master!

694
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,420
Hold on.

695
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,720
Brother Qingshi.

696
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,380
Calm down for good luck.

697
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,020
Sir Sushou.

698
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,350
What do you mean?

699
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,720
It's not a good sign

700
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,130
to start fighting before the job.

701
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,010
Young man,

702
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,180
why did you do that?

703
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,050
We're here to make money.

704
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,350
Harmony brings wealth.

705
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,670
Harmony brings wealth, right?

706
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Zhang Brothers,

707
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,140
I know you don't like it.

708
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,180
But my young elder has unique martial arts skills.

709
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,730
Only he can open the entrance to Yipin Tomb.

710
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,300
Even I have to put up with him.

711
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,460
Just bear with it.

712
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,210
How about this?

713
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,160
Let's hold another banquet at the pond outside the courtyard.

714
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,350
The Zhang Brothers and I will enjoy the moon

715
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,540
while drinking to our hearts' content.

716
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,500
I have a few vats of Xifenglie on my Manor

717
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,020
that have been ageing for ten years.

718
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
I know you like strong wine.

719
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,840
Don't miss it.

720
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,910
Everyone.

721
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,900
Let's go together.

722
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,470
Didn't he say there's going to be another banquet?

723
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,100
You're leaving already?

724
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,810
I'm sleepy.

725
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,450
At the banquet just now,

726
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,170
you suddenly hinted to me not to drink.

727
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,200
Why?

728
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,290
I just don't like drinking.

729
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,220
Forget it.

730
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,340
Since you were kind to that kid,

731
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,380
I'll let it slide.

732
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
If that kid

733
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,660
really got hit by Zhang Qingshi,

734
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,290
he'll die.

735
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,630
Yes.

736
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,980
If he hit him,

737
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,160
he'll die.

738
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
If the headless corpse case

739
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,930
can really lead to the Yipin Tomb that disappeared a hundred years ago,

740
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,770
it will surely astound the world

741
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,800
and give the Master of Baichuan Court a good shock.

742
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,840
You're really not interested in investigating the case with me?

743
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,860
Aren't you sleepy?

744
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,760
What are you waiting for?

745
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,150
Eight for you and nine for me.

746
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,940
What does that mean?

747
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,220
The bedrooms.

748
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,840
Master Wei loves gambling.

749
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,670
He used dices for room numbers.

750
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,780
Alright.

751
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,940
Go to sleep.

752
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,970
I have something to do.

753
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,100
Where are you going?

754
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,150
The Zhang Brothers have

755
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,300
the badge of the Fourteen Thieves.

756
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,460
I also heard them say they want to kill

757
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,290
all the people who're going to enter Yipin Tomb.

758
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,260
So I suspect the seven thieves' corpses case

759
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,930
is related to them.

760
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,980
I'll go see them.

761
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,780
I'll be off.

762
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,280
[Wei Manor]

763
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,620
Brother!

764
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,350
Zhang Qingshi is dead.

765
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,690
His head is gone,

766
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,980
just like the seven corpses down the mountain.

767
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,220
Zhang Qinghu.

768
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,580
What happened?

769
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,310
I didn't see anything.

770
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,090
I don't know.

771
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,660
You two slept in the same room.

772
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,690
How could you not see the murderer?

773
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,900
Did someone sneak in

774
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,980
when you left the room?

775
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,860
Impossible.

776
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,370
I just got up to pass urine,

777
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,500
right at the door.

778
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,120
I would know if anyone came in.

779
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,700
But I don't know why

780
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,810
when I turned around,

781
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,320
my brother became like this.

782
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,600
The window is locked from inside.

783
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,060
You can't kill and decapitate someone in such a short time.

784
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,940
Plus, the other brother was here all along

785
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,140
didn't notice anything.

786
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,540
What kind of martial arts master could have done this?

787
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,050
Maybe it wasn't martial arts,

788
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,340
but sorcery.

789
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,739
I heard

790
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,080
Yipin Tomb is protected by sorcery.

791
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,840
Anyone who has designs on it

792
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,150
will be killed by socery.

793
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,889
The seven corpses at the foot of the mountain

794
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,380
lost their heads like this.

795
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,620
Zhang Qingshi is the same now.

796
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,980
Will it...

797
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,420
Will it be our turn next?

798
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,080
This sorcery is very generous.

799
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:35,980
Sir.

800
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,270
What do you mean?

801
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,179
If it were really sorcery,

802
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,429
it could have decapitated your brother in front of everyone

803
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,210
so no one would dare to go to Yipin Tomb.

804
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,460
Instead, it prevented Zhang Qinghu

805
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,889
from seeing this cruel scene.

806
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,100
It's rather empathetic.

807
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,350
The most important thing now

808
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,060
is to check if there are any other entrances

809
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,500
to this room.

810
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,160
You went to investigate the Zhang Brothers last night?

811
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,940
I've been looking for a chance to tell you.

812
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,310
I came out of Canglu Garden and followed them,

813
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,580
but they disappeared in the blink of an eye.

814
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,840
Why do you always make mistakes?

815
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,500
I always thought the seven thieves' corpses case

816
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,380
was done by them,

817
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,900
so they were vigilant and avoided me.

818
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,320
I didn't expect Zhang Qingshi

819
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
to become a headless corpse too.

820
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,860
Is there really some kind of sorcery?

821
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,460
I'm not getting involved in the investigation.

822
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I'm not counting on you.

823
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:28,970
That's good.

824
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,240
Look.

825
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:41,990
Look.

826
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,220
The vent at the back of the room is broken.

827
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,450
If someone entered from here,

828
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,670
they could commit the murder without Zhang Qinghu realizing.

829
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,570
The entrance is just one chi wide.

830
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,830
How could anyone get in?

831
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,740
No adult could get in.

832
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,400
You mean the kid at the banquet?

833
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,700
That kid is sinister and vicious.

834
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,980
Zhang Qingshi had an argument with him.

835
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,140
It's possible that he would seek revenge.

836
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,650
Bastard.

837
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,370
Bastard! Stop!

838
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,460
Did you kill my brother?

839
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,790
Who do you think you are?

840
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,340
How dare you talk to me?

841
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,180
I'll crush your arm.

842
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
I'll see if you'll confess or not.

843
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,350
-Wait.
-You...

844
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,680
Wait.

845
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,750
Are you helping this bastard?

846
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,340
I’m just here to tell you

847
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,460
the murderer was someone else.

848
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,340
I received a secret letter

849
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,200
saying that a detective from Baichuan Court is among us.

850
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,520
The Zhang Brothers' martial arts skills are unique.

851
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,740
If they worked together,

852
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,910
it'd be hard for anyone to get the better of them.

853
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,190
He must have killed Zhang Qingshi

854
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,530
to weaken our strength

855
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,630
and make us suspicious of one another.

856
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,340
So Zhang Qingshi must have been killed by the detective.

857
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,230
In our trade, we meet once every few years

858
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,710
or not at all in person.

859
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,220
How do we know who is a detective from Baichuan Court?

860
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,040
I already know who he is.

861
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,520
"The hundred rivers flow down at once,

862
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,740
flushing away the murky and bringing out the clear."

863
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,670
Ge Pan, you are indeed from Baichuan Court.

864
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,470
Guards.

865
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,900
Drag him out and kill him.

866
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,340
Wait.

867
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,750
Master Wei,

868
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,430
there’s something wrong.

869
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,100
If the murderer were Ge Pan,

870
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,490
how could he

871
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,310
have avoided

872
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,800
Zhang Qinghu, who was at the door?

873
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,120
He wouldn't have been able to get through that small vent.

874
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,060
Exactly.

875
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,000
This little thing is the most suspicious.

876
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,040
Everyone,

877
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,840
I have a question.

878
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,130
I can vouch for my young elder.

879
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,910
Who dares to vouch

880
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,490
for the Baichuan Court's detective?

881
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,750
Even if he didn't kill anyone,

882
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,690
do we still want him to stay?

883
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,380
Since you have no objections,

884
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,300
let's send Ge Pan off.

885
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,560
Don't kill the innocent!

886
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,670
You're so concerned about someone from Baichuan Court.

887
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,390
Are you his associate?

888
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,140
I...

889
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,310
Hold on.

890
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,620
What advice do you have?

891
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm flattered.

892
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,010
It's just that a detective of Baichuan Court sneaked in.

893
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,790
He must have backup.

894
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,860
If he has accomplices,

895
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,590
everyone will be in danger.

896
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,010
So my suggestion is

897
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,760
to spare his life for now.

898
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,110
After we find out the truth tomorrow,

899
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,700
we can rest easy.

900
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,990
Since Scholar Sushou has said this,

901
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,690
I have no objection.

902
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,690
What about you, Brother Qinghu?

903
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,360
Okay.

904
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,020
I'll wait for the good news from Scholar Sushou.

905
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,050
In that case,

906
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,730
thank you.

907
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,680
Guards.

908
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,090
Take him away.

909
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,710
Let's go.

910
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,560
There are so many detectives from Baichuan Court

911
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,470
at Wei Manor.

912
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,320
Do you know Ge Pan?

913
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,640
I've never trained at Baichuan Court.

914
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,810
I'm not sure.

915
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,140
But this weapon

916
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,870
indeed belongs to Baichuan Court.

917
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,600
So I had to save Ge Pan.

918
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,740
Thank you for helping me just now.

919
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,950
Thank you.

920
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,580
I wasn't helping you.

921
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,170
I’m afraid of death, Young Hero Fang.

922
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,190
We came in together.

923
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,300
If you start fighting,

924
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,680
I would be implicated.

925
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,830
After thinking about it,

926
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,190
I'd either have to rat you out

927
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,000
or help you.

928
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,750
I could only choose one of them.

929
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,440
Take it.

930
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,320
Rat me out?

931
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
What do you mean?

932
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,240
You haven't finished.

933
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,500
Fine.

934
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,310
I'll deal with you later.

935
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,780
There seems to be no entrance

936
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,500
other than the main door and the vent.

937
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,380
Did the kid really do it?

938
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,180
Let me ask you.

939
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,200
If you were that kid

940
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,380
and you wanted to climb into the room through the back wall,

941
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,620
how would you do it?

942
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,420
One, dig a hole.

943
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,510
Two, climb in.

944
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,940
Three, murder.

945
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,000
Take it.

946
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,440
The murderer's steps were different from what you said.

947
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,820
There's blood on it.

948
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,370
If he dug a hole through the bricks

949
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,810
before climbing in to kill,

950
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,590
blood wouldn't get on this brick.

951
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,960
There's blood on the brick.

952
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,890
It means the murderer killed

953
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,830
before making the hole.

954
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,260
So the murderer framed the kid?

955
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,070
What else?

956
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,680
But the murderer didn't leave any clues

957
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,050
in the seven thieves' corpses case.

958
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,930
Now, he's trying to frame someone else?

959
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,570
Do you think just because headless corpses showed up at Mount Buchu,

960
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,330
that it was all done by the same person?

961
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,060
You mean

962
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,060
these two cases might not be related?

963
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,030
I don't know.

964
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,820
I only know that the blood on Zhang Qingshi's clothes

965
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,560
seeped through the layers.

966
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,010
It didn't spurt out.

967
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,770
The blood splattered on one side,

968
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,660
but there was nothing behind the body.

969
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,170
So he died

970
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,120
before his head was chopped off.

971
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,260
He didn't die from being beheaded.

972
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,320
But he's dead.

973
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,860
Why the killer behead him when he was already dead?

974
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,870
The head is a very strange thing.

975
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,200
It can reveal a lot of secrets

976
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,720
whether a person is dead or alive.

977
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,290
What do you mean?

978
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,300
Now,

979
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,510
we need to investigate

980
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,350
Zhang Qingshi's case.

981
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,370
The murderer killed him

982
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,860
before digging a hole in the wall to frame someone else.

983
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,910
That means he must have entered through the front door.

984
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,000
But Zhang Qinghu stayed in the same room,

985
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,640
and didn't see anything.

986
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,310
What if they didn't

987
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,800
stay in the same room?
