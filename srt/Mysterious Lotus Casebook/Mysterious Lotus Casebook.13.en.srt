[Episode 13]

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,950
Xiangyi.

5
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,789
Do you think that

6
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,030
what you say is always right,

7
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,729
always the truth,

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,640
and Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

9
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
It has been proven over the years

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,660
that all these are true.

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,070
Sigu Sect will run normally

13
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,740
regardless of who leaves.

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,650
But without Li Xiangyi,

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,420
it'll collapse.

16
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,540
Fine.

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,860
You've finally said it.

18
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,460
We grew up together since we were young.

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
When there was food, I couldn't bear to eat them,

20
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,190
and I gave all of them to you.

21
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,520
I also gave you the best sword I forged.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,980
Deep down,

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,260
I value you

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,140
more than myself.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,780
But what about you?

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,840
Since Sigu Sect only needs you,

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,650
I quit.

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,930

♫There are still things I can't let go♫

32
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,180
♫I asked myself tens of thousands of times♫

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,190

♫I'd never forget♫

Senior!

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,170
Sect Leader.

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,390
We were ambushed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,990
Senior's dead body was snatched too.

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,420
It was a trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain.

54
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,500
Sigu Sect, listen to my order.

55
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,580
From today onwards,

56
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,210
we'll fight the Jinyuan Alliance

57
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,610
till death do us part.

58
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,750
Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,340
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,500
Since I exposed your nonsense,

61
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,750
you don't know how to quibble anymore, do you?

62
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,100
I can't hide anything from you.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,310
Of course.

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,909
They are very close.

65
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,330
I'll spare your life today.

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,880
Don't spread rumours again.

67
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,150
It's time to go.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,700
Fei knows my uncle.

69
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,830
He must know Li Xiangyi.

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,970
Fei is not familiar with Li Xiangyi.

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,500
You don't have to ask him.

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't care about others,

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,850
but I must find out about Fei.

74
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,350
He is so bad at martial arts

75
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,320
but so arrogant.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,280
There must be something fishy.

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,670
Come on.

78
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,010
Let's go to Baichuan Court together.

79
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,250
Why are we going to Baichuan Court?

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,260
Counting the murder cases in Cailian Manor,

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,700
I've already solved three major cases.

82
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,340
It's time to go to Baichuan Court

83
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,420
for the real detective badge.

84
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,610
If so, you will have Baichuan Court as your partner

85
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,290
when you become a detective.

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,510
Congratulations.

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,830
Same to you.

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,510
You used to be my partner,

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,960
and you'll also be the only one in the future.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,890
How about this?

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,710
We'll imitate the Sigu Sect

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,460
to solve mysterious cases

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,760
and rectify the martial arts world.

94
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,630
Let's go.

95
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
So much money?

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,460
Li Lianhua,

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,659
did you strike gold

98
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,440
or get a fever?

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,920
You're leaving soon.

100
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,280
If you don't prepare well,

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,570
you may starve to death on the way.

102
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,140
Take it to buy some solid food.

103
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,360
No need?

104
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,110
Fine, if you don't need it, I can just...

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,010
It's a rare opportunity for misers like you to be generous.

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll go buy food in town right away.

107
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,300
By the way,

108
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,540
keep an eye on Fei.

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,930
I'll investigate him when I come back.

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,830
I bought a lot of fresh vegetables.

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,400
Li Lianhua!

112
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,200
[To Mr. Worried]

113
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,700
"Fei and I have personal affairs to attend to.

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,370
We have to take our leave.

115
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,810
So I'm writing this letter to inform you.

116
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,310
I'm not leaving without saying goodbye."

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,020
You cunning old fox.

118
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,340
"I'm not an old fox,

119
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,460
and I'm not cunning at all.

120
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,780
This letter is to warn my friend

121
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,900
to stop sulking

122
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,140
and leave this place as soon as possible.

123
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,540
Otherwise, things will change."

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
There's no way I will buy that.

125
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
"You can surely buy that.

126
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,980
Please check it out behind the rock.

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,100
I've sent out a smoke signal.

128
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,680
Your aunt is coming to catch you.

129
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,620
Leave now."

130
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,140
Li Lianhua,

131
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,450
I hate you!

132
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,400
Hurry up.

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,190
Director Di,

134
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,780
you've emptied all the pharmacies nearby, right?

135
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,460
Let's begin.

136
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,080
To practice this technique,

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,020
you have to insert silver needles at certain anatomical points

138
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,860
and take herbal medicine to get the poison out of your body.

139
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,960
Director Di,

140
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,140
please meditate and circulate your qi.

141
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll perform the acupuncture.

142
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Li Xiangyi,

143
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,920
don't play tricks with me when it's related to martial arts.

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,000
It's been ten years since we saw each other,

145
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,760
and you've become more vigilant.

146
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,170
Don't worry.

147
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,350
I won't play any tricks.

148
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,590
It would be best.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,940
I've told you

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,340
the mantra.

151
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,480
Circulate your inner breath for 49 days,

152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
and the poison of the Xiuluo Grass will be detoxified.

153
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,400
Remember, it's 49 days.

154
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,430
Don't miss even a bit.

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Do you hear me?

156
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,000
Director Di.

157
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,700
Do you hear me?

158
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,840
Director Di.

159
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,390
When should I leave

160
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,810
if not now?

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,030
My Lord ordered that

162
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,100
I must make Sect Leader Li stay.

163
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,070
Your Lord just said I can leave.

164
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,930
Oh no.

165
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,980
The poisonous grass has backfired on Your Lord.

166
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,840
Go quickly and have a look.

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,640
You have recovered just like that?

168
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,020
I didn't realize how quickly 49 days went by.

169
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,400
Where are you going?

170
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,050
We're even now.

171
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,120
So I'm leaving.

172
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,950
I promised not to expose your identity.

173
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,090
But do you think you can retire from the martial arts world

174
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,450
and die like a loser?

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,580
You're too naive.

176
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,230
Director Di,

177
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,620
why bother forcing me?

178
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,610
All I want is for you to live on

179
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,440
and fight with me again.

180
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,230
Greetings, My Lord.

181
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,290
Medicine Demon.

182
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,610
I want him to regain his inner power.

183
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
My Lord,

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,980
he is severely injured.

185
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,770
It's not easy to deal with.

186
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,970
Is it not easy,

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,590
or are you not competent enough?

188
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,860
No, no, no.

189
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,110
My Lord, if you want him to recover,

190
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,330
I'll try my best.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,990
My Lord, please come with me.

192
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,070
Let's go.

193
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,980
Move.

194
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,620
My Lord,

195
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,680
Hundreds Herbs Syrup

196
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,380
is a treasure I have decocted

197
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,290
with hundreds of exotic herbs for over ten years.

198
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,860
Normally, a cup of it works.

199
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,320
But if you drink too much,

200
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,230
your meridians will overreact and cause unbearable pain.

201
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,000
Drink that.

202
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,680
Please.

203
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,870
With his injury,

204
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,370
one cup may not work.

205
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,070
Go on.

206
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,540
It's so bitter.

207
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,870
Well...

208
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,830
Feed him.

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,350
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,310
Please.

211
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,910
Thank you.

212
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,540
I'll do it myself.

213
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,610
My Lord,

214
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,760
this guy's qi has been disrupted.

215
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,910
His inner power is weak.

216
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,720
Well...

217
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,300
Even three cups are of no avail.

218
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,720
His inner power is weak?

219
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,770
I'll insert my inner power into his body

220
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,170
to stimulate the drug effect.

221
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,460
My Lord.

222
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,810
He will die if you do so.

223
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,200
I told you it's incurable.

224
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,670
It's such a waste of resources

225
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,920
for Director Di to get me all these treasures.

226
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,570
Think of another way.

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,340
Think of a way.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,950
We can give it a shot at the Spiritual Snake Cave.

229
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,360
Spiritual Snake Cave?

230
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,460
My Lord,

231
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,470
these spiritual flood dragons in the Eastern Sea

232
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
have been fed with spiritual medicine for many years.

233
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,580
They like to suck people's qi and feed them again.

234
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,330
Now that this guy's qi is disrupted.

235
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,310
Let's have an exchange transfusion for him.

236
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,610
It might work.

237
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,650
Let's try then.

238
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,780
B-Bicha Poison?

239
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,830
My Lord.

240
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,800
He was poisoned by Bicha Poison.

241
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,920
Useless!

242
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,700
My Lord, please calm down.

243
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,280
If you want him to regain his inner power,

244
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,270
and fight him,

245
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,710
there's another way.

246
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,110
Say it.

247
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,020
Wangchuan Flower.

248
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,590
Wangchuan Flower?

249
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,210
It has the supreme yang.

250
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,770
It can help me break through the eighth level of the Windy Poplar.

251
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,750
But his inner power is not strong.

252
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,810
How can it cure him?

253
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,400
My Lord,

254
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,870
Wangchuan Flower has two different types, namely Yin and Yang.

255
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,370
The Yang grass is a kind of martial art, same as you.

256
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,440
While the Yin grass

257
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,630
is the most poisonous grass in the world.

258
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,760
Even if a child takes it,

259
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,310
they can gain more than ten years of martial skills.

260
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,050
But it's like the last radiance of the setting sun.

261
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,540
A few days later,

262
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,700
the Yin grass will start to have a strong effect,

263
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,080
and it will get stronger and stronger.

264
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,140
His meridians will break

265
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,460
and his organs will split.

266
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,710
There is no other way to die more terribly

267
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,980
than it in the world.

268
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,830
I don't want him to live a long life.

269
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,380
I just want him to live on until we fight again.

270
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's go.

271
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,740
I want the Wangchuan Flower.

272
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes, My Lord.

273
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,770
Why are you laughing?

274
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,920
Director Di,

275
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,980
stop wasting your time.

276
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,220
It's all for nothing.

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,650
So what if you get the Wangchuan Flower?

278
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,770
You can force me to eat it,

279
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,990
but you can't force me to fight with you.

280
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,540
By then, I'll lie in front of you

281
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,130
and wait for death under the sun,

282
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,740
seeing you anxious.

283
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,440
It's already interesting even if I just imagine the situation.

284
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,350
Lee Xiangyi.

285
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,900
Don't you want to know

286
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,150
how your senior, Shan Gudao,

287
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,560
died?

288
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,220
The three kings of the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior.

289
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,390
Yet you want to deny it?

290
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,680
It's written clearly on the mortuary records of the Jinyuan Alliance.

291
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,310
Shan Gudao died because his left chest was stabbed.

292
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,780
Among the three kings, only the King Xunming of Yama used a sword as his weapon.

293
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,230
He made a mistake back then.

294
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,060
I punished him to bind his right hand for a month.

295
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,980
Even if he did attack your senior,

296
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,510
he should have used his left hand.

297
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,100
It's impossible for him to kill your senior with his right hand.

298
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,040
Ten years ago,

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,780
we declared a five-year truce.

300
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,660
After that, your senior was killed for no reason.

301
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,940
Then the war between Jinyuan Alliance

302
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,900
and Sigu Sect

303
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,980
started again.

304
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,610
In the end, both of us lost our power

305
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,610
and declined in the martial arts world.

306
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,570
But you and I were not the ones who benefited from it.

307
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,770
If you really want to avenge the death

308
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,190
of tens of Sigu Sect's warriors,

309
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,850
and avenge the death of your senior,

310
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,500
I can help you find out the hidden truth.

311
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,260
As long as you promise

312
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,160
to fight with me again.

313
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,360
Avenge?

314
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,260
If they really want to avenge themselves,

315
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,010
they should take revenge on Li Xiangyi.

316
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,020
Because he was arrogant,

317
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,070
and he killed everyone.

318
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,230
He deserved to die.

319
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,180
And he did die after that.

320
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,420
All the hatred

321
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,340
vanished with Li Xiangyi ten years ago.

322
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,710
Director Di,

323
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,330
Li Lianhua

324
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,940
won't fight with you.

325
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,490
I understand.

326
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
You are now a lost soul

327
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,490
although you're alive.

328
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,710
You won't be easily persuaded by me.

329
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,310
Okay.

330
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,240
I'll add some more bets.

331
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,780
If you don't promise me,

332
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,580
I'll kill Shan Gudao's son myself.

333
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,360
Director Di,

334
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,900
please stop joking.

335
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,540
My senior didn't even get married.

336
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,120
How could he have a son?

337
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,090
18 years ago, the Second Young Miss of the Tianji Hall, He Xiaolan,

338
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,840
was in a relationship with Shan Gudao.

339
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,840
This is her farewell letter to Shan Gudao.

340
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,430
[To Shan Gudao]

341
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,860
"I love you, who are in the martial arts world.

342
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,080
But you only love the scenery along the way

343
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,450
and refuse to stop your journey.

344
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,170
You live up to your name.

345
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,420
You're indeed a lonely sword.

346
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,600
Since it's hard to keep each other, we shouldn't persist anymore.

347
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,330
Let's say goodbye now

348
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,850
and cut off my love.

349
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,640
I hope you take good care of yourself.

350
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,790
Xiaolan."

351
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,580
Although they broke up,

352
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,100
they spared the life of their unborn child.

353
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,530
A few months later,

354
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,840
Tianji Hall announced that she died of illness.

355
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,980
But the Chief of the Tianji Hall,

356
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,710
He Xiaohui, who hasn't got pregnant for so many years,

357
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,960
and Minister of Revenue, Fang Zeshi,

358
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,260
had a son that year.

359
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,090
The child

360
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,370
is named Fang Duobing.

361
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,810
You are smart.

362
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,790
You should have known that

363
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,220
Fang Duobing is not Shan Gudao's nephew,

364
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,030
but his son.

365
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,600
Li Xiangyi,

366
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,940
if you don't promise me,

367
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,160
I'll let Shan Gudao's son,

368
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,660
who is his only child,

369
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,330
die in front of you.

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,280
Sir.

373

Serve me the most expensive dishes and wine.

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay, sir.

375
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,670
Waiter.

376
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,950
Take good care of him.

377
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,850
Li Lianhua.

378
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,520
I treat you as my friend,

379
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,180
but you took Fei, who is of dubious background, with you.

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,790
Who do you think I am?

381
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,060
Sir,

382
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,410
this is the best lotus banquet

383
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,620
in our restaurant.

384
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,740
Each dish is lotus-flower-themed.

385
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,920
It's fragrant and delicious.

386
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,200
Look at this dish.

387
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,130
"Lotus grows step by step."

388
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,810
This dish is called “Tongue-glittering Lotus”.

389
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,470
This dish is more delicious.

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,640
This is called "The Lotus Reflecting the Sun Shows Different Colours."

391
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,980
"The Lotus Reflecting the Sun Shows Different Colours."

392
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,140
Sir,

393
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,210
these plates are made of jade.

394
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,100
They're very pricey.

395
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,930
What are you yelling about?

396
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,420
How much can a few plates cost?

397
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,670
I'll compensate you.

398
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,480
Do you have money?

399
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,730
Look at you wearing such decent clothes.

400
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,310
How dare you dine and dash?

401
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,660
Why don't you ask around to find out more about

402
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,070
what my place is?

403
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,230
It's just a small amount of money.

404
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,980
Take it and get lost!

405
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,780
Get lost!

406
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,620
Li Lianhua, it's all your fault.

407
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,120
-Go as far as you can.
-Exactly. What kind of person is he?

408
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,590
Li Lianhua

409
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,030
has no conscience at all.

410
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,420
Why didn't he give me more money?

411
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,860
Now I don't even have a place to stay.

412
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,390
And I have to live on air

413
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:06,790
and eat solid food on the roof.

414
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,110
[After investigation, no one from Nanhai Sect is called Fei]

415
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,320
No one from Nanhai Sect is called Fei.

416
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,250
So,

417
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,020
he's lying to Li Lianhua.

418
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,770
Li Lianhua is in danger.

419
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,180
Whether he's dead or alive

420
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,040
is none of my business.

421
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,920
Excuse me.

422
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,970
Have you seen a man who looks detestable

423
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,870
and is talkative,

424
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,260
and he even brought a building with him creepily?

425
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,090
No, no.

426
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,520
Dude,

427
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,790
have you seen a building

428
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,630
carried by a carriage?

429
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,900
A building?

430
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,170
It seems to be over there.

431
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,240
Thank you.

432
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:17,940
Li Lianhua.

433
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,860
Fei.

434
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,870
Where is Li Lianhua?

435
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,940
Come with me.

436
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,210
What do you mean?

437
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,270
I've investigated it.

438
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,850
You are not from Nanhai Sect.

439
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,060
Who are you exactly?

440
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,670
Also,

441
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,670
where is Li Lianhua?

442
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,790
If you don't leave,

443
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,950
take out your sword.

444
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,430
What?

445
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,370
I said I would remember you

446
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,780
when we were in Cailian Manor.

447
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,520
Take out your sword.

448
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,550
I can't believe you've been hiding your martial arts.

449
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,600
You are a liar!

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,120
I'll teach you a lesson.

451
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,700
Being able to force me to step back,

452
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,590
you're talented.

453
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
If I give you another ten years,

454
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,630
you'll definitely be one of a kind.

455
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,660
Unfortunately...

456
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,650
Li Lianhua.

457
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,340
What's wrong with you?

458
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,380
Did Fei do it too?

459
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,120
It has nothing to do with you.

460
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,230
Go away quickly.

461
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,220
You're injured,

462
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,060
yet you came to save him.

463
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,620
You really care about him.

464
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,690
Come at me if you dare.

465
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,750
I indeed came for you.

466
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,580
That palm just now wasn't a killing move.

467
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,040
I've injected some Gang Qi into your body.

468
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,060
Li Lianhua.

469
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,620
If you don't want him to die,

470
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,560
I'll give you half a month to think about

471
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,070
whether to accept my request or not.

472
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,990

473
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,310
How are you?

474
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,570
I'm fine.

475
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,790
It's just that my meridians are swelling.

476
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,630
Gang Qi of Di Feisheng is so powerful.

477
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,360
I can merely suppress it even with Yangzhouman.

478
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,370
It's not a long-term solution.

479
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
[Cailian Manor]

[Lotus Tower]

481

The Di family

482
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,270
only keeps killers,

483
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,050
not the fools.

484
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,390
Today, the two people who will fight to the death are...

485
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,250
Di Aman and Di Feisheng.

486
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,190
After today,

487

only one of you can live.

488
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,360
Only one of you can live.

489

If you want to let him live,

490
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,460
you'll die for him.

491
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,790
You must be Di Feisheng, right?

492
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,600
Anyone from the Di family

493
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,530
can never kill his master.

494
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,150
You'd better behave yourself and be my butcher.

495
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,360
Don't try to resist.

496
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,620
Your life

497
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,420
will never change.

498
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,660
Run away.

499
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,540

Even if I took the Weeping Guanyin,

504
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,440
it could only restore my power

505
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,170
but I still couldn't break through

My Lord, are you in a bad mood?

What is it?

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,920
My Lord,

513
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,290
I have good news for you.

514
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,860
Aren't you looking for the King  Xunming of Yama

515
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,770
and the Four-faced Qingzun?

516
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,690
I sent someone to find some parts

517

of the map of Prison 188.

518
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,930
The whereabouts of King Xunming of Yama are included.

519
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,130
My Lord, I am so loyal to you,

please spare me this time.

521

Are you really that loyal?

522
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,990
Then tell me

523
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,740
why Li Xiangyi got poisoned by Bicha Poison.

524
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,910
How did you...

525
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,400
It doesn't matter how I know about it.

526
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,340
What matters is that in the past ten years,

527
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,200
you made me feel that I won the battle at the East Sea.

528
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,050
What matters is that in the past ten years,

529
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,330
you made me become an ignorant person.

530
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,170
Li Xiangyi deserved to die.

531
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,180
In this life,

532
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,450
I hope only My Lord ranks first in the martial arts world.

533
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,970
How do I need to use poison to dominate the world?

534
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,690
I wanted to get rid of Li Xiangyi secretly

535
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,400
to solve your problem.

536
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,400
But Li Xiangyi was so ignorant

537
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,570
that he came to steal your thunder.

538
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,840
I know I was wrong.

539
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,930
I've been waiting for you in the Jinyuan Alliance for ten years.

540
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,190
Finally, My Lord is back.

541
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,530
Please punish me.

542
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,510
I'll accept it.

543
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,700
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

544
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,830
Don't think you can do whatever you want

545
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,550
with ten years of hard work.

546
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,940
I don't care

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,840
whether Jinyuan Alliance survives or not.

548
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
From now on,

549
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,560
you don't have to investigate the thundering fire bombs anymore.

550
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,280
I have assigned Wuyan to investigate it.

551
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,410
If I find out that it's related to you,

552
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,670
I'll kill you.

553
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,260
Fang Duobing!

554
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,040
Are you abandoned again?

555
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,120
Are you hungry?

556
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,730
Dig in.

557
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,010
Eat.

558
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,370
Eat slowly.

559
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,140
What were you mumbling about?

560
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm hungry.

561
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,980
Eat slowly.

562
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,040
Don't get choked.

563
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,850
I'm not eating.

564
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,340
You eat.

565
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,170
Why are you staring at me?

566
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,740
It's nothing.

567
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
Aren't you more like your mother?

568
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,900
What kind of nonsense is that?

569
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,530
Our butler said

570
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,250
I resemble my second aunt the most.

571
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
But when I was born,

572
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,830
my second aunt had already died.

573
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,620
You didn't see your uncles many times.

574
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,900
When you were young,

575
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,340
did he dote on you much?

576
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,830
My uncle is the second master of the Sigu Sect.

577
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,180
He was usually very busy.

578
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,520
He didn't have time for me.

579
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,670
Besides, my mother seemed to hate him very much.

580
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,320
She didn't allow me to get close to him.

581
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,449
Why do you suddenly ask about my family matter?

582
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,460
It's nothing.

583
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,280
I was just asking.

584
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,830
Eat your buns.

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,960
Then let me ask you.

586
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,530
You have to answer me honestly.

587
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,469
Who is Fei exactly?

588
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,980
Why is he so skilful in martial arts?

589
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,460
Since we are now at this point,

590
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,070
I won't hide it from you anymore.

591
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,290
He's Di Feisheng.

592
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,159
D-Di Feisheng?

593
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,520
The devil of the Jinyuan Alliance, Di Feisheng?

594
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,389
Well...

595
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,260
Do you know my master

596
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,739
is unaccounted for ten years because of him?

597
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,100
How can you hang out with such a devil?

598
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,530
He asked me to promise him to save someone.

599
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,660
Save someone?

600
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,860
You can lie with your medical skills,

601
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,940
but you can't save lives with it.

602
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
There are people in this world

603
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,190
who can only be saved by me.

604
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,870
Unfortunately,

605
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,980
I don't want to save them.

606
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,180
So you left me behind

607
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,060
because you were afraid Di Feisheng would deal with me,

608
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,090
but it turned out that you were caught

609
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,300
and got hurt all over your body.

610
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,320
Li Lianhua,

611
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,810
I won't accept your kindness for that.

612
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,530
We agreed that friends should share weal and woe.

613
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,140
Even if the opponent is Di Feisheng.

614
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,710
Young Hero Fang,

615
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,310
I know you're good.

616
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,950
It's my fault this time.

617
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,270
Thank you.

618
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,910
At least you have a conscience.

619
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:38,980
By the way,

620
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,820
don't promise Di Feisheng

621
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,070
to save the person he mentioned.

622
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,420
The person he wants to save

623
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,870
is definitely not a good person.

624
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,540
He is indeed not a good person.

625
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
I won't save him.

626
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,010
It's more important to save you now.

627
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,430
Di Feisheng has inserted Gang Qi

628
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,360
into your body.

629
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,830
It'll be troublesome.

630
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,780
It doesn't matter.

631
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm talented.

632
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,900
I felt a little uncomfortable just now.

633
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,560
Look now.

634
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm fine.

635
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,790
I don't have much inner power left.

636
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,830
I almost can't deploy my power to suppress the Gang Qi.

637
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,190
But if Gang Qi reaches his temple,

638
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,990
he will surely die.

639
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,970
This is the only way.

640
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,920
You're awake.

641
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,420
Get up and have some warm water.

642
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,720
Why did I faint again?

643
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,070
You've been inserted Gang Qi.

644
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,530
You fainted all of a sudden.

645
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,840
I didn't expect that you are so heavy

646
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,530
that I was exhausted

647
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,560
to carry you back to the Lotus Tower.

648
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,920
Practice the skill set according to the papers I put on the table.

649
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,530
Practice it properly.

650
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,680
What is this?

651
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,230
A draft?

652
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,870
A draft?

653
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,330
This is an ancestral skill.

654
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,650
Previously,

655
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,890
the Gang Qi inside your body

656
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,390
was suppressed by it.

657
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,870
Study hard.

658
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,710
Don't bother me anymore.

659
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,370
It's ancestral?

660
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,480
The ink is not dry yet.

661
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,770
Did you draw it just now?

662
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,330
The ancestral martial arts

663
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,980
must be passed down by word of mouth.

664
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,330
So I drew it for you

665
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,450
to make you understand

666
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,500
and learn well.

667
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,390
Understand?

668
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,900
I can't simply practice any martial arts for no reason.

669
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,590
If it can't cure the Gang Qi,

670
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,730
and I'm obsessed because of it,

671
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,620
it's not worth it.

672
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,320
I won't practice it.

673
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,110
No.

674
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,130
Do you know why Di Feisheng

675
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,430
wanted me to save lives?

676
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,420
It's because of this skill set.

677
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,250
If you don't trust me,

678
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,530
or you doubt me, it's fine.

679
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,390
But Di Feisheng's judgment

680
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,800
can't be wrong.

681
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,140
You don't want it?

682
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,540
Fine, if you don't want it, give it to me.

683
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,400
Give it to me.

684
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,820
Listen, Fang Xiaobao,

685
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,280
how can you be a detective?

686
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,310
You're such a fool,

687
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:34,840
an idiot.

688
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,620
How can you be a detective?

689
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,430
Can't you think about

690
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,850
why Di Feisheng

691
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,410
used you to threaten me to save others?

692
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,150
If the Gang Qi in your body is getting more serious,

693
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,990
you'll fall into his trap

694
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,010
because you have to listen to him.

695
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,990
What should you do then?

696
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,940
That devil keeps killing people

697
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,790
and keeps doing evil.

698
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,060
Don't you feel guilty?

699
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,270
-Do you want to practice it or not?
-Fine.

700
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,180
I will practice it.

701
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,900
You're talking too much.

702
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,340
I won't let the devil succeed.

703
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,960
Remember.

704
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,200
If I

705
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,010
go crazy,

706
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,660
foam at the mouth

707
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,620
and dance uncontrollably after practising it,

708
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,090
do remember to find me a physician from the town.

709
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,940
Don't worry.

710
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,760
I'll get you any expensive medicine if you need it.

711
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,510
Practice hard.

712
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,300
Fine.

713
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,660
After all, you've called Li Xiangyi

714
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,840
your master for so many years.

715
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,690
I'll pass this Yangzhouman to you.

716
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,840
It's a way to repay his promise to you.

717
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,140
What are you doing?

718
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,910
Are you sleepwalking at night?

719
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Li Lianhua,

720
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,100
where did you get that skill set?

721
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,570
Didn't I tell you?

722
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,410
It's ancestral.

723
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,220
Impossible.

724
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,540
The skill set is profound and mysterious.

725
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,330
It's very useful.

726
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,580
Even Tianji Hall's Mind-reading Skills

727
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,460
can't compare to it.

728
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,570
If it's really ancestral,

729
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,910
there must have been many high-skilled warriors coming from your family.

730
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,100
Tell me.

731
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,410
Where did you get it?

732
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,590
Let go of me!

733
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,860
No manners.

734
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,050
Fine.

735
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,800
One year, I went to the mountain to collect herbs.

736
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,140
Unfortunately, I fell off the cliff.

737
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,890
Suddenly, in front of a cave,

738
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,720
a fairy godmother appeared.

739
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,950
She asked me to kowtow thrice to her

740
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,240
and passed me the set of skills.

741
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,410
After thinking about it,

742
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,820
I realised that was a legendary immortal fate.

743
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,430
Bah!

744
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,090
How can there be like the pie in the sky?

745
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,260
Didn't I tell you?

746
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,410
It's all fate.

747
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,550
Tell me

748
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,370
what the name of the skill set is.

749
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,130
That's amazing.

750
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,390
It's almost the same as Yangzhouman.

751
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,500
It's Suzhoukuai.

752
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,850
I'm not buying that.

753
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,480
You know what?

754
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,210
You asked me to tell you, but you don't believe me after I told you.

755
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,620
Then explain to me

756
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,620
why I, a physician who sells plasters,

757
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,860
can get the ultimate skill set.

758
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
If I were born good at martial arts,

759
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,120
I would have become a hero.

760
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,050
Unfortunately,

761
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,460
we have different fates.

762
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,050
I can only be a wandering physician.

763
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,540
Unlike someone,

764
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,720
who's going to be a master soon.

765
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,480
All right.

766
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,010
I owe you this time.

767
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,210
It's okay if you don't know martial arts.

768
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,880
It's the same if I can.

769
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,110
After we get out of here, I'll take care of you

770
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,150
and protect you.

771
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,760
No matter what happens, just mention my name.

772
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,210
Most importantly,

773
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,110
I kowtowed three times

774
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,680
to get the skill set.

775
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,700
So you also have to kowtow thrice to me

776
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,430
so that I can feel better.

777
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,280
Dream on.

778
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,500
Except for my parents,

779
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,900
I'll only kowtow to my master, Li Xiangyi.

780
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,150
Who are you?

781
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,580
Your Suzhoukuai

782
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,450
is definitely not as good as my master's Yangzhouman.

783
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,270
Take your time.

784
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,480
Li Lianhua,

785
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,450
why don't you tell me more

786
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,470
about my master?

787
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,560
You said too little last time.

788
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,370
I haven't heard enough yet.

789
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,950
Don't you feel hot

790
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,820
and chest tightness?

791
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,310
No.

792
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,710
The crucial part of Suzhoukuai is silence.

793
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,930
Most importantly, talk less

794
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,560
and be quiet.

795
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,420
When you talk, you'll spend your energy and cause blood flow.

796
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,900
It'll boom like a firecracker.

797
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,270
It's up to you.
