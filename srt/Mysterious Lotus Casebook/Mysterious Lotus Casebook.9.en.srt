[Episode 9]

4
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,380
After all these years,

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,660
we finally found the Shaoshi Sword that Xiangyi always carried with him.

6
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,880
We feel so relieved.

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,740
I hope everyone in the martial world

8
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,630
can keep in mind the noble cause of righting wrongs and maintaining peace.

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,800
That's also Xiangyi's wish.

10
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,560
Xiao Zijin is so bold now.

11
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,660
Shi Shui.

12
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,110
It's been ten years.

13
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,930
I thought

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
Qiao Wanmian was your woman.

15
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,590
Ms. Qiao only belongs to herself.

16
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,800
It's my honor

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
to witness the return of the Shaoshi Sword with you.

18
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,190
Look.

19
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,660
It's really the Shaoshi Sword.

20
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,180
Li Xiangyi cut a stunning figure in the martial world

21
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
with the Xiangyi Swordplay he invented.

22
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,470
I heard that to entertain Ms. Qiao,

23
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,530
he tied a long red ribbon around the hilt of that sword

24
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,530
and played the 36 Drunken Moves

25
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,070
on the roof of House of Delights in Yangzhou.

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400

44

It's said that countless people flooded the streets

45
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,940
just to see that sword with the red ribbon.

46
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,760
This must be eye-opening for you two.

47
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,390
He was too young

48
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,070
and too ostentatious.

49
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,740
Yes.

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,490
Too ostentatious.

51
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,560
What's that attitude?

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,909
You can never achieve what he achieved.

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,560
You two are just jealous.

54
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,270
To make it more thrilling,

55
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,340
you can come on stage for a spar.

56
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,580
When the incense burns out,

57
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,550
the one on the stage

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,680
with the ribbon flower

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,210
can try the Shaoshi Sword.

60
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,050
Try the Shaoshi Sword?

61
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,060
I'll surely win!

62
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,070
It's quite lively.

63
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,430
The Sect Leader likes activities like this.

64
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,780
I bet he's very happy now.

65
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,380
I've known you for so long

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,080
but never asked the name of your sword.

67
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:35,790
Sword.

68
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,330
Sword?

69
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,720
It doesn't have a name?

70
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,700
A sword is a sword.

71
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,470
It doesn't need a name.

72
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,920
That one has a fancy name

73
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,580
but ended up in someone else's hands.

74
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,620
Whatever you say.

75
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,620
Aren't you going to take back your sword?

76
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,380
It's not mine.

77
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,930
Li Xiangyi died a decade ago.

78
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,990
Are you still upset about being defeated by me?

79
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,970
Li Lianhua?

80
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,770
What are you doing up there?

81
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,120
That mask…

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,659
Time's up.

83
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,580
The one holding the ribbon flower won.

84
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,710
Li Lianhua,

85
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,220
you lucky dog!

86
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,270
Shut up.

87
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,170
You're not an old friend of the Sigu Sect.

88
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,480
I've never seen you before.

89
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,380
May I know your name?

90
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,790
My surname is Li.

91
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,020
Li?

92
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,230
What's your full name?

93
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,610
Li Lianhua.

94
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,680
You're Physician Li.

95
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,960
I've heard a lot about you.

96
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,590
You got the chance

97
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,940
to try the Shaoshi Sword.

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,450
But I… I don't know how to use swords.

99
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,890
You cheated!

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,250
It's unfair!

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,780
Come down! Come down!

102
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,550
Guys.

103
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,140
Mr. Xiao said

104
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,470
that whoever got the ribbon flower won.

105
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,580
He is the winner.

106
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,790
You're all big shots in the martial world.

107
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,760
Don't be sore losers.

108
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,340
Right?

109
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,030
Young Master Fang is right.

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,840
Physician Li has Xiangyi's surname.

111
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,260
Maybe he's destined to win.

112
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,040
Physician Li,

113
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,580
try the sword.

114
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,460
Go.

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,380
Go!

116
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
What a good sword!

117
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,400
It's so beautiful!

118
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,950
It…

119
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,830
How dare you destroy the Shaoshi Sword?

120
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,720
Guys,

121
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,910
calm down.

122
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,220
There must be a misunderstanding.

123
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,310
What did you do to that sword?

124
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,680
This sword is a counterfeit.

125
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,770
Counterfeit?

126
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,480
Impossible.

127
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,750
Why did you say that?

128
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,350
It's a good counterfeit.

129
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Even the carving on the hilt is exactly the same.

130
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,570
But I heard that Li Xiangyi got this sword at the age of 15

131
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,270
and kept using it for five years.

132
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,960
But this hilt

133
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,890
looks brand new.

134
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,020
It doesn't make sense.

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,420
No abrasion at all.

136
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,130
Here, take a look.

137
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,020
When Xiangyi fought with Master Wuyou,

138
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,240
to save Wuyou's life,

139
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,750
he used the hilt of his sword to parry Wuyou's fatal blow.

140
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,700
This hilt is intact.

141
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,320
It's really a counterfeit.

142
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
This is not the sword I brought back.

143
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,770
Master Ji,

144
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,740
the sword was swapped.

145
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,590
As I said.

146
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,730
[Sword Room]

147
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,580
Look.

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,480
Three days ago,

149
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
Ms. Qiao and Mr. Xiao

150
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,870
brought back the Shaoshi Sword and locked it here.

151
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,270
The Sword Room is strictly guarded.

152
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,450
No one has entered here in the past few days.

153
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,530
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

154
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,400
Shi Shui and I took the sword out.

155
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,710
I don't think anyone had the chance

156
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,590
to swap the sword.

157
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,240
Look.

158
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,820
Something seems wrong here.

159
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,520
Gosh.

160
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,950
Why is there a tunnel here?

161
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,840
Who did it?

162
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,900
When was it dug?

163
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,470
I wonder where the tunnel leads.

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Should we go down and check it out?

165
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,120
Mian.

166
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,550
It's stuffy down there.

167
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,740
You may get an asthma attack.

168
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,980
Why don't you wait here?

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,900
No.

170
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,530
I went through a lot to finally find the Shaoshi Sword.

171
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,490
I can't wait here and do nothing.

172
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,450
Let's go.

173
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,540
This tunnel was dug at least half a month ago.

174
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,960
But the Shaoshi Sword was only sent to the Sword Room

175
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,700
in the Baichuan Court three days ago.

176
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,560
Did someone anticipate its coming?

177
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,700
Half a month ago?

178
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,400
By that time, I'd written a letter

179
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,920
to Master Ji and we'd decided

180
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,550
to keep the Shaoshi Sword in the Sword Room.

181
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,760
Few people have access

182
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,320
to our letters.

183
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,560
Seems that it's an inside job.

184
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,780
The tunnel is so long.

185
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,760
There's a clear dividing line here.

186
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,740
The section we walked through is recently dug.

187
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,900
The rest of the tunnel is quite old.

188
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,600
It was dug at least ten years ago.

189
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,610
So someone extended an old tunnel

190
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,390
to the Sword Room?

191
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,910
Ten years ago,

192
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,110
the Baichuan Court was a branch of the Sigu Sect.

193
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,270
We lived here at that time.

194
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,730
Has any one of you heard of

195
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,810
this long tunnel?

196
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,100
This tunnel…

197
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,980
Mian.

198
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,220
Are you feeling uncontrollable?

199
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,090
Li Lianhua.

200
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,310
Come here.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,630
Coming through.

202
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,520
She's dead.

203
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,560
A stab in the chest killed her.

204
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,270
It's been four hours.

205
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,060
Rou?

206
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,700
Rou.

207
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,480
She's my maid Rou.

208
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,220
I couldn't find her anywhere this morning.

209
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,100
Did she know that the Shaoshi Sword was kept in the Sword Room?

210
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,900
She's been my maid for years.

211
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,770
All the letters I exchanged with Master Ji

212
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,470
were sent and received by her.

213
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,780
The cut is thin and clean.

214
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,220
Judging from its length, it was left by the Shaoshi Sword.

215
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,340
There are two types of footprints here.

216
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,920
They're not messy.

217
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,740
So there was no fight.

218
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,270
They were standing face to face

219
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,670
and Rou didn't expect the attack.

220
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,160
It seems that Rou conspired with someone

221
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,160
to steal the Shaoshi Sword

222
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,680
but her accomplice killed her.

223
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,310
These footprints are big.

224
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,370
They must belong to a man.

225
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
You're right.

226
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
That guy

227
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,780
should be hiding in the Pudu Temple.

228
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm so sure

229
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,610
because the monks in that temple

230
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,690
all wear homemade straw shoes like these.

231
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,810
They're not for sale.

232
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,770
Half a month ago,

233
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,900
a new cook arrived there.

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,940
Half a month ago?

235
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,670
That fits the timeline.

236
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,870
Yes, it does.

237
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,360
There's a crack in the wall.

238
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,820
It seems to be connected to the outside.

239
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,990
[Pudu Temple]

240
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,870
When I sent someone to look for Jingren,

241
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,980
he was already nowhere to be found.

242
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,150
Who'd have known he was so malicious?

243
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,630
If the Baichuan Court and the Pudu Temple work together,

244
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,160
we can definitely find that murderer.

245
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,750
I hope so.

246
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,700
Namaste.

247
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,400
Ms. Qiao.

248
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,150
Do you recognize this handwriting?

249
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,090
It's Rou's handwriting.

250
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,530
You're obsessed with that sword.

251
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,560
I feel guilty about Ms. Qiao

252
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,660
but don't want you to have regrets.

253
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,810
So I'll take it out to let you have a look at it

254
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,980
and then put it back

255
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
before anyone notices it's missing.

256
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,900
Looks like Miss Rou was betrayed by her lover.

257
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,030
She swapped the Shaoshi Sword

258
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,090
so that her lover could have a look at it,

259
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,170
but that man had another plan

260
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,700
and killed her for the sword.

261
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah.

262
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,030
Rou was so foolish

263
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,960
and died for nothing.

264
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,090
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Fang,

265
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,900
can you lead my disciples back into the tunnel

266
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,340
to bring that girl's body up?

267
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,860
No problem.

268
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,340
Ms. Qiao, why don't you come with me to my room

269
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,130
and have some tea while waiting for them?

270
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,460
Mr. Li, come and join us.

271
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,069
Please.

272
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,380
So you've known each other for a long time.

273
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,310
Yes.

274
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,829
It doesn't matter when people meet.

275
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,460
Fate will bring them together eventually.

276
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,160
But it's a pity that when old friends meet,

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,839
they can't recognize each other.

278
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,700
What does that mean?

279
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,650
Have we met before, Mr. Li?

280
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,060
No.

281
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,530
Bhante Wuliao

282
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,140
is used to preaching

283
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,220
and loves to give lectures on life.

284
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,040
But personally,

285
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't believe in any constant laws.

286
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,010
They're all just personal choices.

287
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,250
Everything is written in the stars

288
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,370
and we just need to go with the flow.

289
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,250
We reap what we sow,

290
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,380
so what's the point of escaping the inescapable?

291
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,620
Mr. Li, I bet you have a lot to say

292
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,230
to Ms. Qiao.

293
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,650
So stop wasting your time on me.

294
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,120
I'll mind my own business

295
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,510
and go explain sutras in the sutra hall.

296
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,900
You guys talk.

297
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,800
What do you want to say to me, Mr. Li?

298
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,770
Here's the thing.

299
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,240
When I was young,

300
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,110
I stayed in this temple for a while

301
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,070
and met a young monk

302
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,050
named Huiyuan.

303
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,370
Later I learned that he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

304
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,250
and changed his name to Shi Hun.

305
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,040
Shi Hun?

306
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,970
I've heard of that name.

307
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll look into it for you.

308
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,080
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,410
I'll refill the teapot.

310
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,420
No way.

311
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,930

312
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,580
Ms. Qiao?

313
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,110
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

314
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,160
They may have come out.

315
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,950
I'll go ask about the person you mentioned.

316
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,890
I'll tell you if I find anything.

317
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,770
Since when have you become so withdrawn?

318
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,210
Why didn't you tell her who you are?

319
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,650
Do you think

320
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,870
you're not as good as your old self?

322
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,300
since when have you

323
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,820
become so nosy?

324
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,700
It's just interesting

325
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,120

You'd better not joke with me.

376
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,920
Where is Qiao Wanmian?

377
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,080
Rou told you that incense powder

378
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,350
can trigger my asthma.

379
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,660
You used it against me.

380
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,490
She always tells you everything.

381
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,780
She forced me.

382
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,530
I told you.

383
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,300
It's not that I don't want to return the Shaoshi Sword.

384
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,150
I just want to keep it for a few more days.

385
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,210
Who in the martial arts world

386
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,700
wouldn't want the best sword in the world?

387
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,420
You killed Rou

388
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,120
and you're still defending yourself like a coward.

389
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,680
Enough!

390
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,220
You sealed the mountain pass

391
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,570
and trapped me here.

392
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,220
I could only kidnap you.

393
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,100
I'll chop off one of your hands and give it to them.

394
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

395
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,700
Why are you here, Mr. Li?

396
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,500
Everyone split up to search for you.

397
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,300
It's just a coincidence.

398
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,620
I'm not good at martial arts,

399
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,940
so I had to launch a sneak attack.

400
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,360
Let me untie you.

401
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,750
You're risking your life to save me.

402
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,880
I will remember

403
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,510
your kindness.

404
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,010
You're too polite, Ms. Qiao.

405
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,290
This person is really shameless.

406
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,510
What treasure is this?

407
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,930
I'm not allowed to look at it?

408
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,090
A bangle.

409
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,530
This Green Phoenix Bangle is the Xiao family's heirloom.

410
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
It forms a pair with the Jade Flower Carvings

411
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,300
on my Pojun Sword.

412
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,570
So it's for your future wife.

413
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,290
What?

414
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,440
You have a crush?

415
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,280
I hit it on something just now.

416
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,170
I was afraid it might be damaged.

417
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,780
Luckily, it's fine.

418
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,230
Ms. Qiao.

419
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,250
It seems that you value this jade bangle very much.

420
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,930
Let's get out of here.

421
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,680
Be careful.

422
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,670
Xiangyi is gone.

423
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,490
The Sigu Sect has suffered great losses.

424
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,940
Why don't we dissolve the Sigu Sect today?

425
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,550
You want to dissolve Sigu Sect?

426
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,090
The two leaders are gone.

427
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,430
Our morale is gone too.

428
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,300
Why should we force ourselves to carry on?

429
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Hang in there.

430
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,260
What's wrong?

431
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,900
I feel like Xiangyi came back.

432
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,540
I regret it.

433
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,700
I shouldn't have written that letter to him.

434
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,500
You wrote to him a month ago?

435
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,480
He's a proud person.

436
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,370
But I said I would leave him.

437
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,110
But I was too tired.

438
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,780
I was so tired of chasing him.

439
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,110
[To Minister Yi]

440
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,530
I have enjoyed your love, protection,

441
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,930
and company for the past few years.

442
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,940
I will remember this forever.

443
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,900
I know you are generous.

444
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,020
It causes me admiration, pride,

445
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
but also fear.

446
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
You love the hubbub of the martial arts world.

447
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,370
You strive towards the pinnacle of the martial world.

448
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,780
I can only follow closely behind you,

449
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,450
exhausted.

450
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,620
You are as bright as the sun,

451
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,650
and as dazzling.

452
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,980
However,

453
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,860
who can look into the sun forever?

454
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,780
I'm tired.

455
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,440
I respect you,

456
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,500
but am unable to accompany you any further.

457
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,700
I can't love you like I used to.

458
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,780
I'll say goodbye to you with this letter.

459
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,020
May you

460
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
live healthy,

461
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,350
carefree,

462
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,300
and fulfill your life's wish.

463
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,000
Yours, Wan.

464
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,970
Li Xiangyi.

465
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,900
You only think that everyone relies on you and respects you.

466
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,380
But you don't know

467
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,300
you've become a burden to others.

468
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,380
I'm sorry, Wan.

469
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:10,890
Ms. Qiao.

470
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,470
I think the intersection between Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court

471
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,460
is too far away.

472
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,860
Let's hurry up.

473
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,380
Okay.

474
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,310
Watch the steps.

475
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,740
Ms. Qiao,

476
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,200
I heard from Mr. Xiao that you have asthma.

477
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,030
Why don't you sit down and rest?

478
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,850
Okay.

479
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,690
Slowly.

480
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,430
Wan.

481
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,420
How are you?

482
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,760
Xiangyi.

483
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,060
Xiangyi, you're here.

484
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,080
Are you willing to talk to me today?

485
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,260
You're still unwilling?

486
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
I know

487
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,880
you hate me.

488
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,300
Ms. Qiao,

489
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,560
don't think too much.

490
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
Let me send you home first.

491
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,460
No, I don't want to go.

492
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,360
I don't want to go back.

493
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,220
Xiangyi.

494
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,310
Don't go!

495
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,740
Xiangyi.

496
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,060
Do you remember this place?

497
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,220
At that time,

498
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,310
you didn’t say anything

499
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,730
and went to duel with that master.

500
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,030
I was worried and angry.

501
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,410
I told you not to show up in front of me again.

502
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,180
So I dug this tunnel to see you.

503
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,030
At that time, I wanted to make you happy.

504
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,810
But you always resented me for not understanding you.

505
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,010
And I

506
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,700
only had Sigu Sect on my mind.

507
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,740
I neglected your feelings.

508
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,090
You...

509
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,720
Why did you realize this so late?

510
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
It's too late, Xiangyi.

511
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,560
I can't find you.

512
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,840
I can't find you.

513
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,900
I can't wait for you either.

514
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,370
What should I do?

515
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,740
What should I do?

516
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,410
Wan.

517
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,680
Forget it.

518
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,140
Live the happy life you deserve.

519
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,150
Zijin always tells me the same thing.

520
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
But if I wait for you,

521
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,340
there'll be one more person in this world that believes you're still alive.

522
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,060
Maybe...

523
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,900
Maybe then you can come back alive.

524
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,530
I've let you down.

525
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,250
I... I've also let down Zijin's genuine feelings.

526
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,530
I've let him down.

527
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,220
Did you find anything?

528
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,700
I've searched everywhere.

529
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,600
There's nothing.

530
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,060
Mian must have been caught by that scoundrel.

531
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,160
He might have gone down the mountain.

532
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,530
I'll go down the mountain now.

533
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,900
Inform the people of Baichuan Court

534
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,650
to go after them too.

535
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,150
OK.

536
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,150
Fei?

537
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,930
Why are you here?

538
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,370
Let me ask you.

539
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,630
Did you see Ms. Qiao?

540
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,740
What does it have to do with me?

541
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,220
Wait.

542
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,780
Ms. Qiao has nothing to do with you.

543
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,240
Did you see Li Lianhua?

544
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,140
He said he was looking for someone, but he's gone too.

545
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,230
Did something happen?

546
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,580
You two are old friends.

547
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,210
You should care about where he went.

548
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,940
He told you we're old friends?

549
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,930
Interesting.

550
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,970
Make yourself clear!

551
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,270
Weird.

552
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,860
Xiangyi.

553
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,030
Xiangyi.

554
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,670
Xiangyi.

555
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,470
Ms. Qiao.

556
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,120
Ms. Qiao.

557
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,970
Are you okay?

558
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,219
You were crying and talking in your sleep

559
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,090
when you had an attack.

560
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,080
I have

561
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,150
some medicine on me.

562
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,989
It can relieve your pain.

563
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,659
This sachet...

564
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,070
Why do you have it?

565
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,780
You...

566
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,530
I accidentally found this sachet on the beach

567
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,710
when I was practising medicine at the East Sea.

568
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,960
Do you recognize this?

569
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,100
Is this the only sachet you found?

570
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,920
Many people were dead in the sea.

571
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,820
This sachet

572
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,020
was found

573
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,710
on one of the corpses.

574
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,780
What's wrong, Ms. Qiao?

575
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,330
What did he look like?

576
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,560
What did the person you saw look like?

577
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,530
I remember it very clearly.

578
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,540
But I remember

579
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,260
he was around 20 years old.

580
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,850
I couldn't see his face clearly.

581
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,770
There seemed to be a string of Buddha beads on his left wrist.

582
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,490
I got those for him.

583
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,140
It turns out he's your friend.

584
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,550
At that time,

585
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,990
I had to turn back and ask for help.

586
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,820
To my surprise,

587
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,100
when I came back,

588
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,480
he had already been carried away by the waves.

589
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,910
Now that I think about it,

590
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,060
I'm regretful.

591
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,180
Stop it.

592
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,130
When did you

593
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,340
find him?

594
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
Come to think of it,

595
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,790
it's been about ten years.

596
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,560
I'm sorry, Mian.

597
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
I always hurt you.

598
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,100
I can't make it up to you.

599
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,840
Zijin loves you wholeheartedly.

600
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,860
I can see that you also love him.

601
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,020
Don't make it hard for yourself.

602
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,120
You must be happy in the future.

603
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,520
Ms. Qiao.

604
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,670
Let me send you back first.

605
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,190
Stop!

606
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,690
Don't touch her!

607
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,770
What does Mr. Xiao want?

608
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,620
He's trying to harm Mian.

609
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,400
He deserves it.

610
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,100
If anything happens to Mian,

611
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,360
I'll kill him.

612
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,900
You're hurting people without getting the facts straight.

613
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,440
You're from Sigu Sect?

614
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,420
Sigu Sect was dissolved ten years ago.

615
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,020
What are you talking about?

616
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,020
I want to take this scoundrel with me.

617
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,030
Mr. Xiao, you're too domineering.

618
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,820
Baichuan Court gives Tianji Hall

619
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,570
leeway.

620
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,030
If you dare to bully my friend,

621
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
don't blame me for turning nasty.

622
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,940
Mr. Xiao, don't get me wrong.

623
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,350
I just ran into Ms. Qiao

624
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,170
when she was kidnapped in the tunnel,

625
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,230
so I followed her in.

626
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,120
How dare you make up stories about saving a damsel in distress?

627
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,620
How dare you!

628
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,140
Zijin, stop!

629
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,740
I won't argue with you.

630
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,400
I'll take her back.

631
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,260
Come here.

632
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,710
What's wrong with Xiao Zijin?

633
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,230
The young master of Tianji Hall is really powerful.

634
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,120
But now that you've gotten on a master's bad side,

635
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,750
how can you enter Baichuan Court?

636
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,980
I just can't stand him relying on his position

637
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,100
to bully others.

638
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,290
I don't care.

639
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,170
How are you?

640
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,970
I'm fine.

641
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,750
Brother.

642
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,990
How is Ms. Qiao?

643
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,310
She had an asthma attack.

644
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,250
Luckily, she took Physician Li's medicine.

645
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,580
She's fine now.

646
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,100
Didn't Ms. Qiao say anything else?

647
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,190
Why did Physician Li rush to save her?

648
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,620
Didn't she think

649
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,810
Physician Li seemed familiar?

650
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,920
Biqiu.

651
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,770
What do you want to ask?

652
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,450
Don't you think

653
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,090
Li Lianhua looks a little like

654
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,840
Sect Leader?

655
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,640
To heal someone from Bicha Poison,

656
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,520
besides taking the unique antidote in time,

657
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,110
the other way is Wuliao's Brahman golden needles.

658
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,240
Over the years,

659
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,570
there have been many swindlers pretending to be Sect Leader.

660
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,980
If Wuliao healed him

661
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,860
through the Brahman arts,

662
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,490
why didn't he tell us?

663
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,680
Yes, Biqiul.

664
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,680
I think

665
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,060
his age, physique, and martial arts skills

666
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,050
don't match Sect Leader's.

667
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,030
They only have similar eyes and eyebrows.

668
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,610
But on closer look, they don't look alike.

669
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,790
Brother, I think

670
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,280
I should sound him out again.

671
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,720
It's all because of me

672
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,240
that Sect Leader...

673
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,020
Yun Biqiu, how dare you bring it up?

674
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,630
Bicha poison is so vicious.

675
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,170
It not only disperses people's martial power,

676
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
but also cause brain problems and drive them to death by madness.

677
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,870
You know that,

678
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,290
but you still poisoned Sect Leader.

679
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,480
You deserve to die hundreds of times for what you did.

680
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,360
All right.

681
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,000
Let bygones be bygones.

682
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,990
Only the four of us know about

683
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,490
Sect Leader being poisoned by Bicha Poison.

684
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,780
Don't spread it.

685
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,160
He didn't mean to hurt Sect Leader.

686
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,640
He was just bewitched by that demoness.

687
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,260
Every time he has seen someone who looks like Sect Leader

688
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,560
over the past few years,

689
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,090
he would check him out.

690
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,900
I will never forgive

691
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,980
what he did back then.

692
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,530
This...

693
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,730
[General Temple]

694
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,980
Physician Li.

695
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,690
It's the Masters.

696
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,320
Don't get up, you're infirm.

697
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,910
I'm embarrassed.

698
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,940
Thanks to Physician Li,

699
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,540
we were able to find Shaoshi yesterday.

700
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,770
I brought it here today

701
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,620
so you can take a look for yourself.

702
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,730
Please go ahead.

703
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,950
You are really good at joking.

704
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,170
I don't deserve this sword.

705
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,420
You're exaggerating.

706
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,580
Try it.

707
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,530
It's okay.

708
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,950
I'll give it a try.

709
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,940
I'm embarrassed.

710
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,630
I can't pull out this sword.

711
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,490
I think it's a great honor

712
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,810
just to be able to touch the sword.

713
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,340
Please keep it safely.

714
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,750
It's very heavy.

715
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,970
We were inconsiderate.

716
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,050
Physician Li is infirm.

717
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,170
You can't wield this sword.

718
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:02,880
Good sword.

719
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,470
Physician Li,

720
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,900
I have a small question.

721
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,560
Why don't you show your face?
