Since you're so smart,

You haven't been officially admitted to the Baichuan Court, right?

If you had,

17

29

It must be because you've run out of money, right?

The fact that you pawned some of your jade pendants

31

shows that your parents don't support you in becoming a detective.

hurts these kids again?

189
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,460
Let me explain.

190
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,580
The date of the test was set

191
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,490
by Leader Wang before he died.

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,450
The Lingshan Sect needs a new leader.

193
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,220
No.

194
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Easy, everyone.

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,910
I have an idea

196
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,030
but don't know whether I should say it.

197
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,580
You're arguing

198
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,950
because Leader Wang

199
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,100
didn't specify how to identify the Spiritual Child.

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,400
That's the source of the problem.

201
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,410
How about

202
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,860
I talk to Leader Wang

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,280
to find out what he thought?

204
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,420
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,060
Our master has passed away.

206
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,700
How can you talk to the dead?

207
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,980
Wei Bai.

208
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,340
Who are you?

209
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm Li Lianhua.

210
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,810
Many people call me the miracle physician.

211
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,400
So you're the physician

212
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,700
who resurrected Master Tiexiao.

213
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,550
Yes, it's me.

214
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,460
I've heard a lot about you.

215
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,010
It's such a great honor

216
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,110
to meet you here.

217
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,220
What are you up to this time?

218
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,310
Look.

219
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,700
This is not a simple case.

220
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,770
If I find out who's behind it,

221
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
can you let me go?

222
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,620
No.

223
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,700
You're a detective from the Baichuan Court.

224
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,370
Do you have no conscience at all?

225
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,550
Look at them.

226
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,220
Look at these innocent boys.

227
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,770
Look how much they've suffered.

228
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,190
Can you bear to let them suffer even more?

229
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,980
Besides,

230
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
catching a murderer

231
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,240
can bring you more recognition than catching a quack.

232
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,420
Leader Wang

233
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,620
is six feet under now,

234
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
but I know how to summon ghosts.

235
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,180
If you trust me,

236
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,190
can you let me give it a try?

237
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,100
How can we know if you're just playing tricks

238
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,820
and pretending to be our master?

239
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,220
Don't be rude to the miracle physician.

240
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,410
We trust you.

241
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,220
Let's do it your way, Physician Li.

242
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,730
Well,

243
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,100
please send Leader Wang's body back to his room.

244
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,220
I also need some of his belongings

245
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,580
to summon his ghost.

246
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,770
Sir,

247
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,340
this is where our master lived.

248
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,510
[Qinglan Residence]

249
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,460
Tell me.

250
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,290
What tricks did you play

251
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,540
to resurrect Master Tiexiao

252
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,340
and the heir to the Tiejia Sect?

253
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,340
Master Tiexiao was cornered by his enemy

254
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,540
and jumped off the cliff.

255
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,300
Everyone thought he was dead

256
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
and buried him.

257
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,860
I happened to pass by

258
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,360
and heard his voice.

259
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,860
So I dug him out.

260
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,950
As for Shi Wenjue,

261
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,420
he was determined

262
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,690
to start a career in public service

263
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,420
but his family didn't support him.

264
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,820
His story is even more interesting.

265
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,120
He faked his suicide

266
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,100
but

267
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,890
I could tell

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
that he was acting.

269
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,180
I didn't expose him.

270
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,940
These two guys

271
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,300
naturally won't reveal the truth.

272
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,340
That's what happened.

273
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,430
Word travels fast.

274
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,320
Now I'm famous.

275
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,420
As I expected,

276
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,810
you earned your reputation

277
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,910
through hanky-panky.

278
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm just more observant than most people.

279
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,770
To make my own way in the world,

280
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,100
I have to have some strengths.

281
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,940
Strengths?

282
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
You call that a strength?

283
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,050
You're just lucky.

284
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
You have to admit it.

285
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,930
Good luck is a kind of strength too.

286
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm indeed lucky.

287
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,580
Let me make it clear.

288
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,700
After I help you,

289
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,940
we'll be even.

290
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,390
It depends on how much your help is worth.

291
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
You said you're observant.

292
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
Then let's see

293
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,490
who can find out the cause of his death first.

294
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,360
[Humble and Disciplined]

295
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

296
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,560
Not only do I know how he died,

297
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,260
but I also know that the murderer

298
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
is among his steward and three disciples.

299
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,070
Why…

300
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,740
Look.

301
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,550
Does that hand gesture

302
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,430
look familiar to you?

303
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,620
Breath Stopping Skill.

304
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,860
No need to check.

305
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,980
That skill could only stop his breath for three days at most.

306
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Three days later,

307
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
he needed someone to hit his acupoints

308
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,580
Baihui and Tanzhong three times to come back to life.

309
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,250
It's been over ten days.

310
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,700
He's long dead.

311
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,060
Wang Qingshan used Breath Stopping Skill to fake his death

312
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,340
and needed someone he trusted to wake him up.

313
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
But that guy didn't do it.

314
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,370
So he was suffocated.

315
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,040
No wonder you said

316
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,180
the murderer is among those four guys.

317
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,770
He needed the help of someone very close

318
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,060
to practice this secret skill.

319
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,620
Those four guys

320
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,700
were the closest to Wang Qingshan

321
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,340
in the Lingshan Sect.

322
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,820
You figured it out right away

323
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,770
because you used the same trick before.

324
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,330
I haven't finished my words.

325
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,650
Haven't you noticed that the gold leaf on his lips is very thick?

326
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,570
He was injured before he died.

327
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,270
So the murderer used thick gold leaf

328
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
to cover the blood.

329
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,910
Go scrape off the gold leaf on his back.

330
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,500
You…

331
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,450
I'll do you a favor.

332
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,900
Is it Five Poison Palm?

333
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,470
You know it?

334
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,620
Xin Lei, the Thunder Chaser of the Jinyuan Alliance,

335
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,820
is famous for his Five Poison Palm.

336
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,700
Ten years ago, the Jinyuan Alliance was wiped out.

337
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,350
Most of its disciples were arrested by the Baichuan Court,

338
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,530
but some escaped.

339
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,190
Xin Lei is one of those who escaped.

340
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,570
I didn't expect that

341
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,580
he'd been holed up here all these years.

342
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,670
Let's go

343
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,540
check the place where Leader Wang died.

344
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,420
Maybe

345
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,970
we can find other clues.

346
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,340
It's all for the case.

347
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,180
The Tianji Hall is good at making intricate devices.

348
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,340
I bet you know a lot about them.

349
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,700
Let me ask you a question.

350
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,820
How did he manage to fool everyone?

351
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,180
[Tengyun Tower]

352
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,089
There is a secret chamber here.

353
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,780
I knew it.

354
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,740
That day, the Thunder Chaser

355
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,530
hid a golden statue under the slate beforehand.

356
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,330
After Wang Qingshan

357
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,580
fooled everyone with his fake death,

358
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,700
he sank Wang Qingshan into the chamber

359
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,140
and replaced his body with a fake statue.

360
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,450
I need to remind you

361
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,070
that there were many people here that day.

362
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,460
No matter how fast he was,

363
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,730
he couldn't make it with hundreds of people watching.

364
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,780
Everyone saw

365
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,020
Leader Wang die and turn into a full-body sarira.

366
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,050
Bronze mirror.

367
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,120
Golden powder.

368
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,130
I see.

369
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,900
Good.

370
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,050
You deserve to be a detective of the Baichuan Court.

371
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,460
But there's one thing I don't understand.

372
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,540
Why did Wang Qingshan

373
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,100
fake his death?

374
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,050

What's wrong with it?

378
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,860
How old were you when you learned it?

379
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm smart

380
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,300
so I learned it by heart when I was three.

381
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,340
Most kids learned it at five or six.

382
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,550
Yeah.

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,900
Wang Qingshan was over 50 years old.

384
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,980
Why did he have The Three Character Classic?

385
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,950
Unless…

386
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,340
Unless he had a child.

387
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,000
The Spiritual Child he wanted

388
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,940
is not 16,

389
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,720
but six.

390
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Now it all makes sense.

The Lingshan Sect bans its disciples from getting married and having children.

392
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
If he wanted to leave the assets to his six-year-old illegitimate son

393
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,780
instead of his disciples,

394
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,110
this was the only option he had.

395
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,940
Maybe it was an idea

396
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,770
from the Thunder Chaser.

397
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
He wanted to use this chance…

398
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,900

Where are we going now?

402
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,800
To have a talk with Leader Wang.

403
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,280
Do you expect that dead man to answer your questions?

As an illegitimate son,

408
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,330
he can't have his father's surname,

409
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,610
so he has to use his mother's surname.

410
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,540
So?

411
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,610
So,

412
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,680
I have a plan.

413
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,570
I wonder how long it will take

the Young Master of the Tianji Hall to make a device

415
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,510

416
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,210

they had an illegitimate son.

so he decided to put on a show.

to conceal the print left by your Five Poison Palm.

562
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,930
There's really a palm print on Leader Wang's back.

563
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,360
You killed our master.

564
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,450
Why do you believe him so easily?

565
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,610
Let me tell you.

566
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,440
It's all just his imagination.

567
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,270
I haven't finished yet.

568
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,400
Wang Shouqing.

569
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,350
Can I borrow the letter

570
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
Leader Wang left?

571
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,320
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

572
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
Leader Wang

573
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,460
intended to

574
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,110
leave the Lingshan Sect to his six-year-old illegitimate son.

575
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,860
So the suffix "teen"

576
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,660
is in a different handwriting.

577
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,170
Moreover, part of this letter was cut out.

578
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,420
I guess

579
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,040
the missing part contains the most important information

580
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,620
that the kid's mother's surname is Helan.

581
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,740
You deliberately leaked the news to Happy's cousin

582
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,560
and caused a mysterious fire in the ancestral hall

583
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,250
because you didn't want

584
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,490
these three disciples to get suspicious.

585
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,620
You've never thought of Happy in the past decade

586
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,220
but after killing someone,

587
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,480
you suddenly remembered the son you abandoned.

588
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,260
What a good father you are.

589
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,580
You just want to use him as a puppet

590
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,970
to control the Lingshan Sect.

591
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,090
Father.

592
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,490
Did you do it?

593
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,600
You're a good storyteller.

594
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,230
But unfortunately…

595
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,770
Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence, right?

596
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,630
After seeing the surname Helan last night,

597
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,210
you were worried that your cover might be blown.

598
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,720
So you went to her house in the middle of the night

599
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,040
to kill the mother and son.

600
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,980
But we had smeared Baihong juice

601
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
on their quilt.

602
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,210
If you wash your hands, they'll turn black.

603
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,980
Show us your hands.

604
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,420
Avenge our master!

605
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,160
You talk too much.

606
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
Go to hell!

607
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,360
Fang Duobing.

608
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,190
Please keep him under control.

609
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,380
I'll send out a letter immediately

610
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,100
and have him brought back to the Baichuan Court.

611
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,420
Wait.

612
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,060
Do you have anything else to say to Happy?

613
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,060
I got nothing to say

614
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,200
to a good-for-nothing.

615
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,930
-You trash!
-Move.

616
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,670
Happy.

617
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,670
Young Master.

618
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,640
Don't be sad.

619
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,160
After you grow up,

620
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,010
I'll give you money and land.

621
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,890
It's fine.

622
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,820
You're welcome.

623
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,980
What do you mean?

624
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,440
This is the first case I solved for you.

625
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,940
I know you're grateful to me.

626
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm grateful to you?

627
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,240
Don't you remember shouting my name just now?

628
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,820
I saved your life.

629
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,190
Lower your voice.

630
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,170
After we leave here,

631
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,170
we'll go our separate ways.

632
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,620
So who saved who is not important.

633
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,210
Why are you…

634
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,850
By the way,

635
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,390
I left something in Leader Wang's room.

636
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,380
I'll go get it.

637
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,310
So rude.

638
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,500
Young Hero Fang.

639
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,120
We want to ask you for a favor.

640
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,310
I heard that Prison 188 of the Baichuan Court

641
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,830
is like hell.

642
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,600
What are you doing here?

643
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,570
I'm here to give you a chance.

644
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,940
If you tell me one thing,

645
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,200
I'll let you go.

646
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,250
You captured me and then offer to release me.

647
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,250
What do you want?

648
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,120
I didn't want to capture you.

649
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,770
The guy named Fang Duobing wanted.

650
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,460
I don't care

651
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,969
whether you live or die.

652
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,460
Go ahead.

653
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,679
What do you want to know?

654
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,199
Ten years ago,

655
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,090
the Third Director of the Jinyuan Alliance

656
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,949
killed Shan Gudao of the Sigu Sect

657
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,260
and took away his remains.

658
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,780
Where are his remains now?

659
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,570
You used to work for Medicine Demon.

660
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,179
You should know that.

661
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,310
How did you know

662
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,840
I used to work for Medicine Demon?

663
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,290
Who are you?

664
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,850
You don't need to know that.

665
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,699
Just answer my question.

666
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,580
There are three holes in your earlobe.

667
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,050
When I tested poisons on people for Medicine Demon,

668
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,720
I saw the same mark

669
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,270
on their ears.

670
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,010
It's a mark left by Bicha Poison.

671
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,540
That poison is lethal

672
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,570
and has no cure.

673
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,190
The victims' bones and joints will rot in one month

674
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,100
and their fresh will peel off until they die.

675
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,460
Most victims will die within a month

676
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,780
unless they can force the poison out with strong inner force.

677
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,810
You're standing in front of me now.

678
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,540
The only explanation

679
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,340
is that you're him.

680
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
It's been ten years.

681
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,300
You're still alive.

682
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,380
I don't have time to waste on you.

683
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,510
People from the Baichuan Court should be on their way.

684
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,690
You've become a coward.

685
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,420
You don't even dare to say who you are.

686
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,660
I got it.

687
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,040
It's not that you don't know martial arts.

688
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,900
You lost all of your skills.

689
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,820
Li Xiangyi.

690
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,320
I guessed right.

691
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,790
You were once the invincible Master of Sword

692
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,750
but ended up like this.

693
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,020
You challenged the Jinyuan Alliance for your senior back then

694
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,170
but now,

695
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,270
you're searching for his remains.

696
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,630
Everyone says you're heartless,

697
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,270
but they're wrong.

698
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,780
At least you care about your senior very much.

699
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,720
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

700
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,220
I don't know where his remains are.

701
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,970
You're dead.

702
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
I'll kill you for the Director!

703
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,000
Li Lianhua!

704
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,500
Are you okay?

705
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,030
I'm fine.

706
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,290
Luckily, you appeared in time.

707
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,530
How dare you strangle me?

708
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
I was too quick.

709
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,880
We haven't gotten anything out of him yet.

710
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,420
He died too soon.

711
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,460
Yes.

712
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,730
Thank you.

713
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,790
Li Lianhua.

714
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,310
You said you needed to fetch something.

715
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,310
Why are you here?

716
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,210
I took the wrong turn.

717
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,780
Why are you here?

718
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,380
The three disciples of the Lingshan Sect

719
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,250
are grateful to us

720
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,460
and invited us to dinner.

721
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,940
So I came to tell you about it.

722
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,320
Man,

723
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,660
I saved you again.

724
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,280
Thanks.

725
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,910
Aren't you going?

726
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,710
No.

727
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,630
Fox Spirit is waiting for me at home.

728
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,030
Fox spirit?

729
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,050
A little bit of salt.

730
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,310
A little bit.

731
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,100
A-A little bit.

732
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,480
You must be hungry, Fox Spirit.

733
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,610
Sit down.

734
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,710
Go ahead.

735
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,380
So you're Fox Spirit.

736
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,040
So cute.

737
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,690
So you're not only a quack

738
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,410
but also a bad cook.

739
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,720
So this is the Lotus Tower.

740
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,710
What is this?

741
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,730
You grow vegetables here?

742
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,540
If I remember correctly,

743
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,060
we're even now.

744
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,090
Even if we are,

745
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,250
there are questions I need to ask you.

746
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Why did you steal the manual of sword fighting from the Hall of Flames?

747
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,910
That manual

748
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,360
belonged to the Shi family in Henan in the beginning.

749
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,220
Several years ago, it was taken away by the Hall of Flames.

750
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,270
So I paid Master Thief a lot of money to get it back.

751
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,150
Why did you do that?

752
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,140
He helped me once.

753
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,510
Years ago,

754
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,230
I had heart disease.

755
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,340
He came to steal things from me

756
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,880
and gave me some medicine.

757
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,720
I had to pay him back.

758
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,060
I didn't expect you to be a grateful man.

759
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm not.

760
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,770
I didn't want to pay him back.

761
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,940
But that guy

762
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,660
told the Hall of Flames about my whereabouts.

763
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,790
I had no choice.

764
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,500
Why are you still here?

765
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,640
Do you expect to have dinner with me?

766
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,320
I saved you twice today.

767
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
I brought wine with me.

768
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,630
Can't you let me stay for dinner?

769
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,100
I'll help myself.

770
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,770
Let me try it.

771
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,610
The beef is great.

772
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,250
Why did you ruin it

773
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,130
with so much pepper?

774
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,250
Also,

775
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
look at this artemisia selengensis.

776
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,040
It looks so plain.

777
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,490
The next time you cook,

778
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,610
add some bacon to it.

779
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,610
The fragrance of bacon goes perfectly with its refreshing taste.

780
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,500
It'll be very delicious.

781
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,100
Well,

782
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,110
look at the chicken stewed with chestnuts.

783
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,140
It must taste gamy.

784
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,900
The next time you make it,

785
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,040
try using broth to get rid of the gamy taste.

786
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:43,580
Really?

787
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,310
Yes.

788
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,880
If you like cooking,

789
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,920
I can teach you.

790
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm an expert.

791
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,960
I won't bother you.

792
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,820
Bro,

793
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,770
do you have to be so cold?

794
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,390
You're the first friend I made

795
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,730
after leaving home.

796
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,970
To tell you the truth,

797
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,230
I ran away from home to escape an arranged marriage.

798
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,750
My father wanted me to marry the princess,

799
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,070
but I'm not interested in politics at all.

800
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,160
Compared to the court,

801
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,640
I prefer the wide world outside.

802
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,720
What does that have to do with me?

803
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,040
I have to solve three cases

804
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,120
to be admitted to the Baichuan Court.

805
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,330
Look at us.

806
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,180
We finally

807
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,980
solved the case of the Spiritual Child,

808
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,950
but I promised to keep it quiet.

809
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,850
Lucky for you.

810
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,460
You saved your reputation as the miracle physician

811
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,100
and the Lingshan Sect saved its dignity.

812
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,990
What about me?

813
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,230
I still need to solve three cases.

814
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,310
How about this?

815
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,000
You're sly and I'm good at martial arts.

816
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,410
Why don't we work together

817
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,380
to solve more cases?

818
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,290
I can pay you a salary.

819
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,100
What do you think?

820
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:44,810
Salary?

821
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,690
Do you have money?

822
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,150
I…

823
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,380
You're so poor that you came to me for a free meal.

824
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,780
Besides,

825
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm not interested in being a hero.

826
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,920
I prefer solitude to venturing into the perilous world.

827
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,940
I just want to

828
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,320
travel around the world.

829
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,430
Living on the edge

830
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,180
is not suitable for me.

831
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,790
You…

832
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,940
Give it a thought.

833
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,530
If I can't enter the Baichuan Court,

834
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,980
my master will be disappointed in me.

835
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,200
Get your hands off me.

836
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,990
Master.

837
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,710
You started the Sigu Sect and the Baichuan Court single-handedly.

838
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,500
I swear to make them thrive!

839
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,640
Wait.

840
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,300
Who is your master?

841
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,250
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

842
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,430
I'm fine.

843
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,180
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

844
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,090
I never knew

845
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,270
that Li Xiangyi had a disciple like you.

846
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,750
No one knows about it.

847
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,420
I bet.

848
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,900
I guess he doesn't know it either.

849
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,700
You don't believe me?

850
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,710
Then I'll tell you the truth.

851
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,190
I was weak when I was young.

852
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,360
My mother didn't even give me a serious name

853
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,260
because she thought I wouldn't make it to adulthood.

854
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,980
When I was ten,

855
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,120
my mother found

856
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,380
her younger brother who went missing at a young age.

857
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,150
He's the deputy leader of the Sigu Sect,

858
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,060
Li Xiangyi's senior,

859
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,680
Shan Gudao.

860
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,840
Shan Gudao is your uncle?
