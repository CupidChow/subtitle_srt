[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,930
[Episode 32]

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,910
It turned out that Consort Xuan had always wanted to revive Nanyin

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,720
and had established such a strong foundation.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,860
But the Magician, Feng Ah Lu

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,890
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

8
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,960
The wealth of reviving Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

9
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,330
were all divided by the four of Jin, Yu, Huang and Quan.

10
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,170
Maybe something unexpected happened at that time.

11
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,340
But now,

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Consort Xuan's descendant

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,830
must have been found by the Nanyin people.

14
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,490
Otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,810
You mean

16
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,960
my father is Consort Xuan's son,

17
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,900
the descendant of the royal family of Nanyin?

18
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,410
There are other letters in this box.

19
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,940
Open it and take a look.

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,000
You're right.

21
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,550
The Magician, Feng Ah Lu,

22
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,010
and his whole family were very loyal.

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,530
Back then, they couldn't find Consort Xuan's son,

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,920
but still searched for him everywhere.

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,420
Even though the Magician, Feng Ah Lu went missing,

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,820
his descendant didn't stop searching.

27
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
So in the end,

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,050
with Consort Xuan's old possessions and the birthmark,

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
they verified that Senior

30
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,820
was the descendant of Prince Fangji and Consort Xuan.

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,010
And Feng Qing from the Wansheng Clan

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,460
was the descendant of Feng Ah Lu.

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,280
Obviously my father did not object,

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,340
but conspired with the Wansheng Clan

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,690
to plan all this.

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,920
Senior,

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,080
you did hide too well.

38
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,800
No matter how ambitious he was,

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,140
he didn't expect

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,520
to die a long time ago.

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,960
All his plans have come to nothing.

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,150
Maybe he already figured it out.

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,590
Fang Duobing.

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,329
I want to open the coffin for an autopsy.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,490
What happened?

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
How did it become a skeleton?

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
Did the medicine not work in the coffin?

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,270
When I found the body,

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,980
I also examined the remains.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Senior was also wearing this armor,

51
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,100
and the little finger on his right hand was broken in half.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,870
Being in a state of confusion, I didn't have time to distinguish.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,110
The armor is fake.

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,210
In order to cover it up,

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,740
even half of the little finger

56
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,579
is exactly the same.

57
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,170
But when Senior broke the formation,

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,790
he did lose half of his little finger to the arrows.

59
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,660
But this little finger was cut off flat.

60
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,340
Isn't this my father's corpse?

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,850
This is another person.

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,980
But back then,

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,890
he was cut off and skinned,

64
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,100
and was transformed into Senior.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,240
This magic is extremely cruel

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,540
because he has the Wuxin Huai on him,

67
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,820
which was used to relieve his pain.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,260
So Shan Gudao didn't die.

69
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,550
After he found out his identity,

70
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,620
he wanted to revive Nanyin

71
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,200
and dominate the world.

72
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,830
He wanted to cooperate with the imperial court

73
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,060
and then fight against the Sigu Sect.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,090
But he never thought that

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,290
you would firmly oppose getting involved with the imperial court.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
His pursuit of the descendant of Nanyin

77
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,860
was discovered by Liu Rujing.

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,040
As a result, he had no choice

79
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,640
but to escape with a fake death.

80
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,380
He even knew that

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,290
you'd avenge him.

82
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,010
So he colluded with Jiao Liqiao

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,980
and used her obsession with Di Feisheng.

84
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,400
With just the Bicha Poison

85
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,340
and thundering fire bombs,

86
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,970
he managed to overthrow the two major sects in the martial arts world.

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,620
But he hid in the dark

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,960
and took advantage of that,

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
making the Wansheng Clan grow rapidly.

90
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,000
He never gave up his conspiracies.

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,890
Since the Sigu Sect couldn't be used by him,

92
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,620
he just destroyed it and built another one.

93
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,930
Senior,

94
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,260
I've never seen through you.

[Guest House]

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,840
You used the hidden weapon very fast.

97
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,710
Unfortunately, I have armor protection.

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,130
Shan Gudao.

99
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140

[Shan Gudao]

101
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,010
You dug the grave,

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,940
and you made a good analysis.

103
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,930
I don't need to hide anymore.

104
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,300
It's just like what I dreamed of.

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,180
You're already a handsome young man,

106
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,070
and you look a bit like me back then.

107
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,200
Today, we reunited as father and son.

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,460
We should drink for that.

109
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,040
Father and son?

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,190
When you betrayed my biological mother,

111
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,570
when you saw that I was a sickly child

112
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,710
and abandoned me,

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,080
and when you lied that you were my uncle,

114
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,840
did you ever think of our relationship as father and son?

115
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,650
You pretended to be dead for so many years,

116
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,190
but now you claim that you're my father.

117
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,240
What are you up to?

118
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,840
As a man,

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,820
you should aspire to achieve a great cause.

120
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,580
If you always think about those trivial matters,

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
what can you achieve?

122
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,140
Is that all

123
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,020
the Tianji Mountain Manor has taught you over the years?

124
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,980
The Tianji Mountain Manor taught me to be honest

125
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,380
and upright,

126
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,320
instead of betraying masters and friends

127
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,659
and doing evil deeds.

128
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,070
When you and Li Xiangyi

129
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,290
established the Sigu Sect,

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,450
you said you wanted to build a fair martial arts world.

131
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,020
What is your great cause then?

132
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,540
Hiding in the dark and fearing to show up openly,

133
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,790
just like what you are now?

134
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,310
The Sigu Sect was once admired by everyone

135
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,330
and flourished for a while,

136
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,490
but it was still destroyed by me.

137
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,750
Li Xiangyi, who was cocky and arrogant,

138
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,250
also lost to me.

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,500
In the first half of my life,

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,570
I was overshadowed by Li Xiangyi who was gifted and prominent.

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,940
Who cared about me?

142
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,140
Who ever looked at me?

143
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,799
But one day,

144
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,640
someone found me and told me

145
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,190
that I am the descendant of 
the royal family of Nanyin

146
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,500
and the current imperial family.

147
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
I realized

148
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,050
the meaning and value

149
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
of my life.

150
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,060
You asked me what I want.

151
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,030
What I want

152
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,710
is what's supposed to be mine.

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
I hid in the dark

154
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,450
to accumulate strength.

155
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,300
And now it's time for me to show up and succeed.

156
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,130
This is destiny.

157
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,650
Do you understand?

158
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,820
The position that everyone admires and no one dares to usurp

159
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,300
belongs to me, Shan Gudao.

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,460
Stop it.

161
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,180
What destiny?

162
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,520
It's just your ambition.

163
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,520
Your crazy obsession

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,580
will only bring harm to this peaceful martial arts world.

165
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,490
You're just as stupid as you were when you were a kid.

166
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,650
You just can't understand it.

167
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,700
Tit for tat.

168
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,480
I should be the one to get it back.

169
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,660
Remember this.

170
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,890
You are my only family in this world.

171
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,420
You're my son.

172
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,850
You are related to me by blood.

173
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,820
Think about it.

174
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,920
When I succeed and rule the world,

175
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,660
I’ll leave everything to you.

176
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,420
Don't you want it?

177
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,680
As long as you come back to me

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,580
and give me your Rama Heavenly Ice,

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,700
we will

180
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,110
find the last one together.

181
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,360
-Then we…
-I don’t have it.

182
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,290
Even though I have it,

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,600
I will never give it to you.

184
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,840
Nanyin has been destroyed for a hundred years.

185
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,440
Now the world is at peace,

186
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,580
which is a blessing for all people.

187
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,370
I won't let you ruin this.

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,970
Just you?

189
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,500
You should be glad that you're my son.

190
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,270
I can't bear to kill you.

191
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,450
Come back with me.

192
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,510
It's still so hard

193
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,460
to defend against your sword.

194
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,620
We haven't seen each other for ten years,

195
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,620
but we're still alive.

196
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,360
Should we find a place

197
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,470
to celebrate?

198
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,330
Celebrate?

199
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,500
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

200
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,220
I've been looking for you for ten years.

201
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,180
I've been looking for you for ten years.

202
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,710
I've been looking for you for ten years.

203
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,410
Ten years?

204
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,410
I can't believe

205
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,610
you've been looking for me for ten years.

206
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,240
My kindness to you when I was young made it all worthwhile.

207
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,610
Li Xiangyi,

208
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,980
is it very sad

209
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,840
to be deceived by someone

210
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
you don't care about

211
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,910
for ten years?

212
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,980
The Wenjing Sword I gave you,

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,800
how's that working out for you?

214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,690
Did you kill

215
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,990
the original owner of the cloud iron?

216
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,070
If I didn't kill him,

217
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,130
how could I give you the sword?

218
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,100
It's all because of you.

219
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,340
He didn't want to work for me,

220
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,820
so I had to kill him.

221
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,910
You almost died,

222
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,100
but you look like a loser now.

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
Why am I so happy to see that?

224
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,460
Ridiculous.

225
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,290
It was just a small setback

226
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,200
for him.

227
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,370
Is that something to brag about?

228
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,580
Shut up.

229
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,580
You are my son.

230
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,590
How can you speak for him?

231
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,980
What's so good about him? Everyone praises him.

232
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,450
No matter how good he is,

233
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,730
he still lost to me.

234
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,060
He didn't even know

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
that I had tricked him for ten years.

236
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,870
Li Xiangyi is just a joke.

237
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,980
Li Xiangyi

238
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,280
is indeed a joke.

239
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,490
If you want to win,

240
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,180
Li Xiangyi

241
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,390
has already lost to you.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,220
Stop it.

243
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,200
You should stop going your own way.

244
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,730
Stop pretending to be righteous

245
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,270
and heroic.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,360
There is no turning back.

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,580
What's the point of winning you alone, Li Xiangyi?

248
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,700
I want everyone in the world

249
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,980
to obey me.

250
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,220
If you think it through,

251
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,700
meet me at the Wansheng Clan.

252
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,460
No need to chase him.

253
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,390
It turns out that everything we speculated before

254
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,180
is true.

255
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,890
I don't even know

256
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,160
when I got this far.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Xiaobao,

258
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,970
if you hadn't been involved,

259
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,580
you wouldn't have known this.

260
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,580
Do you think I'll regret it?

261
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,320
The more clearly I see it,

262
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,180
the more I know which path to take.

263
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,210
I'm glad that I've seen all the facts.

264
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,150
[Guest House]

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,070
This is the news I just received.

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,770
Four-faced Qingzun's wife, Liangyi Fairy

267
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,810
was locked up in the Ninth Prison.

268
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,870
Yesterday Di Feisheng broke into the prison with his men.

269
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,160
Di Feisheng must have teamed up with Shan Gudao

270
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,510
to get the last Rama Heavenly Ice.

271
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,450
I thought Di Feisheng

272
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,800
would turn back and change his mind

273
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,200
after you saved him.

274
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
I didn't expect him to go after the Rama Vessel.

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,990
He shouldn't have been interested in the Rama Vessel.

276
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,160
Maybe

277
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,880
I was wrong about him.

278
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,980
Anyway,

279
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,050
they already have the Rama Vessel

280
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,370
and three pieces of the Rama Heavenly Ice.

281
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,440
They will try to get

282
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,040
the one in our hands.

283
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,500
Young Master.

284
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,630
The Master of the Tianji Mountain Manor sent a letter,

285
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,010
asking you to return to the Manor immediately.

286
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,380
Li Lianhua.

287
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,440
My mother asked me to take you back to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

288
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,840
You said you gave the ice shard to your mother.

289
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,810
Is there something wrong?

290
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,110
You didn't find

291
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,340
the Rama Heavenly Ice in the hands of Four-faced Qingzun?

292
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,700
At that time, Four-faced Qingzun was seriously injured

293
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,840
and died in prison.

294
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,900
He left the Rama Heavenly Ice to his wife,

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
Liangyi Fairy.

296
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,860
I didn't know about it until I broke into the prison.

297
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,890
After Four-faced Qingzun died,

298
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,980
Liangyi Fairy also died of hunger strike.

299
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,750
But strangely,

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:31,660
[Foreworld Forever]

301
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,780
I found the whereabouts of Liangyi Fairy after her death

302
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,200
in the residence of Mr. Pi who guards the prison.

303
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,910
She is still alive?

304
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,900
Where do you think she'd be hiding

305
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,720
with the Rama Heavenly Ice?

306
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,230
Mr. Pi comes from the Tianji Hall.

307
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,730
We're going to the Tianji Mountain Manor anyway.

308
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,120
We are on the way.

309
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,329
Saintess.

310
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,339
You are too slow.

311
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,230
Saintess, what happened?

312
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,540
Is it scary?

313
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,300
Even if I have a few more scars on my face,

314
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,330
he doesn't care.

315
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,010

317
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,390
I spent ten years of my life on him,

318
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,860
but still failed to make him like me.

319
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,420
He doesn't care about my love

320
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
or my hatred.

321
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,760
Even though he's indifferent to me,

322
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,470
I still like him.

323
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,710

she still can't let go of Mr. Li,

but she knows that she has no hope with Mr. Li

she's fallen in love with him after taking care of him for a few days.

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,380
In her heart,

373
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,250
she still cares about Mr. Li.

374
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,400
So

375
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,350
she had to finish the wedding ceremony

376
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,570
and enter the bridal chamber

377
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,450
before dark.

378
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,080
She wants me to convey a message to Mr. Li.

379
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,210
According to my Auntie's personality,

380
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,330
she would say,

381
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,360
"Do you regret it?"

382
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,600
And then she would tell him,

383
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,220
"It's useless to regret it now.

384
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,840
I, He Xiaofeng, have a husband now.

385
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,220
You can go wherever you want."

386
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,900
You really know your Auntie.

387
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,150
You're right about every word.

388
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,340
By the way, Mother,

389
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,980
-when I came back last night...
-That brat's done messing around outside

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,810
and has come back?

391
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,210
Master.

392
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,560
Let me introduce him to you.

393
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,490
This is

394
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,750
Xiaobao's friend, Li Lianhua.

395
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,170
[Fang Zeshi, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue]

396
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,260
Greetings, Lord Fang.

397
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,710
Look at you!

398
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,900
You're frivolous and slovenly.

399
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,210
Have you achieved anything outside?

400
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,490
Today, I...

401
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,570
What are you doing?

402
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,570
Let go!

403
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,390
-Let go of me.
-I'm sorry.

404
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,110
Sorry.

405
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,990
Lord Fang.

406
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,980
I've never called you Father before.

407
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,980
But in my heart,

408
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,530
you're the best father.

409
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,010
Did you get into

410
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,620
some big trouble outside?

411
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,330
You've been acting like a good boy since you came back.

412
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,420
Listen,

413
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,360
don't try to play tricks on me.

414
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,440
Also,

415
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,810
don't try to avoid your marriage with the princess.

416
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,140
Now that your Auntie's wedding is over,

417
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,730
it's your turn next.

418
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,710
The emperor's grace is widely known. You can't avoid it.

419
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,360
Look.

420
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,540
-He's lecturing me again.
-You...

421
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,560
I don't want to marry the princess. How many times have I told you?

422
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,620
What kind of son

423
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,780
talks to his father like this?

424
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,430
You're stubborn and disobedient.

425
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,220
Madam.

426
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,120
Madam.

427
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,320
Discipline your son.

428
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,430
Alright.

429
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,180
We have a guest here.

430
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Don't be too strict.

431
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,520
By the way,

432
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,600
the people from the Ministry of Works

433
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,570
came to congratulate you.

434
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,980
I've invited them to the Western Banquet Hall.

435
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,950
Go and greet them.

436
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,530
I'll leave your mother to discipline you.

437
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,140
By the way, Xiaobao,

438
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,380
Mr. Li,

439
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,780
I have an urgent matter.

440
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,500
Because of Xiaofeng's wedding,

441
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,460
the Tianji Mountain Manor sent out wedding invitations a few days ago.

442
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,220
We've received congratulatory gifts from friends from all sides in the past few days.

443
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,700
I don't know who sent such a gift box.

444
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,270
When I saw that it was the setting of the mechanism brocade box

445
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,570
in our Tianji Hall before,

446
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,020
it caught my attention.

447
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,580
When I opened it,

448
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,940
I found the Rama Heavenly Ice inside,

449
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,300
just like the ice shard

450
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,070
you asked me to keep.

451
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,660
Why is it empty?

452
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,480
How is that possible?

453
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,390
It was in there just now.

454
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,890
Master He.

455
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,100
When did you see that the ice shard

456
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,390
was still in the box before?

457
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,370
About an hour ago.

458
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
After watching the ice shard,

459
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,490
I found that the auspicious time had come,

460
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,260
so I put the ice shard back into the box and locked it up.

461
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,060
Then I sent the bride and groom into the bridal chamber after the ceremony.

462
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,810
In the blink of an eye, it just disappeared.

463
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,110
It seems that the person who took the ice shard had a clear goal

464
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
and came prepared.

465
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,720
There is only one way to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

466
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,380
When we went up the mountain,

467
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,820
we did not find anyone going down.

468
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,370
The person who stole the Ice

469
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,770
should still be in the Manor,

470
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,020
perhaps just among the guests.

471
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,210
Come on.

472
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:22,660
Cheers.

473
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,980
Thank you.

474
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,530
Come on.

475
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,000
Please.

476
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,060
Cheers.

477
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,140
There are so many guests.

478
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,460
It's hard to find out who's suspicious

479
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,460
just by staring at them like this.

480
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,400
Master He.

481
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Have you arranged any performances

482
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,180
for this wedding banquet?

483
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,690
What do you mean?

484
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,580
Since

485
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,030
someone came here for the Ice,

486
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,640
we might as well give him a surprise.

487
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,080
You want to use the Rama Heavenly Ice

488
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,550
I gave my mother before

489
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,680
to lure him out?

490
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,890
You're right.

491
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,900
Not many people know about the Ice.

492
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,560
If we show it to them,

493
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,220
people who know about it and those who don't

494
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,020
will react differently.

495
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,500
Isn't it too risky?

496
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,540
Don't let them take it away again.

497
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,070
You brat.

498
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,980
What kind of place do you think our own home is?

499
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,900
I don't care who he is.

500
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,570
It's not that easy

501
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,690
to step out of the Tianji Hall.

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,650
Thank you, Master He.

503
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,300
Okay.

504
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,900
Just in case,

505
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,080
I'll go get Guardian Zhan.

506
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,240
Who is this Guardian Zhan

507
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,250
that needs your mother to invite him personally?

508
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,300
He's just a weird guy.

509
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,260
But his martial arts are quite impressive.

510
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,570
My Auntie recruited him many years ago.

511
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,460
He doesn't really talk to anyone

512
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,080
except my Auntie all these years.

513
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,440
You'll know when you get there. Let's go.

515
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,060
Don't stay up there.

516
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,710
Come down now.

Just get used to it.

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,290
Let me introduce you two.

This is Physician Li, the master of the Lotus Tower.

He's Fang Xiaobao's best friend.

524
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,590
This is Guardian Zhan.

525
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,260
He's known as the Dragon of the Martial Arts World,

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,850
skilled in using the Wufeng Sword.

527
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,220
Guardian Zhan.

528
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,370
Nice to meet you.

529
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm Li Lianhua.

530
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,520
I'm Zhan Yunfei.

531
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,380
That's the general idea.

532
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,620
We will take out a treasure to lure the thief out.

533
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,960
To make sure nothing goes wrong,

534
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,900
I need you to carefully arrange

535
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,980
and guard the Manor.

536
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,760
Okay.

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,980

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,820
excellent martial arts,

541
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,010
why do you stay at the Tianji Mountain Manor as a guard?

542
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,330
It's all my sister's fault.

543
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,780
She made a bet with Guardian Zhan on a sword match.

544
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,700
But Guardian Zhan lost unexpectedly,

545
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,350
so he kept his promise and stayed at the Manor.

546
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,930
A bet?

547
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,380
You're known for your mastery of the Wufeng Sword.

548
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,820
How could you lose to her?

549
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,120
I was injured then, and I did lose.

550
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,950
I was indebted for her help.

551
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,070

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,980
Thank you for coming.

558
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,460
I heard that

559
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,710
you're

560
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,150
very interested in the treasures

561
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,220
collected in the Tianji Mountain Manor.

562
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,140
Today,

563
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,700
I've picked out a few items

564
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,660
to appreciate with you,

565
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
and I'd like to ask for your advice!

566
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,420
Okay.

567
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,100
With pleasure.

568
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,780
If you have something good, take it out.

569
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,180
Yeah, let's see the treasures.

570
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,150
Okay.

571
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,510
Let's look at the first one.

572
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,780
It's good.

573
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,600
It's really good.

574
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,700
It's really good.

575
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,410
This is the luminous pearl from Qionghai.

576
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,540
Legend has it that this luminous pearl

577
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,000
was formed by the tears of a fairy in the heaven.

578
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,420
It's shining and dazzling within a hundred steps at night.

579
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,220
This is really a good thing.

580
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,810
The next treasure

581
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,650
is a piece of ice shard

582
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,620
we got by chance.

583
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,180
Ice shard?

584
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,460
What is this?

585
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,630
It may look ordinary,

586
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,870
but it's cold and frosty to the touch.

587
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,140
It's also engraved with

588
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,960
the Nanyin Script that has been destroyed for many years.

589
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't know

590
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,580
what it is.

591
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
Anyway, it's a rare item.

592
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,700
I've never seen it before.

593
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,010

Who is the calmest person over there?

595
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,270
The owner of Ruyi Private Bank,

596
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,710
Xing Ziru.

597
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,460
He's had business dealings

598
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,470
with the Tianji Mountain Manor over the years.

599
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,340
By the way,

600
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,790
he was the one who recommended my mother

601
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,290
to buy a house in Xiaoyuan City last time.

602
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,650
What? Is there a problem?

603
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,520
Think about it.

604
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,740
He was involved in what happened in Xiaoyuan City,

605
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,500
and he's involved in the loss of the Rama Heavenly Ice this time.

606
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,070
I don’t think it’s a coincidence.

Mr. Xing.

610
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,820
Why are you here alone?

611
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,370
Why don't you go in for a drink?

612
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,780
I can't drink much.

613
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,890
I came out for a walk.

614
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,370
I see.

615
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,030
Go and prepare some good tea.

616
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,870
Yes.

617

Mr. Xing,

618
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,220
how about tasting my new tea

this year?

620
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,900

There's no Ice here.

Nothing is wrong in this room.

630
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,170
Is the Ice on him?

631
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,910
Such a fancy jade pendant.

Xing Ziru may look rough,

633
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,700
but surprisingly,

634
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,060
he's also a beauty lover.

635
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,570
Just now, when Xing Ziru saw the Rama Heavenly Ice,

636
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,450
his look couldn't fool anyone.

637
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,550
If he had come here for the Ice,

638
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,250
he would have tried to get it

639
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,660
when he saw another one just now.

640
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,450
But why did he walk away

641

instead of focusing on the Ice?

The Tianji Mountain Manor is heavily guarded.

643
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,810
If you were him

644
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,260
and wanted to take something away,

645
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,660
would you

646
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,530
need any help?

647
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,140
Do you suspect he has someone on the inside?

648
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,910
I'll tell everyone in the Manor

649
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
to keep an eye on Xing Ziru.

650
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,930

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,130
He was injured at the foot of the mountain

680
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,820
and was rescued by her.

681
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,020
It seems that he's also a man in the martial arts world.

682
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,420
He's extremely weak

683
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,590
in martial arts.

684
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,270
He's nothing but a good-looking man.

685
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,730
He's not good enough for her.

686
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,620
Then why did you...

687
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,840
It's most important that she likes him.

688
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,740
Okay.

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,870

00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,360

that Physician Li treated before?

700
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,410
You need to tell me in advance.

701
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,710
I need to know the situation

702
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,380
and hide myself in advance.

705
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,620
Do you want to hear a story?

706
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,940
Pour me a cup of tea.

707
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,270
Thanks.

708
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,159
I'll take a sip first.

709
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,389
Here's the story.

710
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,500
Back then, Zhan Yunfei teamed up with others

711
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,520
to destroy the Lianhai Gang.

712
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,980
They captured the gang leader, Jiang Dafei.

713
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,730
When they tried to tie him up and sent him back to Yanzhou,

714
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,520
there was no rope.

715
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,820
So

716
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,650
someone looked at one of Zhan Yunfei's things

717
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,670
and wanted to borrow it.

718
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,889
What is it?

719
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:52,909
Headband.

720
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,139
So Zhan Yunfei used a headband before.

721
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,900
Doesn't he never comb his hair?

722
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,330
Not only does he love to comb his hair,

723
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,760
he's also very particular about it.

724
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,020
But

725
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,370
he's a little stubborn.

726
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,540
He didn't want to lend it.

727
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,890
And then?

728
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,830
Then...

729
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,740
What did we just agree on?

730
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,820
Take a bet on your headband.

731
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,640
Whoever loses will never comb his hair again.

732
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,400
Then this headband is mine.

733
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,780
Thank you.

734
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,190
I admit defeat.

735
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,160
I promised you.

736
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,060
I won't break my promise.

737
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,290
I won't tie my hair anymore.

738
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,060
It's more suitable to tie him up with this headband.

739
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,430
It turns out that Zhan Yunfei never combs his hair

740
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,090
because of the bet he made with you.

741
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,970
Li Xiangyi was so boring back then.

742
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,260
How dare you say that?

743
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,540
Isn't he just like you?

744
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,980
He was too young and arrogant back then.

745
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,630
He enjoyed showing off his martial arts,

746
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,770
and wasted his inner power on things that didn't matter.

747
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,540
But Li Xiangyi didn’t expect that

748
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,410
after so many years of his death,

749
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,430
Zhan Yunfei still remembers this promise.

750
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,630
He's so stubborn.

751
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,580
He did lose every bet.

752
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,850
He did lose the bet

753
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,710
with Li Xiangyi back then.

754
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,450
But as to the bet with your Auntie,

755
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,730
I don't know.

756
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,560
He...

757
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,950
And my Auntie?

758
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,000
Young master.

759
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,460
Young Master.

760
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,860
I've checked and found that

761
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,760
the 17 people Xing Ziru contacted throughout the night

762
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,250
are all local merchants.

763
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,270
They have been in touch with the Tianji Hall for many years.

764
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
There should be no problem.

765
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,510
What else did he do

766
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,330
besides talking to the guests?

767
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,350
In between conversations with people,

768
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,390
he would go out for some fresh air.

769
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,660
Each time he would go to the pavilion in the courtyard

770
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,520
and set up a game of chess.

771
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,100
He set it up himself and played it himself.

772
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,600
-A game of chess?
-A game of chess?

773
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,190
We don't know how to play chess.

774
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,280
But we've been trained

775
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,260
when joining the Tianji Hall.

776
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,130
We can remember what we've seen correctly.

777
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,500
These are what we saw

778
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,850
when we followed Xing Ziru

779
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,910
at different times.

780
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,270
After the fourth round, he went back to his room

781
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,070
and didn't come out again.

782
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,850
Keep an eye on Xing Ziru.

783
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,060
Don't alert him.

784
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,900
Yes.

785
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,220
Aren't these the chess manuals

786
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,970
from the Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection?

787
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,040
Look.

788
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,010
This is the Painting of Shangqing.

789
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,350
This is the Painting of the Four Immortals of Chengdu Prefecture.

790
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,290
This is the Painting of Baozhen.

791
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,750
This is the Painting of Jinming.

792
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,980
Minister Fang has really

793
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,800
cultivated you with great effort.

794
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,770
You are thoroughly accomplished

795
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,150
in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

796
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,830
My father cultivated me heart and soul when I was a child.

797
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,330
But I was still young back then.

798
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,330
I disobeyed him all the time.

799
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,960
Now that I think about it,

800
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,220
I'm really lucky.

801
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,540
Fang Xiaobao.

802
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,350
You've grown up.

803
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,400
Take a good look.

804
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,620
What do you think about these chess manuals?

805
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,980
I don't have a clue yet.

806
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,320
But the Rama Heavenly Ice is close at hand.

807
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,540
If Xing Ziru

808
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,660
is still in the mood to play chess at this time,

809
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,620
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

810
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,860
Study these chess manuals first.

811
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,150
I'll go to the pavilion to find clues.

812
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,390
Has my bet

813
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,980
ruined their marriage?

814
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,020
Blood!

815
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,250
Somebody help! Blood!

816
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,710
Somebody help!

817
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,980
Help! Somebody help!

818
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,920
Blood!

819
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,280
Li Lianhua.

820
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,460
Something happened to the groom.

821
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,210
Father!

822
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,070
Mother.

823
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,510
What happened to the groom?

824
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,220
Young Master!

825
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,790
Young Master, it's scary.

826
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,470
The groom had an accident last night,

827
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,490
and the body was gone.

828
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,170
Now there's only a piece of human skin left.

829
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,210
Xiaobao.

830
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,400
Aren't you detectives?

831
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,780
You must help me find the murderer

832
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,290
and seek justice for my husband who died distressingly.

833
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,060
Ms. He,

834
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,970
how do you know that

835
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,790
this piece of human skin is the groom's?

836
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,820
Wei was injured before.

837
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,760
I saw it when he applied the medicine.

838
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,600
He had this tattoo on his back.

839
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,490
My poor husband.

840
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,220
On our wedding night,

841
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,410
his body just disappeared.

842
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,370
Only this bloody human skin was left.

843
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,540
Dead or alive, there must be a body.

844
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,460
The groom is not made of water.

845
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,780
How could he just disappear?

846
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,430
The bedding and clothes are intact

847
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,800
and there are no signs of corrosion.

848
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,440
It doesn't look like the decomposing water.

849
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,450
Ms. He,

850
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,440
do you remember what happened last night?

851
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,360
Last night?

852
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,870
Last night...

853
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,460
Calm down. Tell us slowly.

854
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,060
Yesterday evening,

855
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,300
after the wedding ceremony,

856
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,860
he and I returned to the courtyard.

857
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,780
Seeing that it was still early,

858
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
we sat together in the courtyard for a while.

859
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,410
We didn't go back to the room until the moon came out.

860
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,180
After drinking the cross-cupped wine,

861
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,930
I felt sleepy.

862
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,020
He took me to bed to rest.

863
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,510
After that, I knew nothing.

864
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,870
When I woke up,

865
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,170
I could only see

866
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,010
this bloody human skin.

867
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,920
You felt sleepy after drinking the cross-cupped wine?

868
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,090
Auntie.

869
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,690
Think about it carefully.

870
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,110
Is there anything suspicious?

871
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,910
Anything suspicious?

872
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,780
Leave one's mortal form behind and attain bliss,

873
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,440
ascend to heaven and become immortal.

874
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,840
I've never heard that he likes poetry.

875
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,190
A line of verse.

876
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,320
Verse, human skin.

877
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,900
The pattern on the skin

878
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,890
doesn't look like an ordinary tattoo.

879
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,900
Does it mean anything?

880
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,340
There seems to be

881
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,980
something odd about the groom.

882
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,900
Something odd?

883
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,900
There are traces of fighting.

884
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,860
Someone must have broken into the bridal chamber last night,

885
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,410
but this person didn't hurt Auntie at all.

886
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,400
What's certain is that

887
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,370
no one else

888
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,590
has been killed or attacked in the Tianji Mountain Manor.

889
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,670
So,

890
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,660
the murderer came for Wei Qingchou?

891
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,180
He took the body away

892
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,540
after he killed him?

893
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,260
Impossible.

894
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,100
Last night when I returned from delivering the treasure,

895
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,140
the two of them

896
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,870
gave me a box of wedding candies.

897
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,520
No one else entered the bridal chamber after that.

898
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,020
Otherwise,

899
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,860
they could never escape my attention.

900
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,630
That is to say, Wei Qingchou

901
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,210
must have died after Brother Zhan returned.

902
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,230
Brother Zhan

903
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,380
has been guarding the opposite side of the house all night long.

904
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,150
Then the murderer couldn't have entered or exited from the front.

905
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,640
There is no entrance to the sill walls behind the windows.

906
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,220
The mechanisms in the Tianji Hall have always been very famous.

907
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,180
Is it possible that

908
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,710
there are other mechanisms and secret passages here?

909
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,300
This building

910
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,460
is a very normal place,

911
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,020
and there is nothing else.

912
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,840
The body is gone,

913
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,780
and the only thing left here is a tattooed human skin.

914
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,760
If the murderer killed Wei Qingchou

915
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,290
for this tattooed human skin,

916
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,010
why didn't he take it away?

917
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,650
Madam.

918
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,940
Xiaofeng must have been shocked.

919
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,060
Why don't you take her to rest somewhere else?

920
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,080
We can leave it to Xiaobao here.

921
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,610
Alright.

922
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,120
Li,

923
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,520
you've been waiting outside the door

924
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,830
since last night.

925
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Then stay here

926
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
and listen to Young Master's orders.

927
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,410
Yes.

928
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,850
Let's go.

929
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,480
