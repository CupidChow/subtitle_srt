[Episode 3]

4
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,320
I'll tell you the truth.

5
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,740
I've been sickly since I was young.

6
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,039
My mother didn't even give me a first name.

7
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,860
She was afraid that I wouldn't live to become an adult.

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,590
When I was ten,

9
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,740
my mother found

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,900
her long-lost younger brother.

11
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,900
He's the Deputy Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect,

12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,680
Li Xiangyi's senior,

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,420
Shan Gudao.

14
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,470
Shan Gudao is your uncle?

15
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,600
My mother has never liked the martial arts world,

16
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,050
so she didn't want Uncle

17
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,990
to disclose their relationship.

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,630
Uncle wanted to teach me martial arts in secret.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,440
But at that time,

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,360
I was too sickly.

21
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,110
Uncle always scolded me for being useless.

22
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,300
How many times have I taught you?

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,190
Why can't you remember?

24
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,460
You can't even hold a sword.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,329
How can you learn martial arts?

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,630
Again.

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,980
This sword is too heavy for you.

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,820
It's not suitable for you.

29
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,940
Take this.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
This wooden sword suits you better.

31
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,110
If you can learn the hundred foundational moves

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,820
with this wooden sword,

33
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,060
come to me.

34
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,940
I will take you as my disciple.

35
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,180
Before he left, he told me

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,960
not to lose my sword again.

37
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,030
A swordsman

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,960
must wield his sword firmly

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,490
in order to pacify injustice in the world.

40
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,150
That was the only time I met Li Xiangyi.

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,740
Now,

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,480
I don't even remember his face.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,170
But because of what he said,

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,230
I tried my best to cure myself.

45
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,500
I took medicine, no matter how bitter it was.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,380
I bathed in cold springs, no matter how hard they were.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,620
Now, I can finally stand up.

48
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,520
I can hold my sword firmly.

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,060
But he's gone.

50
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,900
You won't understand someone as noble

51
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,800
as my master.

52
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,930
So it was you.

53
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,060
To think the brat has grown up.

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,610
Your martial arts are alright.

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,740
You haven't really embarrassed your uncle.

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,620
It's just that there are some things

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,570
you don't need to remember too clearly.

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,820

Where is he?

71
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,530
I told him everything.

72
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,870
How can he run away?

73
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,200
The attack

74
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,720
came earlier than expected again.

Where is my senior, Shan Gudao's body?

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
Your biggest weakness

77
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,580
is that you want to be a hero.

78
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,690
A swordsman

79
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,020
should not have weaknesses.

80
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,650
What should we do?

81
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,540
Give it to me. I'll handle it.

82
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,980
That group of people went up the mountain

83
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,860
and fought their way down.

84
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,020
It's finally quietened down today.

Yes.

there would have been nothing I could do about it.

The Brahman arts are only a way to reconnect the meridians.

Golden needles can only

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,270
You're so young,

191
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,230
but you'll let yourself die?

192
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,620
Isn't it a pity?

193
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,910
Besides, the poison of the jade tea

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,550
have entered into your organs.

195
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,300
It will torture you from time to time.

196
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,910
If one day, it cannot be suppressed and enters your brain again,

197
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,830
you might get trapped in illusions.

198
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,220
In the end...

199
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,900
In the end, I'll become a lunatic.

200
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,170
It's good to die crazy.

201
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,130
I won't know anything

202
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,170
and won't feel pity.

203
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,220
I don't know what you want to hide from,

204
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,790
to make you so determined to leave.

205
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,480
"The heart attains peace with a single thought,

206
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,240
lotus flowers bloom all around."

207
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,780
Monk,

208
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,120
your incantation

209
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,040
is very good.

210
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,930
I understand.

211
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,280
Sect Leader Li.

212
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,970
Li Xiangyi has died in the East Sea.

213
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,000
From now on, Li Lianhua is the one left.

214
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,580
Master.

215
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,670
Did you send that brat to me on purpose

216
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,510
to remind me?

217
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,620
But don't worry.

218
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,210
Before I die,

219
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,020
I will definitely find Senior.

220
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,070
Otherwise,

221
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,230
I wouldn't be able to face you.

222
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,460
It's indeed the secret insignia of the Jinyuan Alliance.

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,090
This jade is rare.

224
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,510
Kunlun Jade City?

225
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,310
Young Master.

226
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,310
Why don't you sit down and eat something?

227
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,340
The rice looks bad.

228
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,460
I'm not destitute enough

229
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,520
to treat my mouth that badly.

230
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,680
If you don't, your stomach will suffer.

231
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,610
Young Master,

232
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,790
we really have nothing left.

233
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,850
We don't know if there will be another meal

234
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,400
after this one.

235
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,330
Happy.

236
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,860
Is there really

237
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,300
nothing left on you?

238
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,280
Yes.

239
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,870
Young Master,

240
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,410
are you going to pawn this jade pendant?

241
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,170
No, no.

242
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,020
You have been carrying this

243
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,970
since you were born.

244
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,300
I can't touch it even if I go performing in the streets.

245
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,430
Otherwise, my mother will kill me.

246
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,590
Happy.

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,100
Check the package again.

248
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,580
This letter...

249
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,800
The Lingshan Sect threw out

250
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,670
everything that belonged to Piao Erhuang.

251
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,090
I picked up some paper he wrote on

252
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,160
to burn as offerings to my mother,

253
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,380
so she can stop thinking about him.

254
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,540
I'll write some for you next time.

255
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,990
Let me see.

256
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,680
Wait.

257
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,160
Why is this letter so messy?

258
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,270
"Your subordinate has failed.

259
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,630
The Jinyuan Alliance's whereabouts in Jia Province were exposed.

260
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,210
I must bear the blame.

261
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,820
I should personally head north to atone for my crime.

262
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,770
But for the sake of my loyalty,

263
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,730
please spare me.

264
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
I will be sure to help the Demon King

265
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,980
and the Jinyuan alliance return to your former glory.

266
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,089
I will go to any length."

267
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,790
Young Master.

268
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,599
What does this mean?

269
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,970
This is obviously the apology letter

270
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,869
Piao Erhuang hasn't had time to send out yet.

271
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,760
The only person in the Jinyuan Alliance who might be called "Demon King"

272
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,839
must be the great demon, Di Feisheng's right hand man, the Medicine Demon.

273
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,430
Piao Erhuang works for the Medicine Demon?

274
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,720
Young Master,

275
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,320
what does the Medicine Demon look like?

276
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,070
Li,

277
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,140
take out the manual of the key members of the Jinyuan Alliance

278
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,940
that has been in the Tianji Hall's collection for years.

279
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,580
Medicine Demon.

280
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,150
His age and background

281
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,150
are unknown.

282
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,210
He is good at making poison and using medicine.

283
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,140
He first became famous in the martial arts world for healing the dead.

284
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,420
He has a heart disease.

285
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,930
He has close to no inner skills

286
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,910
and is not good at martial arts.

287
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,110
Sly and cunning.

288
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,900
Why does this sound familiar?

289
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,700
I've got it!

290
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,260
Young Master,

291
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,280
don't you think this Medicine Demon

292
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,510
sounds like that fake miracle doctor, Li Lianhua?

293
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,250
His reputation as a living dead is not coincidental.

294
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
Because he is the Medicine Demon.

295
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,850
Then it wasn't a coincidence that he was at Lingshan Bodhimanda.

296
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,880
Piao Erhuang's death was not a coincidence either.

297
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,180
He exposed the Jinyuan Alliance's whereabouts,

298
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,460
so the Medicine Demon came to silence him.

299
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,050
There are too many coincidences.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,770
If he really is a remnant of the Jinyuan Alliance,

301
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,700
I can't let him

302
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,070
get away from me.

303
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,000
Where can we find him?

304
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,920
There's only one way out of the mountain on the north side.

305
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,230
He can't travel that fast with a house.

306
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,360
Let's go.

307
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,560
Le's go after him.

308
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,610
Y-Young Master, slow down.

309
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,340
What's wrong?

310
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,430
It's a ghost!

311
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,730
This is not a ghost.

312
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,680
It's a corpse.

313
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,320
It's more important to find Li Lianhua.

314
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,570
Let's go.

315
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,770
I've finally found it.

316
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,480
What's that smell?

317
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,490
I smell it too.

318
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,970
Who knows?

319
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,620
If he is really the Medicine Demon

320
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,210
and spends his days with corpses,

321
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,680
nothing he does can surprise me.

322
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,740
Young Master,

323
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,140
you’d better stop.

324
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
Yes, Young Master.

325
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,290
We've checked this area.

326
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,630
There's nothing special.

327
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,510
Are you stupid?

328
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,860
The most important things are always

329
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,700
hidden in the least conspicuous places.

330
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,380
This is the strongest silk that's as thin as an insect's wings.

331
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,130
This is so rare.

332
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,570
How can he use it to cover a pot?

333
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,920
This is the Yingzhu Armor worn by Di Feisheng.

334
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,990
It seems that this fake miracle physician

335
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,240
really has something to do with the Jinyuan Alliance.

336
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,930
C-Could it be that

337
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,700
he realized Young Master was catching up to him,

338
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,480
so he abandoned the building and ran away?

339
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,750
There are no signs at all here

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
that he ran away in a hurry.

341
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,650
He should be nearby.

342
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,670
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

343
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,290
[Xiaomian Inn]

344
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,340
Open the door!

345
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,520
Please forgive us.

346
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,620
We have a rule here.

347
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,410
If you want to stay here,

348
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,980
you need to step over a fire basin to ward off evil spirits.

349
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,140
W-Ward off evil spirits?

350
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,100
You may not know,

351
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,170
but there is an ancient battlefield

352
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,060
nearby.

353
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,890
Many soldiers died in the wilderness.

354
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,450
That's why suspicious things

355
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,850
happen here once in a while.

356
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,330
Today is the Ghost Festival too.

357
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,230
The shopkeeper specially prepared a fire basin.

358
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,010
Please step over it

359
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,880
to ward off evil energy.

360
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,620
Young Master,

361
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,150
let's not stay here.

362
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,820
If we don't stay here,

363
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,200
do you want to travel at night?

364
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,460
Thank you.

365
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,260
Thank you.

366
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,140
May you be safe.

367
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,470
May you be safe.

368
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,810
May you be safe.

369
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,310
Fortunately, the shop is popular.

370
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,610
The waiter was so abnormal.

371
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,310
I was so scared.

372
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,770
I thought this was a haunted shop.

373
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,460
He's really here.

374
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,860
You two go to his room

375
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,110
and see if there's more evidence.

376
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,540
Li.

377
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,940
As the saying goes, "People might meet in the mountains or the rivers."

378
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,470
It's easy to run away after doing something bad,

379
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,970
but wouldn’t it be awkward to meet again?

380
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,830
Young Hero Fang,

381
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,760
here’s the thing.

382
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,740
I was in a hurry to travel north.

383
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,870
I couldn't wait for you to sober up.

384
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
It was my bad.

385
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,100
Here.

386
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,110
How about I treat you to some cold watermelon?

387
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,130
I don't like watermelon.

388
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,260
Physician Li,

389
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,890
did you leave in such a hurry

390
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,930
because of Piao Erhuang?

391
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,020
What does it have to do with Piao Erhuang?

392
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,540
How did you get into the locked shed?

393
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,980
Here’s the thing,

394
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,640
Young Hero Fang.

395
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,360
I saw Piao Erhuang screaming.

396
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,260
So,

397
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,150
as a benevolent doctor,

398
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,730
I went in

399
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,140
to have a look.

400
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,270
And picked the lock along the way.

401
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,130
I have some skills.

402
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,300
Your lie is pretty airtight.

403
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,400
Unfortunately, you left in a hurry

404
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,290
and didn't check if Piao Erhuang was dead or not.

405
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,020
What if he still had a chance to speak?

406
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,420
Young Hero Fang.

407
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,590
Isn’t it better

408
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,560
that Piao Erhuang didn't die?

409
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,690
You could send him to Baichuan Court to take credit.

410
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,890
I thought so too.

411
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,360
Unfortunately, Piao Erhuang only told me about you.

412
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,360
Your background and identity,

413
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,350
need I make them clear here?

414
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,930
Come back to Baichuan Court with me.

415
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,810
Young Hero Fang, you must be joking.

416
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,400
What background can I have?

417
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm just a wandering physician

418
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
trying to make a living.

419
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,470
More than one person has had a reputation for reviving the dead.

420
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,180
Ten years ago,

421
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,180
there was someone who got famous for reviving the dead.

422
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,980
You said all that

423
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,260
because you suspect

424
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,750
I'm the Medicine Demon of the Jinyuan Alliance?

425
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,360
It seems Piao Erhuang really is dead.

426
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,830
Otherwise, you wouldn't have guessed so absurdly.

427
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,450
I found Di Feisheng's Yingzhu Armor

428
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,370
in your Lotus Tower.

429
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,750
You said you had nothing to do with the Jinyuan Alliance.

430
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,330
This is such an important object?

431
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,180
I picked it up by the beach a few years ago.

432
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,050
Is it a crime to pick up things?

433
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,460
How coincidental.

434
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,980
Exactly.

435
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,030
Young Hero Fang,

436
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,200
have some watermelon.

437
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,650
It won't be cold if you don't eat it now.

438
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,350
You see.

439
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,230
It rains every night.

440
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,580
The bones of dead people are everywhere.

441
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,940
This place is so ominous.

442
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,990
If this weren't the fastest way to the harbor,

443
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,710
I wouldn't have come here.

444
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,690
No wonder the shops are so particular.

445
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,270
There's a background to this evil energy.

446
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,970
Have you heard about what happened two days ago?

447
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,090
What happened?

448
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,250
Two days ago,

449
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,590
a friend of mine

450
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,810
saw two merchants

451
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,340
get strangled to death

452
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,690
while passing through the forest up front

453
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,010
by two skeletons that showed up from nowhere.

454
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,730
Really?

455
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,660
This...

456
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,400
Waiter.

457
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,750
Excuse me,

458
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,390
which room does the man downstairs with a dog

459
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,340
stay in?

460
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,330
He stays in the innermost room.

461
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,750
Li,

462
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,760
keep watch for me.

463
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,460
I'll search the fake miracle doctor's room.

464
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,190
Okay.

465
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,090
Don't panic.

466
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,860
It's just windy.

467
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,640
It's just windy.

468
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,540
Sorry.

469
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,380
Waiter, take this ominous thing away.

470
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,260
Sir,

471
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
don't say that.

472
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,940
The girl on the portrait is Yu Qiushuang,

473
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,250
the sister of the master of Yu City behind the mountain.

474
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,220
She ran away from home for some reason,

475
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,290
so he put up a notice to find her.

476
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,650
Everyone at our inn

477
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
are people from Yu City looking for the Second Young Miss.

478
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,780
They're serving melon that's almost rotten.

479
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,070
Why don’t they serve some side dishes?

480
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,330
How about I give you a suggestion?

481
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,400
The noodles here cost two coins plain,

482
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,450
and three coins with meat.

483
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,860
They come with a side dish too.

484
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,120
Who are you looking down on?

485
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,670
I'm not hungry.

486
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,290
You're in such a state now.

487
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,700
You can't even afford a bowl of plain noodles.

488
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,680
Go home now.

489
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,570
We haven't finished talking yet.

490
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Where are you going?

491
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,570
Young Master.

492
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,300
If a detective of Baichuan Court makes a wrongful arrest,

493
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,300
they will be stripped of their badge

494
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,740
and never be hired again.

495
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,980
So,

496
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,210
if you want to arrest me,

497
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,560
be careful.

498
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,970
If you're not guilty,

499
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,080
don't run away.

500
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,200
Ghost!

501
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,450
Who are you calling a ghost?

502
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,100
This is...

503
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,380
the person in the painting.

504
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,090
The Yu Qiushuang on the painting.

505
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,360
What are you looking at?

506
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,090
Don't look!

507
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,780
Second Young Miss.

508
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,350
Where have you been?

509
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,820
We've been looking for you.

510
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,040
You put up posters of me all over the mountain.

511
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,140
Do you want to be whipped?

512
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,410
I-It's because Madam has been looking for Second Young Miss.

513
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,490
She couldn't find you for days,

514
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,980
so she asked us to put up the posters.

515
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,460
My sister sent you here?

516
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,440
Madam went to Shannan.

517
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,340
She'll be back in a few days.

518
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,820
Miss Yun Jiao brought us here to look for Second Young Miss.

519
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,950
She's on the second floor.

520
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,530
Second Young Miss.

521
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,090
Second Young Miss.

522
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,070
Second Young Miss.

523
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,110
Second Young Miss.

524
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,070
Why are you following me so closely?

525
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm already upstairs.

526
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,840
I can't run away anymore.

527
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,150
Shuang.

528
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,430
You're finally back.

529
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,130
If you hadn't put up all those posters on the mountain,

530
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,160
I would'be made you wait a few more days.

531
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,250
Fortunately, they found her.

532
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,150
Otherwise, when people from Yu City get angry,

533
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,570
things turn ugly.

534
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,380
That's a good idea.

535
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,970
If any suspect disappears,

536
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,020
I can put up posters along the way

537
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,280
and force him to show himself.

538
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,230
Young Hero Fang,

539
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,460
your servant disappeared after he entered the inn.

540
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,850
Maybe you can use this method

541
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,950
to find him.

542
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,220
Waiter.

543
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,440
Is the hot water for the bathroom ready?

544
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,860
Yes, Miss.

545
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,610
This is the place.

546
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,480
[Yu City, Yun Jiao]

547
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,340
I have calmed Qiushuang down.

548
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,200
We can return to Yu City tomorrow morning.

549
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
Thank you, Miss Yun.

550
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,160
Miss Yun Jiao and Second Young Miss are close like sisters.

551
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,160
With her around,

552
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,610
I can finally report back to Madam.

553
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,330
Let's go up.

554
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,350
It's raining again.

555
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,290
Ghost!

556
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,640
Ghost!

557
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,260
Ghost!

558
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,250
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

559
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,320
What's going on?

560
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,850
Blood!

561
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,420
Blood!

562
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,860
It's blood!

563
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,380
There's blood there!

564
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,980
There's blood there!

565
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,700
Blood!

566
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,540
He's dead?

567
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,650
Happy!

568
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,470
Happy!

569
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,130
Young Master.

570
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,700
Happy was fine just now.

571
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,690
He became like this as soon as he entered this room.

572
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,020
Happy.

573
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,110
It was him.

574
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
It must have been him.

575
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,250
He must have killed Happy.

576
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,770
Did you do it?

577
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,450
W- What could I have done?

578
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,800
You knew Happy came to your room.

579
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,340
So you killed him with sorcery.

580
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,360
Young Hero Fang,

581
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,590
I understand

582
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,280
you're sad about Happy's death.

583
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,120
But you don't have to

584
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,650
frame me.

585
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,050
You are the Medicine Demon.

586
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,230
You have many tricks.

587
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,950
If you've really been wronged,

588
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,160
come back to Baichuan Court with me for an investigation.

589
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,930
If you leave now,

590
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,080
your Happy would have died in vain.

591
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,970
His neck is fractured.

592
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,610
Obviously, he was strangled to death.

593
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,750
I was sitting opposite you just now.

594
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,340
How could I have strangled him

595
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,030
from all the way there?

596
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,990
Young Hero Fang,

597
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,310
if you keep wasting your time,

598
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,720
the murderer will really escape.

599
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,200
Young Master.

600
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,740
You can't believe him.

601
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,660
It must have been him.

602
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,750
Li, don't worry.

603
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,280
No matter who the murderer is,

604
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,300
we need evidence.

605
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,580
If you are the murderer,

606
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,719
I will avenge Happy.

607
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,070
I'll give you a chance now.

608
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,679
Who is the murderer?

609
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
I really don't know.

610
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,060
But a servant being killed for no reason

611
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,150
is merely a lead-in.

612
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,540
But as long as we follow this trail

613
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,900
and keep looking,

614
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,150
we'll get to the point.

615
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,340
Second Young Miss.

616
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,060
Second Young Miss.

617
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,650
Where is Second Young Miss?

618
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,120
Where is Second Young Miss?

619
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,000
We were guarding at the stairs.

620
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,179
We didn't see her go out.

621
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:55,530
Where is Qiushuang?

622
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,989
Where is Qiushuang?

623
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,540
Someone just died.

624
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,180
Second Young Miss is missing too.

625
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,580
Did she get caught by the person who left the bloody footprint?

626
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,100
Search!

627
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,140
-Yes.
-Yes.

628
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,430
Who are you?

629
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,410
What do you want?

630
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,850
So many people.

631
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,250
I'm Chief Escort Cheng Yunhe of Hexing Escort Agency.

632
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,060
Judging from your attire,

633
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,450
you must be guards from Yu City.

634
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,100
We have never intruded into each other's business.

635
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,960
What brings you

636
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,140
to our room?

637
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,220
Our Second Young Miss is missing.

638
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,620
That's why we're searching the inn.

639
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,930
Please forgive us

640
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,840
for our offense.

641
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,240
Second Young Miss?

642
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,500
As you can see,

643
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,330
there are only armed escorts in this room.

644
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,090
Your Second Young Miss isn't here.

645
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,900
Open it.

646
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,220
My friend.

647
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,300
We're just trying to make a living in the martial arts world.

648
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,720
We can't open the goods until they've been delivered.

649
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,820
This is our rule.

650
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,760
Besides, look.

651
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,240
They have been sealed by wax by our client.

652
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,410
The dates inscribed on them show they have never been tampered with.

653
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,250
The Second Young Miss you mentioned

654
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,070
couldn't have gotten past these wax seals

655
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,380
to crawl into the box,

656
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:20,990
right?

657
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,370
Our Second Young Miss is missing.

658
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,200
Your delivery box is very suspicious.

659
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,910
If you don't open it,

660
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,490
we can't let it go today.

661
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,270
Who dares to do it?

662
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,450
Chief,

663
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
this is Yu City's territory.

664
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,740
If we get into a fight now,

665
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,520
we might have to die here.

666
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,860
A head?

667
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,270
Escort Cheng,

668
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,980
you promised us

669
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,710
you wouldn't bring ominous items to the store.

670
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,020
We trusted you because you're a regular customer.

671
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,060
Why did you bring a head in?

672
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,980
He's a prisoner who was beheaded by the magistrate's office.

673
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,600
His family asked me to bring him back with his body intact.

674
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,150
T-That won't do either.

675
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,940
As long something ominous enters the inn,

676
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,970
there will be vengeful ghosts.

677
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,230
S-See, a vengeful spirit came.

678
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,760
Look.

679
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,910
A ritual has been performed on it.

680
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,390
There won't be any evil spirits.

681
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,660
Second...

682
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,100
Second Young Miss!

683
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,970
Excuse me!

684
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,100
Second Young Miss!

685
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,940
Qiushuang.

686
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,710
Qiushuang.

687
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,140
Qiushuang.

688
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,970
W-What's going on?

689
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,290
How is this possible?

690
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,890
Is there really a ghost?

691
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,780
My Second Young Miss died at Xiaomian Inn.

692
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,420
None of you are innocent!

693
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,040
Take them back to Yu City.

694
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,970
Yes.

695
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,510
[A Tall Pavilion Reaches the Clouds]

696
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,540
Castellan.

697
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,830
This is Second Young Miss.

698
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,550
[Castellan of Yu City, Yu Mulan]

699
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,350
Lock them up.

700
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,860
Lock everyone in Xiaomian Inn up!

701
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,800
Madam will deal with them when she comes back.

702
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,740
Yes.

703
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,010
Brother,

704
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,100
ask your Castellan to see me.

705
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,550
Do you know who I am?

706
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,260
I'm a detective from Baichuan Court!

707
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,540
Why should I be locked up?

708
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,340
Are you pretending not to hear me?

709
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm talking to you!

710
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:19,990
Stop yelling.

711
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,740
The Castellan of Yu City is not here.

712
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,010
She will see you when she comes back.

713
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,040
Didn't we see the Castellan, Yu Mulan,

714
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,830
when we were getting locked up?

715
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,700
Yu Mulan has no real power.

716
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,100
He doesn't have a say over major issues.

717
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,290
How did you know?

718
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,790
Why don't you think about

719
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,050
why the guards at the inn

720
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,960
only mentioned their Madam and not the Castellan?

721
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,750
And Yu Qiushuang

722
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,890
mentioned a Sister,

723
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,780
not a Sister-in-law.

724
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,870
You can infer that

725
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,190
Yu Mulan changed his surname after he married into the family.

726
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,700
He's only the Castellan in name.

727
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,340
So in this city,

728
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,210
the one who's really in power is Yu Hongzhu.

729
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,740
You're still not in the clear

730
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,560
about what happened last night.

731
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,430
Don't focus too much on me.

732
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,830
You need to listen more and question more as a detective.

733
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,480
Do your work properly.

734
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,430
I don't need you to tell me that.

735
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,830
Chief Envoy Cheng,

736
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,880
what happened to your goods?

737
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,780
I also want to know what happened.

738
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,900
The boxes originally contained

739
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,490
yellow jade to be sent from Beishan Mine to the capital.

740
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,660
Everyone saw them being sealed.

741
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,390
Yes.

742
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,910
And they never left our sight.

743
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,060
How did Second Young Miss get in there?

744
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,380
It's all because you accepted that private order in secret.

745
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,020
Don't slander me.

746
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,780
Rituals have been performed on that head,

747
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,260
right?

748
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,260
So what?

749
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,660
Yu City clearly wants our lives.

750
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,140
Chief Envoy Cheng.

751
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,150
What is this private order about?

752
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,310
On the day we set off,

753
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
someone came to me

754
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,370
and asked me to smuggle this head.

755
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,520
He said the criminal was beheaded for robbing official silver,

756
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
but his family wanted to keep his body intact.

757
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,970
They gave me 100 taels of silver.

758
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,730
I...

759
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,400
I was blinded by greed.

760
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,770
So I agreed.

761
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,280
Manager.

762
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,800
Anything unusual with Xiaomian Inn?

763
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,710
No.

764
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,040
It's just that rituals have to be performed during the Ghost Festival,

765
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,540
but we skipped it this year.

766
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,500
Something really happened.

767
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,040
It was a ghost.

768
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,430
The blood footprints led towards the second floor.

769
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,700
We all saw it.

770
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,220
Don't be nervous.

771
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,740
You can't believe in ghosts.

772
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,480
Who else

773
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,570
could have killed Second Young Miss Yu

774
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,860
and put her in our sealed box?

775
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,980
It's strange.

776
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,320
How was Yu Qiushuang killed?

777
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,900
How was she sealed in the escort box?

778
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,310
Doesn't it sound like a ghost did it?

779
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,750
Maybe the ghost didn't want

780
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,150
Second Young Miss Yu's body.

781
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,830
You...

782
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,350
Second Young Miss's body was burned.

783
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,740
Madam was very angry when she came back.

784
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,740
Take everyone away.

785
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,230
Yes.

786
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,090
Blood?

787
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,120
Where did the blood come from?

788
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,660
This blood should belong to the guards of Yu City.

789
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,420
What’s happened to these guards?

790
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,410
As the guards of Yu City,

791
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,440
they failed to protect their master.

792
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,900
They were sent to guard the body,

793
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,410
but someone knocked over the candle

794
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,110
[Wife of the Castellan of Yu City, Yu Hongzhu]

795
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,660
and damaged my sister's body.

796
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,550
It's already merciful

797
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,920
that I asked them to kill themselves.

798
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,760
You are Madam Yu?

799
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,480
You killed the guards

800
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,850
before we figured it out?

801
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,510
The life and death of servants of Yu City

802
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,460
have nothing to do with you.

803
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,810
They were incompetent.

804
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,640
There is no place for no good-for-nothings in Yu City.

805
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,790
Madam Yu.

806
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,910
We had nothing to do with

807
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,590
Second Young Miss being killed.

808
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes.

809
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,810
It was the work of an evil spirit.

810
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,440
Yes.

811
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,780
We're here to testify.

812
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,980
It had nothing to do with us.

813
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,620
I've never seen a ghost.

814
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,390
Then tell me

815
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,840
what this evil spirit looks like.

816
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:57,740
What?

817
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,270
You don't remember?

818
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,500
Or did you forget?

819
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,260
I heard people on the verge of death always see ghosts.

820
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,660
I'll help you remember.

821
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,870
Are you crazy?
