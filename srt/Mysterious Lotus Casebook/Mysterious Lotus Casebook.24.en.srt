[Episode 24]

4
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,460
Do you remember the rose of Sharon that was covered in mud?

5
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,170
The ten-foot-tall rose of Sharon was also covered in mud.

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,660
It was because the mud splashed a little high.

7
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,670
There is nothing special.

8
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,700
The whereabouts of the rest of Yu Louchun's body

9
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,800
is still unknown.

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,320
So the guards dug deep

11
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,300
for the antidote.

12
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,640
That reminded me.

13
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,530
They dug holes everywhere

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,120
and splashed a lot of mud.

15
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,620
Connect the two things

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,380
and think about it again.

17
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,669
Someone dug a hole under the tree

18
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,820
and splashed mud on the rose of Sharon.

19
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,050
That is to say,

20
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,380
Yu Louchun was buried here.

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,320
I guess the murderer

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,260
had already prepared this burial place

23
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,380
before the Mountains Red.

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,260
The darkest place is under the candlestick.

25
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,140
Dig.

26
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,210
Look.

27
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,079
It's really here.

28
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,100
Let me have a look.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,110
The reason why they threw the stump out to attract attention

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,860
and hid the corpse secretly

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,210
is that they wanted to hide the real cause of Yu Louchun's death.

32
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,370
It looks as if he was bitten by a snake.

33
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,430
Could it be that a venomous snake bit him to death?

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,610
Brown-spotted pit viper.

35
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,420
His blood contained snake venom.

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,520
That's why the blood on the stump didn't coagulate or dry.

37
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,020
It made people believe that Yu Louchun died in the morning.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,690
In fact, he was killed

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,110
between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.

40
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,720
Xinjue didn't stay at the foot of the mountain at that time.

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,090
Then who is Bihuang's accomplice?

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Bihuang will come and tell us

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
who her accomplice is.

44
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,300
Let's hear what she will say then.

45
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,850
She'll come to us?

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,390
Judging by the personality of Qing'er,

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,570
she'll tell Bihuang because she's worried about her.

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,110
So let's go back and wait for her.

49
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,190
She came earlier than expected.

50
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,940
I got a valuable thing by chance.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,650
I heard it's exactly what you've been looking for.

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,100
If you two show mercy

53
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,010
and stop investigating Girls' Mansion,

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,870
I'll give it to you

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,390
to show my gratitude.

56
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,240
This letter was written by Bihuang.

57
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,540
She has the ice shard.

58
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,430
Finding out the truth

59
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,780
and punishing criminals are the duties of detectives.

60
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,840
But Bihuang was abducted,

61
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,660
imprisoned, and maltreated.

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,260
She's really a poor woman.

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,230
The law is objective,

64
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,130
but if Bihuang hadn't killed Yu Louchun,

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,260
her miserable life wouldn't have come to an end.

66
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,930
I don't know

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,510
if I should continue the investigation.

68
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,610
If you stop, you're a kind person.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,290
If you keep investigating, you're a detective.

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,820
Fire!

71
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,070
Fire!

72
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,280
Help! Put out the fire!

73
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,350
Fire! This way!

74
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,820
Hurry up!

75
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,700
Help! Put out the fire!

76
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,140
Hurry up!

77
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,630
Get more water! Hurry up!

78
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,340
Don't go in!

79
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,100
Put out the fire!

80
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,020
I'm coming.

81
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,220
Hurry up!

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,460
Help! Put out the fire!

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,140
Get more water.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,060
Qing'er and Bihuang are still inside.

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,940
Don't go in.

86
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,340
OK. Hurry up.

87
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,340
Qing'er.

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,140
Get up first.

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,290
Sister Bihuang.

90
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,640
Sister Bihuang.

91
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,700
-Sister Bihuang.
-Let's go out first.

[Qunfang House]

93
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,550
Sister Bihuang.

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,540
Sister Bihuang.

95
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,580
Sister Bihuang.

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,920
What happened?

97
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,140
I heard you suspected Bihuang.

98
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,360
I was worried.

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,110
So I came and told her.

100
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,480
But she asked me to go to the kitchen and cook porridge for her.

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,500
When I came back, I saw the room was on fire.

102
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,490
Bihuang...

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,250
I wanted to save her.

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,270
But the fire spread too fast.

105
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,659
Even I was trapped inside too.

106
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,900
Why did it happen?

107
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,260
Isn't it said that karma is real?

108
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,540
Sister Bihuang.

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,670
Sister Bihuang.

110
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,330
People who believe in God and worship deities always say karma is real.

111
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,640
But if they really want to redress an injustice,

112
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,900
they have to rely on people.

113
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,050
I knew it.

114
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,600
Li Lianhua, I've made up my mind.

115
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,980
I want to keep investigating.

116
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,140
Okay. Be a detective then.

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,830
Finding out the truth

118
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,480
sometimes seems to hurt good people,

119
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,050
but only in this way

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,280
can't the scumbags who hide in the dark escape.

121
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,740
Treasure! Treasure!

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,930
Yu Louchun hid the treasure here.

123
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,600
We've been looking for it for so long.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,410
It was hidden by this thing.

125
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,110
This is similar to the Jinyun Fabric at the banquet.

126
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,980
It was woven into the shape of the wall.

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,290
It managed to evade the search.

128
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,710
The person is really good at embroidery.

129
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,380
Why is the treasure here?

130
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,340
Could it be

131
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,810
that Xinjue colluded with Bihuang in the murder?

132
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,530
Bihuang committed suicide to escape punishment.

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,290
All you need to remember is

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,930
that there is no escape from the long arm of the law.

135
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,580
Leave the treasure here

136
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,409
and let the Baichuan Court deal with it.

137
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,240

140
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,880
We know Bihuang was guilty.

141
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,280
But she lived with us for years.

142
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,700
Please allow us

to bid farewell to Sister Bihuang for the last time

Tomorrow morning,

let the truth come out.

152
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,250
Have you figured the last part out?

153
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,970
It was a little vague before.

154
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,600
Now everything is clear.

155
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,970
This is the most difficult case I've ever experienced.

156
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,940
But no matter how difficult it is,

157
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
it's time to tell the truth.

158
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,920
Let the truth come out.

159
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,220
Physician Li. Young Hero Fang.

160
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,490
You found the rest of the body?

161
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,180
Hasn't the case already been solved?

162
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,500
Xinjue and Bihuang colluded in the murder, right?

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,660
Why did you call us here?

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,700
A person's left side is cut into the shape of hashes.

165
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,740
It doesn't mean the person's right side is also cut into the shape of hashes.

166
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,880
This means

167
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,490
his left body was cut into the shape of hashes

168
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,610
for some reason.

169
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,150
It's hard to understand what you're saying.

170
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,820
What reason is it?

171
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,870
If Bihuang had killed Yu Louchun directly,

172
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,980
she couldn't have escaped.

173
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,910
In order to be safe after killing people,

174
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,760
she could only frame someone else.

175
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,640
After thinking about it,

176
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,980
she thought the best candidate is Machete Ghost.

177
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,300
Simply put,

178
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,580
Bihuang and Xinjue are not accomplices.

179
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,490
Yu Louchun wasn't killed by Machete Ghost?

180
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,080
You can take a look

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,430
at the shoulders of Yu Louchun's body.

182
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,580
How come?

183
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,680
Snakes?

184
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,740
Yu Louchun was bitten to death by a snake?

185
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,600
That's right.

186
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,200
He died from snake venom.

187
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,010
But the cut seemed to be caused by a single slash.

188
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,160
The murderer is very skilful.

189
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,730
A skill that can cut people with a single slash.

190
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,520
If you have a right tool,

191
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,600
it's not difficult.

192
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:33,980
Guards!

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Black iron.

194
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,430
Yu Louchun's bookcase

195
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,700
is made of black iron.

196
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,700
The edge was even ground and became a blade.

197
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
Was the body dismembered with this thing?

198
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,320
That's right.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,080
Someone chose the hash-shaped shelves from the bookcase,

200
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,070
ground the edge as a blade,

201
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,520
and pressed it against Yu Louchun's body.

202
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,150
This is Hash Slash.

203
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,230
What a nice touch.

204
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,650
But why is there only half of Hash Slash

205
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,650
on the rest of Yu Louchun's body?

206
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,060
It's rare to find something that is as hard as black iron in the world.

207
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,420
If they wanted to grind it and make it a blade,

208
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,120
even if they spent two hours a day,

209
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,330
they could only grind half of the hash-shaped shelves in six months.

210
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,430
But the day of the Mountains Red was coming.

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,340
The murderer could only deceive people with a fake.

212
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,830
If no one found

213
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,120
Machete Ghost,

214
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,010
the rest of the body couldn't be found either.

215
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,840
Bihuang was so scheming.

216
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,900
Apart from Yu Louchun,

217
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,130
only one maid can go up

218
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,200
to his Kanyun Peak

219
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,850
once a day.

220
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,680
And that maid can only clean here for two hours.

221
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,320
During the time when she had to clean the entire house,

222
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,510
it was really not easy for her

223
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,060
to not be noticed

224
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,150
when she ground the black-iron bookcase.

225
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,040
How did she succeed?

226
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,270
Only the person who was cornered

227
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,500
and risked her life to save herself could succeed.

228
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,410
Miss Bihuang

229
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,480
really wanted to escape from Girls' Mansion where she suffered terribly.

230
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,090
But Bihuang was dancing at the Zhaixing Stage the night before.

231
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,870
Yu Louchun was at Kanyun Peak.

232
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,250
She couldn't go to two places at the same time.

233
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
How did she kill him?

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,670
That's right.

235
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,670
A snake was manipulated to kill Yu Louchun.

236
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,670
So she must have a helper who can manipulate snakes.

237
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,520
Miss Chilong.

238
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,690
You're quite awesome.

239
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,170
Physician Li, you must be kidding.

240
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,580
Chilong is only good at dancing.

241
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,420
We've never seen her

242
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,220
learn any snake-manipulation skills.

243
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,550
Miss Chilong.

244
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,310
You're the Chehu people, right?

245
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,430
Chehu belongs to Blood Realm.

246
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Do I look like the Chehu people?

247
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,160
The Chehu people have yellow hair and a Roman nose.

248
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,050
You don't look like them.

249
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,130
So I guess

250
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,240
you are the Han people who was born in Chehu,

251
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,380
right?

252
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,900
Most girls from Chehu have a tattoo of snake teeth.

253
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,370
It's well hidden.

254
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,790
But when you fought against the guards yesterday,

255
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,660
I accidentally saw your tattoo.

256
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,280
Chehu is a small country in Blood Realm.

257
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,750
The Chehu people hunt for a living.

258
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,690
Snake bites are the least harmful to fur.

259
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,390
So you've been training snakes to hunt since childhood.

260
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,720
Miss Chilong.

261
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,480
You must have learnt it.

262
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,630
Even so,

263
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,510
Yu Louchun didn't allow anyone

264
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,720
to bring snakes to Girls' Mansion.

265
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,510
Of course.

266
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,250
But snake eggs are different.

267
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,710
[Celebrate with Light]

268
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,700
Miss Chilong.

269
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,820
I found these in the jade drum.

270
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,070
The jade drum

271
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
was sent up to the mountain ten months ago.

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,570
After the jade drum was put in a warm place for some time,

273
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,100
the baby snakes slithered out of the hole.

274
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,170
My next question is

275
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,370
who sent the jade drum up to the mountain.

276
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,130
Chilong.

277
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,000
This brown-spotted pit viper has just grown.

278
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,190
It can't hurt many people.

279
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,770
Besides, investigating cases is their duty.

280
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,080
What's wrong with that?

281
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,800
As I said before, you two are wise.

282
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,690
I'm more convinced today.

283
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,440
Mr. Murong, you're a smart person.

284
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,100
Yu Louchun was so cautious,

285
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,440
but he still died.

286
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,270
Why did you think

287
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,280
the snake eggs were hidden in the jade drum?

288
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,490
I couldn't guess it at first.

289
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,330
When I found you're the Chehu people

290
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,390
and that you told a lie that you're the Yueqian people,

291
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,530
everything became clear to me.

292
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,570
Then why do you think I'm also the Chehu people?

293
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
Because what you said was self-contradictory.

294
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,270
Yueqian is covered by yellow sand.

295
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,390
People there are afraid of water.

296
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,140
But you were handsome on the bamboo raft.

297
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,040
You were not afraid.

298
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,910
It's reasonable that you don't like taking a bath because you are new here.

299
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,610
But there is another possibility.

300
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,320
You're trying to hide your hair color.

301
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,240
So after we suspected you,

302
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,720
we went to your room and found something.

303
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,210
The end of the hair is black,

304
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,970
but the root is yellow.

305
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,910
Did you dye your hair?

306
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,430
You two are indeed intelligent.

307
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,470
So the three of you conspired together to murder him?

308
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,339
No.

309
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,440
I forced them.

310
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,720
They dared not disobey me.

311
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,220
You...

312
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,670
I coveted Yu Louchun's treasure,

313
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,619
so I coerced you and Bihuang.

314
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,290
It has nothing to do with you.

315
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,400
Now that the truth was exposed,

316
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,970
I'll take the blame.

317
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,540
From now on,

318
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,770
no one will force you and hurt you anymore.

319
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,190
Go down the mountain

320
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,050
and live a good life.

321
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,060
I...

322
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,620
Chilong.

323
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,140
Do as you're told.

324
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,790
If you had coveted the treasure,

325
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,240
you wouldn't have gone this far.

326
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,530
You mean I was too cruel to Yu Louchun?

327
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,140
You were too cruel to yourself.

328
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,670
I don't understand what you said.

329
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,920
Of course you don't understand.

330
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,110
Because you don't want to admit it.

331
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,960
I want to ask you a question.

332
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,730
When did you throw the first broken arm

333
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,970
to Guanri Pavilion?

334
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,900
I threw it after I killed Yu Louchun at night.

335
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,690
No.

336
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,580
Guanri Pavilion is outside Girls' Mansion

337
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,440
and is guarded.

338
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,470
You had no chance.

339
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,270
Your only chance

340
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,440
was when we climbed the mountain to watch the sun rise early in the morning.

341
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,660
But we went and watched the sun rise together that day.

342
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,310
I didn't see him bring bags.

343
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,190
I don't think he could hide a broken arm.

344
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,130
That's why I asked

345
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,820
why you went this far.

346
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,890
When did your arm

347
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,730
get broken?

348
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,830
When you were dancing at the Mountains Red,

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,080
your arm was not broken.

350
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,810
I guess after his last dance

351
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,690
at the Mountains Red,

352
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,850
he went back to his room and cut his arm off.

353
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Before we went to Guanri Pavilion,

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,780
you disguised your broken arm

355
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
as Yu Louchun's broken arm

356
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,330
and then threw it when we didn't notice.

357
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,270
We were all in cloaks that morning.

358
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,080
Everyone gave their attention

359
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,440
to the stump.

360
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,720
No one noticed

361
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,020
that Mr. Murong

362
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
already lost his arm.

363
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,620
You cut your arm off

364
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,370
to cover up the fact

365
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,520
that Yu Louchun was poisoned with snake venom,

366
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,780
right?

367
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,210
You're indeed smart.

368
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,060
But don't go too far.

369
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,380
My arm was broken in an accident many years ago.

370
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,350
To frame Xinjue,

371
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,090
I could throw the body away.

372
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,620
Why did I do this in public?

373
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,570
Because you had to throw the body

374
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,370
to a place where Chilong couldn't go.

375
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,550
To frame Xinjue,

376
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,670
you could throw the body anywhere.

377
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,390
Guanri Pavilion

378
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,650
is outside Girls' Mansion.

379
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,630
It was impossible for the girls to go there.

380
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,230
Only in this way

381
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,340
wouldn't Chilong be suspected.

382
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:11,930
Enough.

383
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,060
I'm greedy for money.

384
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,920
It has nothing to do with Chilong.

385
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,340
Mr. Murong.

386
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,130
Do you remember the Eagle Dance?

387
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,300
A year ago, Dancing Devil, Murong Yao, performed the Eagle Dance.

388
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,240
He spread his arms high as if he was trying to reach the sky.

389
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,610
That dance became famous in the capital.

390
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,700
But now?

391
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,080
Murong Yao, you used a dancer's arm

392
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,870
in exchange for Chilong's innocence.

393
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,490
You can't even raise your left arm in greeting like other Chehu people.

394
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
A greedy man can't do these.

395
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,040
I know what kind of statement you want.

396
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,470
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,350
It was I who did all these.

398
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,330
Yu Louchun, the head guard,

399
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,300
and Dongfang Hao were all killed by me.

400
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,780
Please don't blame others.

401
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,320
I'll compensate with my life.

402
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,620
No!

403
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,300
[Girl's Mansion]

404
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,200
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

405
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,040
Don't jump on my head if you want to die.

406
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,660
Fei.

407
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,450
You came just in time.

408
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,820
Here is the thing you want.

409
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,920
We're even now.

410
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,060
The donation to the temple opposite was recorded on it.

411
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,510
You donated 100 taels of gold ten days ago

412
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,870
and asked them to make the clock strike midnight in advance.

413
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,710
You lost your arm and money.

414
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,280
In this world, there is no one

415
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,270
who is as greedy as you.

416
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,950
Mr. Murong.

417
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,020
You want to use your own death

418
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,390
in exchange for all the girls' life.

419
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,250
I really admire that.

420
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,750
But those girls killed Yu Louchun.

421
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,150
Are they going to

422
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,800
live in the dark forever?

423
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,350
Physician Li.

424
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,200
You mean Yu Louchun's death

425
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,790
has something to do with all the girls in Girls' Mansion?

426
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,030
Of course.

427
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,620
If they hadn't used their deceased friends

428
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
to deliver messages,

429
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,010
Murong Yao wouldn't have known

430
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,200
where Chilong was locked up.

431
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,790
Before yesterday,

432
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,890
I had a question that I couldn't solve.

433
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,840
No one knew

434
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,730
the girls were imprisoned here.

435
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,750
How did Mr. Murong know

436
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,790
the whereabouts of Chilong?

437
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,540
It was recorded on the government's casebook

438
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,850
that there always were many female corpses floating on the nearby river

439
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,030
who dressed strangely.

440
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,120
I didn't realize it until yesterday

441
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,090
when I attended Bihuang's funeral.

442
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,550
The girls put their things

443
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,000
on their deceased friends.

444
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,790
It looked as if they were expressing their sorrow.

445
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,960
In fact, they were seeking help from outsiders

446
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,700
in this way.

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,430
They hoped the corpses that floated out could be recognized

448
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,160
so that their families could know their whereabouts.

449
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,670
But after a long time,

450
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,030
only one girl's jewelry

451
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,320
was recognized by her old friend.

452
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,420
Chilong?

453
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,380
So when Yu Louchun

454
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,670
received the Thunder Dance Notation,

455
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,030
Chilong knew

456
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,920
Mr. Murong found her.

457
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,600
So Mr. Murong

458
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,500
became every girl's only hope.

459
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,300
So it was Murong Yao who made all the plans?

460
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,840
The girls just cooperated with him?

461
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,940
It was the other way around.

462
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,780
Girls' Mansion has been closed all these years.

463
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,030
They sent letters through the waterfall.

464
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,100
But Murong Yao couldn't write back.

465
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,260
So all the things

466
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,610
were planned by the girls,

467
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,060
except one thing.

468
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,870
That is Murong Yao's broken arm.

469
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,450
I guess it happened like this.

470
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,240
After the Mountains Red that night,

471
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,650
in order to clear the girls,

472
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,070
Murong Yao cut his arm off

473
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,590
to prepare himself to throw Yu Louchun's body the next day.

474
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,540
Chilong didn't expect Murong Yao

475
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,970
to hurt himself in this way.

476
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,740
They made a noise.

477
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,580
But the lascivious head guard was attracted there.

478
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,200
At first, they only wanted to kill Yu Louchun

479
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,520
and put the treasure and the antidote in Xinjue's room

480
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,390
to frame him.

481
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,760
But the head guard appeared.

482
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,050
They had no choice but to kill him.

483
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,810
But the head guard has nothing to do with Machete Ghost.

484
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,420
To clear themselves,

485
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,440
they had to kill one more person

486
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,870
to frame

487
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,330
Xinjue.

488
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,260
Am I right?

489
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,990
Dongfang Hao.

490
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,280
They didn't want to kill innocent people.

491
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,550
Only by killing those who deserve to die

492
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,560
could they feel less guilty.

493
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,580
So after thinking about it,

494
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,930
they thought the best candidate

495
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,150
was Dongfang Hao.

496
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,100
Coincidentally,

497
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,150
Dongfang Hao was Machete Ghost's enemy.

498
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
So the second time when he cut the body into the shape of hashes,

499
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,190
he did it better

500
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,290
because he practiced it before.

501
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,470
If I'm right,

502
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,330
that's the truth.

503
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,500
You're right.

504
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,260
Chilong and I grew up together.

505
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,670
We already got engaged a long time ago.

506
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,330
Seven years ago,

507
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,570
she came to Central Plains for a dance competition and suddenly disappeared.

508
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,740
Since then,

509
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,350
I hadn't heard from her.

510
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,770
That's why I came to Central Plains

511
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,870
to find her whereabouts.

512
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,680
One day,

513
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,060
I found her hair stick on a corpse.

514
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,440
Then I started looking for people.

515
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,490
I investigated the whereabouts of many girls.

516
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,610
Later, I found out

517
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,060
she had fallen into someone's hands.

518
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,980
You won't understand how I felt

519
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,350
when I knew the person I love

520
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,230
was in such a situation.

521
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,080
At that day, I vowed

522
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,030
that no matter what the price was,

523
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,800
I would rescue Chilong.

524
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,660
Over the years,

525
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,560
the Mountains Red has been quite famous in the martial arts world.

526
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,220
Good.

527
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,050
But it was mysterious.

528
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,430
Good.

529
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,330
In order to become Yu Louchun's guest,

530
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,650
I performed the Eagle Dance in the capital.

531
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,070
[I'd like to invite Murong Yao to admire beautiful maple leaves with me on September 19.]

532
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,070
[September 7, the year of Renzi. Yu Louchun.]

533
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,060
I finally got an invitation from Yu Louchun.

534
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,260
I found an excuse to send a gift to Girls' Mansion in advance.

535
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,990
Chilong knew my plan when she saw it.

536
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,690
That night,

537
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,120
at the Mountains Red,

538
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,560
we finished the last dance together.

539
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,540
When the clock struck midnight in advance,

540
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,520
we took action.

541
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,650
Yu Louchun didn't expect

542
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,320
that he would be killed by a venomous snake.

543
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,080
This is the retribution for his evil deeds.

544
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,440
I've rescued Chilong.

545
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,370
My wish already came true.

546
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,370
No matter what I'll face,

547
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,450
I'll never regret it.

548
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,940
I admire your good deeds.

549
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,010
But if you bear the blame alone,

550
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,220
not only will you not be able to save Chilong,

551
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,720
but all the girls here

552
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,810
will never have peace.

553
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,190
All the girls here?

554
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,060
Did they also...

555
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,710
The rotating tray weighs about 500 kilograms.

556
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,650
The three of them can't turn it.

557
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,710
This is the first reason.

558
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,120
You fell asleep yesterday.

559
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,870
It was because the girls added opium

560
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,790
to their lipsticks.

561
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,050
You'll know if you test it.

562
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,100
This is the second reason.

563
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,230
There is a lot of treasure in the rooms of Xinjue and Bihuang.

564
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,720
It's hard for the three of them

565
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,220
to move it down the mountain in a few hours.

566
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,300
This is the third reason.

567
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,530
Even if I don't tell others,

568
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,730
do you think you can really hide it from the Baichuan Court

569
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,310
and the Supervision Bureau?

570
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,460
Physician Li and Young Hero Fang are indeed smart.

571
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,790
It seems that we can't hide it from you anymore.

572
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,530
You're right.

573
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,820
We killed him together.

574
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,310
But there's one thing

575
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,280
you guessed wrong.

576
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,580
This black-iron bookcase wasn't ground by Bihuang alone.

577
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,810
Yu Louchun had a suspicious mind.

578
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,650
So the girls who went and cleaned Kanyun Peak

579
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,630
must be changed every day.

580
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,110
This black-iron bookcase

581
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,610
was ground by every girl

582
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,330
in Girls' Mansion.

583
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,820
While grinding this murder weapon,

584
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,720
we were surprisingly calm.

585
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,480
Seeing it getting sharper and sharper,

586
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,030
we thought

587
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,400
maybe we could soon get out of

588
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,050
the hell

589
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,100
and live the life we yearned for.

590
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,090
This black-iron bookcase

591
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,920
is the Deadly Machete

592
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,140
we gave to Yu Louchun.

593
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,010
Ladies.

594
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,650
You wanted to kill Yu Louchun to get rid of the nightmare.

595
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,820
It's understandable.

596
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,400
But the gold bricks you hid

597
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,850
will put you in danger again.

598
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,590
We only found jewelry

599
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,760
in the rooms of Bihuang and Xinjue.

600
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,460
We didn't find gold bricks.

601
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,170
Yu Louchun is in the opium business.

602
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,470
He recorded the gold bricks he earned on this ledger.

603
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,370
But where are the gold bricks?

604
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,610
We've never seen gold bricks either.

605
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,630
Xifei.

606
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,350
Just relying on yourselves,

607
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,520
you girls couldn't cut Yu Louchun who practiced Jade Bone Technique.

608
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,140
Do you have the gold bricks?

609
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,910
The answer is here.

610
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,250
Every gold brick is extremely heavy.

611
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,260
Only by stacking the gold bricks together could the Jade Bone be cut.

612
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,490
But the gold bricks are too heavy.

613
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,400
It's impossible for you to carry them down the mountain.

614
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,390
So you had no choice but to hide them here.

615
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,890
Ladies.

616
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,430
Yu Louchun sold opium.

617
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,000
His business partners are evil.

618
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,770
Now he's dead.

619
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,320
If those villains can't find the gold bricks,

620
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,730
they won't let you go.

621
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
You've tried so hard

622
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,420
to live a new life.

623
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,000
But if you keep the dirty money,

624
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,720
you will never recover.

625
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,140
Well...

626
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,630
Please give yourself a way out.

627
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,380
Let the Baichuan Court

628
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,880
protect you above board.

629
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,380
Come with me.

630
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,140
All the gold bricks are here.

631
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,550
You put all the gold bricks in the wall.

632
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,000
We hid gold bricks

633
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,920
because we've been here for years.

634
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,180
We have nowhere to go.

635
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,980
We wanted to keep them as souvenirs

636
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,150
and gave some to the parents

637
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,970
of our deceased friends.

638
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,330
We know we were wrong.

639
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,690
But Mr. Murong did nothing wrong.

640
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,260
They just wanted to save people.

641
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,730
For the sake of it,

642
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,130
please forgive their sins.

643
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,490
All the girls in Girls' Mansion

644
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,590
are willing to take the blame.

645
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,510
Please spare Mr. Murong.

646
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,190
Please spare Mr. Murong.

647
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,080
Please get up.

648
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,100
I'll definitely tell the Baichuan Court

649
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,910
your suffering and Murong Yao's intention.

650
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,670
Yes.

651
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,230
The Baichuan Court will give you justice.

652
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,530
Please get up.

653
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,560
What justice?

654
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,970
This is not fair at all.

655
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,570
Why did you hide it from me?

656
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,740
I was also harmed by Yu Louchun.

657
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,270
I also wanted to escape from here.

658
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
Why didn't you tell me?

659
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,380
Why am I the only one who was kept in the dark?

660
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,040
Because we treat you as our younger sister.

661
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,170
You've been here for less than two months.

662
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
But we've been here

663
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,490
for at least two years.

664
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,600
A woman's youth is short.

665
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,980
We were locked up in this dark place.

666
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,190
We already regarded ourselves as people who're half dead.

667
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,910
Every time when we saw you

668
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,840
cry and try to escape from here,

669
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,390
we remembered the person who we used to be.

670
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,250
So we couldn't let you know it.

671
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,870
If we failed,

672
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,260
you wouldn't know it.

673
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,010
If we succeeded,

674
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,490
you wouldn't become a murderer.

675
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,670
After you leave here,

676
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,500
you can still

677
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,610
be a smart and happy girl.

678
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,910
Sister.

679
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,380
I'm ashamed.

680
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,940
Yesterday, I even had bad intentions

681
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,940
towards these poor girls.

682
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,240
I deserve to be beaten.

683
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,600
Yu Louchun.

684
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,530
This wretch deserved to die.

685
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,550
People from the Baichuan Court will be here soon.

686
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,350
The girls can air their grievances.

687
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,370
Young Hero Fang.

688
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,420
Your family is rich.

689
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,440
Why don't you help them more?

690
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,380
Don't worry.

691
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,580
I've given the order.

692
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,250
If they have nowhere to go,

693
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,080
Tianji Mountain Manor will take them in.

694
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,330
I'll stay away

695
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,290
from the activities which hurt others.

696
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,659
I should focus on drinking.

697
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,500
Yesterday, in the cave

698
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,909
where Miss Qing'er was hiding,

699
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,389
another place where Yu Louchun hid his treasure was found.

700
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,719
Unfortunately, I'm in no mood to see it.

701
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,820
Forget it.

702
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,179
I'm in no mood to look for treasure.

703
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,750
Let the Baichuan Court investigate it.

704
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,380
You must be disappointed.

705
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,480
I was just curious.

706
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,850
I didn't know you were joking.

707
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,820
You tricked me.

708
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,150
We were joking?

709
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,050
Are you looking for this?

710
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,530
What is this?

711
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,400
I've never seen it before.

712
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,820
Of course you haven't.

713
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,830
Because when Bihuang died,

714
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
she didn't give it to you.

715
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,340
I don't understand

716
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,770
what you're saying.

717
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,710
Li Yifu, you don't understand?

718
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,360
You were looking for the ice shards for the Jinyuan Alliance.

719
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,320
You didn't expect that Yu Louchun was killed and that the treasure was missing.

720
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,060
You temporarily hid.

721
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,540
You finally found Bihuang sent us a letter.

722
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,190
So you forced her.

723
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,340
But Bihuang refused to give it to you.

724
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,050
What did you do when you didn't find the ice shard?

725
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,430
So you wanted to kill her.

726
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,600
That's an amazing touch.

727
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,870
Here you go.

728
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,740
Take a look.

729
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,390
She had long attached the ice shard

730
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,190
to the dragonfly's wing.

731
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,510
So she tricked you.

732
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,040
People who want to condemn someone always trump up a charge.

733
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,300
Do you have any evidence?

734
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,840
Evidence?

735
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,930
You're so stubborn.

736
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,960
Bihuang wrote letters with her right hand.

737
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,890
But there is an ink stain in the palm of her left hand

738
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,780
in which she held this ice shard.

739
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,460
This is the evidence.

740
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,480
Among the guests, only you have something to do

741
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,650
with ink.

742
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,380
One-word Poem, Li Yifu.

743
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,980
In the end, I was found out.

744
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,930
Thundering fire bombs.

745
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,010
If I'm not mistaken,

746
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,800
the inkstone you brought is sulfur.

747
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,990
You used the four treasures of the study to make this weapon.

748
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,960
Unfortunately, you're so bad at martial arts.

749
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,560
Wait.

750
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,190
How about this?

751
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,090
Let's make a deal.

752
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,240
How dare you make a deal with me?

753
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,800
If you hadn't killed Bihuang,

754
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,920
her miserable life would have come to an end.

755
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,850
Are you disregarding the big picture

756
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,090
for a woman?

757
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,770
Life is the most important thing.

758
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,710
Unfortunately, people like you and Yu Louchun

759
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,010
will never understand.

760
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,540
I've put a mark.

761
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,560
People from the Jinyuan Alliance will be here soon.

762
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,860
If you want to live, hand the ice shard to me.

763
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,720
Are you talking about this iron windmill?

764
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,700
It was stuck into the mountain outside the suspension bridge.

765
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,930
It made sounds very often.

766
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,420
It was noisy.

767
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,770
I pulled it out on my way here.

768
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,070
We heard what you said.

769
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,930
Now it's my turn to make conditions.

770
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,020
Tell me.

771
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,960
Apart from the ice shards which Yu Louchun and Jin Mantang had,

772
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,350
where are the other two ice shards?

773
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,100
Do you think I'll betray the Jinyuan Alliance?

774
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,310
I just said it casually.

775
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,360
No matter whether you tell me or not,

776
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Fang Xiaobao won't let you go.

777
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,650
So Li Yifu is the boss of the Jinyuan Alliance?

778
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,820
The boss's face is going to be swollen.

779
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,120
One-word poem?

780
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,190
He succeeded at the first attempt?

781
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,030
He's a beast.

782
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,820
You're right.

783
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,740
By the way, Physician Li,

784
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,990
what are the ice shards they talked about?

785
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,020
Why is the Jinyuan Alliance looking for the ice shards?

786
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,870
The ice shards

787
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,600
are the rare pieces of jewelry.

788
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,530
Maybe Di Feisheng wants to give them

789
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,380
to the people around him.

790
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,390
Well,

791
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,000
don't tell anyone about it.

792
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,810
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

793
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:37,900
OK.

794
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:54,190
[Girls' Mansion]

795
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,050
[Shuixie Zhilan]

796
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,020
Congratulations, Fang Duobing.

797
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,150
You solved another big case.

798
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,550
The girls of Girls' Mansion will be interrogated by the Supervision Bureau.

799
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,970
It's a black-and-white situation.

800
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,340
We'll do justice to you.

801
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,660
We won't let anyone be wronged.

802
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:21,570
Yang Yunchun.

803
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,230
Take all the girls you're in charge of away.

804
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,880
As Miss Shi said,

805
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,240
go with me.

806
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,170
Who dares?

807
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,370
Yang Yunchun, the executive in the Supervision Bureau.

808
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,250
Why don't you kneel before me?

809
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,730
Princess Zhaoling.

810
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,900
Princess?

811
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,250
Zhaoling?

812
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,900
Princess?

813
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,730
Your fiancée?

814
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
Princess, may I ask why you're here?

815
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,270
Who are you to ask me questions?

816
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,940
Obey my orders.

817
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,540
Pardon all the girls in Girls' Mansion

818
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,270
and Murong Yao.

819
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,250
Release them immediately

820
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,410
and escort them home.

821
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,090
If anything goes wrong,

822
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,070
I'll punish you.

823
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,600
Princess.

824
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,730
Murong Yao belongs to the martial arts world.

825
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,380
The case about him should be judged by the Baichuan Court.

826
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,300
I want them to be safe.

827
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,370
If you can't do it, I'll tell my father what you have done.

828
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:25,860
Yes.

829
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,580
I will negotiate with the Baichuan Court

830
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,960
in the name of the Supervision Bureau.

831
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,020
Get up.

832
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,130
Thank you, Princess.

833
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,670
Qing'er.

834
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
You are a princess.

835
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,260
Thank you, Princess.

836
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,350
Thank you, Princess.

837
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,230
Get up.

838
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,520
Get up.

839
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,370
We are friends who suffered together.

840
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,200
Don't stand on ceremony.

841
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
I'll always remember

842
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,000
your kindness to me.

843
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,910
If anyone bullies you again,

844
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,700
just tell me.

845
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,130
I'll take revenge on them.

846
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,200
Qing'er.

847
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,560
Princess.

848
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,330
I know what you're thinking.

849
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,580
You think I was stupid enough to get caught.

850
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,950
You're laughing at me, right?

851
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,480
I don't dare.

852
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,460
You said you don't dare,

853
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,380
but in fact, you think it's right to escape from the wedding, right?

854
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,120
Look carefully.

855
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,040
Am I eight-foot tall?

856
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,900
Is my waist as thick as a giant barrel?

857
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,210
Forget it.

858
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,120
Since you saved me,

859
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,430
I'll forgive you.

860
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,590
I've been out for so long.

861
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,090
Father must be worried about me.

862
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,460
The people from the Supervision Bureau will escort me back to the palace.

863
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,770
See you, Princess.

864
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,420
Why are you in such a hurry to say goodbye to me?

865
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Am I a jinx?

866
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,480
I said goodbye because you said you were leaving.

867
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,310
You only know how to investigate cases.

868
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,880
All right, I'm leaving now.

869
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,580
Don't worry about your escape from the wedding.

870
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,370
I will go back and beg for leniency for you.

871
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,090
Princess, you're so understanding.

872
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,530
Thank you so much.

873
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,100
For what?

874
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,840
What's the difference between the early date and the late date of the wedding?

875
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,200
We'll hold it after you travel around the martial arts world.

876
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,060
It's the same.
