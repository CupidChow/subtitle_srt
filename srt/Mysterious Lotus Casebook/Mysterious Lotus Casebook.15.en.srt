00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,979
Physician Li,

5
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,190
may I have a word with you?

6
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,450
Li Lianhua, come here.

7
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,200
I got something for you.

8
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,220
This is Wuxiang Golden Needles.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,800
They were used by the Immortal Healer in Dazhou a hundred years ago.

10
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,920
They can cure every disease

11
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,289
and be used for acupuncture.

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,640
It took my grandpa a long time

13
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,780
to find this set of needles.

14
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,960
You helped me just now.

15
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,130
Take it as a thank-you gift.

16
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,330
Guan,

17
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,780
I don't think it's proper.

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,300
I insist.

19
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:10,930
Then thank you, Guan.

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
You flatterer.

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,130
After I go back home,

22
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,980
I can give you a dozen better needles.

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,700
That'll be too late.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,570
He's childish.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,070
You're much better than him.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
We're here to investigate the case.

27
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,290
Why are you following us?

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
I'm not following you.

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm following Li Lianhua.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,310
Besides,

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,700

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,010
I prepared clean clothes

37

for Master Jin.

38
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,980
I'll put them on for him.

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,860
How did Dong Ling come in

40
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,350
without triggering the Thousand Bell Formation?

41
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,700
Had he been hiding in this secret room?

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,140
The last time we came here,

43
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,870
the comb was right up there.

44
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,950
He had checked all the treasures.

45
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,620
Why didn't he notice it?

46
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,740
Look.

Date of pawning.

50
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,090
This is a pawn ticket.

51
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,050
It's all black. How could you tell?

52
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,870
Let me have a look at it.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,230
Guan.

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,320
There were lots of people here

55
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,140
so I didn't notice this incense burner.

56
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,070
Take a look.

57
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,460
Jin Mantang owned a pawn shop

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,070
so it's not surprising that he had pawn tickets.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
There's more than one kind of incense in it.

60
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,470
Inhaling it for a long time causes dizziness.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
This is a kind of knockout incense

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,420
with a woody scent.

63
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,659
Careful.

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,020
Was this incense

65
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,060
used to knock out Jin Mantang

66
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,590
before he got strangled to death?

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,290
Or did Jin Mantang

68
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,580
plan to use this incense

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,830
to deal with Dong Ling?

70
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,900
Unfortunately, I don't know the name of this incense.

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,610
Otherwise, we can get more clues.

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,460

He definitely knows what this is.

76
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,020
That old man is a grumpy wanderer.

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,580
It's almost impossible to ask him questions.

78
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,640
So forget about him.

79
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,930
There's something you don't know.

82

You've been quiet. What are you thinking?

83
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
I think I've smelled

84
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,659
this scent before.

85
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,210
Woody scent.

86
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,750
Yes.

87
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,190
The woody scent you mentioned,

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,820
Miss Zhiyu smelled like it.

89
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,159
It can't be a coincidence.

90
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,480
Bracelets.

91
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,159
What bracelets?

92
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,840
Something is wrong with her bracelets.

93
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:57,780
Let's go.

94
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,000
She's gone.

95

Let's split up to find her.

96
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,870
Okay.

97
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,110
Wait.

98
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,020
Miss Zhiyu.

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,450
Where are you going in that outfit?

100
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,780
You went to Jin Mantang's room last night.

101
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,340
Was the knockout incense your doing?

102
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,620
N-No.

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,390
You smelled like the knockout incense.

104
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,450
Your foster father just died.

105
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,340
As his daughter,

106
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,650
instead of waiting to attend his funeral,

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,970
you tried to escape in disguise.

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,780
What happened between you and Jin Mantang?

109
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,090
You won't talk?

110
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,260
You wore so many bracelets

111
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,700
to cover

112
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,900
the scratches left by Jin Mantang, right?

113
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,660
She thinks she can get away with it.

114
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,540
What are you doing?

115
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,020
The murderer has been found.

116
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,700
She shall be locked in the woodshed

117
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,660
and interrogated.

118
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,110
Take her away.

119
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,770
Yes.

120
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,580
I really hate to hurt

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
a beautiful girl like you.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,210
Tell me.

123
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,159
Where is the opal skull?

124
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,290
I don't know.

125
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,820
I didn't kill anyone.

126
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,580
I didn't take the opal skull.

127
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,990
Guess we have to do this the hard way.

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,320
You can't punish her without trial.

129
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,070
If someone files a complaint about it in the court,

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,180
do you think His Majesty will be infuriated?

131
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,950
Keep an eye on her.

132
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,800
No one is allowed to come near her.

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,000
She can't eat or drink

134
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,140
until she confesses.

135
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,180
Let's see how long she can last.

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,550
Mr. Fang.

137
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,280
Please.

138
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, no.

139
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,610
Stop!

140
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,700
Guan, are you all right?

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,850
I'm fine.

142
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,940
Miss Zhiyu, come out.

143
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:36,930
You…

144
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,980
What's going on?

145
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,480
We thought

146
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,580
Miss Zhiyu wore those bracelets

147
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,300
to cover the scratches Jin Mantang left when he struggled.

148
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,000
But it turned out that we were wrong.

149
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,210
Those are knife wounds.

150
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,010
So you made a wrong judgment?

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,770
Sorry that we misunderstood you.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,640
Then how did Miss Zhiyu get those wounds

153
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,380
and why did she have the woody scent?

154
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:18,810
Miss,

155
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,170
say something.

156
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,690
How can we help you if you don't tell us anything?

157
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
At this point,

158
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,310
I can tell you the truth.

159
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Everyone thinks I'm Jin Mantang's adopted daughter

160
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,950
and lives a carefree

161
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,980
and luxurious life.

162
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,010
But in fact,

163
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,830
he just wanted my blood to make medicine.

164
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,340
What? Your blood?

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,060
After I was sold to the Yuanbao Villa when I was six,

166
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,850
I had to take dozens of herbs every day.

167
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,790
After a decade, my blood became his nostrum.

168
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,180
He used incense

169
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,220
to knock me out every few days

170
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,650
so I wouldn't feel the pain

171
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,340
when he took my blood.

172
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,450
He soaked herbs in my blood

173
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,240
and drank them from the opal skull.

174
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
He believed that could cure his disease.

175
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,120
Is that true?

176
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,980
Can't believe

177
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,700
there's such a cruel treatment in the world.

178
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,590
Jin Mantang was heartless!

179
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,240
Someone like him

180
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,460
deserved a tragic death.

181
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,360
What was his disease?

182
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,520
He never talked about it

183
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,080
and never trusted anyone.

184
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,410
Neither did he ever use the opal skull

185
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
in front of me.

186
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,730
Since that's the case,

187
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,240
why didn't you tell us the truth?

188
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,980
Why did you disguise yourself and run away?

189
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,180
I was worried that what he did to me

190
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,420
would be revealed sooner or later

191
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,040
and I'd be suspected of killing him.

192
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,980
On the night Jin Mantang died,

193
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,110
you went to his room to give him your blood.

194
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,750
That's why you and his room

195
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,500
had that woody scent.

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,170
After you left,

197
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,610
he deactivated the Thousand Bell Formation and led me in.

198
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,460
I left after he took my blood.

199
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,700
I really didn't do anything.

200
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Try to recall that night.

201
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Before Jin Mantang died,

202
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
was there something off with him?

203
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,460
Yes.

204
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,120
He usually took his time when he took my blood,

205
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,970
but he was absent-minded that night

206
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,980
as if he was in a hurry to do something else.

207
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,710
He even got blood under his nails.

208
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,850
I guess Jin Mantang

209
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,970
was in a hurry to go to the secret room

210
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,010
to check on Dong Ling.

211
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,060
So you still think

212
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,420
before we set the Thousand Bell Formation,

213
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,190
Dong Ling had already been in the room.

214
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,260
Not on the day we arrived.

215
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,140
He'd been there

216
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,570
since half a month ago.

217
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,770
Was Dong Ling from Zhuzhou?

218
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,980
How did you know that?

219
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,180
That pawn ticket.

220
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,650
I got it.

221
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,840
Dong Ling must have pawned something

222
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,050
in Jin Mantang's shop when he was young.

223
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,740
Now he wanted to redeem it.

224
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,730
Maybe it was the opal skull.

225
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,190
But Jin Mantang refused to return it to him.

226
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,250
That's how they became enemies.

227
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,510
Here is my guess.

228
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,430
Dong Ling threatened Jin Mantang,

229
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,570
but Jin Mantang didn't use the ransom note

230
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,530
as solid evidence to turn him in.

231
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,860
It means that Dong Ling had long been under his control.

232
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,870
It's not that Dong Ling hid in the secret room to get back at Jin Mantang

233
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,670
but that Jin Mantang

234
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,570
managed to hold Dong Ling captive.

235
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,360
Dong Ling came to see Master Jin.

236
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,690
Luckily, Master Jin took him down using the arrow hidden in his sleeve.

237
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,490
He reacted swiftly

238
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,630
or he'd have been hurt by Dong Ling.

239
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,840
No one saw it coming

240
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,180
so we didn't arrive in time

241
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,100
and let Dong Ling run away.

242
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,940
After that, we guards got flogged by the butler

243
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,100
for our negligence.

244
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,940
Yes.

245
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,220
Everyone in the Yuanbao Villa

246
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,920
said Dong Ling was chased away by Jin Mantang.

247
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,580
But no one saw it with their own eyes.

248
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,280
So,

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,870
Jin Mantang was lying.

250
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,970
It doesn't make sense.

251
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,650
Dong Ling was good at martial arts.

252
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
Jin Mantang was no match for him.

253
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,880
How could he take him captive?

254
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,820
Don't you remember this?

255
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,450
This empty box was on the floor.

256
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,130
Why is it up there now?

257
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,420
I thought

258
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,310
a third person entered the secret room

259
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,890
and took away the thing in the box.

260
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,320
But if someone tried to come in,

261
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,060
the Thousand Bell Formation at the door

262
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,030
would definitely be triggered.

263
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,140
The empty box?

264
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,400
It was a bait Jin Mantang used to distract Dong Ling.

265
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,420
Hurry!

266
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,290
Don't get clever with me.

267
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,270
I…

268
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,910
I've promised to give it to you.

269
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,700
There's nothing you need to worry about.

270
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,700
Where is the opal skull?

271
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:58,930
Over there.

272
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,580
In that box.

273
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,490
You played me!

274
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,980
Jin Mantang!

275
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,060
Let me out!

276
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,940
Jin Mantang!

277
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,420
Half a month later,

278
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,320
Jin Mantang thought Dong Ling was dead,

279
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,270
so he was in a hurry to check it out.

280
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,220
But he didn't expect that

281
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,740
Dong Ling was still alive.

282
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,700
So Zongzheng Mingzhu was right.

283
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,340
They killed each other.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,820
It's not that simple.

285
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,200
Why was Dong Ling still alive

286
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,150
after being trapped here for half a month?

287
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,580
He even still had the strength to strangle Jin Mantang.

288
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,070
And why was Jin Mantang

289
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,030
wearing only one shoe?

290
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,240
In my opinion,

291
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,840
just because there is no trace

292
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,610
of a third person in the secret room

293
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,210
doesn't mean there wasn't a third person

294
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,390
in this story.

295
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,220
Could it be that man in black?

296
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,740
Why did he want Miss Zhiyu dead?

297
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,100
Maybe

298
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,140
he wanted a scapegoat.

299
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,450
It's also possible

300
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,120
that he didn't get what he wanted.

301
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,100
It seems that only by catching that man in black

302
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,530
can we find out the truth.

303
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,340
So that was a trap you set.

304
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,410
It's my fault

305
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,890
that he escaped.

306
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,300
I can't help but wonder

307
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,230
if you two are on his side.

308
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,380
Fang Duobing.

309
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,160
Don't let him escape next time.

310
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,820
There's no next time.

311
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,180
You again.

312
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,820
You beat my subordinates

313
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,850
and took away the suspect.

314
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,410
What do you want?

315
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,340
Miss Zhiyu isn't the murderer.

316
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,280
We're here

317
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,570
to find out the truth.

318
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,950
Find out the truth?

319
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,310
I've sent someone to check

320
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,030
the payroll of the Baichuan Court.

321
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,100
Fang Duobing,

322
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,180
you're a downright impostor!

323
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,110
You don't have the right to conduct an investigation here.

324
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,990
[Yuanbao Villa]

325
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,010
Get lost!

326
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,319
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

327
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,859
Open the door!

328
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,310
I was sent here by the Baichuan Court!

329
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm an authorized detective!

330
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,550
How dare you call me an impostor?

331
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,310
That's a wild accusation!

332
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,040
Fang Duobing.

333
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,940
Calm down.

334
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,890
I'm not done yet.

335
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,780
Zongzheng Mingzhu, listen carefully!

336
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,060
You violated the laws

337
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,060
and got away with it.

338
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,980
I don't care what you want this time.

339
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,380
You can't get off the hook!

340
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,180
I'll get to the bottom of it

341
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,700
and throw you into jail!

342
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,670
Let's wait and see!

343
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,510
I'm so mad.

344
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,680
-I'm so mad.
-So hot-blooded.

345
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,020
No.

346
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,700
In just a few days,

347
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,700
even if the Gang Qi in his body is dispersed,

348
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,430
he won't be able to practice martial arts again.

349
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,630
We must find the opal skull as soon as possible.

350
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,820
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

351
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,480
Morning.

352
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,170
Does your throat feel better?

353
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,370
I'll write a letter to the Baichuan Court.

354
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,140
I've solved three cases.

355
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,020
They must keep their promise.

356
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,190
I'd rather die than be humiliated like that again!

357
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,750
Wait. I…

358
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,380
Fox Spirit.

359
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,320
Guan.

360
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:46,970
Well,

361
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
what brought you here?

362
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,150
I'm here to visit you

363
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,710
and the impostor.

364
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,860
I know you want to know

365
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,530
the situation in the Yuanbao Villa.

366
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,030
You know what?

367
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,980
Zongzheng Mingzhu is worried

368
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,550
that someone may sneak the opal skull out

369
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
and searched me before letting me go.

370
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,220
Is he still

371
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,700
grilling Miss Zhiyu?

372
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,510
Yes.

373
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,200
He said he couldn't risk releasing a murderer.

374
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,940
He's still searching for the opal skull

375
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,380
in the Yuanbao Villa.

376
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,180
Everyone is cooperative.

377
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,660
They all want to find the murderer

378
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,800
and seek justice for Jin Mantang.

379
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,900
They're all very righteous.

380
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,360
But Butler Jin is in a bad mood.

381
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't know if it's because

382
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,190
he's grieving over Jin Mantang's death.

383
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,310
Since last night,

384
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,250
he's been devastated.

385
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,400
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

386
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,270
Were they so close?

387
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,350
I didn't expect you

388
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,520
to love flowers too.

389
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,860
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

390
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,370
You're a physician too.

391
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,460
You should know

392
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,350
the medical value of these flowers.

393
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,620
Li Lianhua.

394
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,720
What are you thinking?

395
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,580
It's the first time you came to my place.

396
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,120
Come.

397
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,410
I'll cook for you.

398
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,640
Not for you.

399
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,220
Li Lianhua,

400
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,260
you're actually such a great cook.

401
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,160
Eat.

402
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,060
You're not only a great physician

403
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,700
but also a well-mannered man

404
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,880
who's good at cooking.

405
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,350
Pork tripe with chicken.

406
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,620
Braised fish.

407
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,140
What's wrong with you?

408
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,420
I asked you to make them so many times but you never did.

409
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,600
Now you made them for her willingly.

410
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,940
So delicious.

411
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't be rude to the guest.

412
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,710
Slow down.

413
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,240
Guan.

414
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,740
To be honest,

415
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,420
now that we were kicked out of the Yuanbao Villa,

416
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,920
it's hard for us to continue with the investigation.

417
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,420
Since you can still go there,

418
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,280
why don't you

419
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,430
be our man on the inside?

420
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,240
What do you think?

421
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,440
Well…

422
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,130
I need to think about it.

423
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,420
After all, I'm a big name

424
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,080
in the martial world.

425
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,850
I don't do people favors just because they make lunch for me.

426
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,080
Miss Su,

427
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,050
why don't you give it a second thought?

428
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,890
Miss Su?

429
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,250
Who is that?

430
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,670
Guan Hemeng, the Miracle Healer with Needles,

431
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,500
is good at acupuncture.

432
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,460
When we arrived at the villa,

433
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,020
we saw you chasing someone with moxibustion tools.

434
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,020
That's not the treatment

435
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,590
Guan Hemeng would use.

436
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,460
When you first saw the body,

437
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
you didn't have any idea about the cause of death.

438
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,810
You were even surprised by the Tree Man Syndrome.

439
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,830
So I guess

440
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,370
you don't know medicine at all.

441
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,060
So?

442
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,420
The Yuanbao Villa is worldwide famous.

443
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,660
That's why

444
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,550
all the great physicians in the martial world are gathered there.

445
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,480
Everyone knows that.

446
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,230
You pretend to be Guan Hemeng

447
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,940
and no one came to blow your cover.

448
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,670
It means Guan Hemeng knows about it.

449
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,900
Anything else?

450
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,760
You mentioned Su Wencai before.

451
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,350
So my guess

452
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,920
is that you're Physician Guan's sworn sister,

453
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,020
Su Wencai's granddaughter,

454
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,140
Su Xiaoyong.

455
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,980
You're so smart.

456
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,870
Yes.

457
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,490
[Su Xiaomeng]

458
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,560
I'm Su Xiaoyong.

459
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,250
What?

460
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,930
You're a girl?

461
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,620
Yep.

462
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,390
You searched her bag

463
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,700
and groped her.

464
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,030
If the princess finds out,

465
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,670
how will you explain?

466
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,220
I didn't know…

467
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,890
Wait.

468
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,000
Why should I explain to the princess?

469
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,530
I never said I'd marry her.

470
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,500
That's nonsense.

471
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,010
That night, Jian Lingxiao

472
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
saw you sneaking out.

473
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,250
I guess you were going somewhere out of view

474
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,060
to wash up.

475
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,740
Yes.

476
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,730
I'm curious about the opal skull

477
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,870
so I came to see it.

478
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,570
I didn't expect to be recognized.

479
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,780
Li Lianhua.

480
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,140
Are you going to use my real identity to threaten me

481
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,870
into helping you?

482
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm not that kind of person.

483
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,400
I can help you,

484
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,080
not because I'm afraid that you'll expose me,

485
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,900
but because

486
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,790
I like you.

487
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,460
You…

488
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,260
I…

489
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,280
There is a rule in the Su family in Jinling.

490
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,230
The Su family's daughters don't give out gifts easily.

491
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,500
When we do,

492
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,010
the gift is a token of love.

493
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,850
You accepted my golden needles.

494
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,000
You're mine now.

495
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,300

496

Stop eating.

497
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,590
It's all because of him.

498
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,980
It's because I need to feed him

499
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,900
that I accepted those needles.

500
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,210
I'm an honest man.

501
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,290
Why would I do something like that?

502
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,300
So it's all your fault.

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,640

505

I think Miss Su is nice.

You won't lose anything.

507
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,420
Miss Su,

508
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,860
to be honest,

509
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm engaged.

510
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,970
Besides,

511
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,150
-I…
-He's not engaged.

512
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,550
He never mentioned it before.

513
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,850
And when he met you for the first time,

514
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
he said you two hit it off

515
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,960
and he hoped he'd met you earlier.

516
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,130
Really?

517
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,840
I'll be honest with you.

518
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,280
There's someone I love dearly.

But

520
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,010
she's already spoken for.

521
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,660
So I've made up my mind

522
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,230
to stay single all my life.

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,740
It would be humiliating

565
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,650
if I let you escape again.

566
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,130
Jian Lingxiao.

567
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,370
Li Lianhua is right.

568
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,620
You didn't make it the other night

569
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,820
and wouldn't give up so easily.

570
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,480
You've been biding your time outside the woodshed.

571
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,360
Jian.

572
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,360
My apologies.

573
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,560
We didn't mean to set you up.

574
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,580
So,

575
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,740
you've long found out that it's me.

576
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,420
How should I put it?

577
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,550
We didn't know it was you at first.

578
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,300
But I suddenly remembered

579
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,240
those pedals you stepped

580
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,090
under your feet outside your room.

581
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,200
Those fresh pedals

582
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,010
could be used as medicine

583
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,800
but you didn't care about them at all.

584
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,100
So you came to the Yuanbao Villa

585
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,740
with all those flowers

586
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,320
not because they could be used

587
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,150
as medicine.

588
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,290
You're right.

589
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,330
I noticed

590
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,050
a sting

591
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,540
on Jin Mantang's hand

592
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,840
but got distracted

593
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,850
by the blood under his nails.

594
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,200
So I didn't pay much attention to it.

595
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,890
Now I think about it,

596
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,960
those bees outside your room

597
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,490
were not there by accident.

598
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,850
You planted those flowers

599
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,430
to keep bees, right?

600
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,580
He does bring bees with him.

601
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,940
You set me up,

602
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,650
so you must know

603
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
that I don't have the opal skull.

604
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,150
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come after Guan Hemeng.

605
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,260
Yes.

606
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,610
He's right.

607
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,540
To be honest,

608
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,000
that night,

609
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,630
when I pretended to be Miss Zhiyu,

610
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,000
I found that you didn't want to kill her,

611
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,900
so it's clear

612
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,540
that you tried to snatch her away

613
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,780
because you wanted

614
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,020
to get the opal skull from her.

615
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,010
That's why he bought my words so easily.

616
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,420
I use flowers to keep bees.

617
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,280
But it was an accident that Jin Mantang got stung.

618
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,170
This kind of bee is called Black Tracker.

619
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,470
Sorcerers in Tianzhu keep them

620
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,140
to track down those they want to find.

621
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,800
I just want to find the opal skull.

622
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,500
Master Jin.

623
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,360
Open the door!

624
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:28,960
Master Jin.

625
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,300
I found a dead bee without its sting

626
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,160
outside Jin Mantang's room after he died.

627
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,730
Only then did I know that he got stung.

628
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,750
So,

629
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,750
Jin Mantang was killed by your poisonous bee.

630
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,040
However,

631
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,240
you didn't get the opal skull before he died.

632
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,620
This kind of bee

633
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,170
is just slightly poisonous.

634
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,040
Their venom doesn't work on humans.

635
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,940
We'll know whether the bee killed him

636
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,720
after examining the bee venom.

637
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm curious about something.

638
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,830
Jian, why do you

639
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,070
want the opal skull?

640
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,930
That's none of your business.

641
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,420
Don't you guys

642
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,580
want it too?

643
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,140
[Ci'an Hospital]

644
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,950
This bee is just slightly poisonous.

645
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,770
It can't kill anyone.

646
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,740
You didn't lie.

647
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,890
Now, can you tell me

648
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,740
why you want the opal skull?

649
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,470
I need it

650
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
to cure my son.

651
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,420
What's your son's illness?

652
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,060
You're the Ghost-feared Physician. Can't you cure him?

653
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,300
He has the Tree Man Syndrome.

654
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,720
So when I saw that Dong Ling

655
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,150
had the same nasty disease,

656
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,750
I was very surprised.

657
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
To be honest,

658
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,920
this disease is very rare.

659
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,130
It's a genetic condition

660
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,010
that passes from generation to generation.

661
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,920
A genetic condition?

662
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,620
My wife

663
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,890
died of this strange disease.

664
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,490
Now my son is suffering from it.

665
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,080
I don't want him

666
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,040
to die in pain like my wife.

667
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,590
I have to get the opal skull at all costs.

668
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,830
Jian,

669
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,790
how did you know the opal skull

670
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,400
can cure the Tree Man Syndrome?

671
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,810
I learned

672
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,780
that Jin Mantang used it

673
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,310
to get his condition under control.

674
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,990
You mean Jin Mantang also had this disease?

675
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,980
It's a rare disease.

676
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,090
Why did they all have it?

677
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,860
Could it be…

678
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,870
Yes.

679
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,430
My dead wife, Jin Yuzhu,

680
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,150
was Jin Mantang's half-sister.

681
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,240
Their father was a dissolute man

682
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,430
and had many love affairs.

683
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,030
My wife was an illegitimate daughter

684
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,840
and was never taken back to the Yuanbao Villa.

685
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,810
It seems

686
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,480
that Dong Ling

687
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,030
was related to the Jin family too.

688
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,990
That's also my guess.

689
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,640
I didn't expect

690
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,990
Jin Mantang to be so cold-hearted.

691
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,950
He'd rather watch his family die

692
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,820
than take out the opal skull.

693
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,560
I learned from Miss Zhiyu

694
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,770
that every few days,

695
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,140
Jin Mantang drank her blood from the opal skull

696
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,370
to suppress his symptoms.

697
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,750
It's so cruel

698
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,110
to hurt a girl like that.

699
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,970
Jian,

700
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,320
you're a kind physician.

701
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,700
I'm sure you can't bring yourself to do that

702
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,230
if you get the opal skull.

703
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,350
We're not making any progress.

704
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,440
It's not that bad.

705
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,320
At least we're sure

706
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,510
that Dong Ling

707
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,640
had been trapped

708
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,480
in that secret room since half a month ago.

709
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,620
Now we need to figure out

710
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,060
how he survived in the secret room.

711
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,400
Withered agave

712
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,180
can cause nausea

713
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,250
and weakness in legs and hands.

714
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,620
But Dong Ling broke the back of his head

715
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,570
and died from excessive bleeding.

716
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,970
Not on the day we arrived,

717
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,430
but since half a month ago.

718
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,310
Miss Su,

719
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,570
can you

720
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,670
do me another favor?

721
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,860
Why did you send Su Xiaoyong

722
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,020
back to the secret room?

723
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,120
We didn't find any clues there.

724
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,070
Do you count on her to find anything?

725
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,730
So I asked her to bring an assistant with her.

726
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,270
Assistant?

727
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,930
Here you are.

728
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,070
Look.

729
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,700
Bun crumbs?

730
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,420
So the assistant you brought with you

731
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,650
helped a lot.

732
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,390
Dude,

733
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,740
I'm counting on you.

734
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,110
Li Lianhua is so smart.

735
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,699
He thought of using a rat to find clues.

736
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,860
Fang Xiaobao.

737
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,360
You asked me why Dong Ling didn't starve to death

738
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,070
after being trapped there for so many days.

739
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,489
This is the answer.

740
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,139
Someone sent him food.

741
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,389
But wasn't Jin Mantang the only one

742
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,340
who could open the door of the secret room?

743
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,000
Is there…

744
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,000
Su Xiaoyong.

745
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,530
Did you find these crumbs

746
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,699
near the wall facing the courtyard?

747
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,350
How did you know that?

748
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,860
Is there an uneven place

749
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,300
somewhere high on the wall?

750
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,880
Yes!

751
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,530
There must be a vent

752
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,700
up there.

753
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,030
It's simple.

754
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,300
Someone sent food to Dong Ling

755
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,320
from that vent.

756
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,350
That's how he survived.

757
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,480
Later, to cover his tracks,

758
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,430
that guy blocked the vent again.

759
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,840
In that case,

760
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,890
the guy who helped Dong Ling is the most suspicious.

761
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,780
He helped Dong Ling stay alive

762
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,000
so that he and Jin Mantang could kill each other.

763
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,750
It's not that simple.

764
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,200
There are also cinders.

765
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,220
Cinders.

766
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,130
Food.

767
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,760
The blocked vent.

768
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,620
Did Dong Ling die of smoke inhalation

769
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,320
instead of poison?

770
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,320
Smoke?

771
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,100
The guy who sent him food

772
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,730
burned charcoal near the vent after his goal was achieved.

773
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,790
Dong Ling inhaled a lot of smoke.

774
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,310
After he fainted,

775
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,930
he hit his head

776
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
and died from excessive bleeding.

777
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,890
I've been confused about it.

778
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,610
Dong Ling was indeed wounded

779
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,510
by a poisonous arrow

780
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,890
but the wound was shallow

781
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,390
and Dong Ling had strong internal force.

782
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,620
How could a little bit of poison knock him out?

783
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,350
I didn't find traces of any other poisons,

784
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,380
so

785
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,660
I ignored it.

786
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,860
That's it.

787
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,280
Now we can explain

788
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,330
why Jin Mantang was wearing only one shoe.

789
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,790
The door of the secret room opens from the inside

790
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,450
with a formation instead of a key.

791
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
So Dong Ling

792
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,330
couldn't find a key

793
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
even if he searched Jin Mantang all over.

794
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,410
Keep your voice down.

795
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,770
That guy knew that he could send Dong Ling food

796
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,380
through the vent.

797
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,840
So he must be someone

798
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,020
living in the Yuanbao Villa.

799
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,420
You're right.

800
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,470
But there are so many servants

801
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,580
in the Yuanbao Villa.

802
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,450
Who could it be?

803
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:20,980
Li Lianhua.

804
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,980
Where are we going now?

805
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,790
Fang Xiaobao.

806
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,940
Have you forgotten

807
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,970
the cinders just now?

808
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,270
What's wrong with the cinders?

809
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Take a closer look at them.

810
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,370
They're soft and gray.

811
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,260
They're the cinders of silver coal.

812
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,300
So what?

813
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,820
It's not winter yet.

814
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,870
Coal

815
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,290
is kept in the warehouse now.

816
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,310
So who was the guy

817
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,290
stealing silver coal in this season?

818
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,740
The butler Jin Changbao.

819
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,610
He's the only one who has the key to the warehouse.

820
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,340
Yes.

821
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,350
Zongzheng Mingzhu searched the entire Yuanbao Villa

822
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,780
but couldn't find the opal skull.

823
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,220
Perhaps the opal skull

824
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,680
has never left

825
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,980
Jin Mantang's room.

826
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,670
I got it.

827
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,250
I'll go to the Yuanbao Villa now.

828
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,670
Wait!

829
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,140
I heard that you're guests of the Yuanbao Villa.

830
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,990
Here are the medicines

831
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,720
that Master Jin used to take.

832
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,620
For some reason,

833
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,150
Butler Jin hasn't come to take them.

834
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,170
Jin Mantang's medicines?

835
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,060
Yes.

836
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,300
Could you please take them

837
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,420
to the Yuanbao Villa for me?

838
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,120
The dose is different every day.

839
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,210
I've marked them.

840
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,480
Give them to me.

841
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,050
Okay.

842
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,440
Why are there two bags of every medicine?

843
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,350
At first,

844
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,050
one bag per day was enough.

845
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,370
Later,

846
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,500
Butler Jin said

847
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,700
Master Jin's condition worsened

848
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,790
and the physician they consulted suggested increasing the dosage.

849
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,030
So the dosage was doubled.

850
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,710
I've been keeping an eye on

851
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,490
the medicines Jin Mantang took.

852
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,910
Judging from the prescription,

853
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,630
it indeed helps with the Tree Man Syndrome.

854
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
But from what I could tell,

855
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,300
he didn't take two doses of medicine every day.

856
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,950
That's weird.

857
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,870
Butler Jin told me in person

858
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,240
to double the dosage.

859
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,820
Did Jin Changbao

860
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,670
come to take the medicines himself?

861
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,370
Yes.

862
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Butler Jin is loyal to Master Jin.

863
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,680
He did all these small things himself.

864
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,870
Li Lianhua.

865
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,890
Does…

866
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,100
Does Jin Changbao has the Tree Man Syndrome too?

867
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,250
Is he Jin Mantang's half-brother too?

868
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,490
[Yuanbao Villa]

869
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,380
The commander has banned

870
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,750
you two from entering.

871
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,720
We've found an important clue.

872
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,780
If you don't let us in

873
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,420
and cause the suspect to run away,

874
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,030
the Supervision Bureau will be held accountable.

875
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,020
We let you go last time

876
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,950
as a favor to Minister Fang.

877
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,290
Please leave.

878
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,830
You…

879
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,020
Li.

880
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,620
Fang.

881
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,100
Yang.

882
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,330
I heard that Zongzheng Mingzhu

883
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,360
is here with men from the Supervision Bureau.

884
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:55,950
I'm worried

885
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,240
so I came to check it out.

886
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,940
The Supervision Bureau

887
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,970
is now in the charge of a criminal.

888
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,550
I wonder

889
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,110
whether the founders of the Supervision Bureau

890
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,010
are turning in their graves.

891
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,440
Forget it.

892
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,300
We have other things to do.

893
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,580
But…

894
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,550
Something's wrong.

895
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,310
Something's wrong.

896
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,510
Deputy Commander Yang, something's wrong.

897
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,600
What happened?

898
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,190
The butler of the Yuanbao Villa, Jin Changbao,

899
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,400
hung himself.

900
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,610
How dare you come in?

901
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,550
Yang Yunchun?

902
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,170
Why did you collude with these two impostors

903
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
with ulterior motives?

904
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,080
I saw Miss Shi Shui from the Baichuan Court

905
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,420
assigning tasks to Fang Duobing.

906
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,670
He's not an impostor.

907
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,310
These two guys are suspicious

908
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,450
and I kicked them out.

909
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,540
You're just the deputy commander.

910
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,360
I'm your superior.

911
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,080
How dare you disobey my order?

912
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,410
I'm just the deputy commander

913
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,110
but I was granted the title of the Royal Dragon

914
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,110
and have the Royal Dragon Badge.

915
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,140
I can act independently.

916
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:55,640
You…

917
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,530
I heard

918
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,950
that something happened to Butler Jin.

919
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,610
If there's nothing else,

920
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,730
I need to go in for a check.

921
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,050
Fang Xiaobao.

922
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,550
He's much more powerful than the Baichuan Court.

923
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,380
What happened?

924
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,670
Why did he suddenly commit suicide?

925
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,160
Perhaps Butler Jin went mad

926
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,390
because he was too sad about Master Jin's death.

927
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,160
In the past few days,

928
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,400
he was either absent-minded

929
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,920
or very emotional.

930
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,740
He cried and laughed,

931
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,550
keeping mumbling things like "Why can't I?"

932
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,390
and "Why didn't it work?"

933
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,940
A few days ago,

934
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,750
I started treating Butler Jin's condition.

935
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,540
The needles on his head

936
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,960
were used by me

937
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,530
to alleviate his depression.

938
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,120
Unexpectedly,

939
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,010
after performing acupuncture on him,

940
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,310
I went out to prepare his medicine

941
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,390
and was told that Butler Jin killed himself.

942
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,930
What a pity.

943
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,050
It's indeed a pity.

944
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,550
We planned to ask him some questions.

945
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,210
Mr. Gongyang,

946
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,350
it seems

947
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,560
that I have to find the answers myself.

948
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:52,460
He…

949
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,360
Sure enough, Jin Changbao had the Tree Man Syndrome.
