[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,990
[Episode 31]

4
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,259
Li Lianhua.

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,560
You're awake.

6
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,050
It's indeed effective that Guan Hemeng asked me

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
to use Yangzhouman on you daily.

8
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,180
How do you feel?

9
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,730
This is Yunyin Mountain.

10
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,380
You should know the way here.

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,380
Do you know how to walk up the mountain?

12
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,259
I haven't been here for so long that I've forgotten the way.

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,610
Let's go. Hurry up.

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,630
I have something important to do.

15
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,010
Where are you going now?

16
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,860
Going up the mountain to ask Granny Qin to save your life

17
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,930
is the only important thing for now.

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,840
F-Find my master's wife?

19
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,020
Fang Xiaobao,

20
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,890
let me tell you the truth.

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm going to tell you the truth now,

22
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,660
but you may think I'm lying to you again.

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,160
Back then, I was so unfilial

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,990
and willful that I pissed my master off, leading to his death.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
Now you're taking me to see my master's wife.

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,320
What if I infuriate her

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,820
when she sees me?

28
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,910
Don't fool me.

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,930
Guan Hemeng said you...

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,470
Guan Hemeng?

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,450
Why would you believe Guan Hemeng, that quack?

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,360
He might not know the profound theory of Yangzhouman.

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,390
Besides,

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,750
everyone is afraid of death.

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm just an ordinary person.

36
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,410
Now you have Yangzhouman to protect you,

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
and you also know its strength.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,020
Let's go.

39
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,960
The more you talk, the more guilty you are.

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,770
I won't believe you no matter what you say.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,510
Now we're at the foot of the mountain.

42
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,810
I've made up my mind to walk up the mountain.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
If I can't make it,

44
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,070
I'll just spend my time with you here.

45
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,150
You can't go anywhere else.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,400
The Lord found that I'm a royal member of Nanyin.

47
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,710
Also, he asked about the Rama Vessel.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time for him to find

49
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,750
that I colluded with Wansheng Clan to set him up with Wuxin Huai.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,770
Snow Master, what do you think

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,130
the Lord will do to me?

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,620
Saintess,

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
aren't you ready?

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,710
How about

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,670
we go the whole hog?

56
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,940
Go the whole hog?

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,300
It's been more than ten years.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm already exhausted.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,880
He's still not into me.

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,700
Send a message to all our people

61
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,090
so that they will take action as soon as I order them to.

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,160
As for Zongzheng,

63
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,160
ask him to hand the Rama Vessel to me in person

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,470
once he gets it.

65
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,980
No one can be trusted.

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,880
Yes.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,000
Di Feisheng.

68
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,690
You forced me to do this.

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,100
Do you think you can win her heart

70
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,410
by stealing the Rama Vessel and Heavenly Ice?

71
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,360
After Jiao Liqiao finishes using you,

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,460
you'll only end up being torn apart.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,950
I have no intention of betraying you.

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,520
I... I was bewitched by the siren.

75
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,190
For the sake of the close relationship

76
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,080
between the Zongzheng family and the imperial court,

77
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,540
please spare my life.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
I've got my people all over the court.

79
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,040
Without you, a traitor,

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,140
what's the big deal?

81
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,380
Even if I didn't tell you,

82
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,930
you would have already noticed this fool.

83
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,270
Of course you won't let him

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
take action under your nose.

85
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,270
You told me

86
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,720
about the scheme between Zongzheng and Jiao Liqiao.

87
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,020
In other words,

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,340
compared to well-matched rivals,

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,560
you hate those who betray you more.

90
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm just giving them a taste of their own medicine.

91
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,650
You said you want to cooperate with the Wansheng Clan.

92
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,920
Are you trying to

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,830
collect the debt from the Wansheng Clan?

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,030
The victories and defeats are all in the past.

95
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,270
Since we want to cooperate,

96
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,700
let's not talk about the past anymore.

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,000
I established the Jinyuan Alliance for only one purpose.

98
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
It is to be the top martial artist.

99
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,180
The top of the martial arts world is what I want

100
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,680
but not what you want.

101
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm not interested in what you want.

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
Now both of us

103
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,900
each has a Rama Heavenly Ice.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,390
Without one of us, no one can open the Rama Vessel.

105
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,090
So you and I are the best partners for now.

106
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,970
Okay.

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,560
Di Feisheng.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,630
You're the one who cornered me.

109
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,980
Why don't I add more Wuxin Huai

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,550
and turn you into a good-for-nothing completely?

111
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,670
Di Feisheng.

112
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,180
Be good and wait for me to arrange everything for you.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,740
What's it like to breathe Wuxin Huai in?

114
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,730
My Lord.

115
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,470
I hate being set up the most in my life.

116
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,010
Ten years ago, in the battle at the East Sea,

117
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,790
you attacked the alliance with thundering fire bombs, right?

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,290
So you knew it.

119
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,190
The 12 Guardians were all dead.

120
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,070
The Jinyuan Alliance collapsed.

121
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,580
I fell into the sea after being seriously injured and stayed in seclusion for ten years.

122
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,030
You then took over the Jinyuan Alliance

123
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,490
step by step.

124
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,020
You have ambitions and means.

125
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,690
But today,

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,920
it's time to settle the score.

127
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,560
So you recall everything.

128
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,030
You liar!

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,010
It was my miscalculation.

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,170
Why didn't you ask me the reason I did it?

131
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,190
Why didn't you ask me

132
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,299
who I was scheming so hard for?

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,549
Don't say it's for me.

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,799
I insist on saying that.

135
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,280
The 12 Guardians

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,330
just joined the Jinyuan Alliance before me.

137
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,090
Their looks and means

138
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,300
were no match for me.

139
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,940
Why could they get to be around you?

140
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,510
When they looked at you more than a glance,

141
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,220
I would like to dig their eyes out.

142
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,510
If I didn't get rid of them,

143
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,700
how could you notice me?

144
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,120
The Sigu Sect and the Jinyuan Alliance had always been well-matched.

145
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,410
But all you cared about was

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,640
fighting against Li Xiangyi for the first place.

147
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,900
You knew I hated him the most,

148
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,660
but he was all you remember in this world.

149
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,520
What about me?

150
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,370
So I got rid of the Jinyuan Alliance

151
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
and Sigu Sect together.

152
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,660
Also, I got rid of Li Xiangyi for you.

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,980
Yes.

154
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,710
The arrangement was not perfect.

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,770
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

156
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,290
I would feel the same pain as you if you got hurt.

157
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,310
So I found you immediately and saved you.

158
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,360
When you went to seclusion to heal your injuries,

159
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,120
I found the most precious medicine for you.

160
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,110
I rebuilt the Jinyuan Alliance

161
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,010
and waited for you to come back.

162
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
I waited every day,

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
and I got back

164
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,470
everything you lost.

165
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,200
When the Rama Vessel is opened,

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,340
I'll give you the title of the top martial artists

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,190
that you want.

168
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,740
Di Feisheng.

169
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,770
No one in this world loves you more than I do.

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,780
Why don't you understand?

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
Why do you never appreciate it?

172
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
I can't accept

173
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,630
this kind of your affection.

174
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,760
Di Feisheng.

175
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,060
You'll always be mine.

176
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,090
Whether it's the Jinyuan Alliance

177
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,040
or the master of the martial arts world,

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,140
it's just that I don't want it,

179
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,460
not that I can't get it.

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,030
Di Feisheng.

181
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,030
You shouldn't have rejected me.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Arrest Di Feisheng.

183
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,110
But don't let him die.

184
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,500
My Lord.

185
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,670
All members of the Jinyuan Alliance have been eliminated.

186
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,350
Jiao Liqiao's Xianri Sedan

187
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,740
is also under our control.

188
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,940
Those who are stubborn have been executed.

189
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Only Snow Master escaped after hearing the news.

190
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,990
The Wansheng Clan has already figured you out.

191
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,200
Jiao Liqiao.

192
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,880
It's over.

193
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,500
Di Feisheng.

194
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,170
You're so cruel.

195
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,750
I just want you to look at me.

196
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,980
Is that wrong?

197
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,290
Is that wrong?

198
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,350
[Yunju Pavilion]

199
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
Yunju Pavilion?

200
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,590
It should be here.

201
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,950
Madam Qin.

202
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,380
I, Fang Duobing from Tianji Mountain Manor,

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,510
came to you because of an important matter.

204
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,340
Please allow us to see you.

205
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,680
Fang Duobing from Tianji Mountain Manor wants to see you because of an important matter.

206
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It seems that she's gone.

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,650
My master's wife

208
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,420
likes to travel around.

209
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,110
You can't predict when she will return.

210
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,740
She may not come back

211
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,030
even after a dozen years.

212
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,220
Let's go back first.

213
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,360
We can come back again

214
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,500
after the issue about Heavenly Ice is settled.

215
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,740
This is a big deal in the martial arts world.

216
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,210
All sects will be cautious about it.

217
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Don't worry about it since you're still unwell.

218
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,500
Besides,

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,190
didn't you always say that what happened

220
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,760
in the martial arts world had nothing to do with you?

221
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,250
Let's wait for Granny Qin here.

222
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,300
Don't go anywhere else.

223
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,820
You're not as gullible as you used to be.

224
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,720
Why are you walking in alone?

225
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,310
Li Lianhua.

226
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,340
Slow down.

227
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:12,750
[The memorial tablet of the late husband, Qi Mushan]

228
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,580
You like drinking.

229
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,870
Is it because of your master?

230
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,710
When my master was alive,

231
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,130
I never knew

232
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,130
what was good about drinking.

233
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,680
All I knew was to practice martial arts.

234
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,130
Master used to nag that

235
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,890
there are so many

236
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,960
intriguing things in life.

237
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
He said

238
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,190
I was too boring

239
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,070
because I always strived for victory.

240
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,980
Until I died once,

241
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,700
I realized,

242
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,960
Master,

243
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,600
what you said

244
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,790
is right.

245
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,660
I really regret it.

246
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,350
I really regret it.

247
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,290
Why didn't I

248
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,700
drink with you more often?

249
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,220
This must be the room of you and my father.

250
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,890
I guess this bed

251
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,260
belongs to my father.

252
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,940
How do you know?

253
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,020
Everyone knows that

254
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,360
Li Xiangyi is a genius in martial arts.

255
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,790
Geniuses don't need to memorise their moves.

256
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,740
My father must have been under great pressure

257
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,580
to practise martial arts with you.

258
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,740
My father collected a bunch of junk.

259
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,920
Senior.

260
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,210
You lost again.

261
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,340
Not enough. Come again.

262
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,660
I practice these moves

263
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,700
six to eight hours more than you do every day.

264
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,990
I don't believe I can't beat you.

265
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,140
These are all interesting things.

266
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,060
Senior.

267
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,550
The Silver Moon Crossbow from the Nangong family?

268
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Before this, I took only a glance at it because it was rare,

269
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,030
but I was blown away by the arrogant young master with a slap.

270
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,180
Where did you get it?

271
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,720
I got it by defeating him.

272
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,170
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

273
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,220
Who made this jade knife?

274
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,800
It's quite unique.

275
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,140
[To Senior]

276
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,820
To Senior?

277
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,900
Did you make it?

278
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,890
It's like that year,

279
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,220
I was obsessed with the self-made weapons.

280
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
This should be a knife I made for Senior

281
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,300
and a gift to him.

282
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,850
Maybe it was because I wasn't good at making knives.

283
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,080
It broke after being used a few times.

284
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,180
But this knife

285
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,180
has never been used.

286
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,250
The blade is still new.

287
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,540
It was broken deliberately.

288
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,040
Also,

289
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,430
why are all these damaged?

290
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,580
How could this happen?

I've heated up a bottle of wine for you.

312
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,250
Brat,

313
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,710
you're good at finding wine.

314
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,100
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

315
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,730
But it's worse to keep your feelings bottled up.

316
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,220
Come on.

317
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,260

Here.

320

Senior and I

321
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,030
were like brothers.

322
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,760
I thought

323
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,530
although we had different concepts,

324
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,100
it wouldn't affect the relationship between us.

325
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,860
Unexpectedly,

326
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,890
he hated me so much.

327
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,650
Have you never noticed this before?

328
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,790
In the past,

329
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,350
he always protected me.

330
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,180
He also helped me take a beating from our master.

331
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,730
At that time,

332
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,740
I had many ideas

333
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,490
and I was so stubborn.

334
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,380
Master always punished me.

335
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,460
When I was punished with kneeling,

336
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,940
Senior would give me candy secretly

337
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,870
and say he would rather be the one who got punished.

338
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,090
Later,

339
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,520
gradually,

340
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,300
Senior did take more and more punishments.

341
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,820
You are so flighty and impetuous.

342
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,910
You are not allowed to practise new moves today.

343
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,740
Go face the wall and ponder about your misdeeds.

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,070
Senior.

345
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,460
I won.

346
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,200
Master.

347
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,300
It's the same attack.

348
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,910
You can dodge it without using it.

349
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,570
Why did you do that just now?

350
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,880
Martial arts practitioners value sincerity the most.

351
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,750
If you lose the match on purpose,

352
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,520
you are not only looking down on your opponent

353
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,120
but also yourself.

354
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,310
I don't need you to lose on purpose.

355
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,220
Li Xiangyi.

356
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,380
Don't look down on me.

357
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,410
After that,

358
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,010
I never lost on purpose.

359
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,170
I thought

360
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,760
he wouldn't be angry anymore.

361
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,000
But he has been

362
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,810
hiding his feelings all along.

363
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,950
I just never realised it.

364
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,750
After that,

365
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,010
Madam and Master had a fierce fight and didn't give in to each other.

366
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,530
So they decided to make a bet

367
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,820
to see who can teach the better disciple.

368
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,620
The two of them drew lots.

369
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,990
I

370
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,940
followed Master.

371
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,370
Madam took senior away.

372
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,930
They had a deal.

373
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,540
The deal

374
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,420
was to compete once a month.

375
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,870
Since then,

376
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,720
my father lost to you every time.

377
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm afraid he hates you even more.

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,300
Maybe

379
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,350
I've never been right.

380
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,300
It's not your fault.

381
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,230
Life is about self-deliverance.

382
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Some can see past it,

383
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,680
but some can't.

384
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,860
When I was young,

385
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,850
I met Bhante Wuliao.

386
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,490
He always said I had no Bodhisattva tree in my heart.

387
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,610
At that time,

388
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,140
I was arrogant

389
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,100
and didn't take his words seriously.

390
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,200
But after thinking deeply, I realised

391
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,740
some people join the martial world

392
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
to cultivate their mind.

393
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,030
Some people enter the martial world

394
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,940
to cultivate a meaningful life.

395
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,050
But I don't know

396
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,160
what I really want.

397
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,650
Li Xiangyi is a martial arts genius.

398
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,960
No.1 in the world.

399
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,110
I don't know how others think of him,

400
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,320
but becoming someone like him

401
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,660
has been my dream since childhood.

402
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,140
I was shallow and superficial when I was younger.

403
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,380
Naturally the friends around me

404
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,190
were also like that.

405
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,060
But in my heart,

406
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,100
senior always held a special place.

407
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
But at the end of the day,

408
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,230
I never did my best in this relationship.

409
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,020
Then you should blame yourself.

410
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
In my opinion,

411
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,980
I should be the one reflecting on myself.

412
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,400
My mother once told me

413
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,040
getting along with others

414
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,060
is like drinking.

415
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,770
Cup after cup.

416
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,740
Each taking turns.

417
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,580
No matter more or less,

418
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,240
both parties have to drink to our will to enjoy it.

419
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,930
But I forgot

420
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,320
you and I

421
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,470
have already been honest with each other.

422
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,140
There's no need to show every inch of ourselves to each other.

423
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,250
That's how people get along as well.

424
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,860
Whether it's being caring,

425
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,530
or drinking together.

426
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,830
I've passed the obstacles and drunk the wine.

427
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,230
I don't think Madam

428
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,940
will be coming back anytime soon.

429
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,020
Instead of just waiting here,

430
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,340
why don't we

431
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,720
come another day?

432
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,180
She doesn't live here at all, does she?

433
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,660
Although the place has been kept clean,

434
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,540
there are no traces of anyone living here.

435
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
When I first came in,

436
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,770
I found pine needles on the ground

437
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,890
that didn't come from here.

438
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,420
I think

439
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,370
it must have been left behind by the people who come here to clean.

440
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,120
I did see the woods are full of pine trees

441
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
over there by the south peaks.

442
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,940
That must be

443
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,920
where Madam Qin really is.

444
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,980
How dare you fool around with something related your life?

445
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,520
It's getting late.

446
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,870
Come with me.

447
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,730
[Xiaoyuan City]

448
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,670
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

449
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,420
You even know about this place?

450
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
The people you have locked up here

451
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,540
are martial artists who have once followed you.

452
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,140
You tested poison on them,

453
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,020
tested medicine on them.

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
They were tortured beyond recognition by you.

455
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,100
If I were in your hands,

456
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,720
I would have ended up like this too.

457
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,170
You're wrong.

458
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,940
I love you so much.

459
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,470
How could I ever bear to leave you here,

460
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,460
with how much I love you?

461
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,960
Of course I will

462
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,810
keep you by my side forever.

463
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
I will feed you my strongest poison

464
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,420
until you beg me.

465
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,400
Until you beg me for my love.

466
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,220
You reap what you sow.

467
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,110
Take it, you lunatic.

468
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,180
Di Feisheng.

469
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,210
Do you really have the heart to leave me here?

470
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,030
My Lord.

471
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,630
My Lord, our intelligence network

472
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,420
that was taken control of by Jiao Liqiao

473
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,500
are being restored one by one.

474
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,740
The latest news that we have of Li Lianhua is that

475
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,060
he left Guan Hemeng Villa a month ago.

476
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,650
We don't know where he went after that.

477
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,810
Neither do we know

478
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,490
if he is alive or dead.

479
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,870
Go find the Styx Flower.

480
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,820
And tell Wansheng Clan,

481
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,700
Li Lianhua's life

482
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,520
is mine.

483
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,610
Yes.

484
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,720
Is this the place?

485
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,370
[Yunju Pavilion]

486
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,880
Who dares to trespass Yunju Pavilion?

487
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,660
I have made a vow,

488
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,740
to never leave these gates and see any outsiders.

489
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,460
Madam Qin,

490
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,880
I am Fang Duobing of Tianji Hall.

491
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,230
The one with me

492
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,900
is your disciple Li Xiangyi.

493
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,430
Please open the door.

494
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,140
Li Xiangyi has been dead for ten years.

495
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,360
But there are still so many people

496
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,510
that come here to try and trick me in his name.

497
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,450
I have nothing here you will find of interest.

498
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,160
Get lost.

499
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,280
Say something.

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,470
Fine.

501
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,860
I can only break in by force.

502
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,200
You should rethink about it.

503
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,040
Be aware of my arrow array.

504
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,050
Madam,

505
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,900
please show us mercy.

506
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,940
[Madam Qin]

507
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Xiangyi.

508
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,940
Where are you?

509
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,370
Madam.

510
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,680
It's you.

511
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
It's really the voice of Xiangyi.

512
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,560
Xiangyi?

513
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,090
This unfilial disciple

514
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,480
greets Madam.

515
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,460
Xiangyi.

516
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,590
Where have you been all these years?

517
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,610
Madam Qin,

518
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,730
Li Xiangyi was badly injured in the fight

519
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,630
with Jinyuan Alliance ten years ago.

520
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,350
Now he's been poisoned by Bicha Poison.

521
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
After enduring for all these years,

522
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,730
he doesn't have much time left.

523
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
Please help him.

524
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,750
Poisoned?

525
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,970
Let's talk inside. Let's go.

526
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,270
Is this boy your disciple?

527
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,400
He's talented.

528
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,740
Madam, he is not my disciple.

529
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,310
I didn't teach him anything too.

530
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,620
Come, sit down.

531
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:13,980
Xiangyi.

532
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
If your master knows, even in the netherworld

533
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,240
that you came back to Yunyin Mountain,

534
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,430
he would have been very happy.

535
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,050
You are his favorite disciple.

536
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,920
When he found out about what happened to you,

537
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,230
he was devastated.

538
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,180
He was in great pain.

539
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,040
He didn't want to see anyone.

540
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,860
He locked himself up

541
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,890
and told the public that he was practicing martial arts in seclusion.

542
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,380
But soon after,

543
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,630
he lost his mind and passed away.

544
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,610
After I recovered,

545
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,000
I came back once.

546
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,190
I was too ashamed to enter

547
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,290
when I learned the Master passed away.

548
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,490
Silly child.

549
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,390
This is the reason you didn't dare come back here?

550
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm unfilial

551
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,800
and caused him to suffer.

552
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,080
This is also our fault.

553
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,290
I fought with your master for half my life.

554
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,140
Only at the brink of death

555
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,050
did I realise

556
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,110
that I can't bear to leave him.

557
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,440
I can't bear to leave you too.

558
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,650
And Shan Gudao.

559
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,850
When all of you left,

560
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,580
now that I think back on it, I feel so regretful.

561
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,850
I made you suffer so much.

562
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,900
Madam,

563
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,820
I'm fine now.

564
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,210
That's good.

565
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,990
It's good that you're back.

566
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
I won't let you suffer anymore.

567
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
I know the method that

568
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,300
Guan Hemeng mentioned.

569
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,540
Don't worry.

570
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,110
I'll cure your poison.

571
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,420
Please don't think about it.

572
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,980
I don't want you to save me with your life.

573
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,900
Guan Hemeng told Fang Duobing that you can save me

574
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,270
because your inner power

575
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,350
is similar to mine.

576
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,130
But if you force the Bicha Poison

577
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,770
into your own body using your inner power,

578
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,820
it's just a life for a life.

579
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,970
Madam.

580
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
I don't want to do it.

581
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,620
If Master knew about this,

582
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,180
he would never agree.

583
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,860
Come on, child. Get up.

584
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,130
Get up first.

585
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,870
Xiangyi, if your master knows in the netherworld,

586
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,240
he would have agreed for me to do it.

587
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,550
Even if he is alive,

588
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,270
he will also save you with his life,

589
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,660
because your parents are his saviors.

590
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,890
I am repaying kindness for your master

591
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,460
by saving you today.

592
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,060
Li Xiangyi.

593
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,179
What are you doing?

594
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,980
Are you going to kill yourself in front of me?

595
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,120
Madam.

596
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,130
Everyone has his own fate.

597
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,179
There are things that you don't need to force.

598
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,650
How can I feel at ease?

599
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,659
How can Master feel at ease?

600
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,060
Fine.

601
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,739
If you don't want us to save you,

602
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,050
then stay here and recuperate.

603
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,710
and let me take care of you.

604
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,739
Madam.

605
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,770
There are still some things

606
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,960
that need to be settled by myself.

607
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,260
You need to let me give you some of my Genuine Qi

608
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,900
so that you can protect yourself at critical times.

609
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,460
Also,

610
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,410
can you fool

611
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,120
the one standing there?

612
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,910
So please

613
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,300
keep it a secret for me.

614
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,820
How are you?

615
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,140
I'm fine now.

616
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,690
The poison has just been cleared. He is not allowed to fight.

617
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,010
You're alright now?

618
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
The poison has been cleared and everything is fine?

619
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,620
It's all thanks to your Granny Qin.

620
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,330
Now my inner power

621
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,320
has just recovered twenty or thirty percent.

622
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,340
Yes.

623
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,540
That's why we need to take good care of him.

624
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,820
It's my fault.

625
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,640
I was too happy to care about anything else.

626
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,820
Thank you for reminding me.

627
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,440
In my opinion,

628
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,470
since Madam Qin can clear this Bicha Poison,

629
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,780
why didn't you come back earlier?

630
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,650
I'm just lucky.

631
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Madam used years

632
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,310
of her power to create an antidote

633
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,430
in her earlier years.

634
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,280
Now the poison was only removed

635
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,170
together with the help of her inner power.

636
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,010
That's why I'm recovering well now.

637
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,030
Right, Madam?

638
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,580
I see.

639
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,900
Yes.

640
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,750
I spent

641
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,380
more than ten years

642
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,880
to make this antidote.

643
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,900
Just this one and you've used it.

644
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,540
Don't forget your promise.

645
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,340
I'll give you one month

646
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,690
to go down the mountain and settle your affairs.

647
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,380
You must come back to inherit the sect afterwards.

648
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,200
No other allowances.

649
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,980
Got it, Madam.

650
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,490
Why do you need to promise her?

651
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,500
Do you see why I don't come back?

652
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,020
As you can see,

653
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,080
my Madam's temperamental.

654
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,050
She asked me to inherit the sect as soon as I came back.

655
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,320
I have to stay in Yunyin Mountain.

656
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,340
Although I survived,

657
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,030
but I lost my freedom.

658
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,960
Anyway,

659
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,670
your health always comes first.

660
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,770
As long as you are well, there is still hope.

661
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,020
Besides,

662
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,840
she didn't tell you

663
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,660
that you must stay in Yunyin Mountain forever.

664
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,300
Speaking of the sect.

665
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,410
Fang Duobing.

666
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,290
You are now a descendant of Yunyin Mountain.

667
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,810
Why don't you kowtow to your Granny Qin,

668
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,410
and well your master, me and serve me tea today?

669
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,140
From now on, Yunyin Mountain will depend on you.

670
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,660
It was just a joke when I said I wanted to be your disciple.

671
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,620
How can you take it seriously?

672
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,340
You brat, are you trying to deny it?

673
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,380
I remember you said you were my disciple

674
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,340
when we first met at Lingshan.

675
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,070
What a joke.

676
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,190
Given my age, you want me to kowtow to you?

677
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,100
In your dreams!

678
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,140
Don't try to deny it.

679
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,690
What are you doing here,

680
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,750
not resting properly?

681
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,260
Have a taste.

682
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,550
This porridge

683
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,910
is made from Tofieldia Thibetica of Yunyin Mountain.

684
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,860
It's good for your injury.

685
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,690
Injury?

686
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,520
Just eat it.

687
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,660
Stop talking.

688
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,620
It tastes good today.

689
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,850
When did it taste bad?

690
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,870
Are you really not going back to your past identity?

691
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,400
Fang Xiaobao.

692
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,340
Look at Yunyin Mountain.

693
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,340
The young sprouts grow and the new trees grow.

694
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,410
The martial arts world is the same.

695
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,670
Who can explain

696
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,390
what will happen in the future?

697
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,740
There's so much hustle and bustle in the martial arts world.

698
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,230
There will always be new legend.

699
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,860
Young Master Fang,

700
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,390
there are few empty rooms on the mountain.

701
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,060
This is where Shan Gudao lived when he practiced martial arts.

702
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,450
Please bear with it.

703
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,620
Madam Qin,

704
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,640
what kind of person is he?

705
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,820
Back then, he and Li Xiangyi founded Sigu Sect together.

706
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,450
But people in the martial world

707
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,100
seem vague on their opinions of him.

708
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,600
Shan Gudao looks easy-going on the surface,

709
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,650
but he's willing to hide himself.

710
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,660
He's actually a very competitive person.

711
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,620
He is not quite tolerant of others.

712
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,130
In his fight with Li Xiangyi that year,

713
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,010
he was willing to use

714
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,340
whatever it takes to win, even unorthodox methods.

715
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,040
He passed early.

716
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,220
It's my fault

717
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,770
I didn't bring him to a broader path.

718
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,470
It's getting late.

719
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,500
Rest early.

720
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,370
Thank you, Madam Qin.

721
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,460
[Yunyin Mountain]

722
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,500
Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

723
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,250
Asura Grass, Wuxin Huai, Karmic Bug.

724
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,100
These were passed down the royal family of Nanyin.

725
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,430
The night before Nanyin was overturned,

726
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,840
Princess Longxuan married Crown Prince Fangji

727
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,020
and became Consort Xuan.

728
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,990
Consort Xuan secretly initiated the revival of Nanyin

729
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,040
and plotted using the Rama Vessel.

730
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,700
The imperial clan prince conspired and killed Emperor Xicheng,

731
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,210
and the Empress of Prince Fangji declared herself as the Emperor.

732
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Consort Xuan was sentenced to be buried with Prince Fangji.

733
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,460
Rama Heavenly Ice and Emperor Guangqing.

734
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,230
These should be my father's handwriting as well.

735
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,080
It seems that he had been investigating

736
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,900
Nanyin when he was in Yunyin Mountain.

737
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,300
So, he has been investigating these.

738
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,060
The answer is in this box.

739
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
There's a lock

740
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,980
and self-destruction mechanism.

741
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,250
I dare not try it.

742
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,500
This is Nanyin Script.

743
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,260
Yes.

744
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,540
This patterns are the same as the one on Consort Xuan's grave.

745
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,460
It should be her symbol as the Princess of Nanyin.

746
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,310
Since it's her private belongings,

747
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,560
try her birthday.

748
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,030
[In the year of Ren Yin, Wu Shen month, Geng Jia day, at the hour of Geng Chen.]

749
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,030
[Princess Longxuan]

750
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,250
There's even a translation manual.

751
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,170
To the magician.

752
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,790
This is

753
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,680
a letter from Consort Xuan to magician Feng Ah Lu.

754
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,850
Miss Su said

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,500
Nanyin magicians are the ones

756
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,790
in charge of keeping and controlling the Karmic Bugs.

757
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,390
I married the Crown Prince of Fangji with hatred.

758
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,020
I had already settled in the Central Plains,

759
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,620
but I misplaced my trust in the bad guys.

760
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,210
The imperial clan prince fought for the crown with Crown Prince Fangji,

761
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,190
so I was incarcerated with Crown Prince Fangji

762
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,290
and have no chance of survival.

763
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,760
I can only try my best to send my son to safety

764
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,210
I hope that you will think of  continuing the Nanyin royal bloodline

765
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,670
and hurry to the bamboo forest outside the city to meet my son.

766
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,830
Contact Jin, Yu, Huang, Quan

767
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,180
to fulfill my unfinished wish

768
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,940
and restore the country of Nanyin.

769
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,580
Consort Xuan has been trying to revive Nanyin

770
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,690
and set up such a powerful foundation.

771
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,680
But this Feng Ah Lu

772
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,510
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

773
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,350
The wealth acquired to revive Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

774
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,760
were divided by Jin, Yu, Huang, Quan.

775
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,800
Maybe something happened.

776
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,820
But now,

777
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,410
the descendants of Consort Xuan

778
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,470
must have been found by the people of Nanyin,

779
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,180
otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

780
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,340
You mean

781
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,460
my father is the descendant of Consort Xuan,

782
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,410
the royal bloodline of Nanyin?
