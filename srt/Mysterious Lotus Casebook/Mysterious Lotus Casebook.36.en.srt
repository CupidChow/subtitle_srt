[Episode 36]

4
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,590
As expected, you still want to stay in the palace.

5
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,370
Are you here to convince me not to?

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,990
I can't change Master's mind,

7
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,410
but I trust

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you're just unable to disobey your master's order.

9
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,380
I can only help you as much as possible.

10
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,530
Thank you, Lord Yang.

11
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,979
That will suffice.

12
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
Do you really know magic?

13
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,329
Of course not.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
How did you know about the rain in Yuzhou?

15
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,579
This news

16
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,230
was only delivered today.

17
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,660
I was just lucky.

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,820
I went to buy some vegetables before entering the palace that day.

19
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,890
I happened to meet a vegetable farmer.

20
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,880
He told me that there's heavy mist in the mountains.

21
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,280
The north wind started up,

22
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,540
so the mist would float to Yuzhou.

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,460
When this kind of weather occurs in the winter,

24
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,790
it will definitely rain.

25
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,300
An important figure like you

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,460
still cares for the commoners.

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,520
I admire you.

28
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,220
What important figure?

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,730
We still need to eat vegetables and porridge.

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,490
By the way, Lord Yang,

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,650
later,

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,950
you must do me a favor.

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,400
What is it?

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,510
Eunuch Wang.

35
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,100
Imperial Preceptor.

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
What is this place?

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,540
It's just a wasteland that has been abandoned for 100 years.

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,010
Let's go on.

39
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,000
Wait.

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
I think this place has great feng shui.

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,500
It has the potential to be the site of a pagoda.

42
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,390
This place...

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,210
It's a place of bad luck in the palace.

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,780
Imperial Preceptor, are you mistaken?

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,820
No.

46
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,180
This place is just deserted,

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,590
but there are treasures hidden throughout.

48
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,420
Well, Imperial Preceptor,

49
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,950
I am speaking the truth.

50
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,220
This was where the late Empress Dowager Kang Xian lived.

51
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,860
Later, many servants went missing.

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,380
Only their mangled corpse could be found.

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,980
Someone also saw...

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,980
Saw what?

55
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,610
A monster with two heads,

56
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,890
the fabled beast, Ni Tianhou.

57
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,680
As time went by, this place became deserted.

58
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,570
Even the night patrol guards avoid this place.

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,660
It's indeed a place of evil.

The wise come in different appearances.

63
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,540
The same goes for the auspicious places.

64
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,740
When the pagoda is created,

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,750
the feng shui can be changed.

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,959
This will become the most auspicious place in the palace.

67
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,820
The four of you from the Ministry of Industry,

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,300
take a look here.

69
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,010
See which area's soil is suitable for building a pagoda.

70
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,650
Yes.

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,340
Imperial Preceptor,

72
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,930
you must be thirsty after walking all this way.

73
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,650
Here,

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,850
have some water.

75
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,700
Your Sky-covering Palm is extraordinary.

76
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,720
But

77
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,050
it's impolite to steal my instrument.

78
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,140
Lord Yang was afraid

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,640
that the water would stain your instrument.

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,600
So, he wanted to hold it steadily for you.

81
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,710
Physician Li, don't act so clever.

82
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,370
You might give yourself away

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,760
and get kicked out of the palace.

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,980
All your efforts would be in vain.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,210
Physician Li,

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,900
the Imperial Preceptor is tired.

87
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,470
I invite you to rest in the outer palace too.

88
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,980
You may enter the palace tomorrow.

89
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,130
Outer palace?

90
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,520
Sect Leader Li,

91
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,130
what should we do next?

92
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,880
Next...

93
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Aren't we looking for the child bugs?

94
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,360
But there was nothing

95
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,050
in the Demon Monk's instrument.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,510
What should we do next?

97
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,470
The child bugs are already dead.

98
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,060
Dead?

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,710
When you attacked,

100
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,550
he immediately protected the bell on his waist.

101
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,540
I am guessing

102
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,700
the child bugs were there.

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,260
They should be dead now.

104
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,250
You sprinkled this?

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,650
This is...

106
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,270
Snow salt?

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,510
Snow salt is so precious.

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
How did you get it?

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,820
It's just a coincidental gift from an old friend.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,860
Lord Yang,

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,540
have you noticed

112
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
the four men from the Ministry of Industry?

113
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,200
They seemed a bit timid,

114
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,830
but there's nothing special about them.

115
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,350
Yes.

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,100
Those four craftsmen

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,400
only listened to the demon monk's orders.

118
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,230
The child bugs probably

119
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,880
helped the Demon Monk find that abandoned garden.

120
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
It means that the mother bug is nearby.

121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
But the Demon Monk

122
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,220
wanted the four craftsmen to search for him.

123
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,420
He probably

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,220
only confirmed this general direction.

125
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,260
So,

126
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,850
we have to look for the rest.

127
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,140
You mean

128
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,400
those four craftsmen know where the mother bug is?

129
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,510
Did you notice

130
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,690
the four craftsmen have no beard?

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,920
Come on, don't just eat.

132
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,360
Come, drink up.

133

are all the craftsmen from the Ministry of Industry here?

155
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,360
we find a way to escape?

Sect Leader Li, don't act rashly.

The Wansheng Clan has their eyes on here.

161
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,300
I've found out the backgrounds of the four men.

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
As you expected,

163
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,840
they were eunuchs in the palace over ten years ago.

164
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,680
They are now living in different places.

165
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,500
The Wansheng Clan found them

166
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,679
and sent them to the palace as craftsmen of the Ministry of Industry.

167
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,059
Why were the eunuchs

168
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,059
kicked out of the palace?

169
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,419
They committed crimes of theft.

170
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,140
They stole?

171
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,750
Shouldn't they be executed?

172
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,940
That's the strange part.

173
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,150
Many precious items

174
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,270
were found on them at the time,

175
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,720
but they insisted

176
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,620
they found it from a corpse in the wasteland.

177
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,460
When the Imperial City Division went to investigate,

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,570
they indeed found a corpse.

179
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Its body was broken and limbs were incomplete.

180
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,370
It couldn't have been caused by humans.

181
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,500
It was more like a tiger or wolf that caused it,

182
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,540
but the Beast Garden is outside the palace.

183
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,660
How could wild beasts come to the inner palace?

184
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,090
There were indeed treasures around the body.

185
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,920
Their testimonies became credible.

186
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,340
Was the one who died also a palace eunuch?

187
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,480
Yes.

188
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,210
In that case,

189
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,400
I think the five committed theft together,

190
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,650
and killed one due to the uneven distribution of spoils.

191
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,120
Master suspected that as well,

192
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,620
but the treasures found were not in this dynasty's style.

193
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,460
Rather, they were from 100 years ago.

194
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,180
When treasures in the palace were checked,

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,610
nothing was found missing.

196
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,330
Without any evidence,

197
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,860
they could only kick them out of the palace.

198
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,460
Treasures from 100 years ago

199
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,900
suddenly appeared

200
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,580
next to a corpse.

201
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Don't you think that's strange?

202
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,760
Do you know where exactly

203
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,450
the treasures came from?

204
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,750
It's hard to trace the gold and silver,

205
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,240
but there was a jade Buddha statue

206
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,070
received by Emperor Guangqing as tribute 100 years ago.

207
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,130
It is said to be worshiped in the Pagoda of Bliss.

208
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,420
The Pagoda of Bliss?

209
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,740
I heard from Empress Dowager that

210
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,900
Emperor Guangqing built it to pray for a son,

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,580
but His Majesty said it’s not true.

212
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,150
It's just a rumor.

213
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,680
Does the Pagoda of Bliss

214
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,090
really exist or not?

215
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,460
According to the old people in the palace,

216
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,620
Emperor Guangqing had no children back then.

217
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,210
Later, the Pagoda of Bliss was built.

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,670
Consort Ying soon became pregnant with a prince and became the empress.

219
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,850
But somehow,

220
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,730
the Pagoda of Bliss vanished overnight.

221
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,210
Vanished?

222
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,080
Yes.

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,480
In one night,

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
not a single piece of tile remained

225
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,510
where the pagoda originally stood.

226
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,200
The Pagoda of Bliss?

227
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,680
The Pagoda of Bliss is missing!

228
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,790
The Pagoda of Bliss is gone!

229
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,420
The palace forbade it from being mentioned afterward.

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,710
It became a mystery.

231
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,990
Legend has it that this pagoda contained heavenly fortune.

232
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,960
After the fortune was exchanged for a prince,

233
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,490
the heavens took the pagoda back.

234
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,050
But everyone in the palace

235
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,190
knew the pagoda had been built.

236
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,570
There must be clues left behind.

237
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,590
There is no record in the palace.

238
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,520
However,

239
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,930
back then,

240
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,720
I found a draft of a pagoda

241
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,330
in the hands of Eunuch Wu, who served Emperor Guangqing.

242
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,570
Eunuch Wu loved poetry.

243
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,720
The picture was inside a book.

244
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,180
But...

245
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,760
I don't know if it's the Pagoda of Bliss.

246
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,790
Look.

247
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,870
The Pagoda of Bliss.

248
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,450
The mother bug is hidden in the missing pagoda.

249
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,320
Why did Shan Gudao search for these four eunuchs?

250
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,210
Because these four eunuchs

251
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,780
had gone to the Pagoda of Bliss.

252
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
We can't escape.

253
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,820
How about we tell them?

254
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,770
You're not afraid of dying?

255
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,310
It can't follow us forever.

256
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,250
Monster!

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,630
Help! There's a monster!

258
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,820
Monster!

259
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,460
Ghost!

260
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,120
What monster?

261
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,760
Ni Tianhou appeared again!

262
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,580
Don't kill me!

263
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,270
I didn't say anything.

264
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,970
I didn't say anything.

265
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,430
What did you say?

266
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,580
Who is trying to kill you?

267
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,970
These men said Ni Tianhou is back.

268
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,640
Have you

269
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,630
seen this monster before?

270
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,010
Before, we...

271
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,530
Before...

272
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,150
Shut up!

273
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,580
Sect Leader Shan, you came just in time.

274
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,020
Junior,

275
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,120
you tried so hard to get them to speak,

276
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,630
but you can't get anything out, can you?

277
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,820
Oh, you.

278
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,850
You always do futile things.

279
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,860
The style of this robe

280
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,220
is from the imperial family 100 years ago.

281
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,810
No one wears it anymore.

282
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
A hundred years ago?

283
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,900
Is it really a ghost?

284
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,050
The design is old,

285
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,260
but the fabric is new.

286
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,100
This robe contains

287
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,940
a putrid smell.

288
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,220
It must be the smell of beast blood.

289
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,350
It seems

290
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,080
someone is playing tricks behind the scenes.

291
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,750
It's the Wansheng Clan again.

292
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,470
What I don’t understand is

293
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,620
the Wansheng Clan found these four people

294
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,560
to search for the Pagoda of Bliss.

295
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,940
But then,

296
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,060
why would they cause a commotion?

297
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,460
Shan Gudao said I tried my best to get words out of them.

298
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,470
He must think

299
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,480
that I'm behind this bloody robe and beast.

300
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,620
It seems there's a third person behind this.

301
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,500
Who is he?

302
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,740
Why did he do this?

303
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,710
It was Li Lianhua.

304
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,310
He deliberately splashed water in the daytime

305
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,870
but actually froze the child bugs with snow salt.

306
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,900
Now he got a bloody robe.

307
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,450
We can't get rid of him.

308
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,310
He's very difficult to deal with.

309
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,740
Should I kill him?

310
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
-No.
-Don’t ruin the plan.

311
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,770
We can't kill him now.

312
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,550
He showed his face to the emperor.

313
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,150
If we kill him now,

314
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,420
we'll alert the enemy.

315
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,880
He is no longer the Li Xiangyi

316
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,490
who commanded the martial arts world before.

317
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,780
Where did he

318
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,650
get this expensive snow salt?

319
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,220
We haven't found the mother bug,

320
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,500
but the child bugs died.

321
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,260
Those four idiots don't dare to tell us

322
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,360
where the entrance was.

323
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,770
How do we find the Pagoda of Bliss?

324
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,140
We'll use some means to force them to speak tomorrow.

325
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,980
We can't wait any longer.

326
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,900
[White Jade Academy]

327
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,520
[East Hall]

328
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,690
What?

329
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,400
You still can't tell which area is the best?

330
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,270
Well,

331
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,180
we need to look further.

332
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,060
We need to check more carefully.

333
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,340
Eunuch Wang,

334
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,960
to prevent evil disturbances when the soil is moved,

335
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,950
put these black-iron flags in the corners of the abandoned palace

336
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,580
to suppress the evil spirits.

337
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,220
That's great.

338
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,180
Let's go.

339
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,210
Since I brought you all in the imperial city,

340
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,490
it means I know everything about you all.

341
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,980
Starting today, I will kill

342
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,730
one of your family members

343
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,100
each day

344
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,790
until you speak.

345
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,210
Please spare us.

346
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,060
There really is a monster!

347
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,310
People will die if we speak nonsense.

348
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,780
If you tell the truth,

349
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,540
you will die.

350
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,079
If you don't tell me,

351
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,660
both you and your family will die.

352
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,260
Lu Fang,

353
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,710
you still have

354
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,270
an 80-year-old mother waiting for you at home.

355
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,940
I...

356
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,910
Do you want her to die?

357
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,069
How do you want her to die?

358
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,940
Beheaded,

359
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,960
drowned in the river,

360
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,060
or dismembered?

361
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,580
Tell me.

362
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,840
Don't kill me.

363
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I know nothing.

364
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,900
Spare me!

365
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,140
Ni Tianhou eats people who steal from the Pagoda of Bliss.

366
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,090
Where else do you want to escape to?

367
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,810
I entered the Pagoda of Bliss with the others.

368
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,900
I am not the main culprit.

369
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,680
Don't kill me.

370
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,020
-Don't kill me!
-Where is the Pagoda of Bliss?

371
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,370
It's...

372
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,580
Physician Li.

373
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,210
What happened?

374
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:56,810
Physician Li,

375
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,840
didn't you get sick?

376
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,960
Why are you here again?

377
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,700
I gave myself some medicine.

378
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,380
I'm much better now.

379
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,680
Thank you for helping me request for leave.

380
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,250
You don't care about your health,

381
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,660
but you always trouble yourself.

382
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,130
Thank you for your concern.

383
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,670
It's troublesome recently.

384
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,260
My opponents are always

385
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,560
those who've become well-known decades ago.

386
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,620
Crazy Knife, Fatal Five Fists, and Bone-gnawing Spear

387
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,850
are each more difficult than the last.

388
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,780
Who's next?

389
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,800
I'll continue to accept the duel.

390
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,270
Xiangyi Swordplay.

391
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,230
This is the sword of Li Xiangyi’s Master.

392
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,000
I have to go against Li Xiangyi's master.

393
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,620
You will never win

394
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,890
this final battle.

395
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,060
No.

396
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,850
I can't get through this.

397
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,150
Give up.

398
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,650
I'm not Li Xiangyi.

399
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,610
I can't defeat Qi Mushan.

400
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,410
There will always be a new legend.

401
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,630
Maybe

402
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,140
you'll be the next new legend.

403
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
The Xiangyi Swordplay and Yangzhouman are compatible.

404
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,660
The internal energy forms the structure of the sword technique.

405
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,620
The sword technique is the soul of the internal energy.

406
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,610
Li Xiangyi's martial arts had accumulated

407
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,430
since childhood.

408
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,980
That's why his body and soul were unified

409
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,220
and he could move freely

410
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,700
to defeat his master.

411
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,360
What about me?

412
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
Where is Shan Gudao?

413
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,690
Take him down!

414
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,930
What kind of martial arts is this?

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,810
The newly created Mr. Worried's Swordplay.

416
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,560
Let me ask you again.

417
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,290
Where is Shan Gudao?

418
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,540
I don't know.

419
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,460
Master...

420
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,270
Master is in the palace.

421
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,210
He went to the palace too?

422
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,310

428
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,180
Thank you.

429
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,580
I didn't expect Shan Gudao to be so skilled.

430
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,190
If he hadn't restrained himself in the palace this morning,

431
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,730
he would've caught us.

432
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,830
How is it?

433
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,220
Did you get anything today?

434
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,450
Did the four of them not return?

435
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,080
Didn't they leave the palace with you?

436
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,270
The craftsmen had to do roll-call with the Ministry of Industry,

437
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,490
so they were taken away.

438
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
It seems that Shan Gudao

439
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,250
wanted to hide these four people.

440
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,310
Lord Yang,

441
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,630
does the Ministry of Industry have a special station in the inner palace?

442
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,020
The inner palace is for the imperial family.

443
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080
How could the Ministry of Industry be here?

444
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,340
However, there is a Shanyi Workshop

445
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,870
where various materials are stored,

446
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,860
but it's not a place for people to live in.

447
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,820
These people were planted by the Ministry of Industry.

448
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,590
They must be hidden in the Shanyi Workshop.

449
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,020
I don't think Shan Gudao can wait any longer.

450
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,390
That's why he's doing everything he can

451
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,780
to find the whereabouts of the Pagoda of Bliss.

452
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,170
I must be one step ahead of him.

453
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,380
Who are you?

454
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,980
I wish to see Dian Qiu, Imperial Guard Commander.

455
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,660
I am Dian Qiu.

456
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
You are?

457
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,070
I can only bring you to the palace,

458
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
but I can't guarantee you can walk around freely.

459
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,540
There are many hidden guards in the palace.

460
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,420
Be careful.

461
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:16,920
Don't worry.

462
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,000
Even if I get caught,

463
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,010
I'll say I climbed over the wall by myself.

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,320

Monster.

468
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,910
We should have spoken earlier.

469
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,640
If we spoke when we recognized that osmanthus tree on the first day,

470
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,460
we might be on our way back now.

471
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,060
Even if we did,

472
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,510
will the monster let us go?

473
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,300
Don't forget,

474
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,220
we witnessed

475
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,930
how Xue Kuan was torn into pieces by that monster.

476
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,130
Don't mention Xue Kuan.

477
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,360
He accidentally

478
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,390
found the Pagoda of Bliss when he was drunk.

479
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,440
Just because he coveted the treasures inside,

480
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,790
he incited us to transport the treasures together.

481
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,850
That's why we went there.

482
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,010
But we only transported a few pieces,

483
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,540
went in and out a few times,

484
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,500
and we saw

485
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,020
he was bitten to death by the monster.

486
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,380
That robe floated

487
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,190
behind that monster.

488
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,870
A voice also threatened us

489
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,970
not to leak the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss.

490
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,540
We've kept our mouth shut for so many years

491

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,140
as soon as we got here.

495

Let's not talk about it.

496
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,710
Most of the treasures

497
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,360
were taken away by the Imperial City Division.

498
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,200
We only hid a few pieces and brought them out.

499
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,280
All these years, we never dared to sell them.

500
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,040
I only sold one,

501
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,670
and someone found out and brought us here.

502
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,130
It's all my fault.

503
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,440
Let's tell him.

504
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,630
But what about the monster?

505
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,840
Although it's scary,

506
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,260
it will only kill us.

507
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,980
But the Wansheng Clan

508
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,780
can do anything.

513
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,850
I remember now.

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,020

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,670
to investigate this case

564
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,900
and redeem yourself.

565
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,820
Leave now!

566
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,240
Fang Xiaobao,

567
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,430
thank you.

568
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,140
I asked you to stay in Tianji Mountain Manor to save you,

569
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,780
but you actually came to the palace.

570
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,760
I heard that something happened to you as soon as I arrived.

571
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,280
I asked Princess Zhaoling

572
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
to beg Her Majesty

573
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,080
and finally got this decree.

574
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,000
Do you really think you have nine lives?

575
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,410
Calm down.

576
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,230
Actually, there's another advantage

577
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,420
to me being here.

578
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,740
It happens that

579
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,840
no one will disturb me.

580
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,540
I can organize my thoughts well.

581
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,090
I don't want to argue with you,

582
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,160
as long as you're safe.

583
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,080
By the way,

584
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,480
I heard Shan Gudao came to the imperial city.

585
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm afraid it's for the mother bug too.

586
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,900
I

587
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,220
met him a few times.

588
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,850
I've asked Yang Yunchun about the palace matters.

589
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,210
He thinks Shan Gudao set you up,

590
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,640
but I don't think so.

591
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,560
If Shan Gudao killed the person he brought in

592
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,160
and caused a lot of trouble in the palace,

593
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,230
it won't help him find the mother bug.

594
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,540
There must be a third person behind this.

595
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,180
He did all this

596
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,260
to stop all the people

597
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,540
who want to find the Pagoda of Bliss.

598
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,540
That's right.

599
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,140
It's just as I guessed.

600
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,360
Did you find anything else?

601
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,250
Before Li Fei died,

602
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,700
he drew a circle on the table.

603
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,940
I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure it out.

604
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,800
But now I finally know

605
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,980
what this circle means.

606
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,280
What?

607
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,370
A well.

608
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,700
You mean

609
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,860
the entrance to the Pagoda of Bliss

610
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,610
might be near a well.

611
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,860
But if such a pagoda

612
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,120
is still in the palace,

613
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,190
someone would have discovered it.

614
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,390
I haven't figured it out yet.

615
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,600
But the only thing we know is

616
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,200
the four were killed

617
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,920
and Shan Gudao has lost the clue to the pagoda.

618
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,620
The third person behind this

619
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,510
stops others from searching for the Pagoda of Bliss,

620
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,060
so he must know all the clues.

621
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,680
So,

622
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,990
our goal now is to find

623
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,220
this third person.

624
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,050
These claw prints are indeed from a beast.

625
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,320
It's not forged.

626
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,480
I've read the corpse report of these four.

627
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,910
Their throats were bitten through

628
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,500
and their abdomens dug open by claws.

629
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,180
They were indeed killed by a beast.

630
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,210
But look,

631
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,350
the blood on the ground doesn't look right.

632
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,590
The blood

633
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,570
is splattered around the bodies.

634
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,340
There are no smudges,

635
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
which means none of them tried to escape.

636
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,520
There were four of them.

637
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,720
The beast can only kill one person at a time.

638
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,310
They had a chance to escape.

639
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,290
Why didn't they escape,

640
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,860
instead of letting the beast kill them?

641
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,100
No poison.

642
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,730
No poison?

643
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,930
It doesn't make sense if there's no poison.

644
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,520
Could the Ni Tianhou be real

645
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,300
and make people unable to move?

646
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,940
Maybe the poison isn't in the food and water.

647
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,770
There was such an osmanthus tree

648
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,720
a few meters away from the entrance.

649
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,950
Based on the osmanthus trees

650
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,700
we saw these days,

651
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,220
the entrance

652
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,950
is probably

653
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,620
in this position.

654
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,860
The map.

655
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,080
It should be the map

656
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,880
that they checked.

657
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,460
The poison was on it.

658
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
After reading it,

659
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,730
they were poisoned and paralyzed.

660
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,220
They lost consciousness

661
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,690
and were slaughtered.

662
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,660
Now, the map is gone.

663
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,200
The murderer must be afraid of being traced.

664
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,460
It's not easy to find a simple map

665
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,260
in such a big palace.

666
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,020
Since the beast is real

667
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,620
and Ni Tianhou is fake,

668
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,500
then can't we find it

669
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,280
by tracing this smell?

670
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,219
Smell?

671
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,620
Fox Spirit has been lazy for so long.

672
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,250
It's time for it to work.

673
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:24,790
Come.

674
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,690
Go.

675
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,250
[Shanyi Workshop]

676
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,370
This should be the place.

677
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,620
Be careful.

678
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,870
Fang Xiaobao,

679
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,320
you've improved a lot lately.

680
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,300
I created this Night Rain on Green Robe technique.

681
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:33,880
What do you think?

682
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,640
You'd better not get spotted by Di Feisheng,

683
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,530
or else he'd want to challenge you.

684
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,140
I didn't expect the fierce two-headed Ni Tianhou

685
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,980
to be two lynxes tied together.

686
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
That's why it's so cruel.

687
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,620
Let's go in and have a look.

688
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,560
Seeing this,

689
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,900
it makes sense now.

690
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,200
There are so many lynx remains in the cave.

691
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,430
It seems the murderer has been playing tricks

692
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,330
for many years.

693
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,830
The missing maids and eunuchs

694
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,910
must have been killed by the murderer

695
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,300
for approaching the Pagoda of Bliss.

696
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,740
Think about it.

697
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,880
He just used the lynxes to kill someone.

698
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,480
He won't come here

699
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,960
for a while.

700
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,100
In that case,

701
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,820
we need to find a way

702
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,370
to find out who he is.

703
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,900
The corpses of animals in the cave

704
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,030
are usually fed to the lynxes.

705
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,380
The inner palace is strict.

706
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,220
It's hard not to attract attention

707
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,740
when sending large batches of meat here every few days.

708
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,880
This fake mountain

709
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,760
is built by the palace wall.

710
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,660
The small door in the cave can lead to the outer palace,

711
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,330
so he can put food in from the outside.

712
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,700
But even outside,

713
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,140
there's someone watching this place.

714
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,040
All supplies coming in and out are recorded.

715
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,340
It's hard for him to succeed by transporting or stealing.

716
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,620
Thus,

717
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,890
he can steal food from a group that can't speak.

718
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,460
I see.

719
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,400
The Beast Garden?

720
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,400
That's right.

721
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,690
Let's go.

722
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,610
Uncle Qian,

723
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,440
long time no see.

724
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,730
Fang,

725
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,410
long time no see. You've grown up.

726
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,580
Kid,

727
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,010
are you here so late

728
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,370
to see the tiger again?

729
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,050
Next time.

730
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm here to ask you about something.

731
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,300
Uncle Qian,

732
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,120
do you often lose the meat for feeding the beasts

733
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,420
in the Beast Garden?

734
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,550
How did you know?

735
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,640
Don't worry, Uncle Qian.

736
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,540
We're here to catch the thief.

737
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,180
I'm not clear

738
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,280
about losing meat either.

739
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,940
When I entered the Beast Garden decades ago,

740
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,640
I only remember that half a stone of meat

741
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,570
was enough each day.

742
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,580
But one day,

743
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,530
I used up one more kilogram for no reason.

744
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,730
Since then,

745
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,630
we had less meat to feed every day.

746
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,250
This increased every month

747
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,100
until it reached five kilograms.

748
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,200
This went on for seven or eight years.

749
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,630
Then it became one kilogram again.

750
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,460
This kept repeating.

751
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,320
It's very strange.

752
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,060
It's like...

753
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,860
It's like

754
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,650
someone raised a beast

755
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,430
until it died at 7 or 8 years old.

756
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,910
Then he raised another young beast,

757
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,780
right?

758
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,940
Yes.

759
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,260
At first, I wanted to investigate this matter.

760
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,440
People laughed at me for being too worried.

761
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,230
It's just that the beasts

762
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,840
have varying appetites.

763
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,940
That's right.

764
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,380
It's easy to sneak a small lynx into the palace

765
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,660
and raise it for seven or eight years.

766
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,140
When it is about to die,

767
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,220
you can bring two more in.

768
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,340
This...

769
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,740
Small lynx?

770
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,460
The Beast Garden doesn't have lynxes.

771
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,100
Uncle Qian,

772
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,730
we're talking about a case.

773
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,990
By the way, Uncle Qian,

774
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,300
where do you usually store the feed?

775
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,420
Is it easy to be stolen?

776
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,710
This is why I'm doubtful,

777
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,910
but there's no investigation.

778
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,570
The feed is usually locked in the warehouse.

779
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,020
But other than me,

780
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,350
only the Ministry of Industry

781
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,660
has a spare key.

782
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,340
It's impossible

783
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
for a thief to steal meat

784
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,380
for so long.

785
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,280
Oh no! Let's go!

786
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
What happened?

787
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,830
The Ministry of Industry is responsible for repairing the palace.

788
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,540
The lynx mountain was created by the Ministry too.

789
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,620
Where is the key to the Beast Garden's warehouse?

790
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,730
The Ministry has a spare key.

791
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,520
The four men were planted here by the Ministry.

792
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,100
They also have

793
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,110
the poisoned palace map.

794
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,300
So,

795
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,650
the four of them

796
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,700
didn't return to their residence after the location was chosen.

797
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,060
Instead, they went to Shanyi Workshop.

798
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,200
Before this,

799
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,000
I thought it was done by the Shan Gudao alone,

800
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,140
but it doesn't seem the case now.

801
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,420
Maybe I was wrong.

802
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,340
Someone from the Ministry of Industry

803
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,580
was afraid that the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss would be leaked,

804
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,200
so he arranged them to go to the Shanyi Workshop

805
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,560
and had the lynxes kill them.

806
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,260
Those who can do this

807
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,040
will not only have worked in the Ministry for many years,

808
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,300
but also be involved in choosing the location

809
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
in order to plan at all times.

810
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,150
Ministry of Industry Supervisor, Liu Kehe.

811
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,560
If he didn’t inform Shan Gudao

812
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,880
and brought Li Fei and the others

813
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,900
to the Shanyi Workshop privately,

814
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,300
then Shan Gudao would also know

815
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,410
that the murderer is Liu Kehe.

816
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,070
Let's go.

817
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,350
We're too late.

818
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,390
Shan Gudao lost Li Fei and the others.

819
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,140
If he wants to find the Pagoda of Bliss,

820
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,810
his only clue

821
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,460
is Liu Kehe.

822
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,110
This is tricky.

823
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,470
What's the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss

824
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,530
that he needs to protect with his life?

825
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,470
Did he know about the Karmic Bugs too?

826
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,450
If he had known,

827
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,100
he should have noticed

828
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,610
the Demon Monk from the start.

829
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,010
So,

830
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,110
he must have had an ulterior motive.

831
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,230
It's a mess here.

832
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,140
We can't find any clues either.

833
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,130
Think about it.

834
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,530
Liu Kehe chose to commit suicide

835
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,720
to protect the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss.

836
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,730
I'm sure he won't leave any clues behind either.

837
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,550
The Pagoda of Bliss must never be recovered.

838
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,720
[The Pagoda of Bliss must never be recovered. Otherwise, chaos will erupt.]

839
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,380
Otherwise, chaos will erupt.

840
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,460
Li Lianhua,

841
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,260
I remember you said that

842
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,280
before Li Fei and the others died,

843
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,020
they said they saw an osmanthus tree

844
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,150
and estimated where the entrance was.

845
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,190
That's right.

846
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,680
They only recalled it when they saw the osmanthus tree.

847
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,070
It means the scenery at the entrance

848
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,560
is different from ten years ago.

849
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,340
An abandoned palace has changed so much.

850
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,120
Maybe

851
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,770
this is also a clue.

852
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,670
Maybe after they accidentally entered the Pagoda of Bliss,

853
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,480
Liu Kehe used his power to alter the palace

854
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,030
and hide the entrance.

855
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,970
Look.

856
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,180
These are the records

857
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,150
of the Ministry's construction near the abandoned palace.

858
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,990
There are quite a few moves.

859
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,900
They planted 53 trees,

860
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,790
flattened eight mountains,

861
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,370
filled five wells,

862
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,420
and repaired six canals.

863
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,080
Based on the osmanthus tree

864
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,830
we saw these days,

865
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,930
the entrance is probably

866
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,990
in this location.

867
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,780
It indeed is a well.

868
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,190
Let's go.

869
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,610
Let's go to the abandoned garden now.

870
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,030
Li Lianhua.

871
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,110
What's wrong?

872
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,490
A jade pendant hanging on the waist

873
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,200
shouldn't be so heavy.

874
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,210
[A promise of life and death]
