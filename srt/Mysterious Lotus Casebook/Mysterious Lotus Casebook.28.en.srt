[Episode 28]

4
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,900
It's been six days.

5
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,030
I can't wait any longer.

6
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,140
You're up.

7
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,110
Li Lianhua, you're really something.

8
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,020
You're so weak, you might as well be made of paper.

9
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,580
You just caught the flu.

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,840
But you were bedridden for so many days,

11
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,520
took so many of Brother Guan's ginseng pills,

12
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,260
and still didn't recover.

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,220
When you were sick,

14
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,890
your eyes weren't working very well too.

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,700
Li Lianhua.

16
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,500
Why don't you

17
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,220
stop looking for Lian Quan?

18
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,579
We can go back to my brother's place

19
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,800
and get him to treat you properly.

20
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,470
I am a physician myself.

21
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,550
If I go to your sworn brother,

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,360
won't I be admitting that I'm a bad physician?

23
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,710
I've gotten much better these days.

24
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,910
Next,

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,570
I think I should go out for a walk.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
It might be a good idea.

27
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,270
Don't worry.

28
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,100
But the Lian Quan you mentioned

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,020
has disappeared from Shishou Village.

30
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,620
Where should we find him?

31
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,190
Xiaoyong.

32
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,079
I need your help.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,490
Get me a map of the emerald mines.

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,440
Emerald...

35
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,240
Why do you need that?

36
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,130
Lian Quan practiced the Netherworld Holy Passage.

37
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,950
The most powerful move is Bizhong Strike.

38
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,810
This move requires regular detoxing

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,280
to avoid harming the user.

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,730
I heard

41
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,950
he once bought

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,790
a massive screen wall made of emeralds.

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,230
With this screen wall,

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,540
he could detox and cool down.

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,130
When he left back then,

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,210
the emerald screen wall in his house

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,830
was shattered by his enemies.

48
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,770
I think, in order to stay alive,

49
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,950
he must be living near an emerald mine.

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,470
I see.

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,270
I'll go look for the map now.

52
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,810
Take care of your health.

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,750
Be careful.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,240
Abbot.

55
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,460
Mr. Fang

56
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,920
waited outside your room for three days and nights.

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,510
Are you really not going to see him?

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,190
I can't give him the answer he wants.

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,329
Just tell him I'm out.

60
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,240
Master.

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,650
I thought monks don't lie.

62
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,380
Mr. Fang.

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,370
I have important work to do.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,070
I need to recite the scriptures now.

65
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,410
Master.

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,220
I know who Li Lianhua is.

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,130
You know?

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,090
Then why are you stopping me?

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,990
I just want to know

70
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,740
why he concealed his identity and refused to come back.

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,589
Also,

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,170
did my father, Shan Gudao's death,

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,900
have anything to do with him?

74
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,490
For your first question,

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,880
I know the answer, but I can't tell you.

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,170
For your second question,

77
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,930
I don't know the answer, and I cannot comment on it.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
Why not?

79
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,970
Are you hiding something on purpose?

80
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,020
Okay.

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,530
Let me ask you one more question.

82
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,500
Is his martial arts really gone?

83
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,230
Or is he hiding his strength on purpose?

84
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,610
Even if he was hurt in his duel with Di Feisheng,

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,580
a master like him

86
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,640
couldn't have lost all his vigor.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,250
What is he doing?

88
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,210
Mr. Fang,

89
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,930
have you thought about it?

90
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,880
Sometimes the simplest answer

91
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,130
is the most correct answer.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,330
The tree wants to be still, but the wind wouldn't stop.

93
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,010
I don't understand.

94
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,180
Please enlighten me.

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,390
That's all I could say.

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,960
As for the rest, I've explained already.

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,110
I can't help you.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,090
You have to find the truth yourself.

99
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,220
However,

100
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,010
I have a question for you.

101
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,340
Do you feel conflicted

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,920
because he is Li Xiangyi,

103
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,140
or because he is Li Lianhua?

104
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,010
If you have a storm in your heart,

105
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,080
you will lose the wisdom of a drop of water.

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
It's better to look back

107
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,480
at the wisdom in that single drop of water.

108
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,409
All these years,

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,570
he has always been alone.

110
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,090
You are the only friend

111
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,940
I've ever seen him with.

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,320
Friend?

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,580
I've known him for so long.

114
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,980
You knew about it.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Di Feisheng knew about it.

116
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,160
But I didn't know.

117
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,710
What kind of friend am I?

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,570
The weather is bad.

119
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,110
I'm afraid a storm is coming.

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,290
Master.

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,790
Fang Duobing.

122
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,460
I finally found you.

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,840
There's another wanted man on the Blade List.

124
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,570
The four Court Masters asked you to go back quickly.

125
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,380
Who is it?

126
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,820
Li Lianhua.

127
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,640
What?

[Baichuan Court]

129
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,170
Master Ji,

130
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,260
why is Li Lianhua on the Blade List?

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,640
The Sigu Sect received a secret letter stating that

132
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,230
Li Lianhua has joined the Jinyuan Alliance.

133
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,070
Sect Leader Xiao specially asked the Baichuan Court

134
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,020
to investigate this matter thoroughly.

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,130
This is absolutely impossible.

136
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,360
How can a secret letter that came out of nowhere

137
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
be enough to convict him?

138
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,050
Li Lianhua and I traveled together for months.

139
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
I can testify for

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,760
the kind of person he is.

141
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
There's a hidden flower hanging on the Blade List.

142
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,120
All the righteous sects in the martial world can arrest him.

143
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,860
Li Lianhua is not skilled in martial arts.

144
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,030
If he gets hurt,

145
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,540
-then...
-Do you know the identity of

146
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,590
the masked man called Fei

147
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,220
who traveled with Li Lianhua?

148
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,220
Someone saw his face.

149
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,130
He is Di Feisheng.

150
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,260
You and Li Lianhua were inseparable.

151
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,420
You and Fei

152
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,140
had appeared together too.

153
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,659
Didn't you notice anything

154
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
strange about him?

155
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,620
I...

156
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,890
Duobing is new to the martial world.

157
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,720
How could he possibly recognize

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,350
Di Feisheng when he hadn't appeared

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,070
in the past ten years?

160
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,450
Mu Rongyao hasn't left Great Xi yet.

161
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,020
Shishui went to find him.

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
We'll know the truth soon.

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,300
I met Fei before.

164
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
But I've never seen his face.

165
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,390
Have you seen his weapon?

166
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,150
He carried a long knife on his back.

167
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,420
But he never unsheathed it.

168
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,470
He was very arrogant.

169
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,030
He said ordinary people are not worthy of his blade.

170
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,230
I remember now.

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,590
He unsheathed it once.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,480
I remember it was a horizontal knife.

173
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,380
The blade was sharp on both sides.

174
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,309
There were golden hoops on it.

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,780
Every time he unsheathed his knife,

176
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,330
it unleashed a metallic whistling sound.

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,330
The first famous master that Di Feisheng killed

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
was the monk of the Blood Realm, Kuang Jiezi.

179
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,850
He removed the Golden Jade hoops

180
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,240
from his staff

181
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,580
and hung them on his knife as a trophy.

182
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,290
It seems that

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
he is indeed Di Feisheng.

184
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,490
I didn't expect Li Lianhua

185
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,400
to collude with Di Feisheng.

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,520
No matter what,

187
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,930
good and evil are irreconcilable.

188
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,190
If he is colluding with

189
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,090
the director of an evil sect,

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,750
then we didn't wrong him.

191
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,640
Wait.

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,950
Even if he's really with Di Feisheng,

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,940
it doesn't necessarily mean he's part of the Jinyuan Alliance now.

194
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,140
Maybe he's making use of Di Feisheng's authority

195
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,280
to investigate the Rama Heavenly Ices.

196
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,190
What's that?

197
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,360
We found an ancient vessel

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,450
while investigating Jin Mantang's case.

199
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,020
Hidden inside was the King of all Poison,

200
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,990
the searing karmic fire.

201
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,020
Searing karmic fire.

202
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,570
I didn't expect that

203
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,980
the searing karmic fire might resurface again.

204
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,000
This is such a serious matter.

205
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,700
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

206
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,710
In my opinion,

207
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,930
the searing karmic fire has been gone for a hundred years.

208
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,480
It's hard to tell if it's the real deal or not.

209
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,360
We have to get it back and find out.

With him?

213
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,960
You trust him so much,

214
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,830
but he's always so guarded against you.

215
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,760
He has no martial arts skills.

216
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,570
Could he have been better than you

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,750
He's certainly skilled at manipulating people.

219
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,870
You're just

220
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,410

and he played you like a fiddle.

After that,

223
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,250
you're still willing to speak up for him.

224
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm not trusting him.

225
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm trusting my instinct.

226
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,370
He might really be hiding something,

227
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
but he's not an evil person.

228
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,650
Was he ever frank to you?

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,720
We looked into it.

230
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,660
His name and origin are all fabricated.

231

why was he somehow always

234
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,730
involved in the conflicts of the martial world?

235

You thought you were leading the investigations.

239
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,420
What kind of person is Di Feisheng?

240
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,350
He's selfish, prideful,

241
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,900
and cold-blooded.

242
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
But he's willing to disguise himself

243
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,700
and follow Li Lianhua.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,020
I really can't figure out

he can explain everything after we have captured him.

Big mines attract too much attention.

00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,170
with Di Feisheng.

374
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,670
You should know that.

375
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,420
I don't.

376
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,220
I've been with you for so long.

377
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,380
But even your name is fake.

378
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
When did I ever know you?

379
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,330
Fang Duobing.

380
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,310
I do owe you an explanation.

381
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,660
But I can't go back to Sigu Sect with you now.

382
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,530
I need to first find Lian Quan

383
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,350
and get the Rama Heavenly Ice

384
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,080
to find the real murderer

385
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
and uncover the truth.

386
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm really running out of time.

387
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,980
Why don't we

388
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
find out the truth together?

389
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,380
What do you think?

390
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,760
You're a fugitive.

391
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,350
I'm a detective.

392
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,540
Why should we join hands?

393
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,660
Go back to Baichuan Court with me

394
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,540
and explain yourself instead.

395
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,860
Calm down.

396
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,690
How about this?

397
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,410
Let's make a bet.

398
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,410
If you can find Lian Quan first,

399
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,680
I'll definitely go back to Baichuan Court with you.

400
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,260
I won't lie to you this time.

401
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,170
You have no right to bargain with me.

402
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,790
If you don't go back with me,

403
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,090
don't blame me for being rude to you.

404
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,120
A disciple hitting his master?

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,240
That is outrageous.

406
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,010
Master?

407
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,540
Do you think you deserve that title?

408
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,340
Brat.

409
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,660

What's going on?

413
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,660
I think I broke a rib.

414
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,640
Come and take a look.

415
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,630
Hurry up.

416
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,660
How are you?

417
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,370
Luckily, Su Xiaoyong gave me a pack of knockout powder.

418
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,100
Otherwise, I would have been caught by him.

419
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,980
I didn’t expect Fang Duobing to be here too.

420
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,420
This is getting troublesome.

421
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,020
I best make things quick.

422
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,430
Sure.

I want to ask you something.

425
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,490
Do you know if

426
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,910
there is someone called Lian Quan

427
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,050
in Xiaoyuan City?

428
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,780
Is there a place called Netherworld Mansion here?

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,200
I think I sprained my ankle.

It's nothing serious.

439
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,380
This mister handled it well.

440
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Don't bother me with

441
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,010

You can use it if you don't mind.

It's very effective.

Thank you, physician.

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,800
Okay.

we only have one reliable physician.

458

He's very busy.

459
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,780
It's usually hard to make an appointment with him.

460
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,220

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,930
No, it's Wang Bashi.

467
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
When he was born,

468
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,860
his father made 80 copper coins.

469
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,540
So he gave him this name.

470
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:43,990
Physician,

471
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,780
what's your name?

You're Physician Er.

How much is the consultation fee? I'll go fetch it.

476
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,220
Madam,

477
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,540
you don't need to pay for this.

478
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,210
I want to ask you about someone.

479
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,230
Is it convenient?

480
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,040
Well, Physician Er,

481
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,650
you have come to the right person.

482

I used to be a matchmaker.

483

someone named Lian Quan?

What about the Netherworld Mansion?

I don't know about that.

Have you seen someone...

No.

498
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,280
It's two people.

They share one pair of legs,

500
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,700
but they have two bodies.

No.

503
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,140
I might know

504

what you're referring to.

505
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,860
Six years ago,

506
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,420
when the city mine was still functional,

507
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,100
outsiders frequented the city

508
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,130
for mining work.

509
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,380

He had a

512

massive hump on his back.

513
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,940
We all thought he was a hunchback.

514
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
But one time he went to the brothel

515
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,260
and took off his clothes.

516
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,670
That was when we found another person on his back.

517
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,570
That must be the conjoined monster you mentioned.

518
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,210
After that,

519
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,460
our emerald mine was barren,

520
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,280
and no one saw them again.

521
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,780
Since then,

522
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,690

What strange thing?

526
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,120
I heard that when the mine exploded,

527

yelling that the King of Hell was getting married.

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Then,

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,970
We used to disallow mining.

542
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,460
I heard from my ancestors that there is a God residing in the mountain.

543

Outsiders came here

544
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,130

and came to mine for the rocks.

547

The King of Hell blamed us

for taking his underground treasure.

579
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,340
So he came to punish us.

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,620
they'll be going against me.

748
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,510
You are no exception.

749
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,110
Mother.

750
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,850
Your aunt admires him too.

751
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,820
You know your aunt is getting old.

752
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,480
she has never admired someone before.

753
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,050
Right?

754
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,970
Mr. Li, right?

755
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
Your sister is indeed my friend.

756
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,380
We are...

757
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,080
Shut up.

758
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,260
Don't use my aunt as a shield.

759
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,300
Come with me.

760
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,890
Fang Xiaobao.

761
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,090
How dare you.

762
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,150
You won't even obey me now?

763
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,380
I never taught you

764
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,180
to treat a guest like this.

765
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,460
Let go of him.

766
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,390
Mother.

767
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,630
Be careful of my punishment.

768
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm sorry.

769
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,680
Don't mind him.

770
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,460
Please come in, Physician Li.

771
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,700
Watch the steps.

772
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,890
Physician Li.

773
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Master He.

774
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,290
Just call me Mr. Li.

775
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,760
Okay.

776
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,540
Might as well call him Swindler Li.

777
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,820
Please come in.

778
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,710
Mr. Li.

779
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,620
Please have a seat.

780
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,780
I didn’t expect you to be so young, Master He.

781
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,260
Really?

782
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,430
Boot licker.

783
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,100
I didn’t expect that the

784
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,410
smart and resourceful Mr. Li my son always mentioned

785
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,980
is such a handsome man.

786
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,770
Xiaobao often told me about

787
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,900
his case solving adventures with you.

788
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,700
He said you are good at making decisions,

789
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,580
and he learned a lot from you.

790
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,130
You're too kind, Master He.

791
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,710
Your son helped me a lot too.

792
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,810
The young fox is no match for the old fox.

793
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,650
The older, the wiser.

794
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,920
Wasn't it you who couldn't stop

795
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,570
praising Li Lianhua?

796
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,720
You said that you found a bosom friend in life,

797
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,220
and it was worth your trip to the martial world.

798
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,920
You said you only wished to travel with him again.

799
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,770
Didn't you say that?

800
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
I didn't see his true colours back then.

801
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,220
You don't use your eyes to make friends.

802
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,830
You use your heart.

803
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,100
When I saw Li Lianhua,

804
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,670
I had a feeling we would get along.

805
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,600
I believe he's not an evil person.

806
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,630
What happened between you two?

807
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,180
Let's make it clear here today.

808
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,820
If you like our wine, drink more.

809
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,719
When you go to the prison of Baichuan Court,

810
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,560
you can't drink such good wine anymore.

811
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,570
Don't listen to him.

812
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,350
Drink more.

813
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,239
-Drink more.
-Mother.

814
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:24,710
Fang Xiaobao,

815
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,610
I was reluctant to let you go

816
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,699
when you insisted on roaming the martial world.

817
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,100
I was afraid that your bad habits

818
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,330
and lack of experience

819
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,620
would land you in big trouble.

820
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,290
But you met Li Lianhua.

821
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,969
Not only did he not lead you astray,

822
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,270
he protected you in many ways.

823
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,460
Just for that, I'll accept it.

824
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,020
In life,

825
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,850
everyone has secrets they don't want to tell.

826
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,790
If you leave room for others,

827
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,340
you're leaving room for yourself.

828
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,590
Just like how you hid the fact that

829
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,860
Shan Gudao was my father?

830
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:57,860
You...

831
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,110
You brat.

832
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,380
How dare you bring that up again?

833
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,250
-You've gotten too arrogant.
-It hurts.

834
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,960
-Is that it? 
-It hurts.

835
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,960
Do you think your father was a good man?

836
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,890
I have my reasons for not telling you.

837
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,020
I hate the people

838
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,980
from Baichuan Academy and Sigu Sect the most.

839
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,570
All the grudges in the martial world

840
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,360
were caused by those people

841
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,150
who claimed to be from righteous sects.

842
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,740
They wanted to set rules for the martial world.

843
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,950
But in the end,

844
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,160
it was all for the rulemakers

845
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,050
to gain more power.

846
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,720
The martial world is what it is.

847
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,770
The rules of the martial world is the world itself.

848
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,240
There are 420 volumes of law in this dynasty.

849
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,420
There are more than 3,000 books worth of rules.

850
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,420
But out of those rules,

851
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,780
none of them can restrain the people of the martial world.

852
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,730
So,

853
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,260
I admire willful and free-spirited

854
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,460
wanderers like Mr. Li.

855
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,460
He doesn't participate in any sect conflicts,

856
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,410
unlike Fang Xiaobao's past subject of admiration,

857
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,370
Li Xiangyi.

858
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,570
I think the so-called hero

859
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,300
is a man who hunts for fame.

860
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,230
I don't know what's so good about him.

861
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,850
Mother.

862
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,800
Mr. Li,

863
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,780
you don't know.

864
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:14,880
Xiaobao

865
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,000
tried very hard to be Li Xiangyi's disciple.

866
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,320
Such a big bitter pill,

867
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,600
he would swallow it by force.

868
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,600
In order to stand up,

869
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,170
he pierced his 12 major acupoints every day.

870
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,320
It was so painful,

871
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,200
he fainted many times.

872
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,300
But he refused to cry.

873
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,580
All that, just for what Li said.

874
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,960
He said, if Xiaobao could hold a sword,

875
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,740
he would take him as his disciple.

876
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,650
Isn't this kid silly?

877
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,330
Mother, can you stop talking?

878
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,660
Madam,

879
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,220
the doctor sent the medicine.

880
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay.

881
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,460
Just put it there.

882
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,060
Medicine?

883
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,660
Mother, are you feeling unwell?

884
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,900
I heard that the underground water nearby

885
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,700
is not clean enough for drinking.

886
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,500
Li and I were new here.

887
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,700
We didn't know that.

888
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
That's why we have some diarrhea

889
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,720
these two days.

890
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,830
It's nothing serious.

891
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,110
Go back and take your medicine.

892
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,630
Don't talk so much.

893
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,330
Okay?

894
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,110
Master He,

895
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,020
no need to be so polite.

896
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,920
Your health is more important.

897
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,380
Okay.

898
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,020
Mr. Li.

899
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,620
I’ll leave you to it.

900
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,540
By the way,

901
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,180
you haven't seen the courtyard, have you?

902
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,150
Li.

903
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,540
-Madam.
-Take Mr. Li

904
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,330
and Young Master

905
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,620
on a tour of the mansion later.

906
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,020
Yes.

907
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,890
This way, Young Master.

908
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,270
Why is the backyard so deserted?

909
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,860
Actually, I heard from the servant next door that

910
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,460
a tragic incident happened in this yard.

911
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,170
Was it the fire my mother mentioned?

912
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,650
The original owner of this place was called Yan Qingtian.

913
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,540
Apparently, his wife had an affair with his steward.

914
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,690
They killed him in the middle of the night,

915
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,810
burnt half of the mansion down,

916
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,760
and ran away with all the valuables in the house.

917
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,270
Madam isn't afraid.

918
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,190
But we servants are scared to death.

919
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,180
Young Master,

920
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,760
please tour the rest of

921
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,500
the courtyard yourselves.

922
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm really sorry

923
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,960
for keeping some things from you.

924
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,790
You purposely came to my house

925
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,910
to befriend my mother.

926
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
What do you want?

927
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,400
That's not true.

928
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,070
I just happened to run into Li.

929
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,210
Fang Duobing.

930
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
I didn't kill your father.

931
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,400
I can trust you.

932
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,410
All of a sudden, so many evidence pointed to you.

933
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,430
It's too coincidental.

934
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,660
It's possible that someone knows you're alive

935
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,020
and deliberately pointed all the clues toward you.

936
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,260
But just because it's intentional,

937
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,890
doesn't mean it's definitely fake.

938
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,320
You may be innocent.

939
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,130
You may not be.

940
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,290
If you can tell me

941
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,360
everything you've concealed,

942
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
I can make my own judgment.

943
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,090
Other than my identity,

944
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,890
I didn't hide

945
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,860
anything else.

946
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,820
Did you really show up

947
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,860
outside the Yipin Tomb by accident,

948
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,420
and not because you knew Di Feisheng

949
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
was looking for the Weeping Guanyin there?

950
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,310
Did you really investigate cases with me

951
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,620
because you admire my skills,

952
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,600
and not because you want to enter the Baichuan Court.

953
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,900
Did Difeisheng really

954
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,340
plant the Gang Qi in my body

955
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,990
because you refused to save someone?

956
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,050
You lied to me that he was an Iron Head Slave

957
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,140
and kept him by your side.

958
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,420
Was that also coincidental?

959
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,370
Come to think of it,

960
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,050
you really don't hide anything.

961
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,480
In the end, I was the only one kept out of the loop.

962
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,910
I didn't know anything.

963
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,540
There are many things

964
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,840
I really can't help.

965
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,940
How convenient.

966
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,160
Wait.

967
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,550
[Baishui Garden]

968
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,790
This yard was originally called Baishui Garden.

969
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,860
Baishui means spring.

970
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,870
Could it be the Netherworld Mansion?

971
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,960
Netherworld Mansion.

972
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,880
Did my mother buy the Netherworld Mansion?

973
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,010
If what those servants said is true,

974
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,580
the one who died must be Lian Quan.

975
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,940
But the Lord of the Netherworld is so skilled.

976
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,750
How could he be killed

977
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,960
his wife and her lover just like that?

978
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
There must be something wrong.

979
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,980
Have you heard of the King of Hell getting married?

980
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,940
I suspect

981
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,250
this is related to Lian Quan.

982
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,420
The Lord of the Netherworld's martial arts ranked third 10 years ago.

983
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,090
His unique skill, Bizhong Strike, could even dissolve bones.

984
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,960
Since you can find this place,

985
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,980
you must also be here for Lian Quan.

986
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,170
Maybe,

987
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,450
we can work together.

988
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,260
Do you think

989
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,530
I can't solve the case without you?

990
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,780
That would be a waste of

991
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,550
all the skills you secretly taught me.

992
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,850
If you can't tell me your secrets,

993
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,180
fine.

994
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,410
There'll be someone who can make you talk.

995
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,710
What a coincidence.

996
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,330
When I met you at the door,

997
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,570
I sent a messenger pigeon.

998
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,130
I have no time to joke with you.

999
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,870
Where is the Rama Heavenly Ice in your possession?

1000
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,830
Why are the two of you

1001
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,390
always pulling a long face?

1002
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,580
I heard that

1003
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,220
Master Yun shut himself away for 10 years.

1004
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,240
I didn't expect you to

1005
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,100
leave your place to catch me.

1006
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,350
You even tied me up.

1007
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,940
What did I do to deserve this?

1008
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,620
Don't change the subject.

1009
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,430
Maybe you don't know what the Baichuan Court is capable of.

1010
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,450
We have something called the Water Dragon Incense.

1011
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,030
The first stick of incense creates an addiction.

1012
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,610
The second stick alleviates the addiction.

1013
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,740
No matter what kind of tough man you are,

1014
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,580
you can't withstand it.

1015
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,590
Well,

1016
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,550
isn't it a waste

1017
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,080
to use something so strong on me?

1018
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,220
We only use the Water Dragon Incense

1019
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,700
to deal with extremely evil people.

1020
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,290
I don't know why

1021
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,080
you hate Li Lianhua so much.

1022
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,020
When we find where Lotus Tower is,

1023
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,290
we'll return to Baichuan Court immediately.

1024
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,330
Fang Xiaobao.

1025
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,910
Fang Xiaobao!

1026
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,090
Since I caught you this time,

1027
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,930
you should be obedient and

1028
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,450
go back to Tianji Mountain Manor with me.

1029
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,740
You've had your fun playing detective.

1030
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,190
Next, you should go back

1031
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,900
and prepare to get married.

1032
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,220
-You hear me?
-Who said I’m going back?

1033
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,700
Where are you going then?

1034
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,820
You don't even have a partner now.

1035
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,850
Are you going to travel alone?

1036
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,990
Madam.

1037
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,410
Young Master.

1038
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,020
What's wrong?

1039
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,620
Why did someone put a box of money

1040
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,810
in front of our door?

1041
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,070
The King of Hell is getting married.
