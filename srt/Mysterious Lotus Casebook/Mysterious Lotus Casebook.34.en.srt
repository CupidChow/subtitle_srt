[Episode 34]

4
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Everyone!

5
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,100
Back to the mountain manor now!

6
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,010
Mother, activate the mechanism!

7
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,730
Leave this to me.

8
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,500
Okay.

9
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,260
Hurry!

10
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,630
Everyone! Attack!

11
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,220
You didn't expect a magnetic arrow

12
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,730
could turn your Xianri Sedan

13
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,020
into a pile of scrap iron, did you?

14
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,450
You stole the Cloud-chasing Carriage from Tianji Hall

15
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,370
and turned it into a killing weapon.

16
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,760
Did you think I couldn't find its core?

17
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,140
Since I came back from Shishou Village,

18
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,870
I've been studying this.

19
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,190
What other moves do you have now?

20
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,460
Good.

21
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,930
My son, Tianji Hall has really taught you well.

22
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,100
Demon Monk!

23
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,770
Li Xiangyi?

24
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,090
Aunt!

25
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,880
Xiaofeng!

26
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,250
Director Di.

27
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,810
You're late.

28
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,780
What do you want?

29
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,560
If you want her to live,

30
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,820
give me the Rama Heavenly Ice.

31
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,370
Your memory has been recovered?

32
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,550
You traitor!

33
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,930
You ungrateful man.

34
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
You've colluded with the Wansheng Clan.

35
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,159
We just work together for what we each want.

36
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Give it to me.

37
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,030
I don't have much patience.

38
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,200
You won't get what you want

39
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,470
by getting blood from a stone.

40
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,860
Cut it out.

41
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,550
Xiaofeng!

42
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,430
Aunt!

43
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,860
Shan Gudao!

44
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,050
If you want to achieve great things,

45
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,810
don't care about trifles.

46
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,340
Hand it over.

47
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,050
Fang Xiaobao.

48
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,350
Give him the Heavenly Ice.

49
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,640
Where's the other piece?

50
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,530
Aunt!

51
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,400
If I give it to you,

52
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,750
you must release her at the same time.

53
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,280
My son.

54
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,659
It seems that Tianji Hall didn't teach you well.

55
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,250
You want to bargain with your father?

56
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,460
You're not qualified to bargain with me.

57
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,659
Xiaofeng!

58
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Aunt!

59
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,540
Hand it over!

60
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,220
Xiaofeng.

61
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,240
Are you okay?

62
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,930
Thank you for your help, Director Di.

63
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,920
As long as I have you, Director Di, by my side,

64
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
everything's much easier.

65
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,020
Senior.

66
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
This is the last time I'm calling you this.

67
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,290
In the past,

68
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,820
I've never fought with you for anything.

69
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,659
In the future,

70
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll take your life

71
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
and return it to Master.

72
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,770
Let's see if you are lucky enough

73
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,620
to live to that day.

74
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,280
Finally.

75
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
I finally got all four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice

76
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,180
in my own hands.

77
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,220
Burn your body.

78
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,030
Exorcise your soul.

79
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,690
Sacrifice Sui and Yan for fire.

80
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,830
Karmic fire burns the sky!

81
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,370
Congratulations, Master.

82
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Congratulations, Master.

83
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,630
Once I open the Rama Vessel,

84
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,820
everything in the world

85
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,430
will be mine.

86
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,750
Di Feisheng.

87
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
What are you doing?

88
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,980
I've helped you get it done.

89
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,820
As for this...

90
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,270
I'll take it.

91
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,750
Di Feisheng.

92
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,080
Don't be so rampant.

93
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
This is the Wansheng Clan.

94
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,420
This isn't somewhere you can

95
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,730
come and leave as you wish.

96
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,930
So the ranking of martial skills

97
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
in Who's Who of Martial Arts can't be trusted.

98
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,330
Director Di, you're right.

99
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,680
You two also did a good job.

100
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,700
In the whole martial world,

101
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,180
how many masters of martial arts

102
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,550
can beat you,

103
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,750
Director Di?

104
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,490
So I'd very much like

105
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,360
to work with you, Director Di.

106
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,330
If you really need it for emergencies,

107
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
I can lend you

108
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,600
the Rama Vessel and Rama Heavenly Ice, Director Di.

109
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,250
There's one more thing.

110
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,430
I heard that you sent people to investigate

111
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,720
the whereabouts of the Styx Flower, Director Di.

112
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,360
What a coincidence.

113
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,940
I happen to have the Styx Flower.

114
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,040
I think you must be very interested, Director Di.

115
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,370
Are you serious?

116
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,010
These leaves are the leaves of the Styx Flower.

117
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,160
You can ask the Medicine Demon to identify them.

118
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,990
As long as

119
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,390
you return the two things to me

120
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,780
as soon as possible after you are done with them, Director Di,

121
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,990
I'll gift the Styx Flower to you.

122
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,940
What do you think?

123
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
It's not a bad idea.

124
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,220
Keep the Styx Flower well,

125
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,510
and wait for me.

126
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,220
So I'm still the one who knows

127
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,900
the best way to handle my man.

128
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,060
How's that?

129
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,560
I told you about the Styx Flower.

130
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,370
It really worked, right?

131
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,580
My efforts of sending people to search everywhere

132
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,370
and getting the Styx Flower

133
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,870
into my hands one step ahead paid off.

134
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,380
Sect Leader Shan.

135
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
I've let bygones be bygones and worked with you again.

136
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,700
You should know

137
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,620
what I want.

138
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,240
Rest assured.

139
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,900
After I make the best of Di Feisheng,

140
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,230
he'll be yours.

141
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,100
Rest assured?

142
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,040
I still remember vividly what happened before.

143
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,260
Last time, it was just a stopgap.

144
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,470
You saw it yourself, too.

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
Di Feisheng was pressing me,

146
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,690
so I had to pretend to obey him.

147
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,450
If both of us fall out with him,

148
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,060
it will be bad for Nanyin's cause.

149
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,200
I think

150
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,320
we should keep the sharp knife for now.

151
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,370
You don't have to

152
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,590
make kicking off the ladder sound so nice, Sect Leader Shan.

153
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,900
If I hadn't sent the message

154
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,430
and asked Snow Master to save you,

155
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,870
who would know where you were locked up?

156
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,120
Moreover,

157
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,800
we are from the same clan.

158
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,800
We are both descendants of the royal family of Nanyin.

159
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
We should be even more united.

160
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,410
[Ninglan Hall]

161
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,620
Saintess.

162
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,890
Are you really working with Shan Gudao again this time?

163
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,130
I, Jiao Liqiao,

164
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,430
am not someone who'd suffer in silence.

165
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,380
I just want to take down Di Feisheng

166
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,920
with his help.

167
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,210
Di Feisheng.

168
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,570
After this is done,

169
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll definitely

170
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,290
get even with him.

171
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,530
Your martial skills have improved a lot lately, Kid.

172
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,650
When did you do that?

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,580
Just now.

174
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,550
When I slapped back

175
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,710
the waves you set off.

176
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,300
How's that, Master?

177
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,970
This time I passed the test, right?

178
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,730
Fine.

179
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,760
Go down the mountain with your senior.

180
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,380
Thank you, Master.

181
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,800
I'll make sure to use the sword in my hand

182
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,610
to help the weak and suppress the overpowering,

183
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,100
become a big shot with honor,

184
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,290
and bring glory to our sect.

185
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,790
I don't want you to be a big shot.

186
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,960
I just want you and your senior

187
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,520
to eat well,

188
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,070
and live well.

189
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,420
Remember.

190
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,600
When you come back,

191
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,820
bring me a new flask,

192
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,170
and fill it with fine wine.

193
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,150
Master.

194
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,710
I've fixed the wine gourd for you.

195
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,790
I promised to have a drink with you,

196
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,860
but there's no such chance anymore.

197
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,320
Everything

198
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
should come to an end.

199
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,210
You knew you are injured,

200
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,170
yet you forcibly used your inner power so many times just now.

201
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,030
Do you really want to die?

202
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,500
Just minor injuries.

203
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,860
It's okay.

204
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,270
It's okay?

205
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,740
When we were on Yunyin Mountain,

206
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,340
you told me the poison had been detoxicated.

207
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,890
I actually believed it.

208
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,230
You are blaming everything

209
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,300
on yourself again.

210
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,940
I said it's not your fault.

211
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,350
The cause of it is that I didn't see through or doubt the people who work for me.

212
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,940
So, it is my fault.

213
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,130
If you want to forget your identity as Li Xiangyi,

214
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
you should face your present self truthfully.

215
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Why are you still holding onto the past?

216
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,120
It's been too long since I let go of the past.

217
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,230
Li Lianhua has lived a carefree life for ten years.

218
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,800
It's time for it to end.

219
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,540
For what to end?

220
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,780
From back when we were on Yunyin Mountain to now,

221
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm afraid the poison in your body

222
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,080
has already...

223
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm afraid there's less than a month left.

224
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,020
The most important thing now

225
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
is to find a way to save you.

226
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,720
You know?

227
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,140
Fang Xiaobao.

228
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,890
Bicha Poison

229
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
can't be detoxicated.

230
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,500
Who said that?

231
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,130
I've sent people

232
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,400
to look for the Styx Flower everywhere.

233
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,070
There must be a way to save you.

234
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,660
In this life, I, Fang Duobing,

235
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,520
recognize you, Li Lianhua, as my only confidant.

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,390
I won't let you die.

237
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,260
Don't worry about anything else.

Xiaobao.

239
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't have much time left.

240
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,410
That's why I need to complete what I want to do

241
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,210
before I die.

242
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,900
Shan Gudao.

243
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,450
I must stop him.

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

246
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,850
[Tianji Hall]

247
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,490
There's no way I can stop you, right?

248
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,300
If you really want to go,

249
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,420
I must go with you.

250
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,740
You also have to promise me that

251
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,350
you won't use your inner power anymore.

252
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,580
I'll protect you.

253
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,390
Okay, I promise you.

254
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,230
You agreed so readily.

255
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,080
It's hard not to doubt that you have other thoughts.

256
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,620
Is it wrong to agree readily?

257
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,980
So where are you going now?

258
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,650
To find out what Di Feisheng is really up to.

259
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,670
I don't think he would have worked

260
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
with Shan Gudao for no reason.

261
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,060
If we can find him,

262
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,190
maybe there's still have a chance for us to get the Heavenly Ice.

263
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
Do you have any clue?

264
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,660
I checked the background

265
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,020
of Di Feisheng ten years ago.

266
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,870
He's from a hidden place in the southwest

267
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,750
specially built for Death Sorcerer training.

268
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,940
Do you remember the day we ran into him

269
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,080
when he just lost his memory?

270
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,780
Why?

271
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,610
Why?

272
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,790
Why do we have to kill each other?

273
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,150
Why?

274
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,980
So you suspect the reason why Di Feisheng did this

275
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,540
has something to do with his background?

276
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,180
Di Feisheng

277
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,310
has been famous in the martial world for so many years,

278
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,640
but he never mentioned his background.

279
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,270
Don't you think it's strange?

280
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,670
Let's go to the southwest and investigate it.

281
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,600
Stand up!

282
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
Stand up and fight me!

283
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,180
Stop!

284
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,860
Stop!

285
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,460
Stop running!

[Qingxin Hall]

287
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,320
So it's really the similar mind control techniques.

288
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,020
Karmic bugs are the most powerful of all mind control bugs.

289
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,900
Now that the mind control techniques in my body have been removed,

290
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,820
I'm going to repay

291
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,980
your kindness to me as I grow up.

292
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,770
It's you.

293
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,690
I couldn't do anything to you when you were in the Jinyuan Alliance.

294
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,330
I couldn't kill you traitor even though I sent people there several times.

295
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,540
Since you've come to me today,

296
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,530
don't think about leaving here alive.

297
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,540
The Di family always trains the Death Sorcerers

298
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,200
to take money and do their job accordingly.

299
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,310
Today, I'll buy this cheap life of yours.

I'll show you

302
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,370
what happens when you betray the Di Fortress.

303
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,270
Surprised?

304
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,800
Without these mind control bugs,

305
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,510
how could you make those Death Sorcerers yield to you?

306
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,050
You think you can kill me?

307
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm the head of the family.

308

I'm the one who's been training you since you were little.

309
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,710
When I was little,

310
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,700
did you ever spare me

311
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,790
when I was tortured and begged for mercy?

312
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,550
Don't kill me.

Don't kill me.

I'll hand over the Di Fortress to you.

316
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,650
Kill you?

317
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,780
It'll be too easy for you.

318
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,060
I'll destroy all your meridians.

319

You can neither live well or die.

321
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,790
From now on,

322
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,500
there will no longer be any threats from the Di family.

The Medicine Demon has gone to look for it.

I've found the thing

338
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,280
you asked me to look for, My Lord.

339
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,860
I've checked.

340
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,500
This Styx Flower is real.

341
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,460
The box and the flower itself are neither poisonous.

342
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,210
Shan Gudao wants to threaten me with the Styx Flower.

343
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,670
Now I have both the flower and the Rama Vessel.

Stay away!

352
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,580
The Styx Flower is not poisonous.

353
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,320
That's because I put the poison

354
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,460
on him, King Xunming of Yama.

355
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,700
Otherwise, how could I have fooled you, My Lord?

356
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,810
I was negligent.

357
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,880
I implicated you, My Lord.

358
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,220
You want to die?

359
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,460
What a great show.

Last time, you said the disciples of Demon Monk

362
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,560
are no match for you.

363
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,790
So today,

364
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,470
I've invited Rank 1 on the Who's Who of Martial Arts,

365

Buddhist Three Saints, here

366
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,040
to go a few rounds with you.

367
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,780
Are you satisfied today?

368
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,770
My Lord fought the three of them alone.

369
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,140
If it weren't for the poison on King Xunming of Yama

370
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,020
that accidentally splashed on him

371
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,010
and controlled his inner power,

372
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,950
you might not have been able to beat him.

373
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,850
My Lord.

374
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,830
You threw me

375
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,280
into that horrifying bottomless pit,

376
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,330
and had my face scratched.

377
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,490
How could you?

378
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,180
It took me a long time

379
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,840
to find such a suitable face skin.

380
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,870
Don't worry.

381
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,810
Although you are heartless,

382
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,900
I don't blame you.

383
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,850
Your flexor tendons are broken.

384
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,300
My Lord.

385
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,350
What should I do?

386
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,180
In that case,

387
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,840
I have to...

388
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,060
Jiao Liqiao.

389
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,580
You didn't kill me.

390
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,429
You'll regret it.

391
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,760
How could I bear to kill you?

392
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,440
Enough.

393
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,469
Beauty Jiao.

394
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,679
Have you had enough fun?

395
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,840
Don't worry.

396
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,550
Shan Gudao won't be here for long.

397
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,130
He wants to use you to suppress me.

398
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,969
But I'm not as stupid as you.

399
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,500
Outsiders

400
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,350
will always be outsiders.

401
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,380
Shan Gudao has the wishful thinking of dominating the world.

402
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,470
Let him be.

403
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,050
When his ego inflates out of its limit,

404
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,500
he will die.

405
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,240
Looks like a fierce battle took place here.

406
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,620
Let's go.

407
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,650
Let's go in and have a look.

408
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,810
Help me!

409
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
Help me!

410
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,270
So the Di Fortress

411
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,940
used similar mind control techniques

412
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,780
to make people unable to resist the Master.

413
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,410
So the reason why

414
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,320
Di Feisheng agreed to cooperate with Shan Gudao

415
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,250
is that he wanted to get the karmic bugs

416
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,800
to expel the mind control techniques inside of him.

417
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,780
Now that Di Feisheng has solved

418
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,260
the matter of the Di Fortress,

419
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,010
why didn't he show up and look for me?

420
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,570
Maybe he had an accident?

421
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,340
Or, could it be

422
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,060
Di Feisheng really colluded with Shan Gudao?

423
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,460
Looks like we can only study that human skin first,

424
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,610
and find a way to suppress the karmic bugs.

425
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,360
Master.

426
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,410
Since you know the mind control techniques,

427
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,450
do you know how to suppress it?

428
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,720
The karmic bugs

429
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,150
are of different levels.

430
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,530
Big ones can suppress small ones,

431
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,810
and mother bugs can suppress child bugs.

432
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,790
The karmic bugs are of the highest level.

433
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,820
As far as I know,

434
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,650
all mind control bugs can be suppressed by karmic bugs.

435
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Mother bugs can suppress child bugs?

436
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,740
Could the way of suppressing karmic bugs

437
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,860
be the mother bugs

438
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,300
themselves?

439
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,620
Could the tattooed cyan human skin left by Liangyi Fairy

440
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,900
be pointing to the location of the mother karmic bugs?

441
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,780
It seems

442
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,020
Shan Gudao and I are looking for the same thing.

443
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,400
Welcome, Master.

444
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,780
Rise.

445
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,700
How is it?

446
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,610
My Yulongniuma Gang

447
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,790
is more interesting than the Jinyuan Alliance, right?

448
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,380
Since the first day

449
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,130
I saw you,

450
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,540
I've been hoping you could completely be mine.

451
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,140
I didn't expect that

452
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,140
my wish finally came true.

453
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,250
Come on. Drink with me.

454
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,500
You really have a temper.

455
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,160
Drink mine first.

456
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,580
So pretty.

457
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,520
Look at you.

458
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,250
So beautiful.

459
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah.

460
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,280
So pretty.

461
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,340
Have a drink with me.

462
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,100
Drink mine.

463
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,890
Don't be ungrateful.

464
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,600
Guys.

465
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,690
This girl wanted to steal our precious and practice her martial skills.

466
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,580
Unfortunately,

467
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,260
she's not good enough.

468
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,010
She can be my bedmate.

469
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,990
You want to touch me?

470
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,100
Dream on!

471
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,490
Wicked woman.

472
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,690
Go to hell!

473
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Guishou Fenglie.

474
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,790
What's your rank on the list of who's who of martial arts again?

475
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,770
Who are you?

476
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,950
Rank 10.

477
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,760
Unimpressive.

478
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,090
Now, I'm the new Rank 10.

479
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,230
I wanted to marry you,

480
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,950
but you didn't even look at me.

481
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,310
I honored you as my lord, and you still wasn't satisfied.

482
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,620
Alright then.

483
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
From now on,

484
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,280
you'll be my wife.

485
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,010
OK?

486
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,580
Take him to my room

487
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,320
and hang him up.

488
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,420
Take good care of him.

489
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,380
Why didn't you make any move?

490
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,720
I would, if it's ten years ago.

491
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,890
You're swift in making moves.

492
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,860
Looks like you've almost recovered.

493
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
Thank you for saving me that day.

494
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,260
I'll remember your kindness.

495
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,790
You don't have to.

496
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,380
You can buy me a drink another day.

497
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,050
Your sword is already broken.

498
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,800
Why do you still keep it?

499
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,440
A sword isn't bad just because it's old,

500
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,410
and friends don't have to be new to be good.

501
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,870
It's a good sword,

502
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,310
but I don't deserve it.

503
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,380
Why?

504
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,880
A precious sword is meant for a hero.

505
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,320
But I'm no hero.

506
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,980
Then tell me.

507
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,600
What is a hero?

508
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,820
As long as he's alive, he'll keep the sword safe.

509
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,870
He'll never give it up till he dies.

510
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,540
Where is your Shaoshi Sword?

511
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,140
You're not going to get it back?

512
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,120
Some people discard their swords like throwing out garbage,

513
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,150
while some carry their swords with them for a lifetime.

514
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,030
People's faiths

515
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,770
are different after all.

516
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,650
People do have different faiths.

517
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,690
I was wrong.

518
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,850
You really have changed.

519
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,320
Li Xiangyi wouldn't talk like that.

520
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,720
Things are different, Zhan Yunfei.

521
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,170
It's been ten years.

522
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,920
People change.

523
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,730
Besides,

524
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,660
over the past ten years,

525
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,170
you've also become a different Zhan Yunfei.

526
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,750
You wore your hair up.

527
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,060
It doesn't look good to me at all.

528
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,140
I'll keep the sword.

529
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,740
I'll buy you a drink another day.

530
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,400
The outermost circle of this pattern

531
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,580
looks like a wall.

532
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,210
Then what are these inside?

533
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,540
I've almost emptied my father's study these days.

534
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,410
There are only these local records of Great Xi left.

535
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,480
See if they can be of use.

536
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,510
Compare this book

537
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,890
with this one, which records Nanyin's culture.

538
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,630
This symbol should stand for gods.

539
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,350
Does this pattern mean that

540
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,330
the karmic mother bugs are kept somewhere

541
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,800
related to gods?

542
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,970
When you forget about your physical body, you can enter paradise.

543
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,920
Your spirits can ascend to the fairy land.

544
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,350
This poem is actually related to gods.

545
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,300
What does it mean?

546
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,650
Could it be that

547
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,900
the place related to gods

548
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,770
is a building,

549
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,480
a temple,

550
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,640
or an immortal mansion?

551
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,790
The outermost circle does look like a wall.

552
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,320
Could the shape of the tattooed cyan human skin

553
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,780
be a city?

554
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,180
I happen to have a map of the city.

555
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,310
Let's check it thoroughly.

556
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,900
We've searched everywhere,

557
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,100
but we couldn't find a place

558
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,780
that matches the shape of the human skin.

559
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,230
Did we guess it in a wrong direction?

560
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,370
Xiaobao.

00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,020
You...
