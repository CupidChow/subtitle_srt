[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,080
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,320
Physician Li,

5
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,830
I've been thinking about a small question.

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,370
Why don't you reveal your face?

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Master Bai.

8
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,470
Here's the thing.

9
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm just a physician who wanders in the martial arts world.

10
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,350
I'm rootless.

11
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,700
It's also my duty to cure people and save people's lives.

12
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,090
Besides,

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,970
when I cure good persons,

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,430
bad persons want to kill me.

15
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,090
When I cure bad persons,

16
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,620
good persons are not happy.

17
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,170
There are so many people in the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

18
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,420
There are also many enemies.

19
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,780
It's not too much for me

20
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,160
to wear this mask, right?

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Physician Li.

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,540
But why

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
do I seem to have seen you somewhere before?

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,400
You've seen me before?

25
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,300
Yes.

26
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,740
Could it be

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,810
that you've seen my elder brother before?

28
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,100
Your elder brother?

29
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,520
Have you really seen my elder brother before?

30
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm sorry, Master Yun.

31
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,850
Yes.

32
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,670
I do have a twin brother.

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,050
My mother named us

34
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,450
Li Lianpeng

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,650
and Li Lianhua respectively.

36
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,930
-Li Lianpeng.
-Lianpeng is my elder brother.

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,050
I'm his younger brother.

38
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,460
We were born in a poor family.

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,960
Soon after my brother was born,

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,610
he was taken away by an old man

41
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,430
and became his adopted son.

42
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,230
Since then, I've never seen him again.

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,110
But I also heard

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,550
that my brother is quite awesome.

45
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,300
So in this world,

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,310
there is a person who resembles me.

47
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,780
Li Lianpeng?

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,020
It's true. I never lie.

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,270
Physician Li.

50
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,920
Your family is poor,

51
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,210
but Lotus Tower has a unique structure

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,190
and shows exquisite craftsmanship.

53
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,290
It's valuable.

54
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
Where did you get it?

55
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,300
A few years ago, I saw a big shabby boat

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,130
floating on the sea.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,570
No one had interest in it.

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,130
So I picked up the wood

59
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,680
and made it into Lotus Tower.

60
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,790
You can ask the fishermen about it by the sea.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,430
I didn't steal it.

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,360
Physician Li, what are you talking about?

63
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,970
Biqiu just asked casually.

64
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,390
Pingchuan.

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,660
I was reckless just now.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,550
I guess

67
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,550
you haven't eaten anything since last night.

68
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,250
This is the peanut porridge

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,690
I specially asked someone to buy from Zuijiang Restaurant.

70
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,620
Physician Li.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,510
Try it.

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,850
Thank you, Master Yun.

73
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,750
Sir, put it here.

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll drink it later.

75
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,860
If the peanut porridge gets cold,

76
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,760
you'll abuse my kindness.

77
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
Drink it while it's hot.

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,180
Thank you.

79
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,610
It smells good.

80
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,750
It looks good.

81
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,500
Why are there peanuts in the porridge?

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,870
Why can't there be?

83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,040
Xiangyi has an allergy to peanuts.

84
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,670
This...

85
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,290
I have an allergic reaction again.

86
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,780
Since you've been poisoned with the deadliest poison,

87
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,010
no poison can harm you anymore.

88
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,110
Physician Li.

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,840
You still need to rest.

90
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,540
We won't disturb you then.

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,590
I've had enough porridge.

92
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,230
Thank you.

93
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,760
I won't see you off.

94
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,130
Let's go.

95
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,110
Li Lianhua.

96
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,550
Someone poisoned his friend who he respected most

97
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,990
for a woman

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,150
and caused his friend to fall into the East Sea and die.

99
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,620
Do you think

100
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,970
this person deserves to die?

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,870
Yes. He indeed deserves to die.

102
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,550
Did this person have intention to kill his friend?

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,700
That woman said

104
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,540
she didn't want Li Xiangyi to appear in the East Seaside.

105
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,909
She didn't allow Di Feisheng to be killed by others.

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,840
But Sect Leader's martial art skills are unpredictable.

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,659
If I hadn't poisoned him with the deadliest poison,

108
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,680
I couldn't have stopped him.

109
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,780
I thought I only needed to stop him for a while.

110
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,650
I had the antidote anyway.

111
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,270
I thought it didn't matter.

112
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,700
But things weren't like that.

113
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,440
The antidote is fake.

114
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,800
All the things happened because I was too stupid.

115
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,850
Even if I didn't want to kill him,

116
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,840
I did kill him.

117
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,050
If you were Sect Leader,

118
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,970
you would hate me to the core, right?

119
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,520
If I were him,

120
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,140
I would definitely hate you.

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,150
But think about it.

122
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,120
You said he has died.

123
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,170
Why would the dead hate you?

124
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,740
Besides,

125
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,870
all grudges are gone.

126
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,110
They've become the past.

127
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,650
I think you should forget it.

128
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,659
Should I really forget it?

129
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,550
How is it?

130
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,590
We've tested it.

131
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,870
He's not him at all.

132
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,690
He's really not him.

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,370
Mr. Li.

134
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,730
Ms. Qiao.

135
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,680
Last time, you asked me to investigate the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

136
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,120
I found some clues.

137
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,100
[To Qiao Wanmian. May 28, the year of Renyin.]

138
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,780
When we let him go ten years ago,

139
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,820
he wrote a letter to thank us.

140
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,990
It was sent from Cailian Manor in Xueyu Town.

141
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,600
But it happened ten years ago.

142
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,160
There is a sea of faces in the world.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,590
It's not easy to get some clues.

144
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,720
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

145
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,500
You're welcome, Mr. Li.

146
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,230
Actually, I'm here today also for another thing.

147
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,830
Say it, Ms. Qiao.

148
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
The sachet...

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
You reminded me.

150
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,710
Mr. Xiao took you away in a hurry yesterday.

151
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,100
I kept it.

152
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,750
It belonged to your deceased friend.

153
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,470
I should return it to you.

154
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,340
Ms. Qiao.

155
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,860
I made this sachet for him.

156
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,160
It's been ten years.

157
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,250
I've held out hope

158
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,650
for ten years.

159
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,610
Although I thought about it before,

160
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,230
the fact that he doesn't come back

161
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,490
is the answer.

162
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,530
Although

163
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,630
I'm mentally prepared,

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,590
when

165
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,730
I heard he is dead,

166
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,380
I still...

167
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,700
I still...

168
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,330
Ms. Qiao.

169
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,080
He's already passed away.

170
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,080
Don't be too sad.

171
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,500
Mr. Li.

172
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,640
I...

173
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,360
I once had

174
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,520
some ridiculous thoughts.

175
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,340
It was just because I couldn't accept the reality.

176
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,770
I deceived myself.

177
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,470
Now,

178
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,940
I should clear my mind.

179
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,630
This is his personal thing.

180
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
It's good to let it go with him.

181
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,110
The ten-year wait has ended.

182
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,080
Since he's your deceased friend,

183
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,460
let him stay in the story.

184
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,390
Ms. Qiao, you should move on without worries.

185
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,020
Mr. Li.

186
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,510
Thank you.

187
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,480
Ms. Qiao.

188
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,490
Why did Ms. Qiao also come here?

189
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,440
Let me remind you.

190
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,740
Ms. Qiao is already spoken for.

191
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,010
Don't have designs on her.

192
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,860
I heard from the little monks in the courtyard

193
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,750
that all the masters of the Baichuan Court came here before.

194
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,410
You didn't come at that time.

195
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,990
Do you know

196
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,260
what Master Ji brought me?

197
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,440
Shaoshi Sword.

198
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,640
Shaoshi Sword?

199
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,540
Did you touch it?

200
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,890
Of course.

201
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,540
To be honest,

202
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,110
I saved Ms. Qiao in the tunnel.

203
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,870
In order to thank me,

204
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,030
they let me have a look

205
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,310
and touch it.

206
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,730
Let me tell you.

207
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,430
This sword is really heavy.

208
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,780
My hand hurt when I touched it.

209
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,310
I couldn't lift it immediately.

210
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,440
You're so lucky.

211
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,870
I can't even touch it.

212
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:02,900
Look.

213
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,460
My hand became callused after I touched it.

214
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,200
Cut it out.

215
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,830
How dare you!

216
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,500
You've taken your medicine?

217
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,880
I've told Bhante Wuliao.

218
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,150
He'll check on you later.

219
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,650
Thanks.

220
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,220
How long do you think your life

221
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,580
will let you suffer like this?

222
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,390
I've warned you many times.

223
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,590
You have the unique Yangzhouman.

224
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,820
That's why you still have

225
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,280
ten percent of the internal power which can protect your heart.

226
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,170
Every time you use it, the effect of the poison accelerates.

227
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,910
Why don't you listen?

228
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,920
Bicha Poison will affect your brain.

229
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,380
You're a smart person.

230
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,940
If you suddenly become crazy and stupid,

231
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,940
I... I won't be used to it.

232
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,050
You have to get used to it.

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,220
Old Monk, stop talking.

234
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,340
If you continue to talk,

235
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,790
I will have a headache

236
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,150
and won't hear you clearly.

237
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't interrupt.

238
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,870
If you continue to use Genuine Qi at will,

239
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,650
I'm afraid you'll only have six months to live.

240
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,530
It's fine.

241
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,100
When she was in trouble,

242
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,690
I couldn't just stand by and watch her die.

243
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,380
Is it because you couldn't stand by and watch her die

244
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,610
or you still have feelings for Ms. Qiao?

245
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,120
Old Monk, don't talk nonsense.

246
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,470
Mian is the only one

247
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,450
who can offer me clues to find the corpse of my senior.

248
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,810
Of course I care about her.

249
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,910
People go to heaven when they die.

250
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,060
Why do you insist

251
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,990
on finding the corpse of Mr. Shan?

252
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,430
Why don't you come back?

253
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,710
You've met Yun Biqiu.

254
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,330
I know you don't mind

255
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,700
that he was bewitched by Jiao Liqiao

256
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
and poisoned you with Bicha Poison.

257
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,260
Bicha Poison?

258
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,550
I won.

259
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,270
Ten years ago, Di Feisheng wanted to battle with you.

260
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,850
But he didn't expect

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,510
the one he won in the end

262
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,220
was poisoned with a deadly poison.

263
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,050
Since

264
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,670
you don't mind that he helped Di Feisheng harm you,

265
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,010
why don't you come back?

266
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,830
If you don't want to say it, I'll say it for you.

267
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,310
You always think it was because you acted willfully

268
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,640
and declared war on the Jinyuan Alliance

269
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,020
that

270
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,250
the 58 heroes of the Sigu Sect died tragically

271
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,640
and that the Sigu Sect split.

272
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,110
It's not that you can't forgive others.

273
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,670
It's that you refuse to forgive yourself.

274
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,990
Are you done?

275
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,190
If you're done, let me say something.

276
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,510
Old Monk.

277
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,900
When did you become an old storyteller?

278
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
I just think

279
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,510
being Li Xiangyi is too tiring.

280
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,630
Isn't it good to be Li Lianhua?

281
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,880
I can drink tea with you.

282
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,930
Stop it.

283
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,970
It's time for you

284
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,510
to give lessons to the little monks.

285
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,860
Why are you still sitting here?

286
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,710
Otherwise, those little monks will raise the roof again.

287
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,910
Hurry up and go.

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,510
Li Xiangyi!

289
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,020
Li Xiangyi.

290
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,800
What are you doing?

291
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,620
Ten years ago,

292
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,440
you lost to me because you were poisoned.

293
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,340
Let me tell you.

294
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,280
Eavesdropping is not a good habit.

295
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,110
What are you doing?

296
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,820
In the battle at the East Sea ten years ago,

297
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,420
I thought I was the world number one

298
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,720
because I won a narrow victory.

299
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,630
Today I heard that I won in an unfair way.

300
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,960
You mean you didn't know anything about this?

301
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,460
Are you insulting me?

302
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,800
I see.

303
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,420
Forget it.

304
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,140
Let bygones be bygones.

305
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,910
It doesn't matter who won or lost.

306
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,550
It matters.

307
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,910
I treated you as a worthy opponent.

308
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,680
You made me a joke.

309
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,550
Director Di.

310
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,480
It's been so long.

311
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,480
Just pretend that you didn't hear it, okay?

312
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,660
No.

313
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,660
I want to compete with you again.

314
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,480
Let's compete in a fair way.

315
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,950
The problem is that I can't compete with you again.

316
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,130
You know that.

317
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,220
You've eavesdropped it.

318
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,840
Now,

319
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,800
the poison has entered my bone marrow.

320
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,320
I only have ten percent of the inner power.

321
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,380
Why don't you take a look at the new ranking list?

322
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
I heard Buddhist San Sheng is quite awesome.

323
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
Go and compete with them.

324
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,570
I have only one opponent in my life.

325
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,430
That is Li Xiangyi.

326
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,050
I only have one wish in my life.

327
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,660
That is to beat him.

328
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,790
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,080
I can't help you.

330
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,600
Now,

331
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,410
you're the world number one.

332
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,460
I don't need you to let me win.

333
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,350
It's just Bicha Poison.

334
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,070
I'll find a way to cure you.

335
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,030
I heard the poison

336
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,830
was created by Medicine Demon.

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,820
No one can detoxify it in this world.

338
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,860
Besides, Bhante Wuliao has excellent medical skills.

339
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,560
He hasn't cured me during these ten years.

340
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,380
It doesn't mean I can't cure you.

341
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,420
Tell me the Mantra of Inner Body Cleansing.

342
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,910
I'll find a way to save you.

343
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,540
Do you think I'm stupid?

344
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,600
The Mantra of Inner Body Cleansing.

345
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,120
It's easy.

346
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,810
If you help me find the corpse of my senior,

347
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,210
I'll tell it to you.

348
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,450
Otherwise, there will be nothing to be discussed.

349
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,260
The corpse of your senior, Shan Gudao,

350
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,590
has long become soil.

351
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Even if it became soil,

352
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
according to our agreement,

353
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,220
if you have it,

354
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,080
I'll swap with you.

355
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,060
If you don't have it, I don't have what you want either.

356
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,680
Are you really not afraid of death?

357
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,130
I already died ten years ago.

358
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
Then I'll kill Qiao Wanmian.

359
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
Bullying the weak

360
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,370
is more unjust, isn't it?

361
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,780
Then I'll wipe out the Baichuan Court.

362
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,270
Even if you wipe out the whole world, it has nothing to do with me.

363
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,370
Let go of him!

364
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
Don't you know he's in poor health?

365
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,940
He even doesn't care about his life.

366
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,000
What do you care about?

367
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,120
Listen carefully.

368
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,910
I don't care what happened between you two.

369
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,560
A gentleman uses words but not his fists.

370
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,170
I won't go easy on you if you keep doing this.

371
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,610
I don't believe you don't care about anything.

372
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,340

Hey,

There's a misunderstanding.

Make it up.

382
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,360
Enough.

I just want to remind you

384
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,990
although Fei is not skilled in martial arts,

385
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,990
he's cruel when he fights.

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,410
Fei

561
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,960
met someone secretly yesterday.

562
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,350
I also followed that person.

563
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,480
Unfortunately, that person ran away.

564
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,310
But I'm sure

565
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,720
he must be hiding something from us.

566
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,000
The background of Fei

567
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,600
is definitely not simple.

568
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,860
Don't worry.

569
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,310
I've known him for over ten years.

570
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,470
I know him very well.

571
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,910
You've known each other for over ten years?

572
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,440
Didn't you only meet him once?

573
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,200
Yes.

574
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,100
I didn't meet him often,

575
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,070
but I know him well.

576
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,490
It's going to rain soon.

577
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,530
Hurry up and go.

578
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,240
Don't change the subject.

579
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,330
Tell me.

581
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,270
looks abnormal,

582
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,860
right?

583
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,080
He also has a bad temper.

584
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,850
This person

585
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
is obsessed with martial arts.

586
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,130
That's why he's short-sighted.

587
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,780
Don't take it to heart.

588
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,200
But his only strength

589
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,790
is that his martial art skills are unpredictable.

590
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,410
So you'd better not provoke him.

591
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,660
His martial art skills are unpredictable?

592
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,090
You're not good at telling lies.

593
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,590
I've said it anyway.

594
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,700
Believe it or not.

595
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,510
Wait.

596
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,970
You said you've known each other for over ten years

597
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,170
and that you know each other well.

598
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,300
So I'm the only one who doesn't know anything?

599
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,930
I'm not okay with it.

600
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,300
After all, both of you are relying on me now.

601
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,370
I must know my people well.

602
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,620
Let me ask you now.

603
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,150
Where is your birthplace?

604
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,430
How many people are there in your family?

605
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,650
What hobbies do you have?

606
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,740
To be honest,

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,900
I have an elder brother named Li Lianpeng.

I have no ambition.

611
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,930
My only hobbies are drinking tea,

613
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,320
I don't believe you.

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,470
You asked me.

615
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,730

I've never seen this color before.

I wonder what kind of lotuses they are.

647
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,890
To be honest,

648
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,630
our master loves lotuses.

649
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,070
He elaborately developed a secret way to grow lotuses.

That's why these colorful lotuses are so precious.

651

If you punished the servant cruelly,

She was involved in the martial arts world.

I thought it was an accident.

713

But the fact that they happened in a row made them suspicious.

714
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,340
I must investigate it.

715
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,100

I remarried ten years ago.

720
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,040
I didn't expect the bride

721
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,820
to be accidentally drowned on the wedding night.

722
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,080
Seven years ago, I remarried again.

723
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,850
But the same tragedy happened.

724
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
So I decided

725
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,630
not to get married anymore.

726
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,900
I didn't expect that after so many years,

727
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,720
the same tragedy happened to my son's new bride.

728
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,940
I really don't know why the Guo family is so unlucky.

729
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,940
I heard that the three brides

730
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,540
died in the same wedding dress.

731
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,530
Ms. Jiang.

732
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,370
You've been in Cailian Manor for many years, right?

733
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,630
Have you experienced these?

734
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,050
They all wore the grand Pomegranate Dress of Cailian Manor

735
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,100
and drowned in the pond.

736
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,860
I saw it with my own eyes.

737
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,270
There must be something wrong with the wedding dress.

738
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,860
-There must be something wrong.
-Shut up!

739
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,830
People in the town like to gossip

740
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,320
and spread rumors.

741
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,510
So we didn't make the funeral public this time.

742
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,159
Master Guo,

743
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,080
you don't believe the brides died from the wedding dress.

744
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,480
But there's a long interval between each wedding.

745
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,929
Why did the three brides

746
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,530
wear the same wedding dress?

747
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,730
My ancestors were Zhao people.

748
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,460
Pomegranate Dress

749
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,440
was passed down through generations.

750
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,750
Every generation of our descendants must pass it down.

751
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,900
I'm not interested in how these people died.

752
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,190
I just want to know where Shi Hun is.

753
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,600
Shi Hun?

754
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,300
Who is Shi Hun?

755
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,840
His right hand has six fingers.

756
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,360
His body got burnt before,

757
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,920
so he's ugly.

758
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,020
After hearing what I said,

759
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,980
do you know who I was talking about?

760
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,640
I've never seen anyone who has six fingers.

761
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,070
Why did you ask it?

762
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,360
You really don't know?

763
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,950
You'd better think it through.

764
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,720
You wretch, how dare you be here?

765
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,030
How dare you be here?

766
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:17,320
Look! What a beautiful lotus!

767
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,050
[Cailian Manor. Guo Kun.]

768
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,030
-Where are you going?
-Uncle. Uncle.

769
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,140
Uncle.

770
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,440
Stop it, Uncle.

771
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,350
Brother. Brother.

772
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,720
I've told you to keep an eye on your uncle.

773
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,880
Why did you come here?

774
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,910
I have guests.

775
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,860
I'm sorry, Father.

776
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,150
It's my fault.

777
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,980
[Cailian Manor. Guo Huo.]

778
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,360
I'll take the punishment later.

779
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,500
I asked you to keep an eye on your uncle.

780
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,450
Why did you let him come here

781
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,660
and startle the guests?

782
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,800
I'm sorry.

783
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,190
This is my younger brother, Guo Kun.

784
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,910
He's got a strange disease since he was little.

785
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,060
He's a little crazy.

786
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,740
This is my son, Guo Huo.

787
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,180
Please forgive him.

788
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,580
This is my younger brother, Guo Kun.

789
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,090
He got a strange disease when he was young.

790
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,200
He's a little crazy.

791
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,890
I'm sorry.

792
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,740
This is my son, Guo Huo.

793
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,830
Guo Huo. Guo Huo. Guo Huo.

794
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,820
Uncle.

795
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:08,580
Take him away.

796
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,370
Take him away.

797
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,140
Uncle.

798
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,240
You can't run away.

799
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,140
You can't run away.

800
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,350
When my brother has an attack,

801
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
only I can stop him.

802
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,410
Please excuse me.

803
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,440
Master Guo, there's no hurry.

804
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,030
I have a request.

805
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,310
I heard Cailian Manor is famous for its lotuses.

806
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,370
I wonder if we can

807
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,990
admire the lotuses in the manor?

808
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:32,700
OK.

809
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,630
Please go ahead.

810
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,420
Be careful.

811
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,010
Along the way, there are Shoushan stones which Master bought at a high price.

812
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,000
Don't touch them.

813
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
The master who was prevaricating.

814
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,660
The madman who suddenly broke in.

815
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,440
The young master who seemed to be compliant.

816
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,970
And the housekeeper who talked strangely .

817
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,280
Why did they all look weird?

818
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,270
The three women married into the Guo family in succession.

819
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,700
They had no connection.

820
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,580
But they all died in the pond of Cailian Manor.

821
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,200
What a coincidence!

822
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,410
So there must be some secrets

823
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,370
hidden in Cailian Manor.

824
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,370
I'm here to look for Shi Hun,

825
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,250
not to investigate cases.

826
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,890
I don't want to listen to your analysis.

827
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,660
Fei.

828
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,980
Why are you so impatient?

829
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,480
I didn't finish speaking yet.

830
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,290
But you interrupted.

831
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,050
He just wanted to ask

832
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,430
the past about Shi Hun.

833
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,930
Wait.

834
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,860
What are you talking about?

835
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,680
Is there the past

836
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,680
I don't know?

837
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,610
When we find Shi Hun,

838
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,940
you'll know it.

839
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,100
Let's go.

840
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,980
Enjoy!

841
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,640
This is the best place to admire the lotuses.

842
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,410
Thank you.

843
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,140
This is indeed a good place.

844
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,550
It's such a big pond.

845
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,820
Maybe we can catch fish.

846
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,930
It's useless for you to be anxious.

847
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,400
What if Master Guo hides something deliberately?

848
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,230
If you ask him now, you'll alert him.

849
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,380
Why don't you

850
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,990
investigate the case about Cailian Manor

851
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,880
and find out what happened ten years ago?

852
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,500
Maybe there will be new clues.

853
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,970
You still want me to help you investigate the case.

854
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,750
It's easy.

855
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,290
I'll go and torture Guo Qian.

856
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,580
Fei.

857
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,630
Don't act recklessly.

858
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,500
Fang Duobing, don't chase him.

859
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,080
Let him go.

860
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,230
He has no experience in investigating cases.

861
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,140
He's also violent.

862
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,710
If he gets angry and hits others,

863
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,140
then...

864
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,290
He won't. Don't worry.

865
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,360
He's an adult.

866
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,050
Li Lianhua.

867
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,820
I'm becoming more and more curious.

868
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,440
Do you trust him that much?

869
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,190
Trust?

870
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
The deceased hasn't been buried yet.

871
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,980
Why don't we go to the mourning hall and burn incense sticks for her?

872
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,470
Let's go.

873
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:58,760
You...

874
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,940
The coffin should be kept here for seven days.

875
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,670
Only three days passed, but no one is here now.

876
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,250
People of Cailian Manor really don't care about

877
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,610
this young madam who just died.

878
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,900
Look.

879
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,610
Abdominal distension.

880
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,640
There's water inside.

881
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,150
It does look like she drowned.

882
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,760
The body is swollen.

883
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,300
The spots are light red.

884
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,890
It does look like the spots appeared slowly

885
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,080
because the body was soaked before.

886
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,220
She has a lot of bruises on her neck.

887
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,920
What are you doing?

888
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,760
Young Master Guo.

889
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,610
There's still something fishy about your wife's death.

890
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,160
We want to check it again

891
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,760
to bring justice to the deceased.

892
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,940
What should be checked has already been checked.

893
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,020
She has already passed away.

894
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,080
Please don't disturb the deceased.

895
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,500
Young Master Guo.

896
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,660
To be honest,

897
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,910
your wife appeared in my dream a few days ago.

898
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,970
She cried and expressed her grievances.

899
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,910
She said she couldn't rest in peace.

900
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,660
That's why we came to Cailian Manor.

901
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,600
She appeared in your dream?

902
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,180
This is the master of Lotus Tower.

903
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,080
People call him Physician Li.

904
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,340
He's psychic.

905
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,100
His dreams are believable.

906
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,230
Even so,

907
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,230
I should tell my father first

908
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,070
and get his permission.

909
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,880
You seem to be afraid of Master Guo.

910
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,400
It's right and proper that children obey their fathers' orders.

911
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,560
Young Master Guo.

912
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,630
Now that the coffin has been opened,

913
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,430
she's already been offended.

914
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,400
I'll apologize to Master Guo later.

915
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,900
If he really blames us,

916
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,270
I'll take full responsibility.

917
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,720
This body didn't just have superficial injuries.

918
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,870
Her carpal bones were fractured.

919
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,310
Her cervical spine was also severely damaged.

920
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,920
We never hit her.

921
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,080
The people from the government have already investigated before.

922
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,170
They said the bride fell into the water by accident

923
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,580
and that the injuries were caused when she struggled.

924
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,310
It doesn't seem she was beaten up.

925
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,700
Young Master Guo.

926
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,680
Is there anything happened before the bride died?

927
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,230
There was nothing special.

928
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,120
After she had dinner that night,
