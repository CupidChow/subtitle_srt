You must be hungry.

7
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,310
I knew you like lively places.

8
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,039
But you're here to keep me company.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,090
That's enough.

10
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,880
Time is running out.

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,320
I have to find out

12
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,440

I have to make a trip back to Sigu Sect.

15
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,770
Could it be that my Lord knew Li Xiangyi was alive?

16
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,570
Maybe he had met Li Xiangyi.

17
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,710
Why wasn't he surprised?

18
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,770
If it's true,

19
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,280
why did he hide all these from me?

20
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,079
He still doesn't believe me.

21
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,960
Did the people sent to investigate the Yuanbao Villa

22
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,640
manage to find anything suspicious?

23
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,579
There was a mysterious owner of the Lotus Tower

24

called Li Lianhua.

25
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,130
His identity is a mystery, we couldn't find anything about him.

26

But his appearance and age are similar to Li Xiangyi's.

27

But, back in the Yipin Tomb,

28
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,340
my Lord met him in person.

29
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,930
You mean,

30
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,890
my Lord didn't kill him then unexpectedly?

31
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,470
Is Li Lianhua

32
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,720
related to Li Xiangyi in some way?

33
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,840
I shall send someone to bring him here

No need to rush.

36

Don't alert them.

Li Xiangyi loved Qiao Wanmian very much back then.

If he were alive,

43
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,360

She didn't tell Shan Gudao about you.

Before she died,

she simply entrusted you to Eldest Sister and her husband.

165
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,450
She hoped you could grow up safely,

found out about you.

173

and wanted to take you with him.

But you were still young

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,590
and sickly.

177
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,060
How could you have roamed the martial world with him?

178
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,870
Of course, your father and I refused.

How can I let others take you away as they please?

Shan Gudao ultimately

185
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,740
respected your mother's last wish.

186
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,220
He never tried to reconnect with you again.

187
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,790
He only told you he was my long-lost brother,

188
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,930
and let you take him as your uncle instead.

189
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,540
Besides,

190
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,260
Shan Gudao was devoted to his status and career.

191
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,480
He can't be a husband

192
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,530
or a father.

193
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,760
What's so good about the people from the martial world?

194
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,160
All of them are indifferent to family

195
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,070
and unpredictable in nature.

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,130
Fang Xiaobao,

197
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,300
don't be like them.

198
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,970
Do you hear me?

199
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,610
How could he possibly be like that?

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,070
Xiaobao is a good child who cares about his family.

201
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,770
Eldest Sister.

202
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,280
You raised him yourself.

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,640
Don't you know he's the most sensible and filial?

204
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,030
Mother.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,450
These are all old matters to me.

206
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,560
I just wanted to understand the truth

207
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,630
to stop making mistakes.

208
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,670
In my heart,

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,600
you and my father are my closest kin.

210
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,400
This fact will never change.

211
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,970
It's good that you know it.

212
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,930
Your biological parents are gone.

213
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,190
You are my son.

214
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,780
If I don't care about you, who will I care about?

215
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,520
Alright.

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,130
Now that we've made it clear,

217
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,450
we'll never talk about it again.

218
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,320
Don't mention this again.

219
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,870
Do you hear me?

220
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,950
And you,

221
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,600
don't try to take advantage of this matter

222
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,320
and act pitifully or throw a tantrum.

223
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,730
Got it, Mother.

224
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,530
Are you still thinking about roaming the martial world?

225
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,300
Well...

226
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,970
Let me tell you.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,950
I've activated all the major formation

228
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,230
outside the Tianji Mountain Manor.

229
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
You want to sneak out?

230
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,380
No way.

231
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,540
Just stay at home obediently

232
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,450
and marry the princess later.

233
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,450
That's the right thing to do.

234
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,440
Mother.

235
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,180
Please discipline your sister.

236
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,180
If you think you can, go ahead.

237
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,640
So beautiful.

238
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,400
I used to treat you

239
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,620
as a relative I had never met before.

240
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,710
I never thought of looking into your past.

241
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,490
What did you look like?

242
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,490
What did you like

243
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,810
and dislike?

244
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,300
I have no clue.

245
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
Fang Xiaobao.

246
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,200
I knew you would come here.

247
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,780
Did she draw all these?

248
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,290
She liked to draw things she liked

249
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,900
and things that looked interesting.

250
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,260
Have you seen this item before?

251
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,390
It's probably a rare item

252
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,790
your mother saw somewhere.

253
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,110
I don't know what it is, though.

254
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,890
I've seen this

255
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,150
ice shard before.

256
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,120
The Jinyuan Alliance seems to really want it.

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,290
But where did my mother see it?

258
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,600
It's definitely not from Tianji Hall.

259
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,090
But looking at these teeth marks,

260
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,660
I think they seem to correspond to a lock.

261
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,920
A lock?

262
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,850
You mean,

263
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,010
this ice shard is actually a key?

264
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,800
It's like a key to some kind of mechanism.

265
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,470
But it's not a technique from the Central Plains.

266
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,210
I understand now.

267
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,270
What do you understand?

268
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,460
I understand now, Aunt.

269
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,050
Aunt.

270
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,030
You don't need to understand.

271
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,640
Li Lianhua won't understand either.

272
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,190
I'll show him

273
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,670
what a detective of Baichuan Court is capable of.

274
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,880
Show some respect to Physician Li.

[Yuanbao Villa]

276
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,530
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

277
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,720
[Lotus Tower Medical Center]

278
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,080
Back then, Qiao Wanmian refused to leave

279
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,190
after Li Xiangyi died.

280
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,010
Xiao Zijin didn't want to go against her will.

281
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,040
He hoped she could gradually get over her old love.

282
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,660
So he expanded and built the Mumian Villa

283
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,470
in the old residence of the Sigu Sect.

284
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,760
He stayed here with her ever since.

285
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,300
No matter what,

286
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,510
this is the hometown of the Sigu Sect.

287
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,460
Xiao Zijin wants to marry Qiao Wanmian

288
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,430
and hold their wedding here.

289
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,730
How is that appropriate?

290
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,830
Li Xiangyi has been dead for ten years.

291
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,190
The Sigu Sect was long gone.

292
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,460
Things have changed.

293
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,080
Be it a relative or a friend, we all need to move on.

294
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,860
Sigu Sect was not an ordinary sect in the martial world.

295
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,370
Li Xiangyi was also the embodiment of justice and chivalry.

296
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,860
I have no intention

297
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,840
of intervening in the wedding.

298
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,520
But if the old residence of Sigu Sect

299
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,410
allows the disbanding of Sigu Sect

300
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,270
and intends to erase traces of Li Xiangyi's legacy,

301
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,650
I will be the first one to refuse.

302
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,790
That's right.

303
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,609
Chaos has yet to descend upon the martial world,

304
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,980
but there are signs of trouble everywhere.

305
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,260
Sigu Sect was born out of the passion

306
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,810
to instill justice in the martial world.

307
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,540
It should not be forgotten at this moment.

308
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,670
Have you heard?

309
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,329
Di Feisheng, the villain head of the Jinyuan Alliance

310
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,319
has recovered from his old injuries.

311
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,150
He's establishing his prestige everywhere.

312
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,800
He even declared war on Baichuan Court.

313
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,450
Do you think

314
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,150
the Jinyuan Alliance

315
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,710
will come and mess up the wedding?

316
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,070
Your old injury

317
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,390
doesn't look too bad.

318
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,170
I've prescribed a prescription for removing blood stasis.

319
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,990
You need to let go of your past records.

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,950
Ten coins.

321
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,010
Ten coins for a stupid prescription?

322
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,470
Such a lucrative business.

323
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,350
What a coincidence.

324
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,820
This kind of nonsense

325
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,280
is worthless, my friend.

326
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,900
Let me remind you.

Don't be fooled again.

329

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:14,800
Come.

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,510
Come and have a look.

336
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,590
This man

337
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,470
calls himself a miracle physician.

338
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,630
But he has no benevolence or compassion.

339
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,180

340
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,380
and deceives you with no remorse.

341
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,410
You'd be a fool to believe him.

your tongue will rot.

366

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,900
Don't take it seriously.

376
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,360
Miracle Healer with Needles.

377
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,770
Nice to meet you.

378
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,180
Look.

379
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,100
He ran away so soon.

380
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,280
What would you like to order?

381
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,430
Mr. Li.

382
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,710
Order whatever you want today.

383
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,320
My treat.

384
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,170
Manager.

385
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,240
Sir.

386
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,760
What did I tell you

387
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,740
when I booked the whole inn?

388
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,090
You said

389
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,690
you will pay for the expenses

390
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,620
of all the guests in the inn.

391
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,120
But there is one condition.

392
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,640
The man wearing plain clothes

393
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,950
with a blue bag on his waist,

394
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,740
called Li Lianhua,

395
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,640
is not allowed to enter the inn.

396
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,130
Not...

397
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,030
Are you...

398
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,850
I am

399
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,610
the guest who is not allowed to be here.

400
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,640
What are you waiting for?

401
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,470
Clear the table.

402
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,790
-Hurry.
-Wait, Fang Duobing.

403
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,580
What's the meaning of this?

404
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,810
Did Mr. Li offend you?

405
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Besides,

406
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,090
you've made it so hard for us to get along.

407
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,880
Why are you doing this?

408
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,330
Wrong.

409
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm not old and I don't want to die.

410
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,160
And it's not me

411
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,380
who didn't want to get along with Mr. Li.

412
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,130
It's Mr. Li's fault.

413
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,560
Fang Xiaobao!

414
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,440
How can you talk to Mr. Li like that?

415
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,270
Mr. Li.

416
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,860
Our kid is immature.

417
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,030
Please forgive him.

418
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,220
Aunt.

419
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,690
Why are you here?

420
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,350
Manager.

421
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,190
Prepare the best guest room and food for Mr. Li.

422
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,140
Okay, I'll go now.

423
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,090
Aunt, why are you still helping him?

424
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,220
He's a hypocrite

425
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,890
who goes against his words.

426
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,070
Stop talking!

427
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,650
Come with me.

428
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,030
Where are we going?

429
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:18,880
Go.

430
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,990
Li Lianhua, wait and see.

431
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,250
Go now.

432
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,870
Mr. Li,

433
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,490
I've figured out the Nanyin Script

434
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,420
you asked me to check last time.

435
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
But, there are many people here.

436
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,140
Let's go out for a walk.

437
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,270
Wait.

438
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,150
Senior Li.

439
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,930
I have a question for you.

440
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,200
I have a patient

441
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,670
who suffers from poison-induced madness.

442
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,330
He said he saw ghosts in the day

443
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,600
and was often in a panicked state.

444
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,770
He also couldn't sleep at night.

445
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,530
Later, he started killing people

446
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,450
and became extremely irritable.

447
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,740
I have prescribed medication for several days

448
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
and pierced his acupoints with silver needles.

449
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,170
But even now, there's no sign of improvement.

450
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,840
If the patient is from the martial world

451
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,010
and has decent inner power,

452
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,550
you can try to process fresh tiger palms

453
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,090
and let the patient eat it.

454
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,040
The tiger palm is extremely poisonous.

455
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,230
It should not be taken without proper preparation.

456
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,770
This is undoubtedly a risky gamble of strength

457
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,090
between the poison and the patient's inner power.

458
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,050
Such a gamble is as good as murder.

459
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,190
It's just fighting fire with fire.

460
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,350
If the patient wants to be sober,

461
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,370
they can take a risk.

462
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,950
If the patient lacks inner power,

463
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,750
I suggest consuming the

464
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,010
tiger palm after soaking it in medicinal soup.

465
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,850
Although the tiger palm is highly poisonous,

466
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,700
it can delay or shorten the time of frenzy.

467
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,770
When treating people and saving lives,

468
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,040
you can't suggest a treatment you're not certain of.

469
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,730
How can you be sure that

470
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,660
the patient won't die after taking the tiger palm?

471
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,980
I can't be sure of that.

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,180
You're disregarding human lives!

473
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,460
Guan,

474
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,900
as long as someone can detoxify the poison with pure inner power,

475
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,980
the patient won't be in danger.

476
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,690
How many people in the world have such power?

477
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,910
Pure inner power must be referring to Yangzhouman.

478
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,440
How can he bring Li Xiangyi back to life?

479
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,440
This method of using one's life to test the poison

480
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,080
is so cruel and vicious.

481
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,330
Why are you still defending him?

482
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,980
[Mumian Villa]

483
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,120
Your makeup is too plain, my lady.

484
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,530
Tomorrow, you should wear the golden phoenix and pearl

485
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,960
headpiece that Mr. Xiao chose.

486
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,420
After all, it's a wedding.

487
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,160
Mr. Xiao followed your instructions and kept everything simple.

488
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,260
In consideration of your habit and preference,

489
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,920
he made this old residence your new home,

490
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
and won't move out after marriage.

491
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,170
He thought of you in everything he did.

492
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,340
Am I too willful?

493
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,470
Zijin has

494
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,080
always fancied grand events.

495
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,760
I talked too much.

496
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,870
Mr. Xiao always goes along with your choices.

497
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,780
He said,

498
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,990
as long as you ask,

499
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,810
he's willing to die for you.

500
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,590
Why would I ask him to die for me?

501
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,800
I hate

502
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,110
people who abandoned everything

503
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,770
and readily choose death.

504
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,140
Mr. Li.

505
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,230
Mr. Li.

506
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,470
It's really you.

507
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,950
Why are you wearing a mask?

508
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,550
As a physician of the martial world,

509
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,620
it's natural that I have a lot of enemies.

510
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,250
With this mask,

511
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,330
I feel more at ease.

512
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,510
I see.

513
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,740
The people going in and out of Mumian Villa recently

514
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,820
are all from the martial world.

515
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,480
Better safe than sorry.

516
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,610
That's right.

517
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,310
I heard that the scenery of Mumian Villa

518
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,330
is really amazing.

519
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,210
I just want to see it myself.

520
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,120
I don't know if I can go in.

521
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,360
Why didn't you ask me?

522
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,830
I was about to visit Sister Qiao.

523
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,650
You know Miss Qiao?

524
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,270
Guan is close to Mr. Xiao.

525
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,150
I got to know Miss Qiao when they

526
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,810
brought me to Qingfeng Peak to sightsee.

527
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,020
Back then,

528
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,210
she waited for ten years

529
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,480
to confirm the death of Li Xiangyi.

530
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,250
She even built a cenotaph for him.

531
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,530
Ten years.

532
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,520
That's such a long time.

533
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,180
And yet, Mr. Xiao kept by her side

534
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,440
with such devotion.

535
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,490
It's not easy for them

536
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,020
to finally marry each other.

537
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,690
The person of the past has died.

538
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,270
The living

539
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,060
should cherish the present life.

540
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,080
By the way,

541
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,800
you mentioned you've figured out the Nanyin Script.

542
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,900
I was looking for a chance to give it to you.

543
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,010
I almost forgot.

544
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,320
Look.

545
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,100
This is the meaning of the Nanyin Script.

546
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,880
[Burn your body]

547
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,050
[Suiyan. A mark of a fiend from Nanyin. This mark represents revenge and devour.]

548
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,780
[Statue of the Suiyan fiend]

549
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,870
Burn your body.

550
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,720
It's like a sacrificial text.

551
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,010
Do you know its origin?

552
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Grandpa said the same thing.

553
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,530
Unfortunately, there are too few historical records

554
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,610
about Nanyin.

555
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,850
He hasn't found anything about its background and origin.

556
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,530
However,

557
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,940
look at this.

558
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,670
He found the mark you drew.

559
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,450
This mark is called Suiyan.

560
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,880
It's said to be the mark of a fiend in Nanyin.

561
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,290
This mark represents revenge and devour.

562
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,020
Grandpa said

563
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,270
it's the same as a sacrificial poem.

564
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,540
He's investigating it in this direction.

565
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,150
Revenge and devour.

566
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,030
What does the Jinyuan Alliance want?

567
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,110
What is the connection between the Nanyin Script,

568
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,000
the Nanyin Incense, and the death of Senior?

569
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,600
Sister Qiao.

570
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,920
Sister Qiao.

571
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:45,960
Xiaoyong.

572
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,710
Mr. Li.

573
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,140
Why are you here together?

574
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,890
It's Sister Qiao's wedding day.

575
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,400
Of course, I need to come and absorb some festive luck.

576
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,830
Mr. Li is also here.

577
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,220
I...

578
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,010
So Mr. Li

579
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,310
is the one in your heart?

580
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,300
Mr. Li

581
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,460
is a very good person.

582
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,740
Sister Qiao.

583
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,910
Tomorrow is the wedding.

584
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:09,870
Are you happy?

585
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,360
Of course I am.

586
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,200
It's rare to meet your other half.

587
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,570
Congratulations, Miss Qiao.

588
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,000
I brought some wedding candies as a gift.

589
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,900
It's nothing much.

590
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,860
Thank you, sir.

591
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,500
It's very considerate of you.

592
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,940
I've heard a lot about this villa's great scenery.

593
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,110
May I

594
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,920
stroll the villa on my own?

595
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,900
Sure, Mr. Li.

596
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,380
Just leave Xiaoyong here to chat with me.

597
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,150
Sister Qiao.

598
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,930
Mr. Li is not good at talking and socializing.

599
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,930
Sister Qiao, please don't be mad at him.

600
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,270
The candies

601
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,590
may not be very expensive,

602
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,950
but he must have prepared them sincerely.

603
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,290
I haven't said a thing,

604
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,510
but you're so eager to defend him.

605
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,170
Actually, the wedding candies he gave me

606
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,300
made me feel

607
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,400
very nostalgic.

00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,560
You said you were looking for the remains of Shan Gudao.

703

714

716
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,670

is also involved.

721
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,010
I know you definitely don't know that

722

those symbols are not important.

723
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,010

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,980
I can't tell you where the incense remains came from,

745
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,820
but I have no ill intentions.

746
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,660
I trust you, Mr. Li.

747
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,580
After we go down the mountain,

748
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,810
I'll pass it to my grandpa with a pigeon.

749
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,890
Thank you.

750
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,860
But I have something else

751
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,890
to ask you.

752
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,830
I heard that there are thumb-sized items

753
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,240
in Nanyin that looked like ice shards.

754
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,560
It is said that

755
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,680
it's related to

756
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,770
the fiend mark and sacrificial poem.

757
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,330
Have you heard of it?

758
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll ask Grandpa about that too.

759
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,420
After the wedding tomorrow,

760
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,820
why don't you stay at Qingfeng Peak

761
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,690
for a few more days?

762
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,870
We can enjoy the beautiful scenery in the mountain

763
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,500
while we wait for Grandpa's news.

764
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,080
Okay.

765
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,230
Tomorrow is the wedding.

766
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,090
I hope everything goes well.

767
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,010
Congratulations.

768
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,239
Please come in.

769
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,260
Congratulations.

770
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,760
Thank you.

771
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:31,909
Congratulations.

772
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,199
Mr. Xiao.

773
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,420
Congratulations.

774
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,940
You came after all.

775
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,390
Come in.

776
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,360
Brother Li.

777
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,360
Aunt.

778
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,430
Look over there.

779
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
Li Lianhua.

780
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,910
Mr. Li, how have you been?

781
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,240
Not bad.

782
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,220
He refused to be your wedding company yesterday.

783
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,740
But now he's standing

784
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,340
with Miss Su.

785
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,300
He completely disregarded you, the third most

786
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,240
beautiful woman in the Martial world.

787
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,820
-How dare he!
-That’s right.

788
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,200
He doesn't know what's good for him.

789
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,120
You have to teach him a lesson.

790
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,550
I won't give up

791
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,400
until I get Li Lianhua.

792
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,110
What do you mean get him?

793
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,260
Are you hot, Mr. Li?

794
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,920
Physician Li,

795
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,960
I invited you to enjoy the moon and drink with me last night.

796
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,140
But you were already asleep.

797
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,010
Why don't you sit next to me later

798
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,900
and make up for the owed wine?

799
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,020
Ms. He.

800
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,230
I'm not a good drinker.

801
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,270
If I got drunk at this banquet,

802
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,360
it would be rude of me.

803
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,390
Mr. Li already said that.

804
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,160
Why are you forcing him, Sister He?

805
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,050
Mr. Li, you'd better sit next to me.

806
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,290
It's not your turn to talk, Su.

807
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
But I want to talk.

808
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,240
Go ahead then.

809
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,480
I said, he must sit with me.

810
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,210
-He was going to sit with me.
-Here comes the bride.

811
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,760
She's here.

812
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,900
Mian.

813
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,430
You have to be good to yourself.

814
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,300
Come on.

815
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,180
[Peace and Bliss]

816
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,710
Thank you for coming all the way here.

817
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,400
Please forgive me if the reception

818
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,210
is not up to standard.

819
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,120
Drink, everyone.

820
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,930
Here.

821
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,550
Mr. Ji.

822
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,510
Happy wedding.

823
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,820
Thank you for coming.

824
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,110
I'll drink to show my respect.

825
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,910
Congratulations.

826
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,600
Brother Ji, have a seat.

827
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,110
Mr. Bai.

828
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,180
Brother Xiao.

829
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,400
Your long-cherished wish has finally come true.

830
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,390
Congratulations.

831
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,330
Brother Bai, you know that

832
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,120
Baichuan Court is like a home to Wanmian.

833
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,530
You are like her family.

834
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,970
I don't care what others say.

835
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,790
It's enough to receive

836
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,750
her family's blessings.

837
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,230
Brother Xiao,

838
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,280
you and Ms. Qiao are a perfect match.

839
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,930
So many people are envious of you two.

840
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,190
Look at all the people who came

841
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,860
to celebrate your wedding for you.

842
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,890
You get drunk easily.

843
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,830
Don't drink too much.

844
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,830
The wedding wine won't get you drunk. Come on.

845
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,920
That's right.

846
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,280
Have a seat, Mr. Bai.

847
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,970
Miss Shishui.

848
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,950
Look at her.

849
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,470
She has always been impatient.

850
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,940
She even drank the wedding wine first.

851
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,030
Miss Shishui has always admired Xiangyi.

852
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,010
She doesn't like me.

853
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,830
It doesn't matter.

854
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,370
But Wanmian and I

855
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,720
didn't do anything wrong

856
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,910
to Xiangyi.

857
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,560
I feel much better today.

858
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,580
Great!

859
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,310
You drink.

860
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,390
Here, please.

861
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,070
Have some appetizers.

862
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,710
Come on.

863
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,010
Alright, sit down.

864
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,520
Congratulations on your marriage with Ms. Qiao.

865
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,230
When Wanmian wrote the invitations,

866
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,410
she specifically asked me

867
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,580
to invite you, Physician Li.

868
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,710
She wanted to thank you

869
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,510
for bringing solid news about the death of Xiangyi.

870
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,870
I'm glad too.

871
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,670
-Well…
-Mr. Xiao.

872
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,400
Today is a day of celebration

873
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,760
for you and Ms. Qiao.

874
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,770
It has nothing to do with the dead.

875
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,370
You should enjoy yourself.

876
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,030
Congratulations.

877
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,910
Mr. Xiao,

878
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,890
you're not being very honest.

879
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,650
What do you mean by glad?

880
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,240
What would you have done

881
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,830
if Li Xiangyi came back alive?

882
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,410
Please forgive him, Mr. Xiao.

883
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,670
Xiaobao talks nonsense

884
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,070
when he gets drunk.

885
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,930
May you and Ms. Qiao have a long

886
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,830
and happy marriage.

887
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,280
It doesn't matter.

888
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,560
Enjoy yourselves.

889
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,690
Have a seat.

890
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:45,850
Come on.

891
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,380
Fang Xiaobao,

892
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,370
I know you like Li Xiangyi.

893
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,350
You hate to hear people criticize him.

894
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,850
But he's having a wedding.

895
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,150
What are you being so snarky?

896
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,350
To win a beauty's heart, you have to rely on your own ability.

897
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,720
I think you are

898
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,380
just full of mean energy.

899
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,030
Why don't you go outside

900
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,960
and fight in the sparring arena?

901
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,950
Don't make trouble here.

902
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,290
Fine, I don't fancy this wine anyway.

903
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,330
Watch your back.

904
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,250
Direct your Qi downward

905
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,330
and turn the tide.

906
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,650
Bravo! Bravo!

907
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,560
Good swordsmanship.

908
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,490
Good skills.

909
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,420
Di Feisheng is here.

910
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,900
Inform Xiao Zijin immediately.

911
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,090
Who is sending messages to help me?

912
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,030
Fang Duobing is fine.

913
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,780
Looks like you've taught him Yangzhouman.

914
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,530
If you had taught him ten years ago,

915
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,400
he could have used his inner power to detoxify you

916
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,120
and save your life.

917
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,060
But now, the Yangzhouman

918
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,240
can only keep him safe.

919
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,460
You're not here just to test Fang Duobing.

920
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,300
What are you doing here?

921
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,750
I just checked.

922
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,960
Prison 188.

923
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
The first Heaven Prison is here.

924
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,060
King Xunming of Yama is also here.

925
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm here to take him away.

926
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,250
You can't find the Heaven Prison.

927
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,000
You will help me find it.

928
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,580
I don't care how much you love Qiao Wanmian.

929
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't kill women.

930
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,340
But I have no problem

931
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,580
with killing Xiao Zijin.

932
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,700
I'll take you there.

933
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,890
Okay.

934
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,660
You may leave.

935
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,910
Yes.

936
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,050
Who are you?

937
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,710
You're in my way.

938
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,510
I'll draw more cuts on you.

939
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,800
Who are you?

940
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,720
Sister Qiao!
