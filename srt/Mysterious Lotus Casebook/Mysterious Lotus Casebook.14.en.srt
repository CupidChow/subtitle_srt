[Episode 14]

4
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,979
Have fun training.

5
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,900
Li Lianhua,

6
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,020
why don't you tell me

7
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
more about my master?

8
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,030
You said too little last time.

9
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,820
I want to know more.

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,370
Don't you think your body feels hot

11
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,300
and your chest feels tight?

12
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,850
No.

13
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,250
The key to Suzhou Kuai is silence.

14
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Most importantly, talk less and be quiet.

15
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,890
If you talk, your blood will be circulated,

16
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,400
and boom! You'll explode like a firecracker.

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Do what you will with that information.

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,150
Seeking a famous physician?

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,919
Yes.

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,650
They don't even state what the illness is.

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,770
How will they find a physician like this?

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,470
I heard that the owner of Yuanbao Villa,

23
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,160
Jin Mantang, is rich.

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,640
He has a lot of money.

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,870
Even someone like this has an incurable sickness

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,000
that needs the attention of a miracle physician.

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,560
It must be an extremely tricky disease to cure.

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,010
[Medicine]

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:43,750
Did you forget?

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,150
Silence.

31
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,770
Don't talk.

32
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,910
You're asking me where I went, right?

33
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,329
It's time to depart.

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,540
You may have

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,620
the Suzhou Kuai now.

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,140
But it can only temporarily suppress the Gang Qi.

37
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,760
To eliminate all of Di Feisheng's internal power,

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,010
we need something extremely cold as a medium.

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,530
Currently, I can only think of

40
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,630
using the opal skull from Yuanbao Villa.

41
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,610
No need to reconsider.

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,170
Put on your clothes.

43
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,910
Let's go to Yuanbao Villa.

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,980
Are you afraid that the owner of the villa won't lend it to you?

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,430
Not a problem.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,880
Jin Mantang is offering a lot of money to hire a physician.

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm sure I can get in there

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,890
with my reputation as a miracle physician,

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,510
and borrow the opal skull from him.

50
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,840
Are you afraid my medical skills will be exposed?

51
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes?

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,700
Look, Fang Xiaobao.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,820
You still don't know me well after all this time.

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,710
I can even save Di Feisheng,

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,540
let alone a Jin Mantang.

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,150
What are you saying?

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
You're so annoying, Fang Xiaobao.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,100
Where did your carefree

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,540
and agreeable personality go?

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,900
Why are you nagging so much?

61
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,670
The Tianji Mountain!

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,290
So you're afraid that Yuanbao Villa

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,200
is too close to Tianji Hall,

64
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,060
and they might take you back, right?

65
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,020
I thought about it.

66
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,340
But your life is more important.

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,520
As long as you are alive,

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,790
even if you were caught,

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
you can still escape.

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,380
Isn't this your usual style?

71
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,709
Let's go.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,150
My Lord has started to suspect me.

73
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,850
He ordered Wuyan to investigate that past incident.

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
My Lord is a man of his word.

75
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,920
If he finds out about the thundering fire bombs...

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,620
Saintess,

77
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,690
you've done so much for the Jinyuan Alliance.

78
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,840
Even if my Lord knows about the past,

79
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,940
he won't blame you.

80
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,960
I did so much for the Jinyuan Alliance

81
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,470
just to make him happy.

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,840
If he doesn't care about the Jinyuan Alliance,

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,320
why should I care?

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,250
Even if you turn back time,

85
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,750
I won't regret

86
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,960
working with Wanshen Clan back then.

87
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,780
Back then, he set up 12 female guardians

88
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,650
as his right-hand man.

89
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,180
How can I tolerate having other women by his side?

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
When my Lord has nothing left,

91
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,450
he will realize that

92
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm the only one who treats him best.

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,140
You are right, Saintess.

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,890
My Lord trusts you.

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,290
Trust?

96
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,140
I'm the only one beside him now.

97
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,770
But I don't have his heart.

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,260
But it doesn't matter.

99
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,560
I will give him the whole martial world.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,930
By then,

101
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,980
he will give me his heart.

102
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,490
Granny Blood, isn't that right?

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,890
Yes, Saintess.

104
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,640
We have acquired the Rama Vessel.

105
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,300
We just need to find the four Rama Heavenly Ices

106
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,230
and open the vessel.

107
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,750
Then, we will get the searing karmic fire.

108
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,020
By then,

109
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,190
the martial arts world will bow down to you.

110
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,970
My Lord will never leave you again, Saintess.

111
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,030
OK.

112
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,710
Where is Snow Master?

113
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,020
Have you found the whereabouts of the four Heavenly Ices?

114
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,430
Yes.

115
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,790
OK.

116
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,610
Send a letter to Feng Qing.

117
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,080
I want to see his master.

118
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes.

119
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,790
It's rare to see you

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,230
in such a rush, Saintess.

121
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,140
It's also rare to see Feng Qing's master

122
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,190
in person.

123
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,340
We've been working together for ten years,

124
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,240
but you've always hid your face

125
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,120
and kept your distance.

126
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,220
It's truly frustrating.

127
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,990
You are so eager.

128
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,800
Did something good happen?

129
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,340
The four Heavenly Ices required to open the Rama Vessel

130
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,790
were handed over to four Nanyin citizens

131
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,850
who lived in hiding in the Central Plains.

132
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,100
Now, they are in the hands of their descendants.

133
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,460
I can only tell you where one of them is.

134
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,900
My men will also go to get the Heavenly Ice.

135
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,700
We'll let skills decide who gets it.

136
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,500
At the end of it, we'll negotiate

137
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,970
based on what we have.

138
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,920
What do you think?

139
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,370
Okay.

140
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,270
Let me tell you where to find the first one.

141
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,010
He is the owner of Yuanbao Villa, Jin Mantang.

142
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
He is very timid and cautious.

143
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,330
Do you plan to steal it,

144
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,850
or snatch it from him?

145
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,610
No matter what it takes,

146
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,350
I will get the Heavenly Ice.

147
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,060
You said you wanted to hide my tower?

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,190
Tianji Hall wants to capture you,

149
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,260
not burn down my tower.

150
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,630
There's no need to hide so well.

151
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,150
What?

152
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,659
No.

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,860
[Yuanbao Villa]

154
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,590
What are you here for?

155
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,570
Don't panic.

156
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,930
We are not bad people.

157
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,590
I took the physician recruitment poster,

158
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,060
and I'm here to treat your master.

159
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,580
Since you are physicians,

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
why are you dressed like this?

161
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,820
Why are you sneaking around?

162
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,390
I was collecting herbs on my way here.

163
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,900
This can repel mosquitoes.

164
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,670
Please convey my message.

165
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,680
Tell him that Li Lianhua wants to see him.

166
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,630
How dare you!

167
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,500
Are you the miracle physician who can revive the dead,

168
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,960
[Housekeeper, Jin Changbao]

169
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,410
Li Lianhua?

170
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:34,929
Yes.

171
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,039
Nice to meet you.

172
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,830
This is my assistant.

173
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,429
What a coincidence.

174
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,990
A few miracle physicians

175
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,290
happen to be in the villa right now.

176
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,340
You can have tea with them

177
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,440
and discuss medicine together.

178
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,770
Okay, thank you.

179
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Please come in.

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,970
I often heard that Master Jin Mantang has many treasures.

181
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,300
He's always ranked top ten in the list of rich men.

182
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Now that I'm here,

183
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,450
I can say that he lives up to his reputation.

184
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,400
You're too kind.

185
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,190
Stop!

186
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,510
Physician Guan.

and he suffers from vomiting and diarrhea.

189
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,570
It's clearly a case of spleen and stomach flu.

190
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,380
Let me give you some moxibustion.

191
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,340
You'll feel better in no time.

192
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,350
Physician Guan.

193
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm really fine now.

194
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,670
You have been giving me moxibustion since yesterday.

195
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,290
I'm about to be cooked.

196
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,220
Usually, people beg me to treat them.

197
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,500
[The Elusive Physician - Gongyang Wumen]

198
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,410
But they have no chance.

199
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,020
I'm in a good mood today.

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,150
You look pale

201
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,360
and your breathing is weak.

202
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,380
I thought there must be air obstruction in your organs.

203
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,460
So I took the initiative to take your pulse from a distance.

204
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,440
I didn't expect your assistant to be so ignorant.

205
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,510
I see, you're the elusive physician,

206
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,460
senior Gongyang Wumen.

207
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,010
Excuse me for the unruly behaviour.

208
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,180
I'm Li Lianhua.

209
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,610
I was caught off guard just now.

210
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,470
Please forgive me.

211
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,020
Li Lianhua?

212
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,340
You are the legendary

213
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,030
physician who can revive the dead

214
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,940
and the owner of the Lotus Tower, Li Lianhua?

215
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,500
You look quite ordinary.

216
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,180
I just know a little about medicines.

217
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,490
This is Guan Hemeng, known as the

218
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,520
Swallow Needle in the martial world.

219
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,030
So you are Guan.

220
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,420
I've never seen a medical skill that could bring back the dead.

221
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,630
Li Lianhua.

222
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,950
Let's have a competition.

223
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,410
We'll see who's better at medicine.

224
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,410
We'll... treat him!

225
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,230
Where did the mute come from?

226
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,160
So rude.

227
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,250
Little mute.

228
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,800
Are you Physician Li's assistant?

229
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,110
He hasn't made a sound yet.

230
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,120
It's none of your business.

231
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,860
Why does a mute have so much to say?

232
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,190
I don't understand what you're gesturing.

233
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,300
Silence,

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,940
and grace.

235
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,250
Guan, don't be angry.

236
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,210
He is just my assistant.

237
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,060
He's new in the martial world and doesn't know the rules.

238
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,490
Don't take it to heart.

239
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,970
When I'm free,

240
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,390
I'll definitely come to consult you.

241
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,950
Physician Li is indeed gentle and polite.

242
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,250
But you little follower

243
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,470
needs some discipline.

244
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,460
You're right.

245
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,340
Don't mind him.

246
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,500
It doesn't matter.

247
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,580
This is the physician even the King of Hell fears,

248
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,890
Jian Lingxiao.

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,430
[The ghost-feared Physician, Jian Lingxiao]

250
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,800
There's nothing wrong with your throat.

251
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,650
It's just that there's a wave

252
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,210
of Gang Qi currently suppressed in his body.

253
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,630
Since it's not an illness, it can't be cured.

254
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,150
But you should talk more

255
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,210
to help you get rid of some Gang Qi.

256
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,250
You old fox!

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,980
Silence,

258
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:02,840
and grace.

259
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,620
So he's not a mute.

260
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,060
What a pity.

261
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,420
I'll get even with you later.

262
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,820
It's such an honor to have so many miracle physicians

263

[Master of the Villa, Jin Mantang]

264
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,610
gathered here in Yuanbao Villa.

265
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,050
Are you Jin Mantang?

266
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes, I am.

267
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,130
I heard that you are seriously ill.

268
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,400
That's why you're recruiting famous physicians.

269
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,300
But looking at you now,

270
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,980
your voice is strong and clear,

271
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,050
and your face radiant and healthy.

272
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,930
It doesn't look like you're sick.

273
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,680
To be honest,

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,460
I invited you here

275
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,010
for another favor.

276
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,230
These are the letters I received

277
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,880
in the past month.

278
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,340
These letters all demand

279
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,190
that Master Jin surrender

280
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,730
all the assets of Yuanbao Villa.

281
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,880
Otherwise,

282
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,220
he will be killed.

283
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,290
Who sent these blackmail letters?

284
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,540
How outrageous.

285
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,330
Despite investigations, I have no clue.

286
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,700
Money is just a material possession.

287
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,440
To me,

288
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,290
it's not that important.

289
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,330
It's just that the family business was passed down by my ancestors.

290
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,940
How can I possibly surrender it

291
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,180
to those despicable people?

292
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,920
Now, my villa's security

293
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,100
has been reinforced.

294
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,280
It's not easy to break in.

295
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,750
But it's hard to guard against hidden arrows.

296
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,590
A servant died of poisoning recently.

297
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,470
As such, I can’t sleep or sleep well.

298
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,020
So you want us to come here

299
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,940
to keep watch of your daily life

300
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,690
and prevent any attempts at poisoning you.

301
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,980
And if something really happens,

302
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,180
there are so many great physicians here.

303
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,620
You can be at ease.

304
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,360
Right?

305
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,100
Exactly.

306
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,620
Who would have thought?

307
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,940
I'm a famous physician of the apricot forest.

308
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,470
But I was tricked here

309
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,020
to serve people to eat and sleep.

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
If you help me get through this,

311
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,910
I will reward you well.

312
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,370
You are really generous, Master Jin.

313
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,100
Looks like I didn't come here in vain.

314
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,230
Zongzheng Mingzhu?

315
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,720
Hello, you two.

316
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,280
How have you been?

317
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,490
Weren't you in prison?

318
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,360
I need to thank you.

319
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,590
If you hadn't meddled in Yu City

320
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,660
and framed me,

321
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,350
I'd still have been

322
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,650
an idle young master.

323
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,180
I would have never had the chance

324
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,020
to be the commander of the Supervision Bureau.

325
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,070
Everyone.

326
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,890
Don't panic.

327
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,320
Although I’m part of the martial world,

328
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,490
I once contributed to the court.

329
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,570
That's why I managed to get the help

330
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,120
of the Supervision Bureau and  Lord Zongzheng.

331
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,470
Arrest him!

332
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,700
Let's see who dares!

333
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,060
Who are you to arrest him?

334
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,660
Li Lianhua

335
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,390
is a con artist.

336
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,150
And murders happened everywhere he went.

337
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,740
He is very suspicious.

338
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
I think he's the one

339
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,170
blackmailing Master Jin.

340
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,240
Lord Zongzheng,

341
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,400
you're getting a little personal here.

342
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,410
I was always at the place of murder

343
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,360
because I was traveling with Detective Fang.

344
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,020
And I found the truth every time.

345
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,220
However,

346
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,180
the murderer took a turn

347
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
and cleared his name.

348
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,980
It's really interesting.

349
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,680
You...

350
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
The Supervision Bureau can only ask

351
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,140
about matters related to the court.

352
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,870
Li Lianhua is innocent.

353
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,060
He never gets involved with the court.

354
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,860
What does he have to do with the Supervision Bureau?

355
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,300
Don't you even care about the rule

356
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,860
set by the court and the martial world?

357
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:55,860
Okay.

358
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,290
I can't control Baichuan Court.

359
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,800
But this is Master Jin's villa.

360
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,260
Should we keep these

361
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
suspicious people here?

362
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,490
Master Jin.

363
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,740
Think carefully.

364
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,950
Forget it.

365
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,320
Stop arguing.

366
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,320
Fang Duobing.

367
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,010
The Supervision Bureau is deliberately against me.

368
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,820
Then I can only leave.

369
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,530
Although you, the young master of the Tianji Hall,

370
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,770
have some invincible mechanics,

371
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,180
it's all useless now.

372
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,920
Everyone.

373
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,000
See you.

374
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,070
Wait.

375
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,690
I think there must be some misunderstanding

376
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,460
between the two of you and Lord Zongzheng.

377
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,270
Since you are all my guests,

378
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,330
how can I neglect any of you?

379
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,740
Why don't you get along for now for my sake?

380
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,080
Harmony brings wealth, after all.

381
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,540
Actually, I've already prepared a banquet.

382
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,520
It's waiting for everyone to take a seat.

383
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,820
Lord Zongzheng,

384
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,100

[Yuanbao Villa]

386
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,410
Thank you for your hospitality.

387
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,780
You're welcome.

388
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,829
You said you wanted to talk to me.

389
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
Is it about setting up the mechanics?

390
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,140
Master Jin.

391
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,000
With my help,

392
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,220
I guarantee that not even a fly

393
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,460
can enter your room.

394
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,490
Outsiders can't harm you for sure.

395
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,570
Thank you, Young Master Fang.

396
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,360
It's my pleasure.

397
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,550
But I have a request.

398
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,930
Master Jin,

399
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,800
I want to borrow your opal skull.

400
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,610
What?

401
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,390
You want my opal skull?

402
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,610
This...

403
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,720
Master Jin.

404
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,020
Here's the thing.

405
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
We want to use the opal skull

406
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,570
for healing purposes.

407
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,150
It will be returned on the spot.

408
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,940
About borrowing...

409
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,360
Master Jin,

410
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,340
if it's not convenient,

411
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,620
we can leave now.

412
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,600
Goodbye.

413
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,010
Wait.

414
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,290
The opal skull is the treasure of my villa.

415
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,460
Since you want to borrow it,

416
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,360
you must show some sincerity.

417
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,180
If you can find the person

418
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,580
who intends to harm me,

419
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,140
borrowing the opal skull

420
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
will be no problem.

421
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,280
The mechanism is ready.

422
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,210
Master Jin.

423
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,360
This way.

424
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,930
This is the Thousand Bell Formation.

425
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,020
The only key to activating and deactivating

426
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,820
the formation is here in this room.

427
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,150
The formation has been activated.

428
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,700
As long as someone approaches this room,

429
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,970
they will be trapped by the sharp threads,

430
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,790
and the whole villa will be promptly informed.

431
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:16,900
This...

432
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,450
Someone broke into the formation so soon?

433
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,730
You are...

434
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
This is my goddaughter Zhiyu.

435
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,620
Godfather, I...

436
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,190
I was just passing by.

437
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,470
I didn't expect you to have guests here.

438
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,530
She is only 18

439
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,090
and rarely meets outsiders.

440
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,690
So, she's afraid of strangers.

441
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,230
Sorry for the confusion.

442
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,030
Go back now.

443
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,190
There is a formation here.

444
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,990
You can only enter with my permission from now on.

445
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,790
You may leave.

446
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,140
Let me untie you.

447
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
Your daughter is sick

448
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,290
and very weak.

449
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,690
She was born weak.

450
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,640
I've asked a physician to treat her.

451
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,390
I shan't bother you with it.

452
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,860
We'll talk about the opal skull after you have

453
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,180
captured the person who intends to harm me.

454
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,120
Master Jin.

455
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,510
He locked us out as soon as

456
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,600
I set up the formation for him.

457
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,990
It seems that I was too honest.

458
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,300
There are so many people guarding the Yuanbao Villa.

459
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,070
Now Zongzheng Mingzhu is here too.

460
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,090
If we want the opal skull,

461
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,350
we must help Jin Mantang with this matter.

462
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,660
Mr. Jian.

463
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,320
Gentlemen.

464
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,150
Mr. Jian.

465
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,940
So you live in this room.

466
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,780
I didn't expect

467
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,700
you to love flowers too.

468
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,050
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

469
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,020
You are also an expert in medicine.

470
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,860
You should know the value of these flowers.

471
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,190
Of course.

472
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,480
For example,

473
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,780
I often use this to relieve pain and bruises.

474
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,110
You mean the gelsemium?

475
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,170
The gelsemium is also called heartbreak grass.

476
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,460
How can it be consumed?

477
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,130
I brought it by accident

478
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,150
when I was picking coltsfoot.

479
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,690
I was about to throw it away.

480
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,730
I see.

481
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,430
All things in this world mutually reinforce and neutralize each other.

482
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
If I remembered correctly,

483
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,700
there is a grass called

484
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,600
the smiling Guanyin.

485
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,440
Yes, that's right.

486
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,300
It can adjust the poison of the gelsemium

487
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,460
and maintain its medicinal value.

488
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,060
It works well after taking it.

489
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,370
Do you remember it?

490
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,020
I just remembered

491
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,200
we have something to do.

492
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,890
Mr. Jian,

493
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,860
we won't bother you any longer.

494
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,350
Go ahead.

495
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,770
Look at you.

496
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,900
You are quite bold.

497
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,490
You were boasting in front of an expert.

498
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,480
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

499
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,180
I'm pretty thickskinned.

500
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,490
I'm not afraid.

501
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,900
You're full of nonsense.

502
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,530
Also, you lied and said I shouldn't make a sound.

503
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
So I pretended to be mute on our way here.

504
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,190
I didn't get even with you on that yet.

505
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,160
Silence is gold.

506
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,540
None of that excuse!

507
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,120
Don't think I can forgive you

508
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,090
just by getting the opal skull for me.

509
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,010
Listen.

510
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,870

511
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,260

What did you do?

515
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,090
I told you to keep your voice down.

516
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,220
The Gang Qi in your body has blocked your mute acupoint.

517
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,150
Sit down and use the magic I taught you.

518
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,850
Hurry. Sit down.

519
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,170
Although it's temporarily suppressed,

520
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,720
if you accidentally

521
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,990
trigger the Gang Qi again,

522
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,770
you might be killed.

523
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
Stop being so arrogant.

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,580

I mean,

please deactivate the Thousand Bell Formation.

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,680
Okay.

563
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,120
[Good virtue carries good fortune]

564
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,060
The mechanism is unlocked.

565
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,460
It's finally unlocked. That's great.

566
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,950
Yes.

567
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,630
Master Jin.

568
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,290
Where is Jin Mantang?

569
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,330
Master?

570
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,790
Master!

571
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,580
The doors and windows are locked from inside.

572
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,300
How did he get out?

573
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,160
Since the doors and windows are locked,

574
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,520
and the Thousand Bell Formation was activated,

575
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,040
it's impossible for Jin Mantang to leave the room.

576
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,170
Housekeeper Jin.

577
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,770
Where is the secret room?

578
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,500
Secret room?

579
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,170
I have never heard of that.

580
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,110
Master Jin

581
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,380
is a generous spender.

582
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,170
Why would he keep a comb with broken teeth?

583
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,660
I think...

584
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,590
This is the key.

585
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,080
Master!

586
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,140
Master!

587
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Master!

588
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,450
Physicians.

589
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,040
Hurry! Save my master!

590
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,930
Save my master!

591
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,750
Master!

592
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,190
Master!

593
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,080
Master!

594
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,430
Master, what happened to you?

595
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,580
Master, wake up!

596
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,070
Look.

597
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,380
It's Dong Ling.

598
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,230
Dong Ling, the Jinling Sword?

599
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,910
That's right.

600
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,890
It's him.

601
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,330
Why is he here?

602
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,470
He was strangled to death.

603
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,670
He wasn't poisoned.

604
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,140
There are no other wounds.

605
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,560
The arrow is poisonous.

606
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,540
Let me test it.

607
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,440
It's the withered agave.

608
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,460
The poison of the withered agave

609
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,130
can cause nausea, suffocation,

610
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,260
and paralysis in the limbs.

611
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,970
But Dong Ling actually suffered a blunt injury to the back of his head

612
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,610
and died from excessive bleeding.

613
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,490
Could it be that Dong Ling was poisoned

614
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,900
and couldn't control his body,

615
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,380
so he hit the back of his head and died?

616
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,530
It seems so.

617
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,010
Was he the one who threatened Jin Mantang?

618
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,740
But...

619
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,530
Dong Ling the Jinling Sword had always been

620
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,710
a respectable figure in the martial world.

621
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
I've never heard of any conflict

622
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,670
between him and Jin Mantang either.

623
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,800
He doesn't look like a blackmailer.

624
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,080
Strange.

625
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,930
Did Dong Ling usually wrap himself up like this?

626
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,930
It's summer,

627
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,870
but he's wearing gloves?

628
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,810
Li Lianhua.

629
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,900
Look.

630
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,520
It's Tree Man Syndrome.

631
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,930
What's that?

632
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,150
It's a very rare disease.

633
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,940
The patient's skin

634
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,080
will gradually become like tree bark.

635
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,060
When the disease becomes severe,

636
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,030
the patient will be like a tree trunk

637
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,460
and develop root-like tumors.

638
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,760
The patient will look like a monster.

639
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,830
It's hard to cure.

640
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,130
The patient tends to die from pain.

641
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,740
The opal skull.

642
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,490
The opal skull is missing!

643
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,220
The opal skull is missing...

644
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,910
It seems that we found out why

645
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,190
Dong Ling came to the Villa.

646
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,430
Stop pretending.

647
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,020
Rumor has it that the opal skull can cure all diseases

648
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,570
and grant longevity.

649
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,730
It's hidden in this villa.

650
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,540
Everyone knows it.

651
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,470
I don't believe that the

652
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,440
famous physicians here

653
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,870
were never curious about the opal skull.

654
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,850
So Dong Ling came to borrow the opal skull

655
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
to cure his Tree Man Syndrome.

656
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,800
That's right.

657
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,840
Why don't you ask Housekeeper Jin?

658
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,220
Housekeeper Jin has never been in the martial world.

659
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,940
How did you recognize Dong Ling at first sight?

660
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,090
Yes.

661
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,100
I know him.

662
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,990
I can recognize him even if he turned into ashes.

663
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,180
Half a month ago,

664
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,620
Dong Ling came to see my master.

665
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,330
I listened to them from afar

666
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,740
and heard him asking for the opal skull.

667
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,320
What is an opal skull?

668
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,150
It's an extremely rare treasure.

669
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,270
I've only seen it a few times in my life.

670
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,260
How can he possibly have it?

671
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,110
Why don't we discuss it again?

672
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,230
-Cut the crap.
-No, no, no.

673
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:56,990
No.

674
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,190
Don't get me wrong.

675
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,120
What happened next?

676
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,770
A few days later,

677
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,630
Dong Ling took his Jinling Sword

678
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,490
and threatened us.

679
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,180
My poor master

680
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,120
had no choice.

681
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,350
So he hurt him with a sleeve arrow

682
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,080
and kicked him out.

683
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,550
Sleeve arrow?

684
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,280
That one just now?

685
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,740
Yes.

686
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,790
That's Master's self-defense weapon.

687
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,560
Then it's clear what happened.

688
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,070
Dong Ling failed to acquire the opal skull.

689
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,210
So he planned to steal it from the secret room.

690
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,560
But he was found out by Jin Mantang.

691
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,020
Dong Ling was highly skilled and strangled Jin Mantang to death.

692
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,560
While Jin Mantang was struggling,

693
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,930
he shot a poisoned sleeve arrow.

694
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,320
Both the witnesses and evidence are present.

695
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,100
The case is closed.

696
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,090
Guards.

697
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,560
Take the bodies out.

698
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,350
Yes.

699
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,080
Master.

700
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,370
From now on,

701
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,210
Yuanbao Villa will be handled by the Supervision Bureau.

702
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,340
Get rid of the rest of them.

703
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,480
This is not your home.

704
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,450
Why should I listen to you?

705
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,700
Master Jin asked for the court's help first.

706
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,850
It's only natural for the Supervision Bureau to handle this.

707
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,030
Take him away.

708
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,760
Wait.

709
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,110
No one here can leave.

710
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:34,870
Otherwise,

711
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,590
what will you do when the murderer escapes?

712
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,540
Dong Ling is dead.

713
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,130
Where else will we find the murderer?

714
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,700
Since it's a treasure robbery,

715
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,370
and both of them are dead,

716
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,070
let me ask you.

717
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,780
Where is the opal skull?

718
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,310
Don't forget.

719
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,260
The box was empty.

720
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,710
Did the content of the box

721
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,830
run away on its own?

722
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,300
Unless there is another explanation.

723
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
There was another person present.

724
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,230
The third person is the murderer.

725
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,070
The doors and windows are locked from the inside.

726
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,190
Young Master Fang's Thousand Bell Formation was active as well.

727
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,679
If there really was someone else,

728
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,560
how did he get out?

729
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:26,110
Commander Zongzheng is truly ahead of wisdom.

730
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,790
He won't understand that.

731
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,989
Let me translate it for you.

732
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,650
He's calling you stupid.

733
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,770
There are so many locked-room murders.

734
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,770
Don't forget.

735
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,770
The body of Yu Qiushuang that you innocently killed

736
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,540
was found in a place that didn't make sense too.

737
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,620
Don't be angry.

738
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,000
Besides,

739
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,100
don't you think something is strange?

740
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,570
What is it?

741
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,710
Shoes.

742
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,030
Shoes?

743
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,889
Jin Mantang's shoes.

744
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,500
He only wore one shoe.

745
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
He must have dropped a shoe

746
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,540
in the midst of their fight.

747
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,020
What's so strange about that?

748
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,920
Jin Mantang

749
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,140
wore riding boots, not low-cut boots.

750
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,470
As you all know,

751
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,580
riding boots are hard to put on.

752
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,970
How could it fall from a fight?

753
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,820
Besides,

754
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,880
if Jin Mantang was strangled by Dong Ling,

755
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,890
he shot the sleeve arrow with his last breath,

756
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,930
and Dong Ling died from dodging the arrow,

757
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,660
that proves that both of them died at the same time.

758
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,660
I really want to ask you.

759
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,900
Who took off

760
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,130
Jin Mantang's other shoe?

761
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,260
Well...

762
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,630
I know.

763
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
There must be someone else

764
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,250
searching for the key to the secret room.

765
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,700
That's why he searched Jin Mantang's body.

766
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,300
That's right.

767
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:43,950
Housekeeper Jin.

768
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,550
May I ask,

769
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,000
when did your master

770
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,640
return to his room last night?

771
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,260
I remember

772
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,970
it was at 7 p.m.

773
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,940
I sent Master back to his room to rest

774
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,850
and saw him activate the Thousand Bell Formation.

775
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,770
There was no one else in the room.

776
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,620
That’s strange.

777
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
I set the Thousand Bell Formation myself.

778
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,740
How did Dong Ling and this third person

779
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,320
go in and out of the room?

780
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,260
Look.

781
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,660
There are still many doubts to be addressed.

782
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,720
I'm afraid you need to find out more, Lord Zongzheng.

783
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,440
In this case,

784
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,570
we must find out the truth

785
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,060
to bring justice to the two victims.

786
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,340
[Yuanbao Villa]

787
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,150
Since there are still doubts,

788
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,120
let's talk about it.

789
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,330
I do have a question.

790
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,960
I heard that the owner of Lotus Tower

791
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,690
may have extraordinary medical skills,

792
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,700
but he never takes the initiative to treat patients.

793
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,990
As long as he has more than 50 taels of silver, he would never open business.

794
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,980
But why were you so eager to answer

795
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,440
the recruitment at the YuanBao Villa?

796
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,080
I happen to have less than 50 tales with me.

797
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,180
The Young Master Fang beside you

798
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,050
has erratic moments of muteness.

799
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,800
It's obviously caused by a fatal wave of Gang Qi.

800
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,460
I'm afraid you're also here

801
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,580
for the opal skull, just like Dong Ling.

802
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,670
Yes.

803
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,660
That's our intention.

804
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,310
But don't forget.

805
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,900
We refuted the silly theory

806
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,980
of the two killing each other.

807
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,560
Are we stupid enough to corner ourselves?

808
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,870
Who knows?

809
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,100
Maybe the two of you

810
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,540
hid the opal skull

811
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,060
somewhere in the villa after committing the crime.

812
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,520
Because I suddenly wanted to kick you out,

813
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,440
you found an excuse to stay

814
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,860
to retrieve the treasure later.

815
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,580
What you said

816
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,980
makes sense.

817
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,090
I

818
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,940
can't refute that.

819
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,850
Then, tell me

820
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,030
about your whereabouts last night.

821
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,750
Last night,

822
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,430
we were in our room

823
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,360
and never left.

824
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,930
We can testify for each other.

825
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,140
You two colluded with each other.

826
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,880
Your testimony doesn't count.

827
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,460
Besides, the bells outside Jin Mantang's room

828
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,530
were set by you.

829
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,300
If you wanted to go out,

830
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,910
the formation would naturally be silent.

831
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,290
You two are the most suspicious.

832
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,890
You...

833
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,190
Calm down.

834
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,490
Think about the Gang Qi.

835
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,440
I'm so angry.

836
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,230
Lord Zongzheng.

837
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,030
Speaking of suspicion,

838
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,800
what about yesterday?

839
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,440
Why did you avoid everyone

840
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,570
[Blessings and Prosperity]

841
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,610
and secretly met with Master Jin?

842
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,460
If I'm not mistaken,

843
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,710
you two

844
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,010
had a big conflict.

845
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,850
It's just some official matters.

846
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,370
What?

847
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,030
Do I have to explain to you?

848
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,770
No need.

849
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,570
However,

850
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,380
will you kill him

851
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,780
because of these official duties?

852
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,320
You...

853
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,200
Now that you mentioned it,

854
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,020
I remember something too.

855
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,820
Last night, I saw Physician Guan

856
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,410
sneaking out of his room with a bag in his hands.

857
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,380
I wonder what he was up to.

858
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,720
Me?

859
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,590
What's wrong with me going out?

860
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,340
If we're really talking about this,

861
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,700
I saw Mr. Gongyang

862
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,060
stalking Miss Zhiyu last night.

863
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,760
I just saw Miss Zhiyu leaving Housekeeper Jin's room

864
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,400
in the middle of the night.

865
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,430
I found it suspicious.

866
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,990
I just asked Zhiyu

867
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,640
to handle everyone's meals.

868
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,530
Mr. Jian.

869
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,130
You said you saw Guan going out in the middle of the night.

870
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,570
How did you know?

871
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,030
Were you just coincidentally

872
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,270
admiring the moon that night?

873
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,840
After listening for so long,

874
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,590
I finally understand.

875
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,170
Everyone here

876
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,950
has a little secret.

877
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,980
No use for pointless talking.

878
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,700
Since everyone is suspicious,

879
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,400
we'll just have to search the whole villa.

880
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,630
If the opal skull is found in one of your rooms,

881
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,430
the case will naturally be solved.

882
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,440
Yes.

883
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,250
Let's go somewhere else.

884
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,830
I think Zongzheng Mingzhu

885
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,990
is deliberately perfunctory

886
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,140
to close the case as soon as possible.

887
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,010
What is he trying to do?

888
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,100
Why does he have to get involved in the case of Yuanbao Villa?

889
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,460
He's certainly not here to investigate the case.

890
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,470
He is going to search the entire Yuanbao Villa.

891
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,530
Did he quarrel with Jin Mantang

892
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,550
because he wanted the opal skull as well?

893
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,150
Back in Yu City, I found that

894
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,620
the Jinyuan Alliance had something to do with him.

895
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,190
Could it be that the Jinyuan Alliance wants it?

896
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,650
But according to what you said,

897
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,520
would he be the murderer?

898
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,500
But with his intelligence,

899
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,490
he couldn't have entered my Thousand Bell Formation.

900
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,940
Give me the bag.

901
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,520
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

902
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,030
Don't you dare!

903
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,970
I told you not to search!

904
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,670
What happened?

905
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,290
He won't let us search the bag.

906
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,220
Guan,

907
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,720
everyone in this villa has been searched.

908
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,360
Why can't you be searched?

909
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,850
If you are innocent,

910
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,870
just show it to others.

911
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,770
Guan,

912
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,250
can I have a look at this bag?

913
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,420
Everyone,

914
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,760
there's nothing hard in this bag.

915
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,630
You can rest assured now.

916
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:28,990
Let's go.

917
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,110
Li Lianhua.

918
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,710
Thank you so much.

919
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,510
You're welcome.

920
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,100
What's going on?

921
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,570
Why do you always side with him?

922
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,350
I'm helping you

923
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,540
so you won't be embarrassed.

924
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,470
Physician Li,

925
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,750
may I have a word with you?

926
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,990
Li Lianhua, may I have a word with you?

927
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,800
Let me show you something good.
