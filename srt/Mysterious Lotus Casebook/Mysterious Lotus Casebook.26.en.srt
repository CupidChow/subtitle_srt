[Episode 26]

4
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,460
Where did all these people go?

5
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,820
After fighting, no matter the outcome,

6
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,539
they'd naturally have to leave.

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,900
Even if they left right after beating people up,

8
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,020
but this is an inn after all.

9
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,460
It has been deserted all these years.

10
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,830
You mean no one would have cleaned this up?

11
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,470
So many people died here.

12
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,270
There are also so many talismans downstairs.

13
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,020
They dare not come in?

14
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,400
Is there a ghost?

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
This place is weird and eerie.

16
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,290
Let's just go.

17
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:12,980
Wait.

18
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,570
Wait.

19
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
There seems to be a hidden door here.

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,010
There are only three of us here.

21
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,660
Why are there a pair of footprints here?

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
There really is a ghost, huh?

23
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,740
What was that?

24
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,250
After him!

25
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,100
Let's stop chasing.

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
What on earth was that?

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,810
I've never seen this kind of creature before.

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,330
This is not a normal creature.

29
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,340
That's right.

30
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,260
Its power and speed are both extraordinary.

31
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,090

34
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,390
-We're in the wrong place.  
-We're just passing by. 
-We're staying the night.

35
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,790
There's a ghost inside.

36
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,660
We all dare not come in.

37
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,190
So there is really a ghost after all.

38
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,790
S-so there really is a ghost.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,840
Since it was getting quite late,

40
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,390
we wanted to stay the night here.

41
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,410
But we didn't expect that it was pitch dark in here.

42
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,180
It's really scary.

43
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,220
Yes, indeed.

44
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,220
Lots of people died in this inn many years ago.

45
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,920
You should hurry on out now.

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,440

you can stay at my place tonight.

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,150
We'll take up your offer then.

51
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,140
It's no problem.

52
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,430
Useless!

If you can't even

56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,380
kill them, then what do I need you for?

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,740
I’m incompetent. Please punish me.

58
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,700
Saintess.

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,340
If it was only the two of them,

60
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
we wouldn't have failed.

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,430
Who knew that the lord would be there,

62
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
and he even helped them.

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,990
The lord?

64
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,140
I've sent people to look for him everywhere these few days.

65
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,040
Why is he with them?

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,960
He didn't seem to recognize us.

67
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,030
What did you say?

68
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,790
The lord asked us who we were,

69
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,980
and who he was.

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,520
He was ruthless when fighting us.

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,300
Could it be that the Wuxin Huai

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,220
made him lose his memory?

73
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,020
That day when the man in black injected the Wuxin Huai into the lord's body,

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,660
I felt something was wrong.

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,170
After that, I sent people to look but couldn't find him anywhere.

76
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,440
I felt even more uneasy.

77
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,650
Looks like something really went wrong.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,140
Where are you going, Saintess?

79
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,370
I was just about to settle things out with you.

80
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,890
You lied to me.

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,480
You didn't just give Di Feisheng any regular Wuxin Huai,

82
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,580
but the pure Wuxin Huai.

83
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,720
You're planning to overthrow him.

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,030
So what?

85
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,600
If you dare to hurt him,

86
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,570
I'll make you pay.

87
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,860
Di Feisheng only lost his memory for now.

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,340
He's not seriously hurt.

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,460
On the contrary,

90
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,870
you let the Rama Heavenly Ice fall into others' hands,

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,340
and caused our plan to fail terribly.

92
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,320
Saintess,

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
can you give me an explanation?

94
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,840
It was just a one-off mistake.

95
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,940
I'll take care of it.

96
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,770
It's none of your business.

97
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,620
Sure.

98
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,080
I won’t worry.

99
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,060
I came here today

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,970
to give you a surprise.

101
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,880
Do you want to know where Li Xiangyi is?

102
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,280
Li Xiangyi?

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,970
You tried so hard

104
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,870
to find out where Li Xiangyi is.

105
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,140
The spy I planted beside Qiao Wanmian

106
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
sent a message back recently,

107
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,740
saying that they discovered the inner breath of

108
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,460
Yangzhouman in Qiao Wanmian's body.

109
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,860
There was no such inner breath before.

110
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,260
It was after Qiao Wanmian was poisoned

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,580
by your Iced Cicada and got cured,

112
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,600
that it suddenly appeared.

113
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,000
Yangzhouman?

114
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,030
No.

115
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,460
The Iced Cicada in Qiao Wanmian's body

116
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,330
was cured by Di Feisheng.

117
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,950
Was it really Di Feisheng?

118
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,640
In this world, the Iced Cicada's poison

119
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,500
can only be cured by Yangzhouman's inner breath.

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,590
You know that best.

121
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,410
If it's not Di Feisheng,

122
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,230
then there's only one person who was in contact with Qiao Wanmian.

123
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,000
Li Lianhua.

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,980
It really is him.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,310
Li Lianhua

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,380
is Li Xiangyi.

127
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,770
Di Feisheng is still trying his best to cover up for them.

128
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,990
I was devoted to him,

129
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,460
and tried to do everything to help him get rid of Li Xiangyi.

130
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,460
Not only did he not tell me anything,

131
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,900
but also helped him to lie to me and deceive me.

132
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,659
My beautiful Lady Jiao.

133
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,260
It seems that your way to win people's hearts

134
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,409
isn't anything worth mentioning.

135
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,820
And you don't know a thing about

136
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,409
what they're doing by joining forces.

137
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,980
You're really useless as

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,080
the Saintess of Jinyuan Alliance.

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,290
How dare you say anything about me?

140
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
If it weren't for your master's sake,

141
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,270
you would have been long dead.

142
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,810
Please calm down, Saintess.

143
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,380
It was my mistake.

144
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Actually, I'm doing this

145
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,890
for your sake too.

146
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,810
Di Feisheng has found out about us working together.

147
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,170
He couldn't tolerate you.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,760
Isn't it better for him to lose his memory now?

149
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,730
He won't pay attention to both of us,

150
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,810
and after you bring him back in the future,

151
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,450
you can train him however you want.

152
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,900
According to Master's orders,

153
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,220
what is most crucial now

154
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,680
is to first confirm if that person is Li Xiangyi.

155
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,640
Then, take back the Rama Heavenly Ice.

156
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,020
Your master only asked me to help

157
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,850
and work together with him.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Who is he to order me around?

159
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,180
I'll take care of my own matters myself.

160
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,100
Since you are his dog,

161
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,169
go back and tell him this.

162
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,120
When I come back,

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,299
I will settle scores with him properly.

164
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,419
All of Wansheng Clan is at your disposal.

165
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,310
Thank you for letting us stay here tonight, Elder Shi.

166
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
No one has come to our village for years.

167
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,500
It’s a fateful coincidence that you three are here.

168
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,820
Elder Shi,

169
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,430
have the villagers always been living in seclusion here?

170
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,940
It has been more than a hundred years.

171
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,300
Our ancestors moved here back then

172
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,210
when fleeing from war.

173
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,940
It was only when an outsider came in more than ten years ago

174
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,330
that our village had contact

175
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,220
with anyone from outside the village.

176
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,980
Come this way.

177
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,980
Please have a seat.

178
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,630
This is the wild donkey meat that we usually eat in our village.

179
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,940
I don't know if you will like it.

180
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
I didn’t expect the food in the village to be so abundant.

181
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,330
Thank you, Elder Shi.

182
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,520
But I’ve been praying to Buddha recently.

183
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,190
I heard that wild donkeys in the mountains

184
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,320
understand humans very well.

185
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I really can't bear to eat them,

186
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,440
so I'll politely decline.

187
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,000
I see.

188
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,980
In that case,

189
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,760
please try this Rouchang wine

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,470
brewed with cold spring water from our village.

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,740
This young hero here, why don’t you sit down?

192
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,990
Elder Shi.

193
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,820
To be honest with you,

194
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,220
my two brothers here with me

195
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,230
are also fasting just like me.

196
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,470
So we won't be able to partake in the delicious food and wine.

197
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I see.

198
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

199
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
It is indeed a pity.

200
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,410
Elder Shi,

201
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,230
This Rouchang wine you just mentioned.

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Is it the legendary wine that will

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,450
boost the inner power of

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,340
martial arts practitioners after drinking it?

205
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,500
You are right.

206
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,340
The person who accidentally

207
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,580
entered the village more than ten years ago

208
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,210
found that this Rouchang wine

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,500
could enhance his power.

210
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,810
So,

211
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
it attracted many people to come.

212
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,860
But when they knew

213
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,980
the Rouchang wine was made from the cold spring in the village,

214
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,090
they started to fight for the cold spring

215
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,030
and cut down fruit trees to make wine.

216
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,790
The spring dried out,

217
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,980
all the trees were cut down,

218
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,550
and the village was left in a complete shambles because of them.

219
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,950
After they left,

220
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,380
we blocked off the road to the village.

221
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,530
All these years, besides the three of you today,

222
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,540
no one else has ever been here.

223
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,460
If the cold spring has dried out for so many years,

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,860
[Rouchang wine]

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,880
where is this bottle from then?

226
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,460
After so many years,

227
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,740
no one is fighting for the cold spring anymore.

228
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,740
So the spring water in the mountain

229
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,520
slowly revived a little.

230
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,470
The inns in the village were built

231
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,020
back then for those martial arts practitioners.

232
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,590
After they left,

233
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,750
no one has stayed there since,

234
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,300
which is why it's been deserted.

235
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,510
I see.

236
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,140
Elder Shi,

237
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,690
what happened in this inn?

238
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,350
To be honest,

239
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,800
more than ten years ago,

240
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,180
those people from the martial arts world

241
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,280
started a fight in the inn

242
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,050
over a little bit of cold spring water.

243
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,620
Much blood was shed.

244
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,970
It's been so long.

245
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,400
Why did no one clean it up?

246
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,410
There's a ghost inside.

247
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,100
The villagers were intending

248
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,490
to collect the bodies for burial.

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,880
But who knew,

250
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,230
all the bodies disappeared overnight.

251
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,200
It must be those people who transformed.

252
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,480
They will hurt people.

253
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,340
So no one dares to go in.

254
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
So that was what happened.

255
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,870
Fortunately we left fast then.

256
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:17,880
By the way,

257
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,650
among the people who came here then,

258
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,570
was there someone who often wore a mask

259
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,700
looking like the King of Hell

260
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,500
and was called the Lord of the Netherworld?

261
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,120
Lord of the Netherworld?

262
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,180
There were too many of them coming here back then.

263
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,970
It's been so many years.

264
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
I can't remember.

265
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,270
Are you looking for someone?

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,460
That man is an old master that

267
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,120
my brother here has admired for a long time.

268
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
He hasn't met him before either.

269
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,590
Yes.

270
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,450
I heard that Master Lian Quan

271
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,950
also drank the Rouchang wine here before.

272
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,680
I want to pursue his footsteps,

273
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,100
so I'm just taking the chance to ask.

274
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,180
I can't help you much there.

275
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,090
It's getting late.

276
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,940
Please rest early.

277
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,820
I'll send you out of the village tomorrow morning.

278
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,280
Thank you.

279
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,390
Are you hungry?

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,700
I'm fasting.

281
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,710
I had to find an explanation you know.

282
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,350
On our journey here,

283
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,450
don't you think it's strange?

284
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,170
Yes

285
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,710
It's strange indeed.

286
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,980
The villagers hide when they see us

287
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,740
and avoid us.

288
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,430
But yet they prepared so much food for us now.

289
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,700
It's better not to touch it.

290
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
So in my opinion,

291
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,170
this must be...

292
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,980
A clip joint?

293
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,590
You're not being serious again.

294
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,300
A clip joint should be located in a place with people,

295
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,670
not in this kind of secluded corner.

296
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,740
Fang Duobing.

297
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,560
Have you heard?

298
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,900
Many mountains are inhabited by cannibalistic tribes

299
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,840
who only eat humans.

300
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,100
Then the villagers here...

301
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,450
This won't do.

302
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,230
Let's go to the kitchen to have a look.

303
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,050
There's nothing here either.

304
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,870
Where did they hide the meat?

305
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,290
Since there's something wrong with the food in the village,

306
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,340
do you think the Lord of the Netherworld

307
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,830
got ambushed after eating the meat

308
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,620
and drinking the wine here?

309
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,770
I remember Su Xiaoyong said

310
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,070
they found his last tracks in Shishou Village.

311
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,930
We haven't heard any news about him since then.

312
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,040
Did something happen to him here?

313
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,790
Indeed, many highly-skilled people

314
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,380
were in that inn earlier,

315
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,430
and there were traces of a fight.

316
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,990
But I didn't find any traces of Lian Quan's martial arts.

317
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,700
Maybe,

318
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,110
he never entered the inn.

319
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,320
People usually stop in the inn temporarily.

320
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
If someone was really

321
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,190
cutting trees and making wine here,

322
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,920
they'd have to stay here for a while.

323
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,670
But when we entered the village this afternoon,

324
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,990
there were only houses where long-time villagers lived.

325
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,580
I didn't see any new houses built

326
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
by any outsiders.

327
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,300
Could it be the elder that's making things up?

328
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
In reality, no one was willing

329
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,460
to stay and fight for the spring water to make wine.

330
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,690
Why would she lie?

331
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,170
We've all heard stories about this Rouchang wine.

332
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,980
But have you ever thought about

333
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,510
whether someone really drank this wine

334
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,100
and came to this Shishou Village?

335
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,820
You're right.

336
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,820
In this world,

337
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,440
there's only ever been tales of this Rouchang wine.

338
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,880
But I've never heard anyone claim that

339
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,760
he drank this wine.

340
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,040
If Elder Shi is speaking the truth,

341
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
and many martial artist practitioners have been here,

342
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,110
there should be many people going around

343
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,410
bragging about it.

344
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,560
The Rouchang wine can boost your internal power.

345
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,130
Where did this saying come from?

346
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,700
Many people came here in search of it,

347
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,490
but no one has ever returned successfully.

348
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,060
I have heard that

349
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,770
Tianying Gang once sent disciples

350
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,270
to look for this Rouchang wine.

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,320
But we don't know what happened after that.

352
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,710
Think about it.

353
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,490
Everyone who came to this village disappeared.

354
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Where did they go?

355
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,130
This won't do.

356
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,150
We'll have to be more alert tonight.

357
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,400
We can't sleep.

358
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,370
I've always stayed awake in an unfamiliar environment.

359
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,280
Fang Duobing.

360
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,070
I'll leave standing guard tonight to you.

361
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,860
I'm going to bed.

362
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
Not like I can do anything if I stay awake anyway.

363
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,620
If something really happens,

364
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,530
please act smart.

365
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,670
Wait.

366
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Earlier at the inn,

367
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,070
you could tell at a glance

368
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,220
the different martial skills from each sect.

369
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,970
You're very well-versed in martial arts.

370
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,700
Stop pretending to be modest.

371
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,120
Stay and guide me.

372
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,150
Maybe you can even protect me.

373
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,510
If you really want to hear about

374
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,980
the secret martial art manuals of sword-fighting

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,910
of all the sects,

376
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,260
pick a time when the sun is out

377
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,000
and I'll recite everything for you.

378
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,290
As for martial arts and fighting,

379
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,800
and protecting everyone's safety, I'll leave it to you.

380
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
You're the best at this.

381
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,510
This sly old fox.

382
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,880
Stop badmouthing me behind my back.

383
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,839
You darned fox!

384
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,820
Here.

385
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
I soaked it in water before.

386
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,900
Just make do with it for now.

387
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,420
It's edible.

388
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,870
Forget it if you're not eating.

389
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,540
Thanks.

390
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,000
You actually took it.

391
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,260
I thought a dark-faced fiend like you didn't need any care from others

392
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,060
and didn't care about others.

393
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,260
You're better after losing your memory.

394
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,210
You better not touch anything here.

395
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,580
Thanks.

396
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,960
He's not that bad at heart.

397
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,350
Maybe we can change him for the better

398
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,120
while his memory is lost.

399
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,780
Fei,

400
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,040
do you have any aspirations in your life?

401
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,910
Martial arts.

402
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,950
Martial arts aren't an aspiration.

403
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,130
Practicing the highest form of martial arts.

404
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,080
There are two types of martial arts practitioners.

405
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,350
One of them helps the weak,

406
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,180
and the other takes advantage of the weak.

407
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,210
You can become a hero everyone admires,

408
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,040
or become a demon

409
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,640
that everyone wants to get rid of.

410
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,700
Which one will you choose?

411
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,910
It doesn't matter.

412
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,930
Let me rephrase my question then.

413
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,900
What will you do if someone

414
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,970
accidentally offends you?

415
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,900
I will kill him.

416
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,110
How can you do that?

417
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,180
As the old saying goes,

418
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,780
the best thing a gentleman is to be kind to others.

419
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,320
Acts of kindness need to be accumulated,

420
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,480
and acts of evil...

421
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,320
What are you trying to say?

422
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,970
I just want to tell you

423
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,310
martial arts practitioners

424
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,700
should be righteous.

425
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,950
You shouldn't kill for your own selfish desire.

426
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,170
We should help the weak,

427
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,640
and get rid of...

428
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,100
I know you once went astray.

429
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,640
But who hasn't erred in their life before?

430
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,660
The most important thing is to turn over a new leaf.

431
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,640
It's fine if you don't want to listen.

432
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,700
But how can you attack me like this?

433
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,050
What's that smell?

434
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,720
It's the candle.

435
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Something is hidden in the candle.

436
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,830
It's too late.

437
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,090
We inhaled some of it.

438
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,980
It's the Wuxin Huai.

439
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,010
Are you okay?

440
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,430
How are you?

441
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,410
What are these things?

442
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,820
I don't know.

443
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,180
It's the Jade Cloud Bagua Mirror.

444
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,330
Could it be the Chief of Cuihua Mountain

445
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
who went missing ten years ago?

446
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,860
It's the Iron Door.

447
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,420
Blue Wolf Whirlwind Shu Tianhua,

448
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,810
and Redface Flying Dagger Zhu Mofei!

449
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,260
Are we having a martial arts showdown?

450
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,140
How do you know them all?

451
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,190
They are martial art experts who've been missing for years.

452
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,970
I can still fight them if it's one by one.

453
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,050
But they're coming in hoards.

454
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,310
We'll be ripped to shreds.

455
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,460
Channel your energy to force out the poison.

456
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,690
Li Xiangyi?

457
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,750
Li Xiangyi.

458
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,810
Li Lianhua!

459
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,870
Li Lianhua!

460
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,760
It's really him.

461
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,560
Fang Duobing.

462
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,960
I was scared to death just now.

463
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,560
Luckily I hid in time.

464
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
A few monsters came here just now.

465
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,360
Who are they?

466
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,540
Are you okay?

467
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,140
What could happen to me?

468
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,830
No, you...

469
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
What are you doing?

470
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,910
Stop getting your hands

471
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,870
all over me.

472
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,890
Ridiculous, seriously.

473
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
You're like a lunatic.

474
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,250
I'm just worried about you.

475
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,190
There's something wrong with the candle.

476
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,990
Luckily you didn't light it.

477
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,500
Luckily for Fei and I...

478
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,490
the master in white from last time helped us.

479
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,460
Master in white?

480
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,410
What master in white?

481
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,550
Have you seen the master in white?

482
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,480
What master in white?

483
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,130
When those monsters came over earlier,

484
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,190
I was scared to death.

485
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,460
I immediately hid behind this door

486
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,930
and didn't even dare to look.

487
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,560
Why didn't you come earlier?

488
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,130
Oh, I see.

489
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,570
When those people ran away earlier,

490
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
they were shouting.

491
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm afraid he's summoning his companions.

492
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,700
We'd better leave now.

493
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,950
[Shishou Village]

494
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,720
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

495
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
Is your mouth jinxed?

496
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,580
Cut the crap.

497
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,170
Fight!

498
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,410
Do you think the master in white

499
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,230
will reveal himself again?

500
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,740
Li Lianhua!

501
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,560
Help us!

502
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,200
Did I guess wrong?

503
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,840
He can't even hold a sword.

504
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,330
He can't be the master in white.

505
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,790
I really can't hold up after

506
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,790
just a while of using my internal power.

507
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,330
Li Lianhua!

508
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Young Hero Lu.

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
So it's you all.

510
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,180
Let's kill off these monsters first.

511
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:58,960
Stop chasing.

512
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,210
Wrap up your wounds first.

513
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,770
They are more excited after smelling blood.

514
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,570
Thank you for your help earlier, Brother Lu.

515
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,370
I was passing by

516
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,960
and heard sounds of fighting.

517
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,180
So I came to take a look.

518
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,660
I didn't expect it was you all.

519
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,010
This village is very secluded.

520
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,800
Why are you here, Brother Lu?

521
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,990
To be honest,

522
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,510
three years ago, I made plans with a friend of mine,

523
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,780
Kunlun Sect's Cosmos Fortune Palm, Jin Youdao,

524
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,940
to compete in the tournament at Bahuang Hunyuan Lake nearby.

525
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,980
But I waited for him here for a month,

526
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,790
and still haven't met him.

527
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,700
After going to Kunlun Sect to find him,

528
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,690
I found out that there was no news of him for a month.

529
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,200
I've been looking for him since then.

530
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,600
Was the old friend you were reminiscing about

531
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,620
at the Girls' Mansion Jin Youdao?

532
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,100
The day we agreed to compete together

533
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,340
is exactly three years ago from today.

534
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,080
From then, on this day every year,

535
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
I would come here to wait for him.

536
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,290
I believe he's not a person that will break his promise.

537
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,600
Competition?

538
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,450
Cosmos Fortune Palm has always been a renowned hero.

539
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,100
Good people are always blessed.

540
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,750
When I came here before,

541
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,910
it was surrounded by cliffs here.

542
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,330
But today I found that

543
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,110
a path opened up at the original location of the cliff.

544
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,160
I thought it was strange, so I walked in,

545
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,420
and found this village.

546
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,880
A path that suddenly opened up?

547
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't think it's a path that suddenly appeared.

548
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,470
I'm afraid this village has always

549
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,690
kept a path to contact the outside world.

550
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,840
It's not any hidden place.

551
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,770
They even have the Wuxin Huai.

552
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,250
Could this be related to Nanyin too?

553
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,370
Nanyin?

554
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,490
The foreign tribe that's been extinct for over a hundred years?

555
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,170
If that's the case,

556
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,040
it would be worse.

557
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,340
I don't know where Lianhua is brought to now.

558
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,030
He can't even hold a sword now.

559
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,950
If anything happens,

560
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,880
he won't be able to fight.

561
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,800
I won't let anything happen to him.

562
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,770
Why are you suddenly caring about his safety?

563
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,360
In any case, he can't die.

564
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,510
We made such a big ruckus.

565
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,070
But yet the elders and villagers

566
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,920
didn't react at all.

567
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,050
Are these villagers hiding from these monsters?

568
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,700
Kiddo.

569
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,390
Let me ask you.

570
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,710
It's dark now,

571
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,780
I told you not to run around!

572
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,630
No wonder they never go out after dark.

573
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,550
It was to avoid these people.

574
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,160
These monsters are all martial experts

575
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,430
who suddenly disappeared.

576
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,410
I can't believe they're all here.

577
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,850
Jin Youdao also disappeared suddenly.

578
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,010
He even made plans to meet you around here.

579
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,310
Could it be related to this village too?

580
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,970
That inn is full of traces of

581
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,530
martial experts fighting.

582
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,300
It must have been moves made by them

583
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,220
when they were still sober.

584
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,150
But those people obviously already lost their consciousness.

585
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,420
Could they have been lured to this village

586
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,560
and got poisoned

587
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,620
or came down with some illness,

588
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,690
that caused them to be like this?

589
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,360
If that's the case,

590
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,750
did that also happen to Brother Jin?

591
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,850
This is bad.

592
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,680
Looks like Lianhua also...

593
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,320
Since the people who fought in the inn are still normal,

594
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,520
something must have happened.

595
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,380
Is the monster you fought with earlier

596
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,350
the same as those in the inn?

597
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,670
Let's go take a look.

598
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,310
We should be able to find some clues.

599
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,260
Heaven never bars one's way,

600
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,830
or there'd really be no way out.

601
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,900
Now it seems that

602
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,520
there are so many talismans here.

603
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,070
These were probably placed by the people living here

604
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,170
to chase away those who lost their consciousness,

605
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,030
and repel the evil spirits.

606
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,610
Those people are covered in blood,

607
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,250
and they're even faster than humans.

608
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,940
It's likely that they're treated as ghosts.

609
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,420
Could it be that the martial experts staying here

610
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,510
suddenly got attacked by those who came previously

611
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,800
and already lost their consciousness?

612
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,470
So that's why

613
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,700
such a fierce fight happened here.

614
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,890
That means that

615
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,350
people kept coming here

616
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,930
and kept getting turned into monsters.

617
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,920
Li Lianhua once said

618
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,690
there are traces of Kunlun Sect's martial arts here.

619
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,910
It's him.

620
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:14,840
I recognize it.

621
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,380
The heavens as palms, and the earth as claws.

622
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,630
Is this really Brother Jin's unique skill,

623
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,410
the Cosmos Fortune Palm?

624
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,030
Did he really come here?

625
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,680
Where is he now?

626
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,270
Brother Lu.

627
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,040
there are rumors that you are an alcohol fanatic.

628
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,640
Do you like drinking?

629
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes.

630
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,130
But what does it have to do with this?

631
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Have you ever heard of

632
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,100
the Rouchang wine in Shishou Village?

633
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,820
This is the legendary Shishou Village?

634
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,410
If not?

635
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,970
I once told Brother Jin about this Rouchang wine.

636
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,400
Although I don't believe that

637
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,920
the wine can boost internal power,

638
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,070
but I heard this wine was made with spring water.

639
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,870
It must be fragrant and delicious.

640
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,570
I've always wanted to taste it.

641
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,770
Brother Jin!

642
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,380
I'm here

643
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,510
to remind you

644
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,450
[Cosmos Fortune Palm, Jin Youdao]

645
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,580
about the competition next month.

646
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,120
Next month, at the Bahuang Hunyuan Lake at Mount Chrysanthemum.

647
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,190
I'll see you there.

648
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,760
Bahuang Hunyuan Lake.

649
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,650
Why there?

650
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
You'll know when you get there.

651
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,410
After the competition,

652
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,510
I'll gift you something good.

653
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,980
Could it be that the gift

654
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,370
Brother Jin wanted to give me

655
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,410
was this Rouchang wine?

656
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,770
So he ran into an accident here

657
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,870
because of this Rouchang wine.

658
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,620
This Rouchang wine

659
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,710
is actually a trick to lure people here.

660
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,220
The reason why no one has said they came to this village

661
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,980
and drank this wine

662
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,460
is because everyone who's come here before never made it out.

663
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,380
I remember there was a secret door here.

664
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,660
There must be something fishy if they have a secret room here.

665
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,340
Maybe we can find some clues.

666
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,240
The mechanism is up there.

667
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:08,670
Fei...

668
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,590
I already knew you were good friends with Brother Li.

669
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,000
I didn't expect you and Brother Fei to work together so well too.

670
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,020
I don't know him well.

671
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,260
Me neither.

672
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:15,990
Suiyan.

673
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,170
It's Nanyin again.

674
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,980
Looks like he died after being decapitated.

675
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,570
These clothes are covered with dust.

676
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,330
There's no blood on them

677
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,650
and they are dressed neatly.

678
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,940
There are obvious tearing marks where the head was severed off.

679
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,870
This corpse was decapitated

680
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,740
after it dried out.

681
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,300
There's no trace of blood around.

682
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,520
And the part where the head was severed is also like torn paper.

683
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,360
What is this?

684
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,480
A ghost entered my house.

685
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,830
These are my last words.

686
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,300
They didn't manage to

687
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,570
finish writing this last word.

688
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,310
This handwriting...

689
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,280
is the same as that in the room she hung herself.

690
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,320
Looks like this female body was moved here.

691
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,110
But she's already dead.

692
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,710
Why did they dry out her body,

693
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,440
cut her head off,

694
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:22,989
and hide her body here?

695
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,320
And where did her head go?

696
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,350
Is this some kind of Nanyin sorcery again?

697
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,370
It's the monster from before.

698
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,090
I seem to have seen this monster somewhere.

699
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,060
Elder!

700
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:20,880
Elder!

701
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,350
Elder.

702
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,790
We only caught one of the Head God's emissaries.

703
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,400
We didn't manage to get rid of all of them at once.

704
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,390
I didn't expect these people to be so capable.

705
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,280
But don't worry.

706
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,390
The inn is the site of nirvana for the Head God.

707
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
We kept it there for so many years

708
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,500
to lure these people in.

709
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,230
We have already prepared the Head Bane there.

710
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,800
Once these people come into contact with the Head Bane,

711
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,670
they will become the Head God's emissaries

712
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,120
just like those martial artists from before.

713
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,030
Is this the Head Bane

714
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,470
that you're talking about?

715
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,860
Nothing happened to you three?

716
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,200
What is this?

717
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,090
So disgusting.

718
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,300
It's human skull bone.

719
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,850
The brown liquid on the ground

720
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,410
outside is this.

721
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,820
Mind control bugs?

722
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,610
Once they breed these bugs successfully,

723
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,900
they will use it to create all kinds of sorcery.

724
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,870
Nanyin people are good at these things.

725
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,590
So they cut off the corpses' heads

726
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,250
to breed these bugs?

727
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,830
Mind control bugs...

728
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,650
The mark of the fiend.

729
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,720
This is indeed Nanyin's sorcery.

730
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,030
Did they become monsters

731
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,130
after getting attacked by these things?

732
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,640
First, it was the Rama Heavenly Ice,

733
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,770
then the Karmic Bugs.

734
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,310
And now it's these things.

735
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,790
What exactly are the Nanyin people up to?

736
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,820
In any case,

737
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,390
we must find those villagers behind this

738
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,640
and quickly save Li Lianhua.

739
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,280
When we were surrounded by those monsters,

740
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,870
they seemed to avoid the heads that were severed.

741
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,730
It's also the human heads that turn people into monsters.

742
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,190
Are they afraid of human heads?

743
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,610
I got it.

744
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,180
Do you remember those skeleton shadows

745
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,550
we saw at the Bahuang Hunyuan Lake?

746
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,300
The reflection of the strange stones on the cliff?

747
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,170
Yes.

748
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,420
We always thought

749
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,290
those were just stones that looked like skeletons.

750
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,010
I suddenly realized something.

751
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,700
They're using monsters to attack us.

752
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
But these monsters can't tell what are humans.

753
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,870
How can they be sure

754
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,830
they won't get hurt by mistake?

755
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,140
Of course they have to hide.

756
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,550
And they have to hide in a place

757
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,800
where these monsters are afraid of.

758
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,100
Seems like it's not a coincidence.

759
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,230
Those stones

760
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,100
are not naturally occurring strange stones,

761
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,870
but are actually human heads covered in mud

762
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,020
and hung on the cliff

763
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,670
to ward off the monsters.

764
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,290
Yes.

765
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,500
They must be hiding nearby.

766
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,130
You didn't get struck by the Head Bane?

767
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,460
Do you want us to also become neither human nor ghost?

768
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,580
You...

769
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,960
How dare you insult the Head God!

770
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,940
Head God?

771
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,950
It's just a corpse that breeds the mind control bugs,

772
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,910
and yet you worship it as a god.

773
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,280
How foolish.

774
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,950
Go!

775
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,970
Get back the Head God!

776
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,520
Get it back now!

777
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,220
Looks like you're really afraid of these ceramic pots.

778
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,790
If the emissaries of the Head God find you here,

779
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,770
they will tear you apart.

780
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,970
Let us go now!

781
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,080
Those Head Gods of yours

782
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,570
are afraid of the human skulls here.

783
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,380
They won't come in.

784
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:55,900
Am I right?

785
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:56,890
Tell me.

786
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,330
Where did you take Lee Lianhua?

787
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,380
What's the point of asking that now?

788
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,030
As long as they are captured by the Head God's emissaries,

789
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,320
they won't live for more than two hours.

790
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,510
I'm afraid he's already dismembered by now.

791
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,360
You...

792
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,330
If you want to know where the Head God's emissaries are,

793
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,360
dream on.

794
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,720
If you don't tell me,

795
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,170
I'll put this on you

796
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,230
and make you the Head God's emissary too.

797
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,670
What do you think?

798
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,740
Wait.

799
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,950
Don't go any further.

800
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,990
Don't go any further.

801
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,540
That is where the Heaven and Earth Pit is.

802
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,610
It's where they make the Head Bane.

803
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,920
The Head God's emissaries have taken over the place.

804
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,970
How can we control them?

805
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,710
There's nothing we can do.

806
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,190
Only when the sun shines into the cave,

807
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,960
they'll become dull-witted.

808
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,380
Otherwise...

809
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,540
Otherwise, there's no way.

810
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,660
Just wait for a bit more.

811
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,520
When the sun shines into the cave,

812
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,270
you can go in.

813
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,480
This is Li Lianhua's bag.

814
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,390
With every minute of delay,

815
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,180
Li Lianhua will be in even more danger.

816
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,450
Let's go.

817
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,790
Li Lianhua!

818
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,080
Li Lianhua, wake up!

819
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,700
Li Lianhua!

820
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,820
Why is there so much blood?

821
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,770
Please be okay.

822
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,800
I still have a lot to ask you.

823
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,540
Lianhua,

824
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,020
don't die.

825
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,360
I still have a lot to ask you.

826
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,250
Stop making so much noise.

827
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,590
I'm not dead yet.

828
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,120
I'm just sleepy.

829
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,180
You're fine?

830
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,660
You even fell asleep?

831
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,310
Why are you sleeping here?

832
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,190
Don't shout. Come on.

833
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,820
Help me up.

834
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,970
Where's all the blood from?

835
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,790
How can there not be blood when I was dealing with so many monsters?

836
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,090
Come on.

837
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,670
Help me.

838
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,660
Thank you.

839
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,950
Thank you too.

840
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,560
What's wrong with your hand?

841
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,910
It's wrapped up so terribly.

842
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,250
If I knew you were fine,

843
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,750
who would come save you?

844
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,860
Be careful.
