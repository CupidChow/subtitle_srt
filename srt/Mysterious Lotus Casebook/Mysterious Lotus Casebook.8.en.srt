00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,670
Kid,

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,289
don't say I didn't remind you.

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,080
This is the tomb of Prince Fangji and Princess Nanyin.

Weeping Guanyin?

10
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,380
Hand over the Weeping Guanyin!

11
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,920
Do you want to die?

12
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,040
It's rare that someone can sustain my attack.

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,400
But...

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
What a pity.

15
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,510
So this is what you want.

16
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,170
Goodbye.

17
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,920
You're chasing me so closely.

18
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,940

Li Xiangyi.

Weeping Guanyin lives up to its reputation.

Finally, all my old injuries have been healed.

24
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,870
It's worth my effort to hide my identity

with the Bone Constriction Skill.

26
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,880
Li Xiangyi, I’m going to meet you now.

27
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,409
It’s been ten years.

28
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,250
Li Xiangyi, how've you been?

29
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,830
Director Di.

30
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,720
You're still so clingy after not seeing each other for ten years.

31
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,140
That's why you recognized me at Wei Manor.

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,120
Or what?

33
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
Every day, for the past ten years, I've been wanting to

34
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,290
have a duel with you again.

35
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,490
But they said you were dead.

36
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,290
Why are you so happy that I'm not dead?

37
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,160
Excuse me. I've to go.

38
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,190
I have to go back to cook.

39
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,620
Why do you only have 10% of your power left?

40
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,090
You were poisoned by my Mingyue Chenxihai

41
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,570
and I was poisoned by your Beifeng Cuibahuang.

42
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,650
It's normal to be injured.

43
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,820
Even before taking Weeping Guanyin,

44
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,900
I still had 60% of my power.

45
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
What have you been doing for the past ten years?

46
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,350
To be honest,

47
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,190
I've been busy for the past ten years.

48
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,790
I was busy taking care of myself

49
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,510
and living a good life.

50
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,550
By the way,

51
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,180
I also learned how to cook.

52
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,180
Cooking?

53
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Yes, cooking.

54
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm quite good at it.

55
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,340
How could Li Xiangyi, the great Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect

56
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,810
and the best martial artist in the world,

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
have spent ten years doing such mundane things?

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,890
Director Di, you're too assertive.

59
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,690
These daily life skills are harder than martial arts training.

60
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,990
You know what? Cooking is even harder.

61
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,640
To cook a good dish,

62
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,700
you have to be very particular to its quality.

63
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,780
Try it someday if you don't believe me.

64
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,750
-I don’t want to listen to your nonsense.
-Make a dish of stir-fried cabbage.

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,230
Come with me now to find the elixir.

66
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,880
Wait.

67
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,270
If supplements really work,

68
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,230
why did you have to use the Bone Constriction Skill

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,450
to get Weeping Guanyin?

70
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,659
They're useless.

71
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,140
Besides,

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,990
I don't care to use them now.

73
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,830
Moreover,

74
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm fine now.

75
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,770
I have more vitality than before.

76
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,500
I didn't expect you to have been

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
living like a dog for the past ten years.

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,950
You are the dog.

79
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,000
You want to be a loser?

80
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,990
Fine.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,090
I'll grant you your wish.

82
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,570
I'll take you to Baichuan Court now

83
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,280
and let your men see

84
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,670
what have become of Li Xiangyi,

85
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,750
the Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect.

86
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,790
If you don't want dignity,

87
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,730
I'll make you lose all your dignity.

88
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,380
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,770
I can't take it anymore.

90
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,310
I'm going to throw up.

91
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,580
Throw up.

92
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,130
I-I can't.

93
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,290
I just lied to get you to stop.

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
You were flying too high.

95
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,790
If your inner power is interrupted,

96
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,860
you'll suffer a terrible fall.

97
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,220
What do you mean?

98
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,470
My inner power?

99
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,700
Stop trying.

100
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,290
Your inner power has been blocked.

101
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,520
The Weeping Guanyin?

102
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,460
Smart.

103
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,630
You poisoned it.

104
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,700
Don't come over.

105
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,920
A gentleman doesn’t resort to violence.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,270
It's Asura Grass from the Yipin Tomb.

107
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,260
One of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques, Asura Grass?

108
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,230
Not bad.

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,340
Director Di is really knowledgeable indeed.

110
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,240
It's been 100 years

111
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,380
but the corpse of Princess Nanyin in the tomb hasn't rotted

112
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,660
because she has Asura Grass in her body.

113
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,320
But just now,

114
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,580
I also took some grass seeds from her body

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,670
and put it in the Weeping Guanyin.

116
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,370
This thing grows rapidly when it's met with blood.

117
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,100
Now, the Asura Grass has blocked your meridians.

118
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,510
Li Xiangyi.

119
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,290
Did you plan all this long ago?

120
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,990
I just went to Yu City,

121
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,190
and found out you're still alive.

122
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,500
After you left the borders,

123
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,860
you'd definitely go look for the elixir to heal your injuries.

124
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,630
Then it must be the Weeping Guanyin.

125
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,289
I've heard some old stories before,

126
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,720
that the Weeping Guanyin was buried with Prince Fangji.

127
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,299
Isn't it a coincidence

128
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,670
that strange things also happened on Mount Puchu?

129
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,300
Then, I wanted to go out and have some fun.

130
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,770
I didn't expect

131
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,850
to see a kid with a sword on his back

132
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,430
throwing a tantrum in broad daylight.

133
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,390
It's been so many years

134
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,370
and you still haven't changed a bit.

135
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,730
I can tell that.

136
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,620
Li Xiangyi.

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,730
You haven't been training your martial arts skills,

138
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,260
but you've become more scheming.

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,170
Don't.

140
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,240
You want to kill me with Asura Grass?

141
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Before that,

142
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,190
do you believe I'll kill you first?

143
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,420
You're thinking too much.

144
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,660
I just

145
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,810
need your help with something.

146
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,440
Are you threatening me?

147
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,150
How could I threaten you?

148
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,180
We've known each other for a long time.

149
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,430
I know you.

150
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,550
You

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,950
are the least susceptible to threats.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,240
How about this?

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,950
Put down your sword first and let's talk.

154
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,110
After this matter is settled,

155
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll give you a gift.

156
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,200
The Mantra of Inner Body Cleansing.

157
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,580
Your master's ultimate skill?

158
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,600
That's right.

159
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,440
This skill can reverse the heart's pulse

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,550
and expel the strands of Asura Grass out of your body,

161
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,630
and restore your inner power.

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,610
Of course.

163
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,910
If you don't agree,

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,800
I won't force you.

165
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,780
You can just kill me with the sword.

166
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,390
What's the matter?

167
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,850
It's simple.

168
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,630
Firstly,

169
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,640
keep the secret of my identity for me.

170
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,850
Secondly,

171
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,200
where are the remains of my senior Shan Gudao?

172
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,810
I thought you wanted me to dissolve the Jinyuan Alliance,

173
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,530
or not hurt anyone in the martial world.

174
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,330
I can help you with the first thing.

175
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,220
I don't care if you're self-abasing.

176
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,900
I can't help you with the second thing.

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,410
Your senior has been dead for ten years.

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
The martial arts world has been in chaos for ten years.

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,190
I can't find his body.

180
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,960
Then, the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior

181
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,240
and stole his remains.

182
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,880
That's why I fought against you at the East Sea.

183
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,690
Over the past ten years,

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,550
I've been looking for his remains.

185
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,690
But I never found them.

186
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,170
With your order,

187
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,220
I'm sure you can summon the Jinyuan Alliance to investigate the past again

188
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,800
and help me find my senior.

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,740
It's not impossible that your senior was eaten by a wild dog.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,730
Do you want me to kill all the wild dogs in the world

191
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
to find the remains of your senior?

192
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,820
If that's the case,

193
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,420
Director Di,

194
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye

195
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
to your supreme martial arts skills.

196
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,660
Li Xiangyi.

197
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,500
Do you really think I won’t exhaust the torture methods

198
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,390
to force you to detoxify me?

199
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,610
You will.

200
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,550
Of course you will.

201
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,350
When you were feeling out my aura,

202
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,730
you realized that I don't have long to live.

203
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,620
What's the point of doing all that

204
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,930
to a dying man like me?

205
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,990
Stop wasting your time.

206
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,130
Otherwise, if I die before

207
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,610
I find my senior,

208
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,370
you'd be wasting your energy.

209
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,830
Greetings, My Lord.

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
Which coroner examined

211
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,680
Shan Gudao's corpse ten years ago?

212
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:15,880
My Lord.

213
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,220
Among the coroners in the Alliance,

214
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,750
Shi Hun has the best technique.

215
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,090
He must have been in charge of what you ordered.

216
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,390
Where is he now?

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,410
Because of the great battle ten years ago,

218
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,570
all the outstanding people in the Alliance were dispersed.

219
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
With the status of a coroner,

220
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,190
he has long disappeared and hidden from the martial arts world.

221
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,070
But I remember that

222
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,390
when Shi Hun was young,

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,130
he was adopted by a monk from Pudu Temple.

224
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,120
After he left the Alliance,

225
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,490
he might have returned to Pudu Temple.

226
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,730
My Lord, do you want me to investigate it?

227
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,640
No need.

228
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,300
Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court were built together.

229
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,890
I'll go there myself.

230
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,630
Don't tell anyone about this.

231
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,540
Tell the Alliance I have something personal to deal with.

232
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,820
Tell them not to bother me.

233
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,620
Yes.

234
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,450
Let's go,

235
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,570
to Pudu Temple.

236
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,640
Do you not dare to go?

237
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,990
Are you afraid that your men at Baichuan Court will see you like this?

238
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,890
That's not it.

239
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,690
Before I leave,

240
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,230
I have to bring someone with me.

241
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,610
Fang Duobing?

242
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,080
Smart.

243
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,280
You are really troublesome now.

244
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,880
Fang Duobing.

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,130
Fang Duobing?

246
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,320
Li Lianhua.

247
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,390
Are you okay?

248
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,190
Calm down.

249
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,600
Don't worry.

250
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,860
I'm fine.

251
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,290
I'm skilled at running away.

252
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,720
That brat is so good at martial arts.

253
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,230
By the way,

254
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,100
where is that little thing?

255
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,000
Where is he?

256
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,460
He left.

257
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,060
He left?

258
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,180
What about the Weeping Guanyin?

259
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,460
Hurry and go after him!

260
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,800
Calm down. Calm down.

261
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,360
You haven't recovered yet.

262
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,420
I told you.

263
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,470
He took it.

264
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Actually, this brat

265
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,190
meticulously planned all this

266
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,190
to cure his illness.

267
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,070
So,

268
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,200
I used this Weeping Guanyin

269
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,020
to exchange a lifetime of him not doing evil again,

270
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,290
and he naturally agreed.

271
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,710
That simple?

272
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,450
Not at all.

273
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,340
In order to convince him,

274
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,700
I'd exhausted all my words.

275
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,230
But luckily,

276
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,670
that brat is a man of his word.

277
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,150
He's just a bit impolite.

278
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,620
What about you?

279
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,320
Without the Weeping Guanyin, your heart disease...

280
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,610
I'll be fine.

281
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,300
I've survived for so many years.

282
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,510
Don't worry. I won't die.

283
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
After all, it's quite nice now.

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,920
Since I could convince that brat to stop hurting people,

285
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,800
it's all worth it.

286
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,310
You're still quite chivalrous.

287
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,590
Don't worry.

288
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,400
I've long regarded you as my partner.

289
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,020
Even if I have to search all the magical herbs in the world for your heart disease's elixir,

290
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,960
I will find it for you.

291
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,850
As for whether you regard me as a partner,

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,460
I don't care.

293
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,720
What else can I do?

294
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,630
I can't get rid of you anyway.

295
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,180
Take this.

296
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,130
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,320
Now that the entrance of Yipin tomb is open,

298
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,670
many bandits will barge in

299
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,120
to steal these treasures.

300
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,220
There's no time to lose.

301
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,500
Go and report it.

302
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Besides,

303
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,870
you should be solving your second big case now.

304
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,150
Can you stop mentioning it?

305
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
Everyone is dead now.

306
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
Who can testify for me?

307
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,230
Have you forgotten

308
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,650
that the one you hit at the entrance

309
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,910
is still alive?

310
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,410
That's right.

311
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,330
Who is blocking the way?

312
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,020
He's one of us.

313
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,860
He's the Iron Head Slave

314
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,540
who wore an iron helmet.

315
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,370
Remember?

316
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,819
The Iron Head Slave.

317
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,050
No wonder he looks so cold.

318
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
When did Iron Head Slave become one of us?

319
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,220
His name is Fei.

320
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,470
He's from the South Sea.

321
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,740
Many years ago,

322
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,920
I got acquainted with him.

323
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,079
Later, he was tricked by Master Wei

324
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,510
and was taken in as their Iron Head Slave.

325
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,750
I felt sorry for him.

326
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,310
I saw that he was homeless,

327
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,800
so I decided to take him in for a while.

328
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,660
It's just nice. You're taking Ge Pan to Baichuan Court

329
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,220
while I'm taking him to Pudu Temple

330
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,610
to find another old friend of his.

331
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,790
You talk so much nonsense.

332
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,290
You...

333
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,500
Who are you scolding?

334
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,470
How rude.

335
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,390
You don't have to argue with him.

336
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,860
It will degrade your status.

337
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,490
No.

338
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,260
We must set the rules.

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,650
How dare he.

Wait for me.

343
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,770
You... Slow down. Wait for me.

344
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,560
I'm starving. What should we have for dinner?

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,870

346
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,060
Ask your master

347
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,060

Isn't it the Rama Vessel?

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,680
You are really good at scheming.

Even the great Di Feisheng

355
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,360
was manipulated and in the palm of your hand.

356
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,490
Someone who is intent on plotting against others, never realizes that someone is also plotting against them.

357
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,010
Good.

358
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,290
Master will be very happy to see the Rama Vessel.

359
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,900

act all mysterious the most.

371
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,770
How did you survive to this age?

372
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,420
Egomaniac, let me tell you.

373
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,450
I think you have a decent physique.

374
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Why don't you become my disciple

375
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
and call me Master?

376
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,970
Then I can teach you

377
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,460
so that you won't get beaten up every day.

378
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,840
Your martial arts skills are average,

379
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,180
but you're quite bold.

380
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,720
Ridiculous.

381
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,720
My teacher is a powerful figure of the martial world,

382
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,280
the Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi.

383
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,190
You should be happy you have the luxury of being

384
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,490
the grand-disciple of the best of the best.

385
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,010
He even has a disciple.

386
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,620
He must be out of his mind

387
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,010
to take in a loser like you.

388
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,750
Stop being stubborn.

389
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,070
We'll talk after you defeat your master.

390
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,850
Aren't you hungry?

391
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,140
Let's eat.

392
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,020
Li Lianhua.

393
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,300
Are you really going to keep him at the Lotus Tower?

394
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Let me remind you.

395
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,620
That egomaniac has an irritating quality.

396
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,620
-He’ll get you into trouble.
-Fei knows how to act with discretion.

397
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,310
What's that smell?

398
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,290
What is this?

399
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,140
Are you studying new dishes again?

400
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,200
Wasn't the braised fish I adjusted for you yesterday

401
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,390
good?

402
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,160
That dish is already perfected.

403
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,620
So, naturally, I need to study new dishes.

404
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,310
I'll go pick a scallion from outside first.

405
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,510
Take this out for me.

406
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,160
And...

407
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,730
You're using me to test out your new dishes again.

408
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,730
Smells good.

409
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,110
Egomaniac.

410
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,180
Do you want to try Li Lianhua's new dish?

411
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,580
If you dare to finish it all at once,

412
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,700
I'll respect you as a real man.

413
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,820
If you attack me today,

414
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,600
I'll definitely not fight back.

415
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,740
Fine.

416
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,420
Wait.

417
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,120
Have you guys...

418
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,980
finished all the dishes already?

419
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,130
This is a three-day ration.

420
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,700
Him.

421
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,240
It's him.

422
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,120
He ate it all by himself.

423
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:37,950
Wait.

424
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,460
Didn't you say you have no sense of taste,

425
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,160
and you only eat white rice,

426
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,340
because everything tastes the same?

427
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,630
Let me tell you.

428
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,690
I didn't charge you for the food.

429
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,660
It turns out that you can't tell good food from bad food.

430
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,210
You tricked me on purpose.

431
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,340
You were the one who asked me to eat it.

432
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,140
I...

433
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,260
I spent 30 coins on the food.

434
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,010
It's time to rest.

435
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,580
There's only one guest room upstairs.

436
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,350
First come, first served.

437
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,300
The room on the second floor is the biggest.

438
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,170
It's big enough for you to live in together.

439
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,040
-No way.
-No way.

440
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,560
[Chayin Tower]

441
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,500
Second Court Master, I have news about Yipin Tomb.

442
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,300
You ordered for immediate reports,

443
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
so I dared not delay.

444
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,290
Ge Pan worked under me,

445
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,800
but I didn’t even realize he was up to something.

446
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
It was my negligence.

447
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,060
Why do you have to take responsibility for everything?

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,670
Ge Pan acted selfishly

449
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,630
and left Baichuan Court.

450
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,130
That was really unpredictable.

451
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,600
Luckily, Tianji Hall's Young Master Fang, who was present there,

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,070
and Lotus Tower's master Li Lianhua saw through him.

453
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,370
They are escorting Ge Pan

454
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,590
on the way to Baichuan Court.

455
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,670
He should bear the punishment he deserves.

456
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,260
Li Lianhua again?

457
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,530
Before, he chanced upon

458
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,370
Di Fengsheng, who left the borders after hiding for ten years.

459
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,390
Now he chanced upon

460
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,570
Xiling being broken into and the Weeping Guanyin being stolen.

461
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,980
What role is Li Lianhua playing in all this?

462
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,920
I'll get people to keep an eye on Lotus Tower.

463
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,240
Don't waste our men on that.

464
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,570
Isn't he coming?

465
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,430
There'll be a chance to investigate him.

466
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,410
When they arrive at Baichuan Court,

467
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,080
let me know immediately.

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,040
Yes.

469
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,450
We still have to do our best to follow Court Master's arrangement.

470
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Ask all the sentries to keep an eye on the Jinyuan Alliance's movements.

471
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,170
Di Fengsheng got the Weeping Guanyin.

472
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm afraid there will be another storm in the martial world.

473
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,640
[Wei Manor's Yipin Tomb]

474
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,800
[Lotus Tower]

475
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,840
What are you doing?

476
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Why are you standing and acting cool there?

477
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,090
You're even wearing a face mask.

478
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Li Lianhua said you don't dare to show your real face.

479
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,620
Why do I find it hard to believe?

480
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,450
How can an egomaniac like you be afraid of others?

481
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,470
Why are you so slow?

482
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,940
Do we have to climb up more to get to Baichuan Court?

483
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,250
I can't climb anymore.

484
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,980
Take them up first.

485
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,650
I'll ask Fei

486
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,230
to take me to Pudu Temple nearby for a rest.

487
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,250
Your stamina is too weak.

488
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,290
Eat some meat to replenish your health.

489
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,620
It's been more than ten days.

490
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
There's not a single meat soup.

491
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,610
Egomaniac.

492
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,000
Hurry and take him to Pudu Temple to rest.

493
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,590
and burn an incense for yourself while you're there,

494
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,010
to thank Buddha for blessing you such that you've survived up till now.

495
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,570
Go. Go. Go.

496
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,930
Let's go.

497
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,230
With Yangzhouman's power,

498
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,590
it shouldn't be so taxing for you to hike.

499
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,150
I really can't walk anymore.

500
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,460
Come.

501
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,080
Give me a hand.

502
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,170
You lost to me in the battle at the East Sea ten years ago.

503
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,010
The Sigu Sect fell apart

504
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,290
and you can't bounce back after just one setback.

505
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,690
I was wrong about you.

506
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,810
Life is unpredictable.

507
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,730
Entanglements are unintentional.

508
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,630
Look.

509
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,670
The scenery here is so beautiful.

510
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,320
Just treat it like I no longer have any desires.

511
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,770
Right now, I just want to find my senior's remains.

512
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,780
Let's split up later.

513
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,770
Go the monks at Pudu Temple and investigate

514
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,630
the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

515
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,950
I'll go check if there's any record on the name list.

516
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Thanks.

517
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,940
Here.

518
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,830

[Pudu Temple]

520
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,740
Slowly.

521
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,810
Bhante.

522
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,200
How's it going about what I'd asked you?

523
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,520
What Shi Hun? What Huiyuan?

524
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,330
I know nothing about it.

525
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,630
Ever since you became the abbot,

526
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,030
your temper has been very bad.

527
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Listen.

528
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,690
You need to cultivate yourself.

529
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,690
I was seeking for some peace and quiet,

530
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,700
but secular affairs are inherently disturbing.

531
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,450
No matter how good my cultivation is,

532
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,120
you'd still manage to infuriate me.

533
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,580
Are you aware of your physical condition?

534
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,050
That's why I'm anxious.

535
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:35,840
Bhante.

536
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,830
If you can't find Shi Hun,

537
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,130
I wouldn't be able to find my senior's remains.

538
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,090
Then, how can I face my master?

539
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,220
Besides,

540
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,260
I'm afraid I'll become a lonely wild ghost.

541
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,910
Look at you.

542
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
You've already thought about becoming a ghost.

543
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,270
So I'm really worried.

544
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,120
Can you stop being stubborn?

545
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,460
Who dares to be stubborn in front of the Almsgiver Li?

546
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,270
I thought you would come back after you made up your mind.

547
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,160
But you actually left for ten years.

548
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,470
I wrote to you once I heard some news.

549
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,580
Where is the letter?

550
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,690
Was it sent into the dog's stomach?

551
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,860
Letter?

552
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,330
You actually wrote to me?

553
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,980
You...

554
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,300
Where is the letter?

555
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,970
Was it you?

556
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,280
Bhante.

557
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,560
I don't have a fixed place to live.

558
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,520
I'm afraid it's lost.

559
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,580
You're being willful.

560
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,440
Then, I shortened your life to ten years,
but you didn't save yourself.

561
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,690
Now you should have one out of ten years left.

562
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,010
But your pulse

563
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,300
is much weaker than I expected.

564
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,810
It won't even last a year.

565
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,730
You should have gone back to Baichuan Court earlier.

566
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,780
Coincidentally,

567
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,330
everyone is there today.

568
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,110
All your old friends of Sigu Sect are here.

569
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,850
I'll take you back and vouch for your identity.

570
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,980
The martial arts world is huge.

571
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,300
If everyone put their heads together, they'll definitely figure a way to save you.

572
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,680
Why are you resisting me with your life?

573
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,910
In the year of Dingyou,

574
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,600
a greedy thief was

575
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,610
expelled from the temple.

576
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,910
Then, he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

577
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,900
and took on the name of Shi Hun.

578
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,640
It's recorded here.

579
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
You're so stubborn.

580
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
I really can't force you.

581
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,060
Did something happen in Baichuan Court?

582
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,160
I thought you're stone-hearted

583
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,370
and have completely erased your past.

584
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,370
So you still care about them.

585
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,050
I heard that

586
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,390
Yun Piqiu has been isolating himself in Baichuan Court for ten years.

587
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
I hastily guessed that

588
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,500
he was the one who poisoned you

589
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,010
with Bicha Poison then.

590
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,610
After he knew something happened to you,

591
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,170
Yun Biqiu regretted it so much,

592
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,370
so he rushed to the East Sea and searched for you for months but to no avail.

593
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,640
When Master Bai found him,

594
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,540
he had no intention to resist,

595
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,740
and was stabbed through the chest by Master Bai.

596
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,060
Fortunately, Master Ji found out that

597
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,800
he was indeed bewitched by the evil.

598
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,130
He didn't mean to hurt you.

599
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
So Master Ji sent someone to save him and made him stay.

600
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,530
But Yun Biqiu has been imprisoning himself for ten years,

601
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,420
and refuses to forgive himself.

602
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,120
Let me guess again.

603
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,140
It's not this matter that you can't let go of.

604
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,630
After all, what happened back then is like a chain reaction.

605
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,580
Someone has to let it go first.

606
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,480
Bhante.

607
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,630
You are really good at guessing.

608
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,970
But don't worry and talk about him anymore.

609
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,690
Tell me.

610
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,980
Did something happen to Baichuan Court?

611
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,050
Don't worry.

612
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,490
Baichuan Court is fine.

613
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,860
It just recently got a new sword.

614
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,090
So they

615
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,310
sent out invitations to all the friends of Sigu Sect

616
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,180
to a Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

617
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,080
This sword

618
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,320
was your personal sword in the past,

619
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,860
the Shaoshi Sword.

620
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,070
Then, many people followed the Shaoshi Sword into the East Sea.

621
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,770
Several years later, someone went fishing in the East Sea

622
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,890
and recovered this sword.

623
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,570
After that, the sword was resold repeatedly

624
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,170
until it returned to Baichuan Court.

625
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,970
It'd been used by 43 hands.

626
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,430
The fate of a famous sword.

627
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,460
Don't you think

628
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,690
it's time the sword return to its owner?

629
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,180
This famous sword

630
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,230
will naturally find a good master.

631
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,360
What about people?

632
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,680
Forget about others.

633
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,350
There's someone you have to meet.

634
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,980
Miss Qiao is also in Baichuan Court.

635
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,130
All these years,

636
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,010
she has been going to the temple to pray for you every year,

637
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,980
but she never lit the Rebirth Lantern.

638
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,330
Because no matter what, she refused to believe

639
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,070
that you're dead.

640
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,750
All these years,

641
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,100
Mr. Xiao has been guarding her laboriously.

642
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,750
She's waiting intently for you,

643
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,199
but you refuse to return even though you're alive.

644
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't you want to

645
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,540
resolve this misery?

646
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,840
Me not intervening

647
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,880
would be the best solution.

648
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,179
But you'll regret it in the end.

649
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
Life

650
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,450
is full of regrets.

651
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,100
It's been ten years.

652
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,900
There's nothing you can't let go.

653
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,920
And there's nothing that can't be solved.

654
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,730
I'm to blame for my incompetence.

655
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,470
I failed to persuade someone with a cold heart.

656
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,180
Bhante.

657
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,120
Would you answer my question now?

658
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,510
About Shi Hun of the Jinyuan Alliance?

659
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,140
Yes.

660
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,030
He's indeed Huiyuan who was expelled from Pudu Temple.

661
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,510
After the battle at the East Sea,

662
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,610
did you hear anything about Shi Hun?

663
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,420
When Baichuan Court was newly established,

664
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,980
they once captured the remnants of the defeated troops of Jinyuan Alliance from everywhere

665
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,410
and imprisoned hundreds of thousands men.

666
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,560
After that, Miss Qiao suggested

667
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,770
to release ordinary allies who have never done evil.

668
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,100
The name list of the released

669
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,460
was decided by Miss Qiao herself.

670
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,380
She must know who you are looking for.

671
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,930
The matters of the world are so mysterious.

672
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,370
You end up having to meet someone you don't want to.

673
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,860
Time to eat.

674
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,160
I cherish my life.

675
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,690
I never treat myself badly.

676
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,820
Come on.

677
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,140
Share the meal with me.

678
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,040
There's a new chef named Jingren in the temple.

679
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,010
He's quite a good cook.

680
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,130
Over the past half a month,

681
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,230
I've been eating a lot more.

682
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,630
I've sinned.

683
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,030
Oil paper,

684
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,090
and charcoal residue?

685
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,860
Come on.

686
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,120
Bhante.

687
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Has your new cook been eating secretly?

688
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,340
I won't join you in the meal.

689
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,260
Goodbye.

690
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,980
How did your investigation go?

691
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,820
Over the past ten years,

692
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,280
there are no records of Shi Hun visiting Pudu Temple.

693
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,440
Qiao Wanmian is the only clue now.

694
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,490
I'll go if you don't want to.

695
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,220
Don't worry.

696
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,010
We'll definitely figure everything out.

697
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
Director Di.

698
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,060
Now that you have no inner power,

699
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,670
you should keep a low profile.

700
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,820
[Baichuan Court]

701
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,790
For today's Sword-Appreciation Ceremony at Baichuan Court,

702
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,330
you need an invitation or referrer to enter.

703
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,770
Li Lianhua.

704
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,310
You came.

705
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,550
Yes.

706
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,810
It's the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

707
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,160
Fei insisted on joining in the fun.

708
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:47,900
By the way,

709
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,290
this is my friend.

710
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,720
He got quite famous recently.

711
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,980
He's the master of Lotus Tower, Li Lianhua.

712
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,540
As for this,

713
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
he's just a handyman.

714
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,910
I'll be the referrer and bring them in.

715
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,490
Let's go. Let's go.

716
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,320
Let me take you to a place.

717
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,270
Come on.

718
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,310
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

719
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,730
let me formally introduce someone to you.

720
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,780
This is the portrait of my master, Li Xiangyi.

721
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,570
It looks quite ordinary.

722
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,090
It can really ward off evil spirits.

723
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,830
Watch your mouth.

724
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,840
Be careful.

725
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,530
Since Baichuan Court was established,

726
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,200
his portrait has been hung up here.

727
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,540
It's been ten years.

728
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,340
No one can forget him.

729
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,620
By the way,

730
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,820
do you have candy with you?

731
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,900
Give me two.

732
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,030
What are you looking at?

733
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,520
I know you like candy.

734
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,440
Don't be stingy. Hurry up.

735
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,620
One more.

736
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,180
I only have one. Take it or leave it.

737
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,640
I bring him some every time I come here.

738
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,280
In everyone's eyes,

739
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,940
he is the sect leader of Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi.

740
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,380
Many people rely on him

741
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,660
and many people want to challenge him.

742
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,270
But not many people

743
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,770
really paid attention to his preferences.

744
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,420
Let me tell you secretly.

745
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,840
I've seen him

746
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,740
avoiding everyone to eat candy secretly.

747
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,020
Who would have thought

748
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,370
the number one martial artist Li Xiangyi

749
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,900
would be as happy as a child when eating candy?

750
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,630
Come to think of it,

751
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,560
-you are quite similar to my master...
-He’s not.

752
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,300
Not what?

753
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,440
In the great battle at the East Sea,

754
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,640
Li Xiangyi lost.

755
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,730
He should be the second best.

756
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,240
Are you saying Li Xiangyi lost to Di Fengsheng?

757
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,480
Did you witness it?

758
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,190
They fought at sea.

759
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,930
Where were you?

760
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,240
Are you a Fish Spirit or a Turtle Spirit?

761
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,810
Stop arguing.

762
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,810
Did you hear that?

763
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,260
It's about to start.

764
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,430
Let's go.

765
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:58,950
Don't talk nonsense.

766
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,340
There has been no news of the Shaoshi Sword for ten years.

767
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,040
It was found and reappeared

768
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,130
only because of the help of all my friends in the martial world.

769
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,290
More fortunately, we had two old friends who ran around with all their might.

770
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,680
So, it's Miss Qiao and Mr. Xiao

771
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,750
who found the Shaoshi Sword.

772
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,980
♫I'm only getting into character after half of my life♫

773
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,830
♫The youth can't be friends♫

774
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,280
♫Let bygones be bygones♫

775
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,460
♫The customer dressed in white and asking for wine enters the banquet gracefully♫

776
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,160
♫Smiling foolishly without speaking♫

777
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,930
♫So much affection that it's endless♫

778
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,920
♫The long night accompanies the moon on the rooftop♫

779
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,770
♫Push aside the clouds to count the stars♫

780
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,650
♫Old worries are so far away yet so close♫

781
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,650
♫Since ancient times, how many heroes could♫

782
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,300
♫gamble their lives♫

783
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,580
♫to win against the odds of love♫

784
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,100
♫Ask a question about the joys and sorrows of the lotus flower♫

785
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,920
♫Break a sword and throw it into the mud♫

786
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,270
♫Only when you're over your worries♫

787
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,160
♫Can you live up to all beings♫

788
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:33,980
After all these years,

789
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,260
to have found the Shaoshi Sword that never left Xiangyi's hand,

790
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,410
we're also very comforted.

791
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,320
Today, I hope the people of the martial arts world

792
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,490
don't forget the ideal of punishing evil, promoting good

793
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,150
and bringing peace to the world.

794
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,440
So that we don't let Xiangyi down.
