00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,780
I've been out for so long this time.

5
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,270
Father must be worried about me.

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,380
The Supervision Bureau will escort me back to the palace.

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,850
Farewell, your Highness.

8
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,610
You're in such a hurry to bid me farewell.

9
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Do you take me for a plague?

10
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,400
But you said you were leaving.

11
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,440
Is your brain only good for solving cases?

12

All right, I'm leaving now.

13
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,700
Don't worry about running away from the wedding.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,490
I will go back and beg for leniency for you.

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,160
Your Highness, you're very understanding.

16
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,660
Thank you so much.

What are you thanking me for?

18
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,079
It doesn't matter how soon or how late we hold the wedding.

19
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,430

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
After all, it's a marriage bestowed by my father.

27
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,190

I escaped all the way to Fragrant Mountain, but I got caught anyway.

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,310
it's good for you to go home.

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,220
We've found

107
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,330
Jin Mantang's ancestral hall.

108
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,090
But we've never seen Yu Louchun's ancestral hall.

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,690
I think the formula for the antidote

110
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,450
should be in the same place as the ancestral hall.

111
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,990
Mr. Fang,

112
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,450
can I have a word with you?

113
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,340
-Go ahead.
-I’m sorry.

114
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,780
I'll look into the ancestral hall.

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,510
Let's go there.

116
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,430
Mr. Fang,

117
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
are you the nephew of Shan Gudao?

118
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,960
Yes.

119
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,540
That's good.

But I have a favor to ask.

124
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
Please help me.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,220
Go ahead.

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,220
Many years ago,

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,900
Shan Gudao once brought a piece of cloud iron

128
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,900
to the Weapon Valley.

129
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,790
He said he wanted to make himself an armor piece

130
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,420
and a sword for Li Xiangyi.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,900
But he died in the battle against the Jinyuan Alliance.

132
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,560
It doesn't make sense.

133
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Why?

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,780
Mr. Fang, you don’t know.

135
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,420
Cloud iron is both the toughest and softest material to exist.

136
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,580
The Weapon Valley had only ever seen

137
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,900
Shan Gudao with such a material in a hundred years.

138
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
The armor forged from cloud iron

139
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,440
can only be penetrated by

140
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,860
Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword,

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
which was also made from cloud iron.

142
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,370
I saw my father forge it with my own two eyes.

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,710
There's no doubting it.

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,530
So I wanted to ask you

145
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,940
if Shan Gudao was wearing the armor

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,320
when he died.

147
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,350
This...

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
Only Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword

149
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,390
can penetrate Shan Gudao's armor.

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
Isn't it just like what they said at the Sigu Tea Party?

151
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,700
The death of Shan Gudao is very strange indeed.

152
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,020
My father held a grudge

153
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,300
over this matter for years.

154
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,860
That’s why I came to ask you.

155
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,820
He wasn't wearing

156
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,340
the armor.

157
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,750
I see.

158
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,860
Great!

159
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Great.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,400
I’ll take my leave.

161
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,300
If you do visit me in the Weapon Valley in the future,

162
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,460
I’ll compose ten poems for you.

163
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,340
Goodbye.

164
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,220
Goodbye.

165
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,890
The armor was indeed on my father's body.

166
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,980
But a hole was pierced into it by a sword.

167
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,620
What the hell is going on here?

168
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,890
Fang Xiaobao.

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,810
Why are you spacing out?

170
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,900
Let's go. I found the ancestral hall.

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,370
I asked Xifei.

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,120
There should be a Yingyue Pavilion

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,680
near the Guanri Pavilion.

174
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
It's just a pavilion.

175
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,100
Why didn't Yu Louchun allow

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
anyone near it for the past few years?

177
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,580
All these years,

178
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,920
Xifei has only seen one guest,

179
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,290
Jin Mantang.

180
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,190
What's on your mind?

181
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,100
The fog here is so heavy,

182
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,700
it's exactly the same as the fog at the Yipin Tomb.

183
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,540
If my guess is right,

184
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,020
the key

185
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,330
should be this tree.

186
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,830
I did it.

187
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,620
Let's go.

188
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,980
Li Lianhua!

189
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,580
Li Lianhua!

190
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,510
Fei!

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
At least you have a conscience.

192
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,100
The trick of this mechanism is the stone walls on both sides.

193
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,180
Think of a way to push them back.

194
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,440
Why don't you think of a way?

195
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,540
Yangzhouman?

196
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm exhausted.

197
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,460
Your inner power is Yangzhouman?

198
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,110
I'm very familiar with inner powers.

199
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,890
Where did you learn it from?

200
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,290
Tell me,

201
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,460
what's the name of this technique?

202
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,210
Oh, it's an amazing one.

203
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,380
It's as powerful as Yangzhouman,

204
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,340
called Suzhoukuai.

205
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,260
This is not Yangzhouman.

206
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,450
It's called Suzhoukuai, understand?

207
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
I’ll teach you next time.

208
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,020
What are you waiting for?

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,190
Find Li Lianhua.

210
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,420
What happened to the two of you?

211
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,520
What took you so long?

212
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,860
Everything is here.

213
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,600
I found them.

214
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,250
Young master, here.

215
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,690
This is the formula for the antidote.

216
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,740
Take it.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,560
Take a good look.

218
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,580
Take it.

219
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,840
This is Yu Louchun's ledger from ten years ago.

220
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,980
I've checked all these ledgers.

221
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,230
Ten years ago,

222
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,410
Yu Louchun

223
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,820
rarely invited people to the Girls' Mansion.

224
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
Apart from Jin Mantang,

225
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,740
there were only two other people.

226
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,530
One of them was Four-faced Qingzun from the Jinyuan Alliance.

227
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,640
The other was the Lord of the Netherworld.

228
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,640
I think these two are descendants of Nanyin.

229
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,920
Four-faced Qingzun and Jinyuan Alliance?

230
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,740
Oh, right.

231
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,260
It's also a famous sect in the martial world.

232
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,580
It’s no surprise if you've heard of it before.

233
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,660
But the Four-faced Qingzun

234
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,620
had long died in

235
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
Prison 188,

236
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,930
which is your territory.

237
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,230
The only clue left

238
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,060
is this Lord of the Netherworld.

239
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,740
See?

240
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,490
I'm still the best.

241
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,740
Fang Xiaobao.

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,960
Why are you spacing out?

243
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,630
I'm not.

244
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,460
I just think

245
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,630
it's good to have a smart friend like you.

246
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,510
That's right.

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,340
Let's go.

248
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,940
You two nearly scared me to death.

249
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,340
Hurry up.

250
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,380
This is the prescription.

251
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,790
Please find a physician

252
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,170
to make an antidote for the guards.

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,290
Don’t worry, Mr. Fang.

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,410
Will you report back to Sigu Sect with us?

255
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,950
I have something important to do.

256
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,560
Please help me

257
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,670
report back instead, Sister Shi.

258
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,950
What are the Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin up to?

259
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,210
If you've changed your mind,

260
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,350
it's not too late.

261
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,860
Maybe Baichuan Court

262
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,420
can reduce your punishment.

263
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,190
Fine.

264
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,900
You're on your own.

265
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,930
If it's really him,

266
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,180
how could he be hurt by Li Yifu?

267
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,170
He brought it on himself.

268
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,140
Are you okay?

269
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,700
I'm fine.

270
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,200
He was right behind you just now.

271
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,500
You really didn't notice?

272
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,010
No.

273
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Luckily you came in time.

274
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,430
That really scared me.

275
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,700
Check it out for me.

276
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,390
How is it?

277
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,980
Is it serious? Any marks?

278
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,820
Stop messing around.

279
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,160
Miss Shi,

280
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,790
shall we proceed to the

281
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,620
local government office

282
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
and count the confiscated goods?

283
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,400
Let's go.

284
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,560
Let's go.

285
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,540
It's time to move.

286
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,860
Let's find the Lord of the Netherworld.

287
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are we avoiding the Baichuan Court?

288
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,460
That's because you've done a lot of evil in the martial world.

289
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,060
If someone finds out,

290
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,300
it'll be a big trouble.

291
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Am I really wrong?

292
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,350
How could Li Lianhua be Li Xiangyi?

293
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,340
But...

294
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,340
What about the Yangzhouman?

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,580
Di Feisheng.

296
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,050
Li Xiangyi.

297
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,460
No.

298
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,260
I have to get to the bottom of this.

299
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,580
What are you doing?

300
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,790
Here.

301
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,900
Have a drink on me.

302
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,860
A celebration for

303
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,360
solving the big Girls' Mansion case.

304
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,740
You're treating me with my wine?

305
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,620
You're so eloquent.

306
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,550
I just want to drink and

307
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,500
chat with you, can't I?

308
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,460
What do you want to chat about?

309
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,490
How about why you know Yangzhouman?

310
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,680
What Yangzhouman? You're so full of strange words.

311
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,940
Stop pretending.

312
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,950
It's the inner skill mental factor you taught me.

313
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,500
Let me tell you.

314
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,020
I rarely offer to let bygones be bygones.

315
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Think before you answer.

316
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,220
If you're really hiding something from me,

317
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
you'd better tell me everything today.

318
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,810
You mean the mental factor?

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,340
I remember it now.

320
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,220
What did I tell you back in that cave?

321
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,700
Can you stop talking nonsense?

322
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,940
There can't be so many coincidences at once.

323
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,970
Do you take this for writing a script?

324
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,560
Let me ask you.

325
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,100
You know Yangzhouman,

326
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,340
and you appeared in Yuanbao Villa at the same time

327
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,850
as that mysterious swordsman in white.

328
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,240
You...

329
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,270
Are you Li Xiangyi?

330
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,960
Li Xiangyi? How's that possible?

331
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,050
Fang Xiaobao.

332
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,230
If I were Li Xiangyi,

333
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,450
how could Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi not have recognized me?

334
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,660
Besides,

335
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,740
I asked you to practice every day,

336
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,470
but you only think about this nonsense.

337
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,680
What?

338
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,569
You don't trust me?

339
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,020
Do you know that

340
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,819
my father had impenetrable armor

341
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,020
forged from cloud iron?

342
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,280
Cloud Iron?

343
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,619
Junior.

344
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,750
It's your first time leaving the mountains for training.

345
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,780
The He family of Changma Blade Sect

346
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,220
was besieged by the Dongling Three Gang.

347
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,380
It'll be dangerous.

348
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,340
You should not take the risk.

349
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,050
My Shaoshi Sword is meant for

350
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,650
upholding fairness and justice.

351
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,320
The Changma Blade Sect has long retired.

352
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,660
The Dongling Three Gang claims to be eliminating bandits,

353
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,620
but they are actually coveting the He family's cloud iron.

354
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,330
I must interfere with this matter.

355
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,420
Father.

356
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,340
Father!

357
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,650
Father!

358
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,100
Father!

359
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,380
Wake up, Father.

360
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,350
Master He.

361
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,450
Here.

362
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,700
Gentlemen,

363
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,220
I beg of you.

364
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,050
Send my son to his grandfather's place in Luoyang.

365
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,220
Don't worry.

366
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,290
-We will...
-Junior.

367
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,140
I heard that the He family owns the

368
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,940
cloud iron, a material that is both tough and soft.

369
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,850
Heroes,

370
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,620
as long as my son arrives safely,

371
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,050
he will tell you the whereabouts of the cloud iron.

372
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,130
There is no need.

373
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,900

You escorted the kid to Luoyang alone.

Lian Quan, Lord of the Netherworld,

It is said that Shishou Village was famous for

its Rouchang wine, which can enhance one's inner power.

457
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,330
Back then, many people in the martial world went there for the wine.

If Rouchang wine can increase his inner power,

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,460
Let's go.

559
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,490
Let's go over there.

560
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,560
Out of the woods, another village.

561
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
It's truly destined.

562
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,100
You were staring at that lake for a long time.

563
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,890
You must have long noticed that

564
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,210
something was under the lake, right?

565
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,460
Fei, what's wrong?

566
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,790
The Wuxin Huai poison is spreading throughout his body.

567
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,400
Use your power to suppress it for him.

568
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,120
I...

569
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,870
Why should I save this villain?

570
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,930
Hurry up.

571
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,750
Fine.

572
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,510
I can't let you die

573
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,140
before I take you to Baichuan Court.

574
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,820
Why is this small village so quiet?

575
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,380
Are you feeling better?

576
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,690
The Jinyuan Alliance. My Lord.

577
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,010
What do they mean?

578
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,110
You mentioned these words before.

579
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,400
You must know something.

580
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,630
Why do I have a headache whenever I think of it?

581
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,760
Well,

582
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,010
about the Jinyuan Alliance.

583
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,180
You really were

584
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,750
the evil leader of the Jinyuan Alliance.

585
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,150
You were their lord.

586
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,050
However,

587
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,970
you've turned over a new leaf.

588
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,030
You are no longer on their side.

589
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,860
That's why they poisoned you.

590
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:43,680
What's wrong?

591
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,500
Your words can never be fully trusted.

592
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,630
But I can't completely disregard them either.

593
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,500
Listen.

594
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,420
-I’m not lying.
-Let's enter the village.

595
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,590
Li Lianhua.

596
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,970
How long do you think we can

597
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,030
keep lying to him like this?

598
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,050
But if he regains his memory,

599
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,490
he might be able to figure out

600
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,930
what happened in the Jinyuan Alliance.

601
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,010
I have something

602
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,050
to ask him too.

603
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,290
Is it about your father?

604
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,050
If he regains his memory,

605
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,980
do you think he'll be a friend or foe?

606
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,190
[Shishou Village]

607
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,920
Shishou Village?

608
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,860
This is the legendary paradise?

609
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,650
Maybe it's not paradise season yet.

610
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,490
Right?

611
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,720
But this village is so hidden.

612
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,770
Did the Lord of the Netherworld really come here?

613
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,120
It's been so many years.

614
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,330
It's not easy to find someone.

615
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,180
It's not dark yet.

616
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,270
Why is there no one outside?

617
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,030
Kid.

618
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,940
Excuse me.

619
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:01,970
It's getting dark.

620
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,190
I told you not to run around.

621
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,420
The villagers are strange.

622
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,500
They seem to be avoiding something.

623
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,100
Wasn't this place known for its Rouchang wine,

624
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,780
and many martial artists came here for it?

625
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,420
Why is it in this state instead?

626
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,060
This place is indeed strange.

627
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,740
It's getting late.

628
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,580
Let's find an inn first.

629
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,420
Let's go.

630
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,900
[Yuquan Inn]

631
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,130
It seems

632
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,660
[Yuquan Inn]

633
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,340
no one has lived here for a long time.

634
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,940
This village is so desolate.

635
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
But they built an inn here.

636
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,580
Who is it for?

637
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,540
Maybe it was quite lively a few years ago.

638
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,490
Don't forget.

639
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,170
Many martial artists

640
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,090
came here for the Rouchang wine.

641
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,670
Let's go in.

642
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,000
What is this?

643
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,650
Don't you think

644
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,150
there's a strange smell here?

645
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,400
What smell?

646
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,810
The smell of the dead.

647
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,050
It's all blood.

648
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,590
You're right.

649
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,320
The marks here are short and messy.

650
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,010
They weren't caused by swords or blades.

651
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,670
It's more like

652
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,250
someone tore into them with bare hands.

653
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,450
The blood splattered very fast.

654
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,330
I'm afraid the victim won't survive.

655
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,470
Look.

656
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,910
Be careful.

657
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,530
This way.

658
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,970
Someone hanged to death here.

659
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,010
Since they have retrieved the body,

660
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,870
why didn't they remove the cloth

661
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,450
and the bench on the ground?

662
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,020
At night, the ghost emerged from the fourth room.

663
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,030
It peeped into my window.

664
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,700
I am terrified.

665
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,970
I wish you were here.

666
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,340
It's a suicide note.

667
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,020
This is left by a woman.

668
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,020
Before her husband returned,

669
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,170
she encountered something terrible.

670
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,280
It forced her to hang herself.

671
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,700
She said a ghost entered through the window.

672
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,050
The main hall does have a lot of

673
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,450
bamboo tags with ghost characters on them.

674
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,100
Is this another haunted inn?

675
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,420
Don't you think it's strange?

676
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,720
There's the sound of wind outside,

677
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,400
but the wind can't get in.

678
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,430
It's as if someone is blocking the wind.

679
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,610
It's a ghost.

680
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,740
The ghost blocked the wind for you.

681
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,650
Are you done?

682
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,320
Fine.

683
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,820
Let's go our separate ways.

684
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,650
Did you find anything?

685
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,860
There are signs of a

686
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,090
serious battle in the room.

687
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,200
But the bodies are all gone.

688
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,870
It's like everyone disappeared

689
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,460
at the same time one day.

690
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,070
How did we get in here?

691
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,470
There's a door.

692
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,730
You're right.

693
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,050
What is it?

694
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
This severed hand was ripped off.

695
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,900
Judging from the decay,

696
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,610
it should be less than four to five days.

697
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,740
That means

698
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,280
this ghost is still killing.

699
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,680
Why are you looking at me?

700
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,940
Think about it.

701
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,180
We've been in the inn for so long.

702
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,760
Maybe we're already being targeted.

703
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,300
If we don't leave this inn now,

704
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,670
we'll be in danger.

705
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,500
Look. On the doorframe.

706
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Looks like this hand

707
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,460
had an insane grip.

708
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,620
If not for the traces of martial arts,

709
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,610
I would have thought that the people here

710
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,470
were torn apart by a vicious tiger.

711
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,270
The pillar was broken like this.

712
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,580
I'm afraid this beast

713
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,080
was no match for the owner of this severed hand either.

714
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,700
They even managed to

715
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,100
split such a tough copper censer.

716
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,410
This was split open in one strike.

717
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,680
The person must have been quite skilled.

718
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,260
But they are still inferior to me.

719
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,370
Why are you looking at me?

720
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,480
The sword mark split the copper censer from the center.

721
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,460
But the sword tilted left by three points.

722
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,840
This seems to be a move from Zhaoyue Sect.

723
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:55,920
Also,

724
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,820
the fingerprints and the palm print on the doorframe

725
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,160
were also made by people.

726
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,660
The finger strength was strong enough to dent a hard surface.

727
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,020
There are also claw marks on each side.

728
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,820
This is the outer martial arts of the Kunlun Sect.

729
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,310
Identifying the moves and sects only through the marks...

730
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,570
Only those who are skilled in martial arts can do that.

731
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,910
Li Lianhua.

732
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,700
Who are you?

733
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,560
Zhaoyue here,

734
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,470
Kunlun there.

735
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,640
Looks like a bunch of skilled martial artists

736
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,430
really did fight here.

737
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,110
If it really was a fight between martial artists,

738
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,980
why are there so many

739
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,950
beast marks here?

740
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,260
Fang Xiaobao,

741
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,240
have you heard of

742
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,200
any sect in the martial world

743
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,640
that specializes in taming beasts?

744
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,520
What are you doing?

745
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,890
Why are you spacing out at night?

746
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,910
I've never heard of it.

747
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,170
You're right.

748
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,500
Where did these people go?

749
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,410
Whether they won or lost the fight,

750
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,040
they had to leave after fighting.

751
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,300
They might have left after the fight,

752
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
but this is an inn.

753
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,780
It has been deserted all these years.

754
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,220
Is there no one here to clean this up?

755
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,880
So many people died here,

756
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,660
and there are so many talismans downstairs.

757
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,440
Maybe no one dared to come in

758
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,810
because this place is haunted.
