Have you really made up your mind?

There are some things that I have to solve myself.

The leader of the Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi, is not dead.

22
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,520
Yes.

The traitor, Yun Biqiu,

24
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,390
conspired with Jiao Liqiao repeatedly

25
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,180

38
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,030
A kind of concealing potion was used on these letters.

39
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,840
With them, you leaked out everything

40
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,190
pertaining to the location and layout

41
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,440

Biqiu. Oh, Biqiu...

44
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,630
Ten years ago, you were bewitched by Jiao Liqiao's beauty.

45
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,600
All these years,

46
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,409
you stayed at home and refused to travel,

47
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,260
as if you were punishing yourself.

48
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,610
I really thought that you'd grounded yourself

49
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,630

after ten years,

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,640
you are still so stubborn?

53
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,740
You even harmed the Sect Leader

54
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,320

It has brought countless villains to justice in the past years.

It's unforgivable.

why must you be so stubborn?

111
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,200
I've let you down.

112
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
I poisoned you back then

113
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,450
and severely wounded you recently.

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,800
I am too ashamed to live on.

115
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,980
What about the good things you did?

116
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,980
Why didn't you mention them?

117
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,840
You defamed yourself

118
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,770
and used the map of the 188 prisons as bait

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,720
to earn Jiao Liqiao's trust.

120
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,120
You found the details of her defenses

121
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,190
and deliberately disclosed them to Fang Duobing.

122
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,460
That's how everyone was able to find and save me that day.

123
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,730
It was also you

124
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,930
who pretended to be bewitched by her beauty

125
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,840
and made Jiao Liqiao let her guard down.

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,950
You induced her to make flawed mechanisms

127
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,180
and destroyed half of Shan Gudao's foundation.

128
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,840
Am I right?

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,460
Sect Leader,

130
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,010
are you telling the truth?

131
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,220
Everyone,

132
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,990
these are the mechanism blueprints

133
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,700
found in Jiao Liqiao's hideout.

134
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,980
They are all written by Yun Biqiu.

135
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,750
You can verify them.

136
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,180
Anyone who knows how to design mechanisms

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,040
can tell what Yun Biqiu did to them.

138
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,750
When I saw the layout of the statues on the roofs,

139
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I knew something was weird about them.

140
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,550
All the traps we encountered along the way

141
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,590
had their mechanisms exposed.

142
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,580
It was very obvious.

143
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,460
Any designer would know that

144
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,980
the mechanism should be hidden.

145
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,980
And this mechanism...

146
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,340
Someone deliberately placed this mechanism here

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,770
for people to see.

148
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,060
He even buried 18 fire bombs around the court,

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,860
saving everyone from a bloody battle.

150
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,510
I see.

151
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,100
Biqiu.

152
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,870
You did all those things.

153
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,670
Why didn't you tell us about it?

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,310
Sect Leader was poisoned and fell into the sea because of me.

155
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,760
Later, he was also stabbed by me.

156
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,320
58 members of the Sigu Sect died because of me.

157
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,830
No matter what I do,

158
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,090
I cannot amend my sins.

159
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,030
Biqiu.

160
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,720
When you stabbed me that day,

161
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,240
you purposely missed the spot by half an inch.

162
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,340
You originally asked me out that day

163
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,620
to tell me this information.

164
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,740
But unexpectedly,

165
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,200
Jiao Liqiao had secretly sent someone to spy on you.

166
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm not talking about the past.

167
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm sorry

168
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,700
for the present.

169
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,770
Only by stabbing me can you get Jiao Liqiao

170
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,290
to lower her guard against you.

171
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,890
That way, she no longer doubted

172
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,420
the mechanisms you placed.

173
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,240
So,

174
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,430
you helped me find Jiao Liqiao's place,

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,350
and I was able to catch all of them at once.

176
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,600
What you did back then

177
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,520
was not your intention either.

178
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,580
Since you wish to repent,

179
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,490
we shall

180
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,610
let bygones be bygones.

181
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,700
Sect Leader.

182
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,620
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

183
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,240
Master Yun.

184
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,380
In order to clear your name,

185
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,150
that man named Li Xiangyi

186
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,340
had to come back from the bottom of the sea.

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,430
And that man called Li Lianhua

188
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,180
can no longer be

189
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,860
a carefree wandering physician anymore.

190
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,570
Sect Leader...

191
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,620
How is he?

192
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,860
It's Xueronghua.

193
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
What is Xueronghua?

194
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,910
It's Snow Master's dark skill.

195
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,760
Jiao Liqiao must have done it

196
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,920
to control Biqiu.

197
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,540
The only way

198
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,630
to detoxify the poison is

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,960
to circulate his blood with Snow Master's inner power.

200
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,540
Otherwise, the poison will reach his heart and kill him.

201
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,910
Jiao Liqiao and Snow Master are both dead.

202
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,650
Xueronghua is now a lost skill.

203
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,670
Then Biqiu...

204
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,550
He won't last long.

205
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,730
He knew that,

206
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,570
but he didn't stop me from killing Snow Master back then.

207
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,910
Xiaobao.

208
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,340
Does Tianji Hall have a secret branch in this vicinity?

209
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,950
Can you help me find a way

210
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,390
to cure the Xueronghua?

211
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,020
Okay.

212
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,370
I'll contact them now.

213
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:40,690
[Roam with a Noble Spirit]

214
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,310
The rest of you may leave too.

215
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,740
We'll plan after Biqiu wakes up.

216
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,400
It's not that I don't care about my life.

217
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,690
But Li Xiangyi said back then

218
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,020
that he would protect everyone in Sigu Sect.

219
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,640
And yet, 58 brothers died

220
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
in the East Sea battle.

221
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,770
If I let Sigu Sect lose another member now,

222
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,550
how will I face my fallen brothers

223
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,690
in the Netherworld?

224
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,280
At least my last bit of inner power

225
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,880
is useful in the end.

226
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,330
I really shouldn't have been wasteful

227
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,680
when I was young.

228
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,660
Then I wouldn't have had to

229
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,630
put my life on the line

230
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,450
just to do some good with my inner power.

231
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,960
Sect Leader.

232
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,530
You're awake.

233
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,610
Did you

234
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,740
cure the Xueronghua for me?

235
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,480
Do you

236
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,110
feel better?

237
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,420
I...

238
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
I...

239
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,060
Biqiu.

240
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,480
Back then, at the East Seaside,

241
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,270
I fought the Jinyuan Alliance alone.

242
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,960
I had no way out and no reinforcements.

243
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,250
I sank the ship with everything I had.

244
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,310
But the Bicha Poison struck

245
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,190
and I fell into the sea.

246
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,690
Back then,

247
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,290
I really hated you.

248
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,440
After I made my way out of the sea alive,

249
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,990
I swore

250
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,230
to take revenge

251
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,670
even if it would land me in hell.

252
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,940
I...

253
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,700
Deserve to die.

254
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,540
Actually,

255
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,990
after the battle at the East Sea,

256
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,000
I went back to Sigu Gate.

257
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,930
While in hiding,

258
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,420
I saw the sect crumble and fall apart.

259
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,060
I also heard

260
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,730
complaints I'd never heard of before.

261
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,000
I was confused

262
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,860
and lost my direction.

263
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,460
I thought about it for a long time.

264
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,360
Maybe that failure was caused by

265
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,210
my own stubbornness.

266
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,890
No.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,660
It doesn't matter anymore.

268
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,730
I don't want to go back to Sigu Sect.

269
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,140
Let me tell you something funny.

270
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,600
Back then, I had no money on me,

271
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,250
[Pawn]

272
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,620
and I was injured.

273
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,940
So I pawned the only valuable

274
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,180
item on my body

275
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,030
for 50 taels of silver.

276
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,940
It was the Sigu Sect Leader token.

277
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,589
A token that could spare or take a life at will,

278
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,560
a token that everyone in the martial world

279
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,970
knew about.

280
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,310
Biqiu.

281
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,510
Don't you think it's funny?

282
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,410
Such a powerful token was only worth 50 taels.

283
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,810
At that time, I thought

284
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,250
I would redeem it

285
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,050
as soon as I was better.

286
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,590
But at one point in time,

287
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,840
I started growing turnips instead.

288
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,970
Growing turnips?

289
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,440
It's so that I won't starve anymore.

290
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,550
It was spring then.

291
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,910
I thought the turnips were growing too slowly.

292
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,090
I looked at them every day,

293
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,350
and counted them every day.

294
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,740
When I saw the turnip bellies

295
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,950
poking out of the soil,

296
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,420
I was so happy,

297
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
I almost cried.

298
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,310
Before I knew it,

299
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,240
I somehow saved up 50 taels of silver.

300
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,360
It had been three years

301
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,500
since I fell into the sea.

302
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,150
I took the 50 taels of silver to the pawnshop

303
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,260
to redeem the token.

304
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,570
In a poor fishing village,

305
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,680
no one knew what it was.

306
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,950
The token was still there, but I hesitated.

307
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,420
It turned out that I'd forgotten the martial world.

308
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,950
I no longer yearned to be the best

309
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,020
or to be admired by everyone.

310
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,640
I kept myself fed

311
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,500
and even kept a dog fed.

312
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,570
Such a life

313
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,190
was perfect.

314
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,180
When I thought of you one day,

315
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,180
I suddenly forgot why I hated you.

316
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,180
The past doesn't matter anymore.

317
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,420
Sect Leader.

318
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,750
If those are not important,

319
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,600
what is?

320
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,190
What matters is your future life.

321
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,410
You've always liked studying.

322
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,580
You can become a scholar,

323
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,910
or get married

324
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,380
and live a peaceful life.

325
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,550
Biqiu.

326
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,910
Live well.

327
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,900
Live for yourself.

328
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,820
Okay.

329
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,140
I'll listen to you.

330
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,780
I'll live well.

331
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:21,830
What about you?

332
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,010
What about your Bicha Poison?

333
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,550
Don't worry.

334
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,980
I can even cure your Xueronghua.

335
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,590
Let alone

336
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,260
a mere Bicha Poison.

337
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,990
[Grand Hall]

338
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,030
Li Lianhua!

339
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,320
What's wrong with you?

340
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,100
You saved Yun Biqiu with Yangzhouman?

341
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,350
You truly hold no grudge

342
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,260
or resentment against him.

343
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,660
Those who truly repent

344
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,150
deserve a second chance.

345
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,460
No.

346
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,960
You can't delay any longer.

347
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,030
You need to take the Styx Flower now.

348
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,060
Where is the Styx Flower?

349
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,570
I've kept it locked in here

350
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,300
since Di Feisheng gave it to us.

351
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,420
Where did it go?

352
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,020
Li Lianhua,

353
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,200
how did His Majesty cure his poison?

354
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,080
Did you use the Styx Flower to save His Majesty?

355
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,060
Fang Xiaobao.

356
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,460
You now...

357
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Don't you know that there's only this one Styx Flower

358
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,570
left in this world

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,940
that can save your life?

360
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,860
I knew you would be angry.

361
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,300
To be honest,

362
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,100
the Styx Flower

363
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,050
only had 30% of the chance to detoxify my poison.

364
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,550
It will be a waste to use it on me.

365
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,360
I might as well give it to someone who needs it more.

366
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,260
Right?

367
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,550
Greetings, Your Majesty.

368
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I'm here today

369
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,050
to present this to Your Majesty,

370
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,850
to help clear Your Majesty's poison.

371
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,200
No wonder His Majesty let my father go so quickly.

372
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,700
No wonder he's no longer afraid of you.

373
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,940
Li Lianhua,

374
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,660
so many people work so hard to get you to live.

375
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,460

561
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,900
and held the leader of Wansheng Clan at swordpoint.

562
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,760
Bravo! Bravo!

563
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,230
What happened after that?

564
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,860
Go on.

565
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,540
Go on.

566
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,530
Tomorrow is the day.

567
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,460
Fox Spirit,

568
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,780
do you think he will come?

569
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,920
Did this Li Xiangyi not come

570
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,070
because he's afraid?

571
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Who is this Li Xiangyi?

572
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,920
I think this is his deliberate tactic used

573
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,220
to mess with Di Feisheng's emotions.

574
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,860
Sect Leader, do you think something has happened?

575
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,910
Excuse me, may I know who is Di Feisheng,

576
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,070
and who is Fang Duobing?

577
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,000
I am.

578
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,770
Someone asked me to deliver a letter today.

579
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,840
Sir, where are you going?

580
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,730
Where am I going?

581
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,760
Let me think.

582
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,400
If the boat sinks and I spend the rest of my life here,

583
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,690
that doesn't seem so bad either.

584
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,520
Ten years ago,

585
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,820
at the Great Battle of the East Sea,

586
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,150
I couldn't win even though

587
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,470
I had the weaponry advantage and used the sinking of the boat.

588
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,070
Your valiance

589
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,880
is rare in the world.

590
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,800
I sincerely admire you.

591
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,170
It's been years now,

592
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,990
I am ill of health,

593
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,350
my sword is broken, and I will be gone.

594
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,450
It is with great regret that I can't attend

595
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,170
the promised meeting at the East Sea.

596
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,570
I'm grateful for the Styx Flower you gave me,

597
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,360
but I have failed you ultimately.

598
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,640
Years have passed

599
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,200
and things have changed.

600
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,990
When it's time to go, it goes.

601
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,070
When time comes, it comes.

602
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,880
I have passed my skills to Fang Duobing.

603
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,380
He is talented,

604
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
and no doubt

605
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,490
will surpass me one day.

606
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,690
You have no intention of chasing victory,

607
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,370
you just want to reach the peak.

608
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,260
Now that I'm gone,

609
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,870
if you are unwilling to accept this,

610
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,190
please ask Fang Duobing to stand in my place.

611
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,410
Last regards, Li Xiangyi.

612
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,500
His sword is broken and he is gone?

613
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,410
Li Lianhua.

614
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
What does he mean?

615
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,360
He was fine, why would his sword break?

616
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,260
Is Li Xiangyi really not coming?

617
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,910
He sent his last regards.

618
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,720
Li Lianhua's Bicha Poison

619
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,890
never had a cure.

620
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,140
How could this happen?

621
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,320
Then could he really be…

622
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,730
He told me

623
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,520
he had a way to cure the Bicha Poison.

624
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:52,880
But...

625
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,570
I should have known.

626
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,270
I really misunderstood him.

627
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,440
So it's true.

628
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,670
But how is that possible?

629
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,020
He survived it.

630
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,050
How could he have died?

631
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
He was fine

632
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,910
the day his sword broke.

633
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,220
The day his sword broke?

634
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,220
When did you see him?

635
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,900
A few days ago,

636
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,460
at Wangjiang Pavilion.

637
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,550
I forced him to draw his sword and fight me.

638
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,690
He then broke Shaoshi Sword

639
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,590
and jumped into the river.

640
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,380
Was he trying to–

641
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,740
He never cared about the position of sect leader at all.

642
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,420
Why didn't you trust him?

643
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,330
It's all our fault.

644
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,180
We didn't even notice.

645
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,520
We thought he was fine.

646
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,000
Miss Shi.

647
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,600
Since Li can supress

648
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,780
the poison in his body for ten years,

649
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,080
he might be able to do it for another ten years,

650
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,850
and another ten more.

651
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,420
I'll go find him now.

652
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,410
I'm afraid it's too late.

653
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,060
I've checked his pulse.

654
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,780
He only has less than a month to live.

655
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,360
He used his martial arts

656
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,520
too often for the Shan Gudao incident.

657
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,400
If he didn't take the Styx Flower in time,

658
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,880
I'm afraid by the time he wrote this letter he would have...

659
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,470
Impossible.

660
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,030
Li Lianhua is not dead.

661
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,010
No matter what you say,

662
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,980
as long as we don't find his body,

663
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,980
I won't believe that he is dead.

664
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,810
I will find him,

665
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,730
no matter what it takes.

666
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,190
Xiaobao.

667
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,580
Li Xiangyi.

668
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,570
No one can replace you

669
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,200
in our promise.
