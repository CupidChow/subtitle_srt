00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,620
This should be the entrance of a mining cave.

In the past, when the King of Hell married,

156
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,680
he only targeted unmarried women.

157
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,370
Now, he abducted my mother

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,580
Just because we bought this mansion.

159
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,230
He sure went out of his way

160
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,930
to protect the emeralds here.

161
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,360
Something's not right.

162
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,870
Think about it.

163
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,040
If he wanted to keep this mansion,

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,420
why did he

165
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,830
pretend to die in the fire?

166
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
After he died,

167
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,560
the mansion would naturally belong to someone else.

168
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,100
He won't be able to hide himself like this.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
There's no need to do this.

170
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
Was an enemy hunting him,

171
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,720
so he left in a hurry?

172
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,170
Even if he wanted to hide,

173
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,390
he wouldn't have

174
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,570
pretended to be the King of Hell looking for a bride.

175
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,500
He must have done it out of lust, then.

176
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,240
I don't think Lian Quan is that kind of person.

177
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't think too much now.

178
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,320
Let's go search somewhere else.

179
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,160
Why is the body on the ground missing its lower half?

180
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,410
Where did his legs go?

181
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,940
Maybe he never had legs.

182
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,100
Look.

183
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,040
The bone frame on the wall is complete.

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,700
But this one on the ground

185
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,120
was cut off from its waist.

186
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,770
Could they be Niutou Mamian?

187
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,360
Look.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,600
The ribs are black in colour.

189
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,420
It does look like the work of Bizhong Strike.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,280
They must have suffered

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,360
a lot when they were alive.

192
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,410
Did the Lord of the Netherworld

193
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,060
fall out with Niutou Mamian,

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,090
so he tricked them here to kill them

195
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,060
and cruelly separate their bodies?

196
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,810
The Lord of the Netherworld

197
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,370
is really vicious.

198
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,020
It's strange.

199
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,530
What is?

200
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,410
I think

201
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,560
something is wrong with this body.

202
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,160
If he left Niutou Mamian here to rot,

203
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,440
then who is cooperating with Lian Quan outside?

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,580

205
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,980

206
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,620
Oh no.

207
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,830
I think there's poison here.

208
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,100
Let's get out of here.

209
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,850
This is not emerald.

210
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,620
It's a kind of ore that commonly grows alongside emeralds,

211
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,580
called emerald jade.

212
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,200
The two ores you found

213
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,700
look almost identical.

214
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,940
But they have very different effects.

215
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,550
The emerald jade is not only worthless,

216
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,130
it's also highly poisonous.

217
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,480
If people stay near the mine long enough,

218
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,260
they may start to cough up blood from the lungs.

219
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,480
This ore will also explode when ignited.

220
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,150
However,

221
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,540
emeralds love to form alongside these jades.

222
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
It's inevitable that accidents happen when mining.

223
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,990
Later, people thought of

224
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,270
marking the emerald jades when they stumbled upon them.

225
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,660
This way, if the locals see it,

226
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,100
they will avoid it.

227
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,520
It's really hard to tell them apart.

228
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,910
It's hard for ordinary people to tell.

229
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,970
If it weren't for people like us

230
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,970
who have been miners for decades,

231
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,880

232
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,980

What does it have to do with us

237
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,410
if this is emerald or emerald jade?

238
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,140
I understand now.

239
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,760
What do you understand?

240
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,710
I know why Lian Quan

241
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,400
had to put up the whole

242
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,690

243
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,580
Actually, when Lian Quan first arrived here,

244
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,900
he couldn't tell the two ores apart.

245
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,670
If he practiced his martial arts

246
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,890
on emerald jades instead of emeralds,

247
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,610
what do you think will happen?

248
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,510
By right, the Bizhong Strike

249
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,800
needs to use the emerald

250
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,990
to detoxify.

251
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,300
Doing this will only make the poison seep deeper,

252
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,070
possibly into his bone marrows.

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
I heard that there's a cruel technique

254
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,110
called Yunuqiao.

255
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,900
It can use one's inner power to transfer

256
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,310
the poison to a girl's body without hurting one's inner breath.

257
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,620
Out of greed, Lian Quan

258
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,240
continued to maintain his power

259
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
by using emerald jades.

260
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
At the same time, he consistently

261
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,940

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,500
in and out of Baishui Garden?

378
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
There were plenty of them.

379
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
We hired many craftsmen

380
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,930
for the renovation of the old garden.

381
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,480
Was there any craftsman near the dry well?

382
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,030
It's a remote place.

383
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,060
Few people went there.

384
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,180
What is this?

385
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,710
Didn't Madam have diarrhea before?

386
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,770
The physician prescribed some medicine.

387
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,430
This is the residue.

388
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,190
This was for diarrhea, right?

389
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,730
Then why does it have xijiang grass, which is used to cure poisoning?

390
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,040
It's hard for ordinary people to tell.

391
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,080
If it weren't for people like us

392
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,140
who have been miners for decades,

393
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,940
who can tell the difference?

394
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,870
Where was the physician mixing the herbs?

395
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,550
In the side hall near the dry well.

396
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,460
It's him.

397
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,650
What do you mean?

398
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,740
Not many people know about the emerald jade's poison.

399
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,060
But he prescribed the antidote right away.

400
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,780
It seems that he must know about

401
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,540
the situation of the mine.

402
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,700
He marked this place

403
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,190
by tossing the white river pebble into the well

404
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,380
when he was mixing the herbs.

405
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,370
Li,

406
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,630
light the signal smoke.

407
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
[Physician Xue]

408
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,310
It's you.

409
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,730
The physician who treated me.

410
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,050
It's too late.

411
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,260
What are you doing?

412
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,390
Listen.

413
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,420
If you dare lay a finger on me,

414
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,770
my son will never forgive you.

415
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,570
Li Lianhua!

416
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,330
Looks like I arrived just in time.

417
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,980
Be careful.

418
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,890
There's poison on his palms.

419
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,050
The murderer pretends to be a physician.

420
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,750
You sure know how to hide.

421
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,860
Why are you here?

422
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
Let's talk about it later.

423
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,020
Fang Xiaobao.

424
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,030
What took you so long?

425
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,570
Mother!

426
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,170
Catch that bastard!

427
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,900
Few people know about the emerald jade's poison.

428
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,050
But you prescribed the antidote right away.

429
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,040
This white river pebble

430
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,010
was also a mark you threw into the dry well, right?

431
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
The Bizhong Strike might be powerful,

432
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,990
but the toxin in his body is limited.

433
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,060
I'll attack the shaoyang channel,

434
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,880
and you attack the queyin channel.

435
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,860
This way, he can't channel the poison.

436
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,300
How dare you abduct my mother?

437
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,170
You're asking for death.

438
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,690
Be careful, Xiaobao.

439
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,100
Don't move.

440
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,300
You're here too.

441
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,730
After receiving your news,

442
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,270
we set up a trap here

443
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,980
and caught him.

444
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,290
Did you see Li Lianhua?

445
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,670
Didn't the two of you lock him in the post?

446
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,140
He is cunning.

447
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,410
He picked the lock and escaped.

448
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,990
Look out for him.

449
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll bring him to justice.

450
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,830
We're taking this suspect away for interrogation.

451
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,190
Come to the post to find us later.

452
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,730
Okay.

453
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,600
Xiaobao.

454
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,220
Where did Li Lianhua go?

455
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,660
This guy is up to no good.

456
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,320
He'd be caught if he stayed here.

457
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,850
Your mother almost got poisoned just now.

458
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,570
Li Lianhua saved me.

459
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,870
How could you say that

460
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,550
my savior is up to no good?

461
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,940
How heartless.

462
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,760
By the way, Mother.

463
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,410
Are you okay?

464
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,220
Are you hurt?

465
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,620
Of course not.

466
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,570
That darn physician

467
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,710
caught me off guard, is all.

468
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,360
But he's no better.

469
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,440
He was struck by my Bone-breaking Pearl.

470
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,020
He'll be suffering for a while.

471
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

472
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,450
I was so worried about you.

473
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,160
Alright.

474
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,060
I'll take you home.

475
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,280
Invite Li Lianhua over next time.

476
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,620
I need to thank him properly.

477
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,140
Alright.

478
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,980
Got it.

479
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,600
Water.

480
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Water. Give me water.

481
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,220
Water.

482
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,120
Give me water.

483
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,590
Water! Water!

484
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,580
There are too many toxins in his body.

485
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,220
He didn't get to detoxify using Yunuqiao.

486
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,510
So he desperately needs water to dilute the poison.

487
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,330
Take it.

488
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,750
The thing you want is in my boot.

489
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,360
Give me water!

490
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,300
Water! Water!

491
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,700
Water.

492
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,030
Water.

493
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,980
Give me water.

494
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,140
Water!

495
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,960
Water!

496
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,980
Lian Quan.

497
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,100
This must be the Rama Heavenly Ice.

498
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,850
I can't believe that, apart from the Jinyuan Alliance,

499
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,700
even Baichuan Court knows about the Rama Heavenly Ice now.

500
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,910
Not only that,

501
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,660
but we also know about the searing karmic fire.

502
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,950
So you'd better tell us

503
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,750
about the Nanyin people's plan back then.

504
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,570
Otherwise, in a few hours,

505
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,200
you won't get another pail of water to detoxify with.

506
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,360
I'll tell you.

507
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,540
Look at me now.

508
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,380
There's nothing I can't tell you.

509
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,900
Back then, my ancestors and the other three individuals

510
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,510
came to the Central Plains with the Rama Heavenly Ices.

511
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
We planned to open the Rama Vessel one day

512
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,600
and use it to control the millions of Midlanders.

513
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,340
But the four guarding the Rama Heavenly Ices

514
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,190
eventually led a wealthy life

515
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,310
and didn't want to partake

516
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,090
in such a dangerous venture anymore.

517
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,230
I didn't expect that after all these years,

518
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,980
I escaped the Jinyuan Alliance,

519
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,410
but couldn't escape Baichuan Court.

520
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,750
Many years ago,

521
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,650
I met the Lord of the Netherworld

522
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,880
once.

523
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,870
Why do you look so different from him?

524
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,910
I accidentally used the emerald jade to practice

525
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,400
and was badly poisoned.

526
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,880
My appearance had long changed.

527
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,090
If I hadn't used the Sanskrit technique to change my skin,

528
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,860
I wouldn't even appear human.

529
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,710
A Sanskrit technique for changing your skin?

530
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,220
It's a secret technique.

531
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,270
Only a few enlightened monks

532
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,650
can acquire the method from the Sanskrit scripts.

533
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,170
It can transform a person anew

534
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,680
and completely change one's appearance.

535
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,900
Completely change one's appearance?

536
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,780
All right, I've told you everything I know.

537
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,870
You also got the Rama Heavenly Ice.

538
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,310
Please let me go.

539
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,410
Let you go?

540
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,840
Have you ever let those girls

541
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,140
who were murdered by you go?

542
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,110
I'll make you pay

543
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,350
for all your crimes.

544
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,340
This is an important matter.

545
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,330
I'm going to ask the All-Knowing Mr. Su

546
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,380
to verify whether the Ice is real or not.

547
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,120
I'll leave you to escort Lian Quan.

548
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,560
Let’s split up.

549
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,970
Since the Rama Heavenly Ice is so important,

550
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,760
I can’t let you go off on your own with it.

551
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,760
I should go with you.

552
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,870
You still don't trust me,

553
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,260
right?

554
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,460
It's only right that I don't trust you.

555
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,470
If we go together,

556
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,960
what will happen to Lian Quan?

557
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,410
Should we leave him at the post?

558
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,860
Fang Duobing is here.

559
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,690
It's safer to lock Lian Quan

560
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,120
in the Baishui Garden bought by the Fang family

561
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,790
than in the post.

562

I'll be back in three days.

569

I'll leave Lian Quan with you in the meanwhile.

570
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Alright, I'll interrogate him then.

Is he hiding something?

573
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,820
I think he is.

You're so skilled.

577
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,950
You can knead the dough in one hand and cut the dough in the other.

578
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,790
My mother said

579
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,280
if the neighbors saw it,

580
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,330
they would think that the dough wasn't kneaded enough.

581
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,140
But I'm strong.

582
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,910

587
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,510
He struck with both palms.

588

But the one who snuck into Baishui Garden

589
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,680
had the habit of using one palm.

590

Stop pretending.

612

When I chased you that day,

613

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,200
Did the poison enter your brain

615
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,310
and made you forget?

616
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,580
That was just a thief I hired.

617
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,290
Every time I abduct someone,

618
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,110
I hire a thief from the underworld to act as a decoy

619
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,850
so I can strike easily.

620
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,330
I pay them when the deed is done

621
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,630
and we never associate with each other again.

622
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,730
Never associate with each other again?

623
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,030
That can't be right.

624
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,950
I remember my mother's Bone-breaking Pearl

625
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,460
landed a solid hit on the intruder.

626
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,650
The Bone-breaking Pearl strikes deep into the bones.

627
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,210
But just now,

628
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,160
I saw no trace of such injury on you.

629
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,890
The only explanation is,

630
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,510
you were not the one struck by the Bone-breaking Pearl.

631
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,980
It's possible that you hired a thief

632
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,610
to abduct someone for you.

633
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,340
But to bear the Bone-breaking Pearl for you,

634
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,510
that's not worth the price.

635
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,120
Tell me.

636
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,280
Where is your accomplice?

637
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,690

639

It can change its target seven times in two hours.

Sometimes, it'll make you cry out of pain.

646

Other times, it'll make you laugh till you're breathless.

647

Be sensible.

667
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,940
The Bone-breaking Pearl must have hurt a lot.

668

Oh, wait.

669
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,750
I shouldn't call you Master.

Should I call you Niutou,

or Mamian?

672
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,170
Didn't you see

674
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,620
You're right.

675

Yes.

676
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,690
When I first saw

677
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,610
the two bodies in the mine.

678
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,020
I did suspect that they were Niutou Mamian.

679
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,480
But out of the two corpses,

680
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,310
one was heavier than the other.

681

a much wider pelvis bone.

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,270
It belonged to a woman.

684
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,110
So the people who died in the mine

685
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,620
were not Niutou Mamian,

Smart people are indeed hard to deal with.

689

and mastered the Bizhong Strike. But you feared being hunted by his enemies,

693
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,910
so you disguised Lian Quan and his wife's bodies

and killed him and that woman.

747
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,540
Then, I disguised the bodies

748
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,130
to look like us.

749
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,790
This way, even if the Jinyuan Alliance finds out,

750
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,630
they won't suspect us.

751
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,460
Everything was perfect.

752
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,420
But while we avoided the Jinyuan Alliance,

753
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,310
we couldn't avoid you guys.

754
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,660
My brother, Lee Xiong,

755
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,080
has been captured, right?

756
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,320
He's in the hands of the Baichuan Court.

757
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,830
Fortunately, I'm not that unlucky.

758
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,320
God gave me

759
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,580
a chance to survive.

760
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,490
Your identity has been exposed.

761
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,270
You still want to survive?

762
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
With Li Xiangyi, the leader of the Sigu Sect here,

763
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,920
of course I can.

764
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,110
That day, you used Whirling Steps when you were chasing me.

765
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,230
Sect Leader Li,

766
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,820
you can't fool me.

767
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,520
If it were Lee Xiangyi,

768
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,400
do you think you could have escaped?

769
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,260
Sect Leader Li,

770
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,910
you came all the way to Xiaoyan City.

771
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,980
Surely, your goal is the Rama Heavenly Ice,

772
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,460
just like the Jinyuan Alliance.

773
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,130
Promise me one condition,

774
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,240
and I'll happily give you the Rama Heavenly Ice.

775
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,830
The Baichuan Court has already acquired it

776
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,740
from your brother.

777
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,430
That one is naturally a fake.

778
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,840
We have no one to depend on.

779
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,900
The Rama Heavenly Ice is our lifesaver.

780
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,440
I have to keep it until the end.

781
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,070
But now I have you, Li Xiangyi.

782
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,770
I can give the Ice away.

783
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,860
Sect Leader Li.

784
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,020
Promise me,

785
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,340
and the Rama Heavenly Ice is yours.

786
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,500
Otherwise, I'll hand it over to the Jinyuan Alliance.

787
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,980
Although they are not as trustworthy as you,

788
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,180
they're still capable of keeping us alive.

789
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,020
Tell me.

790
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
What do you want me to do?

791
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,830
Save my brother Li Xiong

792
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,690
and cure his Bizhong Strike poison.

793
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,120
I know.

794
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,430
The Yangzhouman is the best inner power in the world.

795
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,660
Only you can cure him.

796
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:31,940
Li Xiao.

797
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,770
You're too optimistic.

798
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,780
I'm no longer a member of the Baichuan Court.

799
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,290
I'm wanted on the Blade List.

800
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,430
I can't save your brother.

801
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,540
That's your problem now.

802
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,550
It has nothing to do with me.

803
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,390
I know you're close to Fang Duobing,

804
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,780
the detective of Baichuan Court.

805
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
You might be able to use him for this.

806
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:53,860
Finally,

807
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,060
Sect Leader Li, let me remind you.

808
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,700
You only have two days.

809
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,790
Once the time is up,

810
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,180
I'll ask the Jinyuan Alliance for help.

811
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,640
You better hurry up.

812
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,550
Looks like I'll have to offend Fang Xiaobao again.

813
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,100
It's not a big deal to promise you.

814
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,750
But I'm worried.

815
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,030
Sect Leader Li.

816
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
What are you worried about?

817
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,710
Your brother's Ice is fake.

818
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,700
I have to check if your Ice

819
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,850
is real.

820
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,830
Li Xiangyi is a man of his word.

821
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,210
I believe you won’t take the treasure by force.

822
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,760
You don't have to threaten me with my past reputation.

823
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,970
I'm only confirming its authenticity.

824
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,750
I won't snatch it from you.

825
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:54,850
Deal.

826
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,900
Fang Xiaobao.

827
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,050
Why did you lock the prison?

828
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,220
The physician hasn't confessed yet.

829
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,710
Your mechanism poked him

830
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,210
till he was frothing in the mouth, yet he was silent.

831
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,500
It means he won't tell on his partner.

832
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,900
It's useless to force him.

833
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,270
Even the mechanism made by me, the Tianji Hall Sect Master,

834
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,130
can't get him to fess up?

835
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,110
I refuse to admit defeat.

836
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,300
Go.

837
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,480
Open the door.

838
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,760
Let me improve

839
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,870
the Lotus Acupoint Fingers.

840
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,900
No need.

841
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,250
Let's try another way.

842
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,940
He's willing to protect his partner's identity with his life.

843
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,160
It means they are very close.

844
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,310
He will definitely come to save him.

845
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,430
I've set up traps

846
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
all around Bashui Garden.

847
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,320
If he dares to come,

848
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,590
I won't let him escape.

849
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,750
What are you doing here again?

850
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,340
I thought about it.

851
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,630
Since I'm on the Blade List,

852
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,540
there's no point in hiding.

853
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,420
So,

854
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,350
you're here to turn yourself in?

855
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,620
I have no other choice.

856
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,660
Why don't we work together again?
