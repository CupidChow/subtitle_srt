[Episode 30]

4
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,420
I thought about it.

5
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,770
Since I'm already on the blade list,

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,789
there's no point in hiding.

7
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,600
So,

8
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,530
you're here to turn yourself in?

9
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,840
I don't seem to have any other option.

10
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,840
Why don't we continue to work together as a team?

11
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,650
Work together?

12
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
We agreed that we'd let each other know when we find clues.

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
Why did you go alone?

14
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,670
What were you up to?

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Cut it out.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,090
Or I'll change my mind.

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,940
Fine.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,340
This is it?

19
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,730
Why didn't you send me to prison?

20
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,170
You're so delicate, Young Master Li.

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,440
How can I mistreat you?

22
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,210
There must be something behind this weird situation.

23
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,770
You want to be sent to prison,

24
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,760
but I'd rather have you kept in this woodshed.

25
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,620
Have you figured out who the doctor's accomplice is after interrogation?

26
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,720
How about

27
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,150
let me see him?

28
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,650
Maybe I can pry some clues out of him.

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,460
No need.

30
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,210
Detectives will handle the case.

31
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,780
You're here to turn yourself in.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,380
So just be a prisoner as you should.

33
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,920
Young Master Li.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,290
Would you like some tea?

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:46,790
No, thanks.

36
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,490
I can do it myself.

37
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,010
Fang Xiaobao.

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,530
What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,740
How can you let Young Master Li stay in the woodshed?

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,280
Invite him to the superior guest room now.

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,000
Mother.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,490
He's turning himself in.

43
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,970
I only did things as he wishes.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,800
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,770
Young Master Li.

47
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,330
Ignore him.

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,970
-This way, please./N-Mother.

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,570
Don't worry.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,190
I won't do anything to him.

51
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,850
I just want to

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,250
ask him something face to face.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
Don't worry, Master He.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,520
As friends, we have to solve the problem between us.

55
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,970
You've really grown up.

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,160
You've grown out of my control.

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,130
Still, Fang Xiaobao.

58
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm telling you.

59
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,490
The martial world is dangerous.

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,540
It's not easy to make a real friend.

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,660
There's no need to make it so serious.

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,950
Ask me what you want to know.

63
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,530
I just want to ask you three questions.

64
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,170
First.

65
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,090
Why didn't you burn the smoke that day,

66
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,290
and went after Lian Quan alone instead?

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,720
Second.

68
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,830
Why did you come to turn yourself in today?

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,940
Third.

70
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,400
Why did you suddenly show yourself

71
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,240
after having endured for ten years?

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't speak.

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
I don't want to hear your explanation now.

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,090
Come find me

75
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,450
when you come to your senses

76
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,130
and would like to tell me the truth.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,060
Keep an eye on him.

78
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,390
Let me know if anything happens.

79
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,480
Yes.

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,650
Young Master.

81
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,950
Li Lianhua asked me to tell you

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,090
that he's injured.

83
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,280
What kind of injury?

84
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,780
I don't know.

85
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,990
Anyway, he said

86
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,950
he was injured accidentally,

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,010
and he can't lift his hands,

88
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,090
so he needs to be taken care of.

89
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,659
Tell that old fox

90
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,930
to stop playing tricks.

91
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,900
Yes.

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,250
Could it be internal injury?

93
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,120
What is this?

94
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,180
It was burned by a candle just now.

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,530
Is this what you meant by "being accidentally injured",

96
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,360
"can't lift my hands",

97
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,180
and "need to be taken care of"?

98
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,490
It really hurts.

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,330
You get mad so easily.

100
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,630
Fang Duobing.

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm hungry.

102
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,410
Get me some food first.

103
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,980
Didn't you say your chef is pretty good?

104
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,760
Let me see.

105
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,010
My chef doesn't cook for prisoners.

106
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,420
Then get me a quilt.

107
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,340
This room is cold at night.

108
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,010
The cold toxin inside my body may take effect anytime.

109
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,440
It's hard to bear.

110
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,170
What you have is a heart disease, right?

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
What cold toxin?

112
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,740
Sect Leader Li, your Yangzhouman is invincible.

113
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,570
Stop playing this kind of trick.

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,430
Anyone?

115
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,490
Give me a pot of warm wine.

116
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,960
Give me a pot of warm wine.

117
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,360
Young Master.

118
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,930
Where does he hurt this time?

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,810
Li Lianhua doesn't seem to be pretending this time.

120
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,000
He seems to be truly ill.

121
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,659
How are you?

122
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,840
Li.

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,860
Go get some blankets.

124
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,490
Yes.

125
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,630
Come on.

126
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,890
Careful, it's hot.

127
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,810
Drink slowly.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,450
Li Lianhua, you're awake.

129
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,770
What is it about the cold toxin inside your body?

130
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,530
Why couldn't Yangzhouman suppress it?

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,080
Slowly.

132
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,050
Yangzhouman consumes too much inner power.

133
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,470
I have the warm wine

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,400
and the quilt you sent me.

135
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,740
Come to think of it,

136
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,490
you'd be okay anyway, right?

137
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,549
Fang Duobing.

138
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,730
What trick are you trying to play this time?

139
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,490
About the three questions you asked.

140
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,630
The first one is easy to answer.

141
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,370
I'll answer that one first.

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,050
I didn't burn the smoke that day

143
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,520
because I knew how powerful Bizhong Strike is.

144
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,280
You're fast.

145
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,180
If you met Lian Quan first,

146
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,020
you'd have been taken advantage of.

147
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,280
What about the other two questions?

148
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,890
I'll let you know

149
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,860
the answers to them later.

150
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,400
Let me tell you a story.

151
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,170
The story of

152
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,890
a pair of fellow apprentices who only have each other.

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,900
This pair of fellow apprentices have been street beggars since their childhood.

154
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,060
They were lucky to meet Master,

155
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,250
and they started learning martial arts.

156
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,650
Time flies.

157
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,930
In the blink of an eye,

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,010
the junior turned 15.

159
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,190
He was on his first trip down the mountain with his senior

160
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,440
when he encountered the massacre of the He family of the Changma Blade Sect.

161
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,980
[He's Residence]

162
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,560
The He family took the low road to make their fortune.

163
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,760
-It's been years since they retreated from the martial world./N-Father!

164
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,310
There hadn't been many people giving them trouble.

165
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,860
Father!

166
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,290
Father!

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
-But not long ago.../N-Wake up, Father!

168
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,920
There were rumors that there was a piece of cloud iron in their household

169
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
which had spread throughout the martial world.

170
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,790
Many people coveted it.

171
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,470
When that pair of fellow apprentices arrived at He's Residence,

172
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,650
only the father and the son of the He family were still alive.

173
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,920
The father knew he was seriously injured and he couldn't make it,

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,170
so he kneeled down and begged the fellow apprentices

175
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,370
to escort the only offspring of the He family

176
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,300
to his ancestral home for refuge.

177
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,100
[Luoyang]

178
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,730
When they arrived in Luoyang,

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,830
the senior asked the junior to buy some specialties,

180
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,450
saying he'd send the offspring to the He family by himself.

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Of course the junior didn't think much about it.

182
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:35,930
But soon,

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,270
word came that the child was killed by the enemy.

184
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,340
Three years later,

185
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,440
the senior gave the junior

186
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,480
an extraordinarily sharp soft sword as a birthday gift.

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,170
It had been too long,

188
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,090
so the junior had long forgotten about the cloud iron incident.

189
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,070
So that soft sword

190
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,700
became the sword the junior carried around.

191
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,970
Are you trying to say that my father misappropriated the cloud iron?

192
00:10:59,410 --> 00:10:59,760
Are you trying to say that

193
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,770
my father is a villain who stole things and took advantage of others?

194
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,050
I don't know,

195
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,220
neither do I want to know.

196
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,300
It's up to you

197
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,650
whether you believe it or not.

198
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,750
Young Master, bad news!

199
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,220
Lian Quan is missing.

200
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,450
No need to look for him.

201
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,540
I let him go.

202
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,170
How could you...

203
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,870
Li Lianhua.

204
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,990
No need.

205
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,930
I've let Li Lianhua go as well.

206
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,290
How could you...

207
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,530
Why couldn't I?

208
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,320
Li Lianhua saved my life.

209
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,290
You're ungrateful,

210
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,510
but I'm a grateful person.

211
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,320
Alright.

212
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,290
Don't be mad.

213
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,880
Li Lianhua said

214
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,190
he has his own plan.

215
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,020
I helped him steal the key to release him,

216
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,250
and he'll figure out the truth for you in return.

217
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,400
He asked me to give this to you.

218
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,750
Jian Lingxiao's tracking bee?

219
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
The doctor isn't Lian Quan.

220
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,590
Lian Quan is dead.

221
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,200
Niutou Mamian is still alive.

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,370
He said

223
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,470
he'll give you

224
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,480
the answers to the other two questions tomorrow.

225
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,310
The poison has been detoxicated.

226
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,280
As expected from you, Li Xiangyi.

227
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,760
As expected from Yangzhouman.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,700
Good.

229
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,970
Very good.

230
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,220
Sect Leader Li, you're useless

231
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,370
after this.

232
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,490
Wait.

233
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
So you two

234
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,630
want to kick down the ladder.

235
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,350
Sect Leader Li.

236
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,730
You're a man of honor,

237
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,690
but Netherworld Estate has always believed in evil ways.

238
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,110
You don't really think

239
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,620
we'll give you the Rama Heavenly Ice obediently, do you?

240
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,820
Too much power was consumed for detoxification just now.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,040
He can't even stand straight now.

242
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,690
It's a good chance to kill him.

243
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,520
You are not eager to look for the Heavenly Ice,

244
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,800
and you want to kill me first?

245
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,990
Aren't you putting the cart before the horse?

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,490
What are you talking about?

247
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,260
If I guess it right,

248
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,290
you should have hidden the Heavenly Ice

249
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,810
under the chessboard in the monk room.

250
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,490
When I was checking the authenticity that day,

251
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,340
I accidentally added a little pollen

252
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,850
to the Heavenly Ice.

253
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,760
And I happen to have a bee that can track pollen.

254
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,850
Half a day ago,

255
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,370
the tracking bee

256
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,550
circled around your monk room.

257
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,230
That's why

258
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,890
I brought you here for detoxification.

259
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,080
The Heavenly Ice

260
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,430
must have been taken away by now.

261
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,220
Then I'll torture you to be half-dead

262
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,990
and trade you for the Heavenly Ice.

263
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,650
I'm not the half-dead one.

264
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,410
Look at your brother.

265
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,890
Brother!

266
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,810
Slowly.

267
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,340
It's Bicha Poison.

268
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,390
[Hanshui Temple]

269
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,300
One more?

270
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,810
Sit tight.

271
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,510
Go.

272
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,670
You were still locked in the woodshed

273
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,780
of Baishui Garden yesterday,

274
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,130
and now you're back in Lotus Tower?

275
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,980
You know that?

276
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,450
I was worried about you,

277
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,770
so I asked around.

278
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,850
Little girl.

279
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,440
Thank you for your concern, Miss Su.

280
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,480
You fed the dog for me,

281
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,850
yet you still had time to ask around about my well-being?

282
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,190
Not only about your well-being.

283
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,190
I also heard that

284
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,410
you owe Young Master Fang

285
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,640
answers to two questions.

286
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,440
What is it?

287
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,850
What answers?

288
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,320
So juvenile.

289
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,290
Anyway,

290
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,310
we should pack up.

291
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,330
We should lose no time in looking for the next piece of Heavenly Ice.

292
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,530
We're leaving now?

293
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,520
We haven't got rid of Niutou Mamian yet.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,330
Besides, is it okay

295
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,320
to leave it to Fang Duobing?

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,400
As for those two,

297
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,550
only one of them is able to move now.

298
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,570
Of course Fang Duobing can handle it.

299
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,770
Besides,

300
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,630
Baishui Garden is surrounded by traps.

301
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,520
Li Xiao can't get in even if he wants to.

302
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,230
Let's go.

303
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,530
What's wrong?

304
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,570
Let me help you lie down.

305
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm okay.

306
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,510
Maybe I'm tired.

307
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,520
What's that sound?

308
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,450
It's an explosion.

309
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,060
It seems to be from the west of the city.

310
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,150
From the direction of Baishui Garden.

311
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,090
How many times has it been?

312
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,250
Why did it catch on fire again?

313
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,850
Why was there another explosion?

314
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,290
Could it be because of the mine?

315
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,120
Did someone go down the mine again?

316
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,160
I don't know.

317
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,020
I knew something bad would happen because of the mine.

318
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,079
You're awake.

319
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,740
It shouldn't be that easy to get Rama Heavenly Ice, right?

320
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,560
Since you've got the Heavenly Ice,

321
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,240
why did you have to abduct me here?

322
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,410
To lure Sect Leader Li here, of course.

323
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,040
He should be here soon.

324
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,450
You are right.

325
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,840
I'm here.

326
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,710
You've gone through so much trouble

327
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,530
to lure me here.

328
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,570
Sect Leader Li, you are scheming.

329
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,730
You detoxicated Bizhong Strike for my brother,

330
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,950
but then you poisoned him

331
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,940
with the deadliest poison in the world, Bicha Poison.

332
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,290
Hand over the antidote.

333
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,690
You said yourself that Bicha Poison

334
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,210
is the deadliest poison in the world.

335
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,030
How could I have the antidote?

336
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,690
Others may not have it,

337
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,540
but I believe you do, Sect Leader Li.

338
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,670
You must have heard of who I, Li Xiangyi, am.

339
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,520
I advise you to release him as soon as possible.

340
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Otherwise,

341
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,010
you'll die a miserable death.

342
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,340
Don't move.

343
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,790
I know you have superior martial skills.

344
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,600
If it wasn't for Mr. Fang,

345
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,600
I wouldn't have dared to offend you.

346
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,750
I will detonate the ore

347
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,100
and die together with you if I have to.

348
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,340
You think you can threaten Li Xiangyi by kidnapping me?

349
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,570
Li Xiangyi is cold-hearted.

350
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,170
He's only here just for Rama Heavenly Ice,

351
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,110
not me.

352
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,610
Don't try to take this chance to snatch the Heavenly Ice.

353
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,890
Get lost!

354
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,540
Get lost!

355
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,250
I didn't expect that

356
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,190
you made a new friend during your ten years' of silence, Sect Leader Li.

357
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,690
He'd even ruin your reputation to keep you safe.

358
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,430
Li Xiangyi is just arrogant.

359
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,510
He's not cold-blooded at all.

360
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,010
Back then, Shan Gudao searched for descendants of Nanyin.

361
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,810
On the surface, it was to protect the Central Plains,

362
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,020
but it was actually to shake the martial world.

363
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,860
There have been rumors about this secret for a long time in the martial world.

364
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,790
But no one dared to tell him

365
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,400
because everyone knows

366
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,690
he would never believe it.

367
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,550
I think he's still in the dark.

368
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,600
Li Xiangyi.

369
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll ask you one last time.

370
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,010
Where is the antidote to Bicha Poison?

371
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,450

I didn't mean to poison your brother either.

I do have a way.

379
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,240
in my Wenjing sword.

380
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,390
It may be able to detoxicate the poison in your brother's body.

381
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,310
Take three steps back.

I knew it.

385
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,060
So when you were curing my brother,

386
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,680
you transported the poison into his body.

It seems that there really is no antidote to Bicha Poison.

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,850
Only you can save him now.

560
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,430
I'll do whatever you want.

561
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,840
I won't break my promise.

562
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,600
Get him in here first.

563
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,480
Yong.

564
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,010
Go prepare the Three-archeus-in-one Soup

565
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,910
so that I can give him a herbal bath.

566
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,670
Guan.

567
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,890
How is it?

568
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,530
A word, please.

569
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,940
He's dying.

570
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,420
There must be ways to save him.

571
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,530
His body is overly consumed.

572
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,240
He's injured in the origin.

573
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,330
Even if it's repaired and mended,

574
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,890
he can barely survive.

575
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,760
His Qi and blood can't last longer.

576
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,140
[Excellent Medical Skills Work Magic]

577
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,150
But when I did his check-up last time,

578
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,990
he still had four months to live.

579
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,820
In just a few days,

580
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,280
he lost half of his life

581
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,100
to ruin my reputation.

582
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,330
Has he been poisoned?

583
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,670
It's Bicha Poison.

584
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,550
Once Bicha Poison gets deep into the blood,

585
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,490
it will destroy all the internal organs. It's incurable,

586
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,540
and he'll definitely die.

587
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,290
It's just fighting poison with poison.

588
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,969
If you want to sober him up a bit more,

589
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,070
you can take a risk.

590
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,540
If he lacks inner power,

591
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,500
I suggest

592
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,590
you use it after he takes the medicine.

593
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,730
Although the tiger palm is highly poisonous,

594
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,429
it can postpone the madness.

595
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,139
Fighting poison with poison?

596
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,170
That's right.

597
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,560
He used Yangzhouman to suppress Bicha Poison.

598
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,880
He shouldn't have used his inner power again and again.

599
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,380
What happens if he uses his inner power forcibly?

600
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,179
The more he uses his inner power,

601
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,980
the deeper the poison will get in the internal organs

602
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,340
and endanger his life.

603
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,190
The day the fuel of his inner power runs out

604
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,080
is what it is now.

605
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,130
Even if I try my best to keep him alive,

606
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,820
he can only hold on for a month at most.

607
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,489
You've always wanted to get rid of me

608
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,050
because you didn't want me to know who you are.

609
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,960
So the Master in White was also you.

610
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,900
You hid it from me for so long.

611
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,260
I didn't know anything,

612
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,380
and l was still worried about your safety.

613
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,820
Fang Xiaobao.

614
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

615
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,710
I thought he pretended to have no martial skills

616
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,350
just to hide his identity.

617
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,010
He used Yangzhouman to save people more than once.

618
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,750
I didn't know it was at the cost of his life.

619
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,130
He used to teach me Yangzhouman.

620
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,520
He saved me and others with Yangzhouman.

621
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,220
Can I save him too?

622
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,440
How long have you been learning Yangzhouman?

623
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,250
Several months.

624
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,360
You can use Yangzhouman

625
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,900
to slowly guide his inner power to rotate

626
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,960
so that he doesn't have to be drowsy

627
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,950
or lie in bed every day.

628
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,540
However, without at least ten years of

629
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,850
refining Yangzhouman's intensive inner power,

630
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,210
it's impossible to detoxicate and save people

631
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
like him.

632
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,530
He only has one month to live.

633
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,250
He can't wait for you for ten years.

634
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,770
I don't believe it.

635
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,690
There is always a way out.

636
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,910
No one believed that he could come back alive,

637
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,210
but he made it.

638
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,900
We still have some time.

639
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,810
Even if I have to search all over the world,

640
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,170
I must find a way to save him.

641
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,040
Go to Yunyin Mountain and find Granny Qin.

642
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,230
Maybe she can save him.

643
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,630
Isn't that where

644
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,860
Li Xiangyi's master, Qi Mushan, finished his apprenticeship?

645
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,520
So Granny Qin is...

646
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,660
Don't you know that Qi Mushan's wife is Granny Qin?

647
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,230
She still lives in Yunju Pavilion on Yunyin Mountain.

648
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,890
But that is a hidden place.

649
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,260
You've got what I want, right?

650
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
[Chapter 17, Detailed Map of 188 Prisons]

651
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,680
After Four-faced Qingzun died,

652
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,730
the place his wife Liangyi Fairy was imprisoned

653
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,640
has changed again and again.

654
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,950
I searched for a long time

655
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,710
until I found out that

656
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,200
she's now imprisoned in the Dragon King Temple of the 188 Prisons.

657
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,730
Do you think

658
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,660
she has the fourth piece of Rama Heavenly Ice?

659
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,880
So that's where it is.

660
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
You just need to know

661
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,540
our great plan will succeed very soon.

662
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,370
Thanks to you,

663
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,900
who asked the Jinyuan Alliance to destroy so many dungeons.

664
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,020
Don't worry.

665
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,790
I will avenge

666
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,040
the punishment and humiliation Baichuan Court gave you.

667
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,650
There's something I want to know.

668
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,350
On Xiao Qiao's wedding,

669
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,620
you sneaked in Sigu Sect and poisoned Qiao Wanmian.

670
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,570
Who did you want to test?

671
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,740
Since you asked me that,

672
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,050
you must have known the answer.

673
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,620
Of course I wanted

674
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,820
to test Yangzhouman.

675
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,280
Li Xiangyi is not dead.

676
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,430
He is...

677
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,220
Li Lianhua.

678
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,450
It's really him.

679
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,190
Look at your face.

680
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,960
So what if it is him?

681
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,440
After Li Xiangyi became Li Lianhua,

682
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,740
he's lost most of his power.

683
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,020
But there's one thing you should worry about.

684
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,230
He will come to you

685
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,110
to settle the score for poisoning him with Bicha Poison.

686
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,200
So you might as well take action first and kill him secretly

687
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,260
to prevent future troubles.

688
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,410
Saintess.

689
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,880
Help me!

690
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,770
My Lord.

691
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,550
Why are you...

692
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,290
Someone delivered a letter from Zongzheng Mingzhu.

693
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,890
This pair of loving jade butterflies came with it.

694
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,230
Don't you know

695
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,380
my feelings for you, My Lord?

696
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,410
If I betray you, I will die a horrible death.

697
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,010
It's his wishful thinking.

698
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,740
His wishful thinking?

699
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,480
It is said that you have been in contact with him for years.

700
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,420
If it’s not for him,

701
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,770
are you trying to collude with the Wansheng Clan behind?

702
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,320
My Lord, what are you talking about?

703
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,580
My Lord.

704
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,290
When you were recuperating in seclusion,

705
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,660
I investigated the War of the East Sea.

706
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,270
Only then did I know that Wansheng Clan may have added fuel to the fire.

707
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,050
I wanted to find out the truth,

708
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,810
so I approached him deliberately and pretended to cooperate.

709
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,780
Really?

710
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,630
So what did you find?

711
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,110
Have you seen

712
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,890
the real master of Wansheng Clan?

713
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,750
So Lord hasn't recalled those things.

714
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,120
My Lord.

715
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,040
That man is very secretive.

716
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,660
I only contacted with Feng Qing.

717
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,290
I don't know anything else.

718
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,080
But give me some time.

719
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,030
I'll definitely find the person behind it

720
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,210
and present him to you.

721
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,830
You should at least know

722
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,700
why they want the Rama Vessel.

723
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,030
It belongs to Nanyin.

724
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,950
You are a descendant of Nanyin's royal family.

725
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:55,900
Jiao Liqiao.

726
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,340
What else are you hiding from me?

727
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,870
My Lord.

728
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,890
I'm not hiding anything from you.

729
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,040
I'll tell you everything

730
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:06,930
about the Rama Vessel.

731
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,340
The Rama Vessel contains the larvae of Nanyin's Karmic Bugs.

732
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,760
The mother bugs can be found through the larvae,

733
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,800
and they'll give birth to more Karmic Bugs.

734
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,190
So Wansheng Clan wants to manipulate

735
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,500
those who've been poisoned by Karmic Bugs

736
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,740
and make them follow whatever order they give.

737
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,040
How do they manipulate them?

738
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,580
I have been away from my hometown for too long.

739
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,890
How can I know the method?

740
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,020
Only professional bug-control sorcerers know it.

741
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,590
What's in it for you then?

742
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,550
You can see

743
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,490
how loyal I am to you, My Lord.

744
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,380
I want nothing

745
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,480
but to help you achieve great cause

746
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,220
by the power of those people.

747
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,820
In that case,

748
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,460
give it to me.

749
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:48,930
What?

750
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,820
The Heavenly Ice that opens the Rama Vessel.

751
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,280
You are so impatient, My Lord.

752
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,900
I only have one piece.

753
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,120
Besides, I've been pretending to collude with Zongzheng Minghzu

754
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,460
for so long.

755
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,290
It's because I want to use him

756
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,550
to collect all the pieces of Heavenly Ice

757
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,580
and open the Rama Vessel

758
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,040
for you to ride around, My Lord.

759
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,760
By then,

760
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,470
everything will be under your Jinyuan Alliance's control, My Lord.

761
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,110
Wouldn't that be great?

762
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,680
Give it to me.

763
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,190
My Lord.

764
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,640
Give it to me.

765
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,690
Do as usual.

766
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,040
Tell your Zongzheng Mingzhu to find

767
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,710
Rama Vessel and the rest of Heavenly Ice as soon as possible.

768
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,370
Mother! Mother!

769
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,080
Run!

770
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,280
Run...

771
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,390
Are you okay?

772
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,140
I'm okay.

773
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,850
This is my place.

774
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,810
I'll beat you again next time.

775
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,210
Go.

776
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,660
Get out.

777
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,410
Leave now.

778
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:05,810
[Yunyin Mountain]

779
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,110
Granny Qin!

780
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,990
Setting up the mist formation to block me again.

781
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,940
I just went down the mountain for a drink.

782
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,150
Do you have to be so angry?
