[Episode 35]

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,230
I didn't expect the karmic mother bugs we've been searching

5
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,420
for such a long time are in the Royal Palace.

6
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,579
It saves me some trouble.

7
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,920
Father.

8
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,600
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

9
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,280
The pattern on the tattooed cyan human skin

10
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,130
is completely different from the map of the Royal Palace.

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,700
In the early stage of the Great Xi Dynasty,

12
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,500
the palace of the previous dynasty was still used.

13
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,520
So it has been expanded and renovated many times over the past century.

14
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,140
The current palace

15
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,490
is indeed very different from what it was a hundred years ago.

16
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,280
So this human skin means

17
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,090
the mother bugs are in the Royal Palace.

18
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,810
If so,

19
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,400
Shan Gudao's target must be the Royal Palace, too.

20
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,860
I have the royal blood

21
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,450
of Nanyin's and the present dynasty's imperial family.

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,550
What I want is

23
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,150
something that's supposed to be mine in the first place.

24
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,510
Could his searching for karmic bugs

25
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,420
be with the aim of killing His Majesty?

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,510
Lord Fang.

27
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,320
Could you please report to His Majesty

28
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,360
and ask Imperial City Division to make sure the palace is heavily guarded?

29
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,330
This...

30
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,880
Mr. Li.

31
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,329
Without solid evidence,

32
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,310
His Majesty won't believe it.

33
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,050
His Majesty will even be mad

34
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,740
and consider it as a rumor instead.

35
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,260
Something like this happened many years ago.

36
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,950
It caused a great fuss in the whole country.

37
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,680
But it turned out to be nothing after investigation.

38
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,060
But this is a big deal.

39
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,350
Is there no other way?

40
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,420
I know someone from the Imperial City Division.

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,260
I can only write a letter to the Imperial City Division in private,

42
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,650
and ask them to keep an eye on it secretly.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,750
Lord Fang.

44
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,690
Is there a way you can send me into the palace?

45
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,100
I must find the karmic mother bugs

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,290
before Shan Gudao does

47
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,329
and stop him.

48
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,470
Young Master.

49
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,310
Has the spy found out

50
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
what I asked him to investigate the other day?

51
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,540
The spy is back.

52
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,540
The Styx Flower can indeed help people rebuild their body

53
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,430
and have all poisons detoxicated.

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,790
In that case,

55
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,450
Li Lianhua can be saved.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,700
According to the spy,

57
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,000
there are two kinds of leaves on one Styx Flower, Yin and Yang.

58
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,700
The Yin leaf can repair the meridians,

59
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,130
which can fill the body with Genuine Qi instantly,

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,750
but the person will die due to organ explosion very soon.

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,760
Only if the person eats Yin and Yang leaves together can he be saved.

62
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,740
Eating Yin and Yang leaves together?

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,850
Besides,

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
the Jinyuan Alliance has also been looking for the whereabouts of the Styx Flower.

65
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,540
Because the Yang leaf of the Styx Flower is extremely masculine and strong,

66
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,580
which exactly matches

67
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,420
the Windy Poplar Di Feisheng has been practicing.

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,070
Di Feisheng wants to use the Yang leaf

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,820
to break through the highest level of Windy Poplar.

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,190
Di Feisheng...

71
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,900
So have you found the whereabouts of the Styx Flower?

72
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,210
Mr. Li.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,730
Xiaobao asked us to make sure

74
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,820
you stay in Tianji Mountain Manor

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,530
and wait for him to find the medicine for you.

76
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,700
He also asked us to tell you that

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,320
there's nothing in this world that can't be done without you.

78
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,900
So you must keep yourself alive.

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,970
Do you know

80
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
where he went?

81
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,180
He only said

82
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,580
he went to find the medicine for you.

83
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,730
We don't know

84
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,970
where he went exactly.

85
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,180
Mr. Li.

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Fang Xiaobao knows what he's doing.

87
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,540
Just stay here and wait for him to come back.

88
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,190
I appreciate your kindness.

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,860
But this is an emergency.

90
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,470
I need to go to the capital immediately.

91
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,820
I'm afraid

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,680
Fang Xiaobao will blame you.

93
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,070
I'll explain to him

94
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,980
later.

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,960
Mr. Li.

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,420
I know

97
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,900
people like you

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,580
have their own persistence and choices.

99
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,900
Even if Tianji Mountain Manor forces you

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,140
to stay today,

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,900
the matter in your heart is unsolved,

102
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,820
and the burden is still on your shoulders.

103
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,420
You will blame yourself downheartedly

104
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,340
and regret in the future.

105
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,159
I, He Xiaohui, hate to see heroes regret what they fail to achieve.

106
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,430
So, I won't stop you.

107
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,400
Thank you.

108
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,640
Lord Fang.

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,640
How is the thing I requested before going?

110
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,290
Alright.

111
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,350
I'll send a letter to my subordinates in the capital.

112
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,510
There will be someone making arrangements for you

113
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,900
when you arrive in the capital.

114
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,920
Thank you, My Lord.

115
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,570
I have official duties I need to fulfill.

116
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,530
I can't go to the capital for now

117
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,820
without the imperial order.

118
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,970
Mr. Li.

119
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,310
Be careful.

120
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,580
Mr. Li.

121
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,470
Don't worry.

122
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,220
Tianji Mountain Manor will never

123
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,470
reveal your identity.

124
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,620
Goodbye.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,510
Li.

126
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,940
I'll see you off.

127
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,860
No need.

128
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,610
See you.

129
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,940
Cheer up.

130
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,030
No mistake is allowed in the Sword Room.

131
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,020
Yes.

132
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,929
Stop fighting.

133
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,740
You've made it in here.

134
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,450
It means you are quite capable.

135
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,910
You are indeed my son.

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,670
It may be easy to get in the Wansheng Clan,

137
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,790
but it'll be extra difficult

138
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,580
if you want to get out.

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,410
Don't stand there.

140
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,530
Sit down and have a drink with me.

141
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,210
So you want the Styx Flower

142
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,390
to save Li Xiangyi?

143
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,350
You used to be close fellow apprentices.

144
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,340
You used to practice martial arts

145
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,810
and travel the martial world together.

146
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,980
How could you put him in the ground

147
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,460
for your own ambition?

148
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,400
Ambition?

149
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,720
Everything should be mine in the first place.

150
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,220
But you

151
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,840
called it ambition.

152
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,740
Back then,

153
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,510
Li Xiangyi always wanted to oppress me.

154
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,680
And now,

155
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,310
even my own son

156
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,300
takes his side.

157
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,730
Just for these illusory things,

158
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,530
you'd rather drive your fellows of Sigu Sect up the wall,

159
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,150
kill your own master,

160
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,380
instigate dissension and disrupt this peaceful and prosperous world?

161
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,270
What does this peaceful and prosperous world have to do with me?

162
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,520
What I want

163
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,820
is a peaceful and prosperous world that belongs to me, Shan Gudao.

164
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,170
And you. You are my own son.

165
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,840
You have my blood.

166
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,100
I hope you can join me

167
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,660
in this ambitious cause.

168
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,330
Everything that I have in the future

169
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,980
will be yours.

170
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,650
I don't agree with what you do.

171
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,240
And I won't stand by your side.

172
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,910
But you

173
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,380
are always my biological father.

174
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,820
I owe you my life.

175
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,490
This toast

176
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,980
is to you.

177
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,440
After I kowtow to you today,

178
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,020
your kindness will be repaid.

179
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,370
From now on,

180
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,510
we'll owe each other nothing.

181
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,630
Good.

182
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,480
Since you are so heartless,

183
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,520
don't blame me.

184
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,340
There won't be anything I can't bear to do.

185
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,360
Master.

186
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,570
You learned the Qianjun Guiyuan Formation

187
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,590
from Qi Mushan, and you perfected it.

188
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,180
No one has made it out alive.

189
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,520
This is his own choice.

190
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,910
He's my only family in the world.

191
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,880
I've always been thinking of this.

192
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,100
But what about him?

193
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,910
Not only does he side with outsiders,

194
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,990
but he also goes against me all along.

195
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,410
If he can't make it out of this formation,

196
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,040
it's fate.

197
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,670
I'm not the one to blame.

198
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,680
What is this place?

199
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,270
Since this formation has such a clever design,

200
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,980
it must be controlled by a mechanism.

201
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,030
I must find the core of the mechanism as soon as possible

202
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,920
and defeat the hallucination.

203
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,100
That's right.

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,560
It's hallucination.

205
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
Bravo!

206
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:46,470
[Nanshan Hall]

207
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,430
I heard that they hired

208
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,520
a famous miracle-working physician.

209
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,230
He can cure any disease.

210
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,380
You bet.

211
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,870
I have a distant brother

212
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,040
working as a cook in Tiejia Sect.

213
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,410
Their young master died,

214
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,220
and this miracle-working physician resurrected him.

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,940
He's this good?

216
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,690
Yes.

217
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,360
Look at the waiting line.

218
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,450
He must be good.

219
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,660
Diagnose through a thread.

220
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,150
Miracle-working physician.

221
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,370
He's really amazing.

222
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,210
Physician Li.

223
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,100
Minister Fang has ordered me to spread the word

224
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,300
to promote your medical skills in the capital, Physician Li.

225
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,920
You've really impressed the whole capital these days.

226
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,330
I believe there will be news from the imperial palace soon.

227
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,640
Lord Fang is really modest about his capabilities.

228
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,110
Here comes the imperial edict!

229
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,710
[Eunuch Wang]

230
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,000
Physician Li.

231
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,990
We're approaching the inner palace.

232
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,980
We're not far from the Noble Lady's palace.

233
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,340
When we arrive,

234
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,930
you'll join the consultation for the Noble Lady with the other doctors.

235
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,900
Eunuch Wang.

236
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,580
May I ask which Noble Lady I'll be treating?

237
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,340
Physician Li, just come with me.

238
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,510
[Zhaohua Palace]

239
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,140
Everyone.

240
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,350
This is

241
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,480
Physician Li, who has been famous in the capital recently.

242
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,410
Nice to meet you.

243
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,090
Nice to meet you.

244
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,330
Please wait a little longer.

245
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,170
When the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei arrives,

246
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,130
you can go in together for consultation.

247
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,570
Eunuch Wang,

248
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,050
may I ask who the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei is,

249
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,240
and why we are waiting for him?

250
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,840
The Imperial Preceptor of Xibei is highly skilled in occult practices.

251
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,920
He's highly respected by the Empress Dowager.

252
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,820
He finally made a visit to Great Xi.

253
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,480
Of course, he's our guest.

254
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,250
It's our honor to have a consultation with the Imperial Preceptor

255
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
for the Noble Lady's treatment.

256
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,570
I see.

257
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,310
The Imperial Preceptor of Xibei is here!

258
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
It's Demon Monk.

259
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,339
Shan Gudao is eager to find the karmic mother bugs.

260
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,579
It seems that the mother bugs are indeed inside the Royal Palace.

261
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,910
Demon Monk

262
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,369
has managed to get Empress Dowager's approval.

263
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,170
I must take care of him first.

264
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,180
Imperial Preceptor.

265
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,770
We've been waiting for you for a while.

266
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,200
Since you are here,

267
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,920
the consultation starts now.

268
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,740
Hold on.

269
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,550
Can anyone, even a rat, enter

270
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,050
Great Xi's Royal Palace

271
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,820
at will?

272
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,450
Imperial Preceptor, there may be some misunderstanding.

273
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,460
Physician Li is a famous miracle-working physician in the capital.

274
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,470
The Empress Dowager issued an order to invite him here.

275
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,850
His name is Li Lianhua.

276
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,860
He's been conning people in the name of miracle-working physician

277
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,220
for a long time.

278
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,200
You want me to have the consultation with him today.

279
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,230
Are you looking down on me

280
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,530
or the State of Xibei?

281
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,330
Why does the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei from so far away

282
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,880
care so much about a wandering physician?

283
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,690
Eunuch Wang.

284
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,380
Have you checked his pass?

285
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,300
Can you check it carefully?

286
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,360
Both of you

287
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,280
are distinguished guests invited by Empress Dowager.

288
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,320
If there's any grudge from the past,

289
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,190
could you please put it on hold for the moment,

290
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
for the sake of Empress Dowager?

291
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,530
Treating the Noble Lady is more important.

292
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,930
There's no way I'll have the consultation

293
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,510
with a rat like him.

294
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,180
If he stays,

295
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,630
I shall take my leave.

296
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,650
Take care.

297
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,500
Imperial Preceptor.

298
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,740
Please don’t make things difficult for me.

299
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,420
Since only one of us can stay,

300
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,770
why don't we

301
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,190
make a bet to see

302
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,200
who's going to be the one to stay?

303
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,070
What do you think?

304
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,360
What do you want to bet on?

305
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,310
Imperial Preceptor, you're also here to treat the Noble Lady.

306
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,110
Why don't we bet on

307
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,130
who can cure the Noble Lady's illness?

308
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,440
Make the bet as you wish.

309
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,610
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

310
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,930
But if you lose,

311
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,930
you'll have committed another felony,

312
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,730
which is disrespecting foreign envoys.

313
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,090
Eunuch Wang.

314
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,890
Take me to see the Noble Lady.

315
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,680
Yes.

316
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,670
But...

317
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,590
Get out! I don't want to see anyone.

318
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,880
Imperial Preceptor.

319
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,010
Please be patient, Imperial Preceptor.

320
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,770
What the Noble Lady has is a strange illness.

321
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,550
She has rashes all over her body and has a bad temper.

322
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,430
[Zhaohua Palace]

323
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,550
She refuses to see a doctor.

324
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,770
Anyone who entered the palace wanting to treat her

325
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,220
was kicked out.

326
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,790
It's okay.

327
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,750
I'll hit her acupoints first and then treat her.

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,760
No, you can't do that.

329
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,130
The Noble Lady is distinguished and delicate.

330
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,530
You can't offend her.

331
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,630
How can I treat her if she refuses to see the doctor?

332
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,020
Are you fooling me?

333
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,950
Eunuch Wang.

334
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
How about I give it a try?

335
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,300
Mr. Li.

336
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,900
I learned the medical philosophy of Confucianism.

337
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,680
It's like how the maple leaves on Fragrant Mountain turn red in autumn.

338
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,630
I'm very well-mannered.

339
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,380
You won't make it difficult for me, Your Ladyship, right?

340
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,800
Come in.

341
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,360
Li Lianhua.

342
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,520
It's really you.

343
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,570
Why are you here?

344
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,010
Your Highness, long time no see.

345
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,350
I'm here to treat you.

346
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Grandmother tells everyone that a Noble Lady is sick.

347
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,130
How do you know it's me?

348
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,670
I couldn't tell and didn't know it before.

349
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,800
However,

350
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,770
I saw the character "Zhao" outside the palace,

351
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,080
so I figured it out.

352
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,690
Your Highness, why do you pretend to be sick?

353
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,850
It's all because of Fang Duobing.

354
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,760
So the reason why you pretend to be sick

355
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,750
and refuse to see the doctor

356
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,390
is to ask for Empress Dowager's permission

357
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,000
to go out and find Fang Xiaobao, right?

358
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,830
You're still so smart.

359
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,700
You got it right at first attempt.

360
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,720
Unfortunately, Grandmother wouldn't allow me.

361
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,540
Instead, she invited a lot of famous physicians here.

362
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,120
Another one came once I beat one away.

363
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,200
I'm about to give up.

364
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,430
Luckily, you're here, Li Lianhua.

365
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,770
Go and tell them

366
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,420
that I need to go out of the palace for treatment.

367
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,860
Let’s go find Fang Duobing immediately.

368
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,580
Your Highness, there's no rush.

369
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,970
I came to the palace this time

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,030
for something important,

371
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,440
so I can't leave for the time being.

372
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,510
For case investigation?

373
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,840
Smart.

374
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,420
Recently,

375
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,670
some bandits have managed to sneak

376
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,600
into the palace.

377
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,880
I must catch them.

378
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
She's cured. Come in.

379
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,470
Your Highness.

380
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,000
Eunuch Wang.

381
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,740
Physician Li has cured my illness.

382
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,370
I have a good appetite.

383
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,440
Tell the kitchen to cook more food.

384
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,170
As long as you're healthy, Your Highness.

385
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,550
I'll go get ready.

386
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,710
And I'll report it to Her Majesty.

387
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,310
She must be happy.

388
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,490
Wait.

389
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,440
Your Highness, what else can I do for you?

390
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,830
I heard that someone bullied Physician Li.

391
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,150
I'm stupid.

392
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,190
I didn't know the one who was sick is Your Highness.

393
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,560
Sorry for my reckless behavior.

394
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,360
I didn't mean to bully Li Lianhua.

395
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,560
I just had a bet with him.

396
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,300
Please don't misunderstand, Your Highness.

397
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,530
A bet?

398
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,510
What's the bet?

399
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
I bet with him that

400
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,750
if one of us cured you first,

401
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,340
the other one

402
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,450
must leave the palace.

403
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,270
Then why haven't you left the palace yet, Imperial Preceptor?

404
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,830
Eunuch Wang.

405
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,500
Send the Imperial Preceptor out of the palace.

406
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,250
Who wants to drive my benefactor away?

407
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,460
-Your Majesty./N-Grandmother.

408
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,660
Grandmother.

409
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,340
Grandmother.

410
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,530
Your leg has recovered.

411
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,720
Thanks to the elixir Imperial Preceptor brought me from the Blood Realm.

412
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,460
I've been lying in bed

413
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,100
for four or five years.

414
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,100
Finally, I can come down and take a walk.

415
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,570
[Empress Dowager of Great Xi]

416
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,930
Zhaoling.

417
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,700
Are you cured?

418
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,220
Yes.

419
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,320
Physician Li cured me.

420
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,860
Then why do you have to drive Imperial Preceptor away?

421
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,810
It's not that I wanted to drive him away.

422
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,740
He lost the bet himself.

423
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,320
A bet is a bet.

424
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,530
He's not a shameless dog.

425
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,970
Of course he has to go.

426
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,160
Your Majesty.

427
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,730
I shall take my leave.

428
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,620
Not so fast, Imperial Preceptor.

429
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,540
You must be Mr. Li.

430
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,070
Your Majesty.

431
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Rise, please.

432
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,030
Zhaoling has been ill for more than a month.

433
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,330
Thanks to Mr. Li, she's cured.

434
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,780
I thank you on behalf of His Majesty.

435
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,040
You're welcome, Your Majesty.

436
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,590
As a doctor,

437
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,150
I just tried my best and did what I should do.

438
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,230
You're kind and skillful.

439
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,770
Both of you

440
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,830
are my benefactors.

441
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,120
I haven't repaid your kindness yet.

442
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,270
How can we say goodbye in such a hurry?

443
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,060
I hope you

444
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,730
can let go of the bet

445
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,950
for the sake of me, Mr. Li.

446
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Your Majesty.

447
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,440
It was just a bet with the Imperial Preceptor.

448
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Don't worry about it.

449
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,600
Right.

450
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,800
I would ask the Imperial Preceptor to stay too.

451
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,680
Thank you, Physician Li.

452
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
His Majesty will hold a banquet tomorrow

453
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,700
as a formal thank you.

454
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,500
Mr. Li and Imperial Preceptor, you are both invited.

455
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Please don't refuse.

456
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,060
It's my great honor.

457
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

458
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,860
Your Majesty. It's just that

459
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,190
it'll take some time

460
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,930
before Her Highness can be fully recovered.

461
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,420
I need to take Her Highness

462
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,560
to a place that's airy and ventilated in the palace

463
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,210
so that her meridians can be cleared.

464
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,580
Hope I can get your permission, Your Majesty.

465
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,560
Yes, Grandmother.

466
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,040
I still have a bit of a headache.

467
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,190
In that case,

468
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,280
we'll do as you say.

469
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,840
If you need anything,

470
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,840
just tell them.

471
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

472
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,520
Li Lianhua.

473
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,190
You said the Imperial Preceptor is a bad person.

474
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,420
Then why did he cure Grandmother's leg?

475
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,040
There's something magical called Golden Shell Snow Silkworm in the State of Xibei.

476
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,470
It can fix broken limbs.

477
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,580
It is said to be a rare treasure.

478
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,460
I guess the Imperial Preceptor

479
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,050
used this Snow Silkworm

480
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,430
to cure Empress Dowager.

481
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,050
What do they want to steal exactly?

482
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,520
Even at the cost of a national treasure.

483
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,320
The Interior Treasury?

484
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,930
Grandmother always says the 
expenses of the royal family

485
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,200
come from the Interior Treasury.

486
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,220
There must be a lot of treasures in the treasury.

487
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,330
How bold they are.

488
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,420
Li Lianhua.

489
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,650
You winked at me and asked me to come out here.

490
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,930
You've figured out how to catch them, right?

491
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,210
You are really smart, Your Highness.

492
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,920
You see.

493
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,230
This

494
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,570
is the secret code of the bandits.

495
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,070
It is said that

496
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,560
there's another symbol exactly like this in the palace.

497
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,360
Have you seen it, Your Highness?

498
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,890
No.

499
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,420
But the Royal Palace is huge.

500
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,930
It's possible that I didn't notice it.

501
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:03,980
How about this?

502
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,340
I'll take you to look around the palace.

503
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
We must catch all these thieves who steal from us.

504
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,070
OK. Thank you, Your Highness.

507
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,420
That was close.

508
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,710
I didn't mistake this knife as a hallucination.

509
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,560
What a formation of fake and real.

510
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,240
Could this be

511
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,070
Dian Daoke's Demon-Spike Sword?

512
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,850
Li Lianhua.

513
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,210
Is that symbol reliable?

514
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,960
We've searched the entire palace.

515
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
Is there no other clue?

516
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,950
It seems that

517
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,540
there is no other clue for now.

518
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,640
But, Your Highness,

519
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,500
did you notice anyone who's been acting weird

520
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,380
in the palace?

521
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,950
That evil old man, Xuanyuan Xiao.

522
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,890
What's wrong with him?

523
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,720
He is the Commander of the Imperial City Division.

524
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,500
A few days ago, he suddenly started a thorough check in the palace.

525
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,000
Those whose background is unclear had to leave the palace.

526
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,200
Many of my handmaidens were kicked out.

527
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,820
He seems weird to me.

528
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,340
Could it be Xuanyuan Xiao?

529
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,070
He's just being a little strict.

530
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,470
It's not a problem.

531
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,870
Nothing matches.

It's getting late.

536
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,420
Why don't you go back and rest?

537
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,630
OK.

538
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,060
Take this.

539
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,530
If you get in trouble,

540
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,810
take it to Yuhua Gate and find the Head Guard, Dian Qiu.

541
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,150
He's a trusted aide from my hometown. He'll help you.

542
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm leaving then.

543
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,580
See you, Your Highness.

Minister Fang's reminder worked.

545
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,830
There must have been many of

546

Shan Gudao's spies in those who were kicked out of the palace.

547
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,620
That's why he could only ask Demon Monk

548
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,740
to enter the palace as Imperial Preceptor.

You've only been wandering among the folks.

552
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,700
I didn't expect to see you here.

554
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,500
So you've heard

555
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,900
my conversation with Her Highness just now.

556
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,600
There's another reason

557
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,360
why I entered the palace this time.

558
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,730
But the Imperial City Division

559
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,620
has already known the reason.

560
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,530
So the warning we received

561
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,850
was from you, Mr. Li.

562
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,240
Shan Gudao has got his hands into the Royal Palace.

563
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,070
I have to come here and take care of it myself.

564
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,760
But, Lord Yang,

565
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,590
you work for the Supervision Bureau.

566
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,040
Why are you here?

567
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,700
My master is the Commander of the Imperial City Division.

568
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,440
He appointed me to the Imperial City Division a few days ago

569
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,940
because of your warning.

570
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,750
The suspects should have been sent out of the palace.

571
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,360
We should be safe now.

572
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,280
The Imperial City Division

573
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,900
has cleared up many spies,

574
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,520
but they let in such a big trouble.

575
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,770
The State of Xibei

576
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,270
has been coveting

577
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,280
Great Xi's territory for long.

578
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,010
So the aim of the Demon Monk entering the palace

579
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,860
is very clear.

580
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,910
What he wants must be related to our territory.

581
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,640
Please remind your master again, Lord Yang.

582
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,950
No need.

583
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,110
Master.

584
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,550
Master.

585
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,820
We are master and disciple in private.

586
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,560
[Commander of the Imperial City Division, Xuanyuan Xiao]

587
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,920
But now we're performing our duty in the palace.

588
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,440
Yes.

589
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,970
Greetings, Commander.

590
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,730
There are always dangers and threats in the palace.

591
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,870
If we suspect everything,

592
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,630
I'm afraid the Imperial City Division would have been executed for encroachment.

593
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,870
Unexpectedly,

594
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,580
the Imperial City Division

595
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,830
neglected its duty.

596
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,260
You knew the danger was near,

597
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,910
but you'd rather ignore it.

598
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
I spoke too much.

599
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,310
You worry too much, Mr. Li.

600
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,020
No matter what the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei's purpose is,

601
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,480
as long as he doesn't break the rules,

602
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,110
he is still the Imperial Preceptor

603
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,710
and His Majesty's guest.

604
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,770
Just like you, Mr. Li.

605
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,380
You entered the palace to treat illness.

606
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,210
Just perform your duty as a physician.

607
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,860
Mind your own business.

608
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,460
The defense in the palace is strong and solid.

609
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Everything is under my control.

610
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,380
It's none of your business, quack.

611
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,540
Yunchun.

612
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,730
Send Mr. Li back to his room to rest.

613
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,790
My Lord.

614
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,450
Do you remember the Mid-Autumn night in the Royal Palace ten years ago?

615
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,340
It's really beautiful.

616
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,870
Who are you? How dare you break into the Royal Palace?

617
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,820
The Epiphyllum Festival really deserves its reputation.

618
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,350
I shall take my leave.

619
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,470
So you were the one who broke into the Royal Palace that night.

620
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,380
The man in control behind the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei

621
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,860
is Shan Gudao, from the Wansheng Clan.

622
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,510
He's the master of the powerful Wansheng Clan.

623
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,180
My Lord.

624
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,890
If you strike only after he has struck,

625
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,760
you'll be at a disadvantage.

626
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,100
So you are Li Xiangyi.

627
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,380
Although I haven't left the palace for decades,

628
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,280
I've heard of your name.

629
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,120
You died ten years ago.

630
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,650
After coming back to life ten years later,

631
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,070
you only knew to come in the palace and slander the Wansheng Clan and Shan Gudao.

632
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,930
What's your purpose?

633
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,060
It seems the rumors about you are true.

634
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,390
Wansheng Clan has been loyal these years,

635
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,600
working for the Imperial Court.

636
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,010
Shan Gudao once saved the Xuanyuan family.

637
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,240
He's a righteous man.

638
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,090
But you.

639
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,010
You tried to assassinate him and made him hide for ten years,

640
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,800
and now you're slandering him again.

641
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,190
Considering that you're the Empress Dowager's guest,

642
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,240
I won't kill you.

643
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,540
Don't let me get the goods on you.

644
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,840
Or there will be

645
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,900
a vacancy for you

646
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,950
in the prison of Imperial City Division, Sect Leader Li.

647
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,640
Even a master like Xuanyuan Xiao has been bribed.

648
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,180
Senior's game is set so deliberately.

649
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,710
Looks like there's only one way to stop him.

650
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,300
Tomorrow at the banquet,

651
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,330
I have to gain His Majesty's trust.

652
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,420
This is a family banquet to thank the Imperial Preceptor and Mr. Li.

653
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

654
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,600
Just drink as much as you want.

655
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,130
[Emperor of Great Xi]

656
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,900
Your Majesty.

657
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,400
The State of Great Xi

658
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,650
is beautiful and prosperous.

659
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,420
There are so many talented people here.

660
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,389
Not to mention how advantaged and talented you are, Your Majesty.

661
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,190
My first toast today

662
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,070
has to go to Your Majesty.

663
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,460
This is my blessing,

664
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,860
not my credit.

665
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,699
Thank you for your praise, Imperial Preceptor.

666
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,670
To Your Majesty.

667
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,940
My second toast is to the Empress Dowager.

668
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,800
Congratulations on the three blessings, Your Majesty.

669
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,600
Zhaoling and I are cured, which counts as two blessings.

670
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,219
What's the third blessing?

671
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,150
Half a month ago,

672
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,300
I discussed with Empress Dowager

673
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,840
about building an occult pagoda in the palace.

674
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,840
Everything is ready now.

675
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,580
As long as Your Majesty and Empress Dowager agree,

676
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,360
we can start the site selection and building of the pagoda today.

677
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,760
Mother, why do you suddenly want to build an occult pagoda?

678
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,610
I'm just imitating

679
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,050
the tradition of Emperor Guangqing

680
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,440
and trying to pray for more blessings to the royal family.

681
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,320
There's no record of

682
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,420
Emperor Guangqing building an occult pagoda

683
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,380
before giving birth to his child.

684
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,660
And there's no former site of an occult pagoda.

685
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,220
It's probably just a legend.

686
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,110
Mother.

687
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,480
Don't take it seriously.

688
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,030
Since it's a legend,

689
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,450
it could be true.

690
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,380
Although you're still in your prime, Your Majesty,

691
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,630
you only have a daughter, Zhaoling.

692
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,460
It's a big problem if the royal family has no male offspring.

693
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,150
How can I not be worried?

694
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,350
Fine.

695
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
Let's do it as you wish, Mother.

696
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,150
Order.

697
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,630
Order!

698
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,160
Occult pagoda craftsmen, come in the hall!

699
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

700
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,050
Rise.

701
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

702
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,540
Your Majesty.

703
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,630
This is the occult pagoda blueprint drawn by the craftsmen from Lanzhu.

704
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,220
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

705
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,640
It is indeed an audacious pagoda that seems appropriate and harmonious.

706
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,040
So you are the craftsmen recommended by the Imperial Preceptor?

707
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,440
Why do you

708
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,300
look a bit familiar to me?

709
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,100
Your Majesty.

710
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,490
I am Feng Pan, from Wansheng Clan.

711
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,540
I donated some money and grains during the famine in Longxi.

712
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,150
I was lucky to have been summoned and rewarded by Your Majesty.

713
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,850
Your Majesty.

714
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,900
These are the craftsmen Imperial Perceptor asked me to hire from Lanzhu

715
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,070
with big money.

716
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,490
I'm sure Your Majesty and Empress Dowager will be satisfied.

717
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,150
No wonder you look so kind.

718
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,180
You're a hero of Great Xi.

719
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,740
In that case,

720
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,240
you can select an idle spot

721
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,490
in the palace to build the pagoda.

722
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,910
So this is Shan Gudao's plan.

723
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,530
In the name of building a pagoda for a royal offspring,

724
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,270
he can take this opportunity to look for mother bugs in the palace.

725
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,540
Your Majesty.

726
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,600
I think it's a bit inappropriate.

727
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,630
What matters the most in the Royal Palace

728
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,850
is royal authority.

729
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,710
Wouldn't building the occult pagoda be turning the tables?

730
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,220
Besides, if this occult pagoda

731
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,620
is built outside the palace wall,

732
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,070
it would be more appropriate.

733
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,540
The space is vast.

734
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,280
Why does it have to be built inside the palace?

735
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,570
What Mr. Li said

736
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,010
makes sense too.

737
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,130
Your Majesty.

738
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,360
It's okay if we are building an ordinary occult pagoda.

739
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,180
But the occult pagoda we are building will have Luminous Sarira stored in it,

740
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,760
so it has to be built inside the palace.

741
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,470
Luminous Sarira?

742
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,900
The Luminous Sarira stolen during the late emperor's reign?

743
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,920
Exactly, Your Majesty.

744
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,910
We bought this treasure with a lot of money

745
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,040
from the State of Lanzhu.

746
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,420
We know how important it is,

747
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,780
so we brought it here to present to you, Your Majesty.

748
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,450
Bring it to me.

749
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
What is this treasure?

750
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,500
Why are you so happy, Father?

751
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,490
This is the treasure that the late emperor valued the most.

752
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
When it was placed in the palace,

753
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,940
Great Xi was prosperous and free of famine and plague for ten years.

754
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,400
This treasure is heavily blessed.

755
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,860
If it's placed in the pagoda built inside the palace,

756
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,820
it will protect the state and the people of Great Xi

757
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,880
just like it did during the late emperor's reign.

758
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,950
The late emperor was heartbroken

759
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,090
when this treasure was stolen.

760
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,940
It's a good omen

761
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,290
that it comes back to us today.

762
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,700
Fine.

763
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,960
I permit you to walk around the palace and select a site

764
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,630
to build the audacious pagoda right away.

765
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,480
Place this treasure in the pagoda.

766
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,260
We won't let Your Majesty and Empress Dowager down.

767
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,610
This is so great.

768
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,690
Your Majesty.

769
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,310
The site selection and building of the pagoda is extraordinarily mysterious.

770
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,140
If there are too many people involved,

771
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,440
it may disturb the spiritual energy.

772
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,340
Physician Li is a distinguished guest.

773
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,490
Please allow him

774
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,840
to stay in a guest room outside the palace, Your Majesty.

775
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,920
Your Majesty, I know some occult practices.

776
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
Isn't it perfect if I help

777
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,700
the Imperial Preceptor with site selection?

778
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,860
Maybe I don't have to

779
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,980
leave the palace.

780
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,050
Physician Li just said

781
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,890
it's inappropriate to build a pagoda inside the palace.

782
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,510
And now you say this.

783
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,260
I'm afraid you're fooling His Majesty.

784
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,730
Of course I dare not fool His Majesty.

785
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,970
But I really want to help.

786
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,680
Imperial Preceptor is a guest from another country,

787
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,290
yet he thinks for Your Majesty so sincerely.

788
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,020
As a citizen of Great Xi,

789
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,670
of course I should do my part.

790
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,670
Mr. Li.

791
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,860
Since you dared to talk so ambitiously in front of His Majesty,

792
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,640
I'm sure you have a deep understanding

793
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,830
of metaphysics.

794
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,770
How about this?

795
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,160
Use your metaphysics to divine

796
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,400
how many jade beads there are

797
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,640
in my sachet.

798
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,530
I believe this kind of trick

799
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,820
is a piece of cake to you.

800
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,470
Why does he have to listen to you?

801
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,960
Giving orders in front of my father.

802
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,110
How rude!

803
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,020
It's okay.

804
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,560
It's not a big deal, divining the number.

805
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,780
However,

806
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,140
occult practices are psychic.

807
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,440
Isn't it a blasphemy

808
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,200
if I use it to divine the number of jade beads?

809
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,530
How about

810
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,300
I use it to divine something bigger

811
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,000
to show my real ability?

812
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,710
May I

813
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,990
divine and see

814
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,830
if there's anything bothering you lately, Your Majesty?

815
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,800
OK.

816
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,760
Mr. Li, please start your divination.

817
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,620
My way of divination is different.

818
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,590
It's called Picking-flower Hexagram.

819
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,250
Please pick any flower you like, Your Majesty.

820
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,890
The flower you picked

821
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,420
is yet to bloom.

822
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,170
It shows that it needs water.

823
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,240
What's been bothering Your Majesty

824
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,760
is related to water.

825
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,400
There's a drought in Yuzhou.

826
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,830
His Majesty has been worried about it for days.

827
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,400
Everyone knows that.

828
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,280
What Physician Li said

829
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,470
is just a common hoax.

830
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,580
That's just the beginning.

831
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,350
I haven't finished yet.

832
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,440
Please take a look.

833
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,240
The pistil in the bud has taken form.

834
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,780
It will bloom very soon today.

835
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

836
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,700
The matter you've been worried about is about to be solved.

837
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,120
Report!

838
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,150
Your Majesty.

839
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,260
Urgent news from Yuzhou.

840
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,060
Yesterday, it finally rained.

841
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,500
The drought has been resolved.

842
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,450
You're so capable, Mr. Li.

843
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,450
I'm impressed.

844
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,270
All right.

845
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,200
From today on, Mr. Li,

846
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,470
you can participate in site selection together with the Imperial Preceptor in the palace.

847
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,460
-Yes, Your Majesty./N-Yes, Your Majesty.

848
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,310
Yes, Your Majesty.
