Ten years ago,

the fastest sword in the wide world was Li Xiangyi's sword.

He defeated the Demon of the Blood Realm at 15

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,860

Some take him as the hope of the martial arts world in the Central Plains.

13

15

Aren't you giving out the police badge first?

[Fang Duobing, Young Master of Tianji Manor]

197

We meet again.

I knew it.

202
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Isn't it Fang Duobing?

203
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,710
He almost got away.

204
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,490
No.

205
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,580
Why are you here again?

206
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,020
Why can't I come?

207
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,530
I took the exam for three years in a row,

208
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,070
but you always find excuses

209
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,770
to eliminate me in the end.

210
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,030
This time, I disguised myself

211
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,820
and got the first place.

212
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,490
You must have nothing to say.

213
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,210
Do your parents know you are here?

214
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,860
I...

215
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,470
Minister Fang and Lady He sent a letter.

216
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,970
The ink is still wet.

217
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,580
If you let my son enter Baichuan Academy,

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,370
I'll tear down Baichuan Academy and build a pigsty.

You are the only descendant

We...

222
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,910
Of course we are not afraid of trouble,

Head Li.

231
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,520
My master left me this sword.

Yes.

My master is the famous Li Xiangyi.

238
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,600
And I am your Head's direct disciple.

239
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,800
Li Xiangyi's Young Master Sword is the most rigid in the world.

240
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,380
But few people know

241
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,140
he also has a most flexible sword

242
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,770
called Neck-cutting.

243
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,700
My master has never

244
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,570
used Neck-cutting in public.

245
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,460
Less than five people

know about this sword.

247

This is master's order,

265
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,550

Wang Qingshan, head of Lingshan Sect,

301
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,820
sent me a letter a few days ago,

302
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,770

We planned to send someone to investigate.

306

He ascended to immortality.

310
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,420
It's true that the Lingshan Sect has been practicing immortality.

311

But the timing

312
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,880
is too coincidental.

What an interesting doctor.

He said he needed a condition to save people.

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,200
Well said.

377
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,620
Well said.

378
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,080
Young man.

379
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,160
You're a detective, right?

380
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,960
Then you came at the right time.

381
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,380
You came at the right time.

382
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,230
They...

383
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,700
They killed someone.

384
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,700
Killed someone?

385
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,620
Who did they kill?

386
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,220
Arrest them now!

387
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,090
Tell me.

388
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,460
What case?

389
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,600
We killed those who deserve to be killed.

390
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,530
But he shouldn't die at this moment.

391
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,240
Right?

392
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,520
That's right.

393
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,350
You'll die anytime I want.

394
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,980
You own the Yama's Palace?

395
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,510
You...

396
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,060
What are you doing?

397
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,910
Look.

398
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,020
He's staring at me.

399
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,740
All right, stop it.

400
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,860
Where is he?

401
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,420
Show me.

402
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,420
Emptying Hands, the master thief?

403
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,150
That's right.

404
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,660
Li.

405
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
His mouth and nose are cold.

406
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,620
There's no pulse at all.

407
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,790
He can't die anymore.

408
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,940
As for the cause of death,

409
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,860
it's probably your meteor hammer.

410
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
Sir.

411
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,650
He stole the treasure of Hall of Wind and Flame.

412
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,720
He is a Shaolin lay disciple.

413
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,660
He practiced Impenetrable Defence.

414
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,540
He shouldn't die like this.

415
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,790
That's right.

416
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,300
In that case,

417
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,560
what does it have to do with this doctor?

418
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
Did he kill him?

419
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,020
No.

420
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,220
Did he still with Emptying Hands?

421
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,280
No.

422
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,260
In that case,

423
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,520
why are you making things difficult for this...

424
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,380
Li Lianhua.

425
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,470
Doctor Li Lianhua?

426
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,260
Well said, young man.

427
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,800
This...

428
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,700
Did we just lose our things for nothing?

429
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,210
Didn't you just kill someone?

430
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,370
He took your stuff.

431
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,610
You killed him.

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
He's at a disadvantage.

433
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,860
You had a chance to find the lost thing.

434
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,940
Unfortunately...

435
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,700
Think about it before you take action next time.

436
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,490
Everyone's life is expensive.

437
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,920
You have to pay for killing, right?

438
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,290
As for this dead body,

439
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,940
I'll stay and inform Baichuan Academy.

440
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,180
As for how to deal with it,

441
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
it's also up to us.

442
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,030
Doctor Li.

443
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,710
You may leave now.

444
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,540
Thank you.

445
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,520
He can't leave.

446
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,710
Brother.

447
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,620
We lost the treasure of our Hall.

448
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,840
He is the only hope we can get it back.

449
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,160
Shi Wenjue of the Iron Armor Sect.

450
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,070
Iron Flute Hero.

451
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,740
It is said that Li Lianhua

452
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,730
is a miracle-working doctor who can cure the dead.

453
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,080
They would never lie.

454
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,460
But I only remember

455
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,050
I gave them

456
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,680
some rheumatic plasters.

457
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
But this plaster

458
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,140
can't bring people back to life.

459
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,620
I'm not that powerful.

460
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,660
I can't cure the dead.

461
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,860
How could you believe

462
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,380
words to cheat kids?

463
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,460
That's right.

464
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,900
If he can bring people back to life,

465
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,860
I'll take his surname.

466
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,390
This...

467
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:53,980
What?

468
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,220
You're not convinced?

469
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,310
13 years ago,

470
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,220
the court had an agreement with Sigu Sect.

471
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,530
The affairs of the people are under the government's jurisdiction.

472
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,090
Baichuan Academy judge the grudges between people who know martial arts.

473
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,260
Are you disregarding the ruling

474
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,320
of Baichuan Academy?

475
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,070
Fine.

476
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,110
For today's matter,

477
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,660
we will not just let it go.

478
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,470
Let's go.

479
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,000
Let's go.

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,470
Thank you for saving my life.

481
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,930
But

482
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,240
now,

483
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,260
they should...

484
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,150
Don't worry.

485
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,860
As long as I'm here,

486
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,390
no one dares to touch you.

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,500
Stay with me tonight.

488
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,120
I'll send you out of the city tomorrow morning.

489
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,170
How can I?

490
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,820
But my money...

491
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,420
I'll pay for it.

492
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,320
How loyal!

493
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,000
[Lingshan Sect]

494
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,760
[Lotus House]

495
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,730
Young Master.

496
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,740
The dessert is not delicate enough.

497
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,710
I'll prepare some more.

498
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,900
Thank you so much, Mr. Fang.

499
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,780
Li, don't mention it.

500
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,100
How do you know my surname?

501
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,840
Daring to recruit the only son of Minister Fang,

502
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,240
Fobi Baishi is really bold.

503
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,140
You know my father?

504
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,270
Mr. Fang.

505
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,930
If I'm right,

506
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,030
your sward ornament

507
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,740
should be a rare jade, cold smoke.

508
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,830
Last year, only one piece came out.

509
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,340
Fuyu Building charged an extremely high price.

510
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,710
Tianji Manor got it.

511
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,090
Your name is more frightening

512
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,830
than the title of a detective.

513
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,300
I didn't expect that although you don't know martial arts,

514
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,050
you're quite insightful.

515
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I didn't want to be ostentatious

516
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,220
in the wide world.

517
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,530
Mr. Fang,

518
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,180
you must have just entered Baichuan Academy, right?

519
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:19,990
Yes.

520
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Since I was young, I swore

521
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,860
I would join Baichuan Academy when I grow up

522
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
and revive the Sigu Sect.

523
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,050
So I don't want anyone to know

524
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,110
I'm the son of Prime Minister Fang.

525
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,660
I just want others to remember me as

526
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,790
an ordinary detective of Baichuan Academy.

527
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,630
Good ambition.

528
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,250
I like passionate young men like you.

529
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,370
It seems that we really get along well.

530
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,350
Here.

531
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,220
To Mr. Fang.

532
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,300
To Baichuan Academy.

533
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,580
Here.

534
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,550
It's my honor.

535
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,300
Cheers.

536
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,890
Cheers.

537
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,450
By the way,

538
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,570
Mr. Fang,

539
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,690
what's your plan on

540
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,970
handling the body of Emptying Hands?

541
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,860
I'll send a pigeon to Baichuan Academy

542
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,280
and ask them to bring it back.

543
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,660
By the way, Li.

544
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,750
I'm curious about one thing.

545
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Why is the Hall of Wind and Flame so sure that

546
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,020
you saved two dead people?

547
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
I don't believe in resurrection.

548
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,640
In this world,

549
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,350
there are ways to revive the dead.

550
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,550
Because sometimes,

551
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,930
the dead may not really be the dead.

552
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,110
Li,

553
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,330
what do you mean?

554
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
This tea...

555
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,710
I haven't met a detective for so many years.

556
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,310
I didn't expect that the first detective

557
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,830
to meet is you, a newbie.

558
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,760
Baichuan Academy is getting worse every year.

559
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,650
Who are you?

560
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,020
For the sake of your help,

561
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,710
I'll say something more.

562
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,540
You made the first mistake as a detective

563
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,390
as soon as you got off the mountain.

564
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,290
You trust others too easily.

565
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,950
You deserve a beating.

566
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,520
Secondly,

567
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,190
your autopsy is not done professionally.

568
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,160
That's another beating.

569
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,410
I'm not blaming you.

570
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,240
Being a detective doesn't suit you.

571
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,600
Go home after one or two cases.

572
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,590
By the way,

573
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,960
also,

574
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,610
you even brought maids and servants with you.

575
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,320
Can you be more ostentatious?

576
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,690
Just you wait.

577
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,100
Get up.

578
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,250
Li.

579
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,400
Why are you so late?

580
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,740
Do you know that the Unbreathing Skill

581
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,140
can only last for three days at most?

582
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,420
Lower your voice.

583
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,920
The Hall of Wind and Flame is so cruel.

584
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,360
They almost killed me.

585
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,400
Cut the crap.

586
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,220
Leave now.

587
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:32,640
Okay.

588
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,820
Let's go.

589
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,760
Hurry!

590
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,160
Hurry!

591
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,020
Where is Li Lianhua?

592
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,960
My people just found out that

593
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,670
he knew Emptying Hands long ago.

594
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,900
He deliberately

595
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,980
lured us here to find him.

596
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,000
Boss.

597
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,160
Bad news!

598
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,540
The man in the coffin is gone.

599
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,040
Go after him!

600
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,780
Wait for me!

601
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,840
Wait for me!

602
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,550
Huahua?

603
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,140
You are well prepared.

604
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,270
Stop! Stop!

605
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,700
Stop! Stop!

606
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,690
-Stop! 
-Go!

607
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,000
Kid.

608
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,210
What did you say?

609
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,860
If this brother can really come back to life,

610
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,670
you'll take his surname.

611
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,990
I must seek an explanation from Baichuan Academy for this.

612
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,140
Let's go.

613
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,430
Let's go.

614
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,970
Li Lianhua.

615
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,910
Did you see Huahua?

616
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,610
That detective was so stern.

617
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,890
I owe you nothing now.

618
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,290
All clear.

619
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,110
The Hall of Wind and Flame

620
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,440
is really not good.

621
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,610
They started off as bandits.

622
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,020
Five years ago, they took the Shi family's secret book

623
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,889
as their own.

624
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,699
I had no choice.

625
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,100
I have to find and steal it.

626
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,139
But today,

627
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,830
fortunately, you're here.

628
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,080
-This play...
-Where's my stuff?

629
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,420
Yes.

630
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,190
Here.

631
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,340
You're really weird.

632
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,820
If you're stingy,

633
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,770
when I want to give you half of the silver, you didn't want it.

634
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,860
You only want the recipe and five taels of silver.

635
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,260
If you're not stingy,

636
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,929
when anyone owes you three coins,

637
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,699
you have to get it back no matter where you have to go.

638
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,659
My consultation fee

639
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,540
is just five taels.

640
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,980
No more.

641
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
No less.

642
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,760
This is my master's recipe.

643
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,679
I wonder

644
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,460
how it ended up in someone else's hands.

645
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,380
I just like eating this.

646
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,290
You are always mysterious.

647
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,850
I can't tell if you know any martial arts.

648
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,440
But you're good at flying.

649
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,260
Who is your master?

650
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,660
Stop studying.

651
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,820
I'm just a lonely ghost.

652
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,240
Li Lianhua.

653
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,700
Are you looking for people of the Jinyuan Alliance?

654
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,200
It's my professional habit.

655
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,040
I was just curious.

656
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:17,800
Besides,

657
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,830
even if I search you thoroughly,

658
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,670
I can't find anything important.

659
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,900
Goodbye.

660
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,630
Go to Lingshan Taoist Rite

661
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,540
in Jiazhou,

662
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,500
you might find the person you're looking for.

663
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,780
Lingshan Sect?

664
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,030
Young Master.

665
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,460
Calm down.

666
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,670
We travel in the wide world,

667
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,880
it is normal to get our feet wet occasionally.

668
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,940
It's unexpected that

669
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,620
he looks harmless.

670
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,980
Who knows he's an old fox?

671
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,660
Young Master,

672
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,820
let's go back to the manor.

673
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,370
Do you remember that Lady said

674
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,840
if you dare to join Baichuan Academy, she will teach you a lesson.

675
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,420
My mother always threatens me.

676
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
When did she really teach me a lesson?

677
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,420
Actually, Young Master,

678
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,060
I just found that

679
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,980
all the money we brought out this time

680
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,660
has become invalid.

681
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,260
What?

682
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,810
The manager asked us to move out overnight.

683
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,850
But you know

684
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,430
we're used to living in the superior room.

685
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,140
We can't sleep on the streets.

686
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,720
No.

687
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,540
Since I've made up your mind,

688
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,300
how can I return so easily?

689
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,470
Let's go to Jiazhou first

690
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,350
and get down to business.

691
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,740
Take it.

692
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,050
Pawn it for some money.

693
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,460
Li Lianhua.

694
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,180
I must catch you to vent my anger

695
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,480
even I have to go to the end of the world.

696
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,760
[Jiazhou City]

697
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,360
Excuse me,

698
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,250
how do I get to Lingshan Sect in Jiazhou?

699
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,930
You're going to Lingshan Sect?

700
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,020
Are you too old?

701
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,600
There are many people going to Lingshan.

702
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,410
Go ask them.

703
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,610
Do you know?

704
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,980
I heard that the person the Lingshan Sect is looking for

705
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,080
is their next sect head.

706
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,910
[Notice]

707
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,630
In my opinion,

708
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,710
if they can find this boy,

709
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,940
the boy can

710
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,830
inherit all the assets of Lingshan Sect.

711
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,310
Who do you think is so lucky?

712
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,730
Born on the sixth day of the fourth month of the lunar year, Bing Shen Year,

713
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,340
he has a lotus mole.

714
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,590
Wangfu.

715
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,980
What are you doing?

716
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,780
Young master,

717
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,180
I was born on the sixth day of the fourth month of the lunar year.

718
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Does this look like a lotus mole?

719
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,520
Wangfu.

720
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,860
How long haven't you washed your feet?

721
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,820
I think you have a mole in your brain.

722
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,820
How can you believe that?

723
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,460
Wangfu.

724
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,620
Fu.

725
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,940
Why are you here?

726
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,090
I've been looking for you.

727
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,730
Cousin.

728
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,020
Did you see the notice?

729
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,810
It's clearly you.

730
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,710
Let's go.

731
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,710
Go to Lingshan Sect with me.

732
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,180
Wait.

733
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,580
What cousin? From Lingshan Sect?

734
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Make it clear before we go.

735
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,780
As soon as Lingshan's notice came out,

736
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,880
I thought

737
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,870
isn't this Wangfu?

738
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,450
I went to the manor to find you.

739
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,930
But the people in the manor said

740
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,280
you and Eldest Young Master ran out.

741
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,580
Luckily I met you here.

742
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,930
We are here

743
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,240
for the ascension of the head of Lingshan Sect.

744
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Tell me everything you know.

745
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,820
The Lingshan Sect

746
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,780
is a sect of Feng Shui Taoism.

747
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,980
They have many followers.

748
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,460
That's why it's super rich.

749
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,260
Of course.

750
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,770
They can't compare to

751
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
the Eldest Young Master of the Fang family.

752
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,540
But locally,

753
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,740
it's one of the richest.

754
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,820
But followers of the Lingshan Sect can't marry.

755
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,570
Once the sect head is gone,

756
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,080
only his disciples can be the next head.

757
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,400
But seven days ago,

758
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,090
[Tengyun Pavilion]

759
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
the head of Lingshan Sect

760
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,100
ascended in public.

761
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,160
Master.

762
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,450
It's time to start the ceremony.

763
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,780
Don't panic.

764
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:07,740
You've been in our sect for years.

765
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,820
I didn't summon you here

766
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,250
to preach,

767
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,930
but to say goodbye to you.

768
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,820
I was guided by the deity

769
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
and cultivated three flowers gathering at the top

770
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,820
and five energy circulating.

771
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,820
I'm leaving this body behind

772
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,170
to protect you.

773
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,740
When you see the golden body in the future, it's like seeing me.

774
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,040
Farewell, Grandmaster.

775
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,710
[Destiny predetermined that the heir returned as a 16-year-old immortal boy who was born in the southwest of the city in early April and has a lotus mole on his right foot.]

776
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,000
That's what happened.

777
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,210
He just died like that

778
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,460
and became a golden body.

779
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,860
It's true.

780
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,180
Fu.

781
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,210
This is fate.

782
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,470
Since young,

783
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,050
your father abandoned you and your mother.

784
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,810
Your mother died early.

785
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,460
I thought

786
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,190
you might remain miserable in your life.

787
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,380
But who knew

788
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,020
there is such a good thing waiting for us?

789
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,500
It sounds interesting.

790
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,680
Looks like I have to go.

791
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,850
No.

792
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,710
Be gentle.

793
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,590
Why are you so rude?

794
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,090
Get lost!

795
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,170
Although your head is dead,

796
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,650
he owes me five taels of silver.

797
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,660
You are his disciple.

798
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,470
Pay the bill.

799
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,720
Get out of here!

800
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,240
Let me tell you.

801
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,970
I know your head.

802
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,870
Can't I go in and visit him alone?

803
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,080
You're not leaving?

804
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,290
I won't be polite with you then.

805
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't come down. I'll go.

806
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
What a coincidence, Doctor Li.

807
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,090
I thought it would take a long time to find you.

808
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,560
I didn't expect that karma's a bitch.

809
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,260
We meet again so soon.

810
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,460
What a coincidence.

811
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
You're empty inside.

812
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,970
Your dantian is weak.

813
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,500
You really don't know martial arts?

814
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,120
Your body is weak too

815
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,660
and can't stand torture.

816
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,740
But you embarrassed me, a representative of Baichuan Academy,

817
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,980
in front of the Hall of Wind and Flame.

818
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,130
Don't worry.

819
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,640
I, Fang Duobing,

820
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,390
won't do anything to someone who doesn't know martial arts.

821
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,250
Aren't you eloquent?

822
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,900
Don't you have many opinions of Fobi Baishi

823
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,200
on how to train detectives?

824
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,780
Come with me to Baichuan Academy.

825
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,900
I'd like to see how you can talk you way out of

826
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,670
the prison of Baichuan Academy.

827
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,630
Young man.

828
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,500
Forget about Baichuan Academy.

829
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,620
Actually,

830
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,900
I just did a favor.

831
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,590
I received five taels of silver to treat a patient.

832
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,770
That's not a crime.

833
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,850
Besides,

834
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,950
let me explain this to you.

835
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,900
In fact, Emptying Hands,

836
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,530
he

837
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,470
used the Unbreathing Skill, right?

838
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes.

839
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,780
I

840
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,040
never believe in resurrection.

841
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,050
I thought about it all night.

842
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,110
How did you do it?

843
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,050
I finally understand.

844
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,980
Young man,

845
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,450
you're really something.

846
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,130
I didn't know

847
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,200
you have a lot of knowledge.

848
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,080
There is only one line

849
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,810
that knows the Unbreathing Skill.

850
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,800
Ordinary people can't see it.

851
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,270
I know I'm smart.

852
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,500
Come with me.

853
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,460
Wait, young man.

854
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,540
Since you are so smart,

855
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,940
you must know

856
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,360
what is best for you.

857
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,980
Now the head of Lingshan Sect

858
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,820
has been killed.

859
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,640
I can help you solve the case

860
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,860
and help you pass the test of Baichuan Academy

861
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,760
so that your parents have nothing to say.

862
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,380
If I seal these two acupoints,

863
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,130
ordinary people can't unseal them.

864
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,800
Don't even think about escaping.

865
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,120
As for whether Head Wang was killed,

866
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,620
I'll get into it myself.

867
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,080
I don't need you, a talkative

868
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,140
fake miracle-working doctor, to help me.
