00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,890
This tea is called Xiangyunhong.

5
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,560
No need.

6
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,020
I'm not here for tea.

7
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,180
I just want to take a rest.

8
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,020
I'll serve you tea, Young Master.

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
I didn't mean it.

10
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,370
Wait.

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
It was my careless mistake.

12
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,300
It had nothing to do with Miss Qing'er here.

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,979
Can you not take this down?

14
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,100
I'm just following the rules.

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,560
Did the girls offend you, Young Master?

16
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,940
The girls are fine.

17
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,030
I have a question

18
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,430
for you though, Miss Bihuang.

19
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,820
Go ahead please, Young Master.

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
If the girls from the Girls' Mansion

21
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,410
make any mistake,

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,650
will they be punished?

23
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,990
We are fair in meting out rewards and punishments.

24
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,730
We only deduct some money from their salaries.

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,290
Then why are they so scared?

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,610
We are here to make money.

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,910
Of course we don't want our salary to be deducted.

28
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,420
Even so,

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,690
may I ask you a favor, Miss Bihuang?

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,460
If any mistake

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
is made by the girls serving us today,

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
I'll pay for their fine. Is that okay?

33
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,820
This may not be...

34
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,250
If the girls are fearful,

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,660
the guests won't be at ease, either.

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,340
If you can't make this call, Miss Bihuang,

37
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,190
I'll go talk to Yu Louchun myself.

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,810
Wait.

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,820
Since it's your request, Young Master Fang,

40
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,170
I dare not disobey.

41
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,270
I'm the steward of the Girls' Mansion.

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,100
I hereby make the call to skip today's inspection.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,100
I'll report it to Master later.

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,070
Yes.

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,670
Thank you.

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,110
I thought the son of the Minister of Revenue

47
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,780
must be a good-for-nothing second generation.

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,910
I was wrong.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,270
I never liked tea,

50
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,870
but there's no wine here.

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,140
So I'll drink tea instead of wine,

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,040
and propose three toasts to you.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,340

65
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,260
He's gone.

66
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,450
I thought it was a big deal.

67
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,520
But people are saying that he bailed on your marriage.

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,470
And they say you scared him away because you are eight feet tall,

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,610
and you have a waist the size of a huge bucket.

70
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,440
What?

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,200
He bailed on me?

72
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm the one who wants to get out of it, okay?

73
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,220
By the way,

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,790
where did Fang Duobing go?

75
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,870
He seems to have gone to the martial world.

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Martial world?

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,100
It's so fun to knock around the martial world.

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,610

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,820
How much is this?

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,380
Are you here to have fun yourself, Miss?

81
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,130
Yes.

82
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,660
There's more fun stuff in my warehouse.

83
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,790
Do you want to check it out, Miss?

84
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:22,980
Please. Take me there.

Fang Duobing.

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,700
It's all because of you! You had to come to the martial world.

87
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,000
It's because of you that I was abducted here as a servant.

88
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,000
Miss.

89
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,490
You should be more gentle.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,220
If you accidentally break the cup,

91
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
you'll have your salary deducted again.

It's alright.

Please, make yourselves at home and take a seat.

I'm almost done with this plaything.

110

This is Jade Bone Skill.

111
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,350
You are knowledgeable, Young Master Fang.

[Master of Girls' Mansion: Yu Louchun]

113
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,770
You've even heard of this unremarkable life-saving skill of mine.

114
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,730
Jade Bone Skill can make people invincible.

115
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,220
It's as powerful as Armor Lock.

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,170
Thank you two

117
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,250
for being here at such short notice.

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
I'm very grateful.

119
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,340
Since it's short notice,

120
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,780
there must be something urgent.

121
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,170
I do have a presumptuous request.

122
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,740
Young masters, please tell me

123
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,140
who killed my best friend, Jin Mantang.

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,510
So this is why

125
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,000
you invited us here.

126
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,130
May I ask, Mr. Yu,

127
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,960
were you close to Jin Mantang?

128
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,740
I built this Jinyu Mansion

129
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,820
specially for Jin.

130
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,510
I used to invite him here every year for Mountains Red.

131
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Jin and I were best friends, and we confided everything to each other.

132
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,580
Since the murderer has been arrested,

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,900
Mr. Yu, you could have inquired Baichuan Court about it.

134
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,190
Why come to us?

135
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,940
Jin was a cautious person.

136
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,140
He wouldn't have been murdered by some greedy unnamable thief.

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,340
I know there's more to it.

138
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,260
You two were there.

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,170
Could you please tell me what happened exactly?

140
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,790
Sorry.

141
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,110
Mr. Yu, there's no need to overthink.

142
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,780
There's nothing behind it.

143
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,450
You don't believe my friendship with Jin?

144
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,460
It's not that.

145
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,020
Master Yu.

146
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,400
You worry too much.

147
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,590
It's just

148
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,810
when the murderer killed Master Jin,

149
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,180
he simply did it for the opal skull.

150
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,690
So I did overthink.

151
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,040
However,

152
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,270
something strange happened after the murder.

153
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
But I don't know if I should tell you about that.

154
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,770
What strange thing?

155
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,940
Feel free to tell me.

156
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,260
When I was in Yuanbao Villa,

157
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,480
I lost a treasure.

158
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,140
The treasure

159
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,530
seems to have been placed together with the opal skull.

160
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,210
Fang Duobing.

161
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,070
You saw it too, right?

162
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,600
That treasure is as thin as a cicada's wings,

163
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,740
and it's crystal clear.

164
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,150
It's more like an...

165
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,280
Ice shard?

166
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,580
From my point of view,

167
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,800
it's more like a jade bamboo leaf.

168
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,200
So you've seen it too, Mr. Yu?

169
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,890
I was just guessing.

170
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,960
Do you know who the treasure thief is?

171
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,980
No clue at all.

172
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,460
But Baichuan Court suspects that

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,880
Jin Mantang was not from the Central Plains.

174
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,770
We suspect the robber is from another sect.

175
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
Do you know where he was from, Mr. Yu?

176
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,590
Jin was not from the Central Plains?

177
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,980
This is also the first time I've heard about it.

178
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,440
There must be some misunderstanding.

179
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,420
I see you have a high-bridged nose

180
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,450
and deep eye sockets.

181
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,190
I thought you are also a person of mixed blood.

182
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,570
I'm a native of Central Plains.

183
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,510
It's getting late.

184
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,210
I'm going to make preparations for Mountains Red.

185
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,310
Pardon me,

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
young masters.

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,830
Not only does he know about ice shards,

188
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,530
but he also has an ice shard himself.

189
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,300
Why don't we visit the Girls' Mansion

190
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,100
in the name of moon-viewing tonight,

191
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,880
and find out where the secret is hidden?

192
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:47,090
[Jinyu Mansion]

193
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,580
Physician Li. Young Master Fang.

194
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
The bell of noon has rung.

195
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,260
How about I take you back to your rooms for a rest?

196
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,950
The bell doesn't sound close.

197
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,460
You have good hearing, Physician Li.

198
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,160
This is the bell from an ancient temple.

199
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,340
It's about two or three hills away from here.

200
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,100
But

201
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,520
fortunately, it's tranquil around here.

202
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,130
We usually arrange our schedule according to the bell.

203
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,620
The bells in other temples ring twice, at dawn and dusk.

204
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,530
I've never heard the bell of noon.

205
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,500
This temple believes in asceticism.

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,950
So, the bell rings three times, at 5 a.m.,

207
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,940
noon, and midnight, every day.

208
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,540
I won't bother you then, Miss Bihuang.

209
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,630
We'll walk around.

210
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,760
Okay.

211
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,260
Okay.

212
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,980
You came up from down the mountain.

213
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,650
Have you heard about what happened on Sigu Tea Party?

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,470
It's all over the martial world.

215
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,450
I didn't expect Li Xiangyi to be such a person.

216
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,460
I knew it long ago.

217
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,860
I was there

218
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,400
when the incident took place that day.

219
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,950
I happened to be passing by,

220
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180
and I wanted to save Shan Gudao.

221
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,430
But after 100 rounds,

222
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,970
I made one tiny mistake,

223
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,490
and Li Xiangyi took the chance

224
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,860
to kill Shan Gudao at one swing.

225
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,610
So why did he let you go?

226
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,780
I saved Li Xiangyi's life once.

227
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,700
Otherwise, he would have killed me too.

228
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,590
It's said that Mr. Yu invited an extraordinary man.

229
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,700
I didn't expect that

230
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,320
you were invited here

231
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,450
because you're good at talking nonsense, Master Dongfang.

232
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,410
Fang.

233
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,490
What do you mean?

234
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,980
Why don't you go a few rounds with me?

235
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,460
Bring it on.

236
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm not afraid of you.

237
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,060
Fang Xiaobao.

238
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,100
Calm down.

239
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:10,940
What's the rush?

240
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,900
Maybe Dongfang here

241
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,750
really saved Li Xiangyi's life.

242
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,610
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,140
May I ask you, Dongfang,

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,220
was there any enemy that Li Xiangyi couldn't beat

245
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,630
when he was young?

246
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,800
Yes.

247
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,740
The thing is

248
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,720
maybe when that enemy

249
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,580
was forcing Li Xiangyi to kneel and beg for mercy,

250
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,330
Dongfang here defended the weak

251
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,250
and helped Li Xiangyi

252
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,160
by kowtowing 18 times instead of him,

253
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,790
and saved his life in the end.

254
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,610
Li Lianhua.

255
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,110
You two are ganging up on me.

256
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,310
I dare not.

257
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,100
Dongfang.

258
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
They were just kidding.

259
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,980
Don't take it seriously.

260
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,140
-Yeah. Just kidding./N-Everyone.

261
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,790
Mountains Red is about to start.

262
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,640
Please follow me to Qinhong Hall.

263
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,210
[Qinhong Hall]

264
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,340
The Mountains Red banquet will be full of beautiful women.

265
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,820
We are lucky today.

266
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,620
Shi.

267
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,060
You are a scholar after all.

268
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,290
-What?/N-Young Master Fang.

269
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,010
It's fun to have beautiful women around while studying.

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,280
One side is honor and fame.

271
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,530
The other side is romantic encounters.

272
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,450
You are all here.

273
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,570
I admire all of you.

274
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,020
It's my honor to have invited all of you here.

275
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,270
Everyone,

276
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,180
please be seated.

277
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,700
The wine on the table in front of you

278
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,170
is made from the water of the ice spring on Fragrant Mountain.

279
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,710
It has been stored for 100 years.

280
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,780
We only open one jar on this day every year.

281
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,970
Mountains Red is the name of the wine.

282
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,880
Mountains Red is a wine's name?

283
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,050
Yes.

284
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,250
There's nothing more to it?

285
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,420
So the century-old fine wine is not good enough?

286
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,180
What else do you want?

287
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,060
Great wine.

288
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,590
My gift can lift our spirits of wine drinking.

289
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,100
This ice drinking cup is made from the ice crystal on Snow Mountain.

290
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,820
It's a perfect match for the fine wine of Mountains Red.

291
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,690
It's not to be missed.

292
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,540
When the leaves turn red on a mountain, two people are missing each other.

293
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,700
The third time I saw her made me fall in love on the fourth encounter.

294
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,000
The curtain opens, and the dream awakens.

295
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,490
One more drink, and I'll write a poem for nothing.

296
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,940
The poem is full of regrets.

297
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,480
It seems that you love women more than wine, Young Master Shi.

298
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,710
What a coincidence.

299
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,250
I also wrote a poem just now

300
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,580
since I was in the mood.

301
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,820
[Aroma]

302
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,750
No wonder they say

303
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,510
you, one-word poet Li Yifu, refused to become an official after passing the imperial exam,

304
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,130
and chose to be a carefree man in the martial world.

305
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,970
Using this one word, "Aroma",

306
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,940
you managed to visualize the poem line "Filled and tossed in the jade bowl like opals shine".

307
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,740
So, Physician Li and Young Master Fang,

308
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,650
you really didn't bring any gifts?

309
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,220
Young Master Fang's gift

310
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,510
is to help you

311
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,570
look for the real Mountains Red.

312
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,940
The real Mountains Red

313
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,340
should be around us.

314
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Please listen carefully.

315
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,380
It's foggy and misty here in the hall.

316
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,880
Now the wind is blowing,

317
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,890
but the mist in the hall still hasn't faded.

318
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,820
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Yu,

319
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,890
the mist behind you is not real, right?

320
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,260
Young Master Fang, you're really smart.

321
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,370
The mist was embroidered by the girls.

322
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,490
It's Jinyun gauze made of ice silk.

323
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,420
Young Master Fang, you saw through the mystery,

324
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,080
so I won't hide my inadequacy anymore.

325
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,970
Girls.

326
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,880
Let Mountains Red begin.

327
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,060
Yes.

328
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,250
So this is the real Mountains Red.

329
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,870
The item each of you picked at the mountain gate

330
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,150
belongs to one of the girls here.

331
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,600
You've chosen your own match.

332
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,580
It's destined.

333
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,460
Come on.

334
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,250
Let's have a toast.

335
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,080
[Binrong, from the Girls' Mansion]

336
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,310
Since we are destined to meet today,

337
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,100
I shall return this item to you, Miss.

338
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,790
[Yushi, from the Girls' Mansion]

339
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,820
[Yuyan, from the Girls' Mansion]

340
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,590
[Chilong, from the Girls' Mansion]

341
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,010
[Xifei, from the Girls' Mansion]

342
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,820
My name is Xifei.

343
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,680
We're destined to meet today, Physician Li.

344
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,460
I want to give you this hibiscus syriacus flower as a gift in return.

345
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,780
May you

346
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,100
have girls as beautiful as the flower by your side every day.

347
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,450
It seems that everyone who comes to the Girls' Mansion

348
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,230
will have beautiful women by their side in the future.

349
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,980
This is the rule of Mountains Red.

350
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,100
It's for good luck.

351
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,500
Well,

352
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,220
I was too embarrassed to keep the chicken foot.

353
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,260
So I left it outside.

354
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
Can I not return it to you?

355
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,329
You're a swordsman in the martial world.

356
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,770
It's fine if you lost it.

357
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,780
What can I do?

358
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,140
Mr. Yu.

359
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,670
This item belongs to Miss Bihuang, right?

360
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,619
Why did you arrange someone else for me?

361
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
Please forgive me, Master Dongfang.

362
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,980
I'm the steward of the Girls' Mansion.

363
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,740
There are many chores to do for Mountains Red.

364
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,690
I didn't want you to feel neglected,

365
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,050
so I asked Binrong to take my place.

366
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,820
Don't worry, Dongfang.

367
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,150
Others may not know it, but don't you?

368
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,720
You'll have plenty of time

369
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,420
after Mountains Red is over.

370
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,680
Okay.

371
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,520
Bihuang.

372
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,300
You heard that too, right?

373
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,320
Everyone.

374
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,740
Besides wine,

375
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,790
there's a must-taste delicacy at Mountains Red.

376
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,090
This fish soup is called Late Spring Nowhere to be Found.

377
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,800
It's made from white fish of the North Sea brewed for days.

378
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,060
It's very nutritious.

379
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,300
It's not available at every Mountains Red.

380
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,170
You're all lucky.

381
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,920
Miss Xifei.

382
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,920
I can do it myself.

383

Qing'er.

384
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,850
It's okay.

385
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,670
I don't like soup anyway.

386
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
It's good I don't have to eat it.

387
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,260
Young Master Fang.

388
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,740
If you don't eat it,

389
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,140
it means I didn't serve you well.

390
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,670
I'll have to punish myself.

391
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,180
Someone.

392
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,130
Serve Young Master Fang another bowl.

393
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,140
Physician Li, what do you think of the soup?

394
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,900
The soup is really good.

395
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,780
But besides Mr. Yu,

396
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,330
no one else here needs supplements, right?

397
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,920
Mr. Yu's Jade Bone Skill is invincible.

398
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,700
What nonsense are you talking about, quack?

399
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,840
Who do you think you're talking to?

400
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,460
This is not a big deal.

401
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,870
It's just that there's some deficiency in your gallbladder, Mr. Yu.

402
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,620
Otherwise,

403
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,380
why would you always bring a bodyguard?

404
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,000
The one standing next to me is Xin Jue.

405
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,250
He's the guard of the Girls' Mansion.

[Girls' Mansion Guard: Xin Jue]

407
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,380
He never leaves my side

408
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,700
because there are too many women in the Girls' Mansion.

409
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,050
It'll be troublesome

410
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,480
if I walk around willfully.

411
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,980
I see.

412
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm sorry if I offended you.

413
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,130
Mr. Yu, you really take good care of the girls.

[Dongpin, from the Girls' Mansion]

415
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,980
These girls are only for serving us

416
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,680
when I drink or write poems with friends.

417
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,540
What I'm worried about is

418
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,410
the guards may be disturbed.

419
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,430
Mr. Yu, you're belittling yourself.

420
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,740
The girls in the Girls' Mansion

421
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,460
are only here for money.

422
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,220
Whether it's master or servant,

423
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,590
you have to show some mercy.

424
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,120
If you don't treat people like people, Mr. Yu,

425
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,540
in others' eyes,

426
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,710
you'll be just a living wallet.

427
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,710
Isn't that belittling yourself?

428
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,950
I see what you mean, Young Master Fang.

429
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,270
It's my turn to offer my gift.

430
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,500
A few months ago,

431
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,090
you sent me a jade drum and an exotic dance score

432
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
called Thunder, Murong.

433
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
This dance is mysterious and hard to learn.

434
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,800
Even Chilong, the girl who's best at dancing in Girls' Mansion,

435
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,100
couldn't master it.

436
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,790
Today, Murong

437
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,730
will perform the Thunder dance for you

438
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,010
as an eye-opening show.

439
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,510
It'll be disrespectful if I refuse.

440
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,490
Please help me with the entertainment, Miss Chilong.

441
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,850
Please present the jade drum.

What a magnificent Thunder dance.

It's like I had a beautiful dream just now.

You all must feel the same.

But I truly admire you.

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,770
Miss Qing'er.

552
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,500
I sincerely advise you

553
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,400
to change your career.

554
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,490
Change my career?

555
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,000
You have no talent

556
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,890
and you are clumsy.

557
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,390
You always pout and get angry.

558
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,670
Compared with other girls,

559
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,020
you're a far cry from them.

560
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,230
So I advise you to leave here as soon as possible.

561
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,170
Why do you have to be fearful here all day?

562
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,570
Do you think I'm a prostitute?

563
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,860
Do you think I'm here to prostitute myself?

564
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,740
Aren't you?

565
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,480
I would have left if I could.

566
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,900
The girls here would also have left.

567
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,940
Aren't you here for money?

568
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,030
That's Bihuang's lie to tell outsiders like you.

569
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,100
All the girls

570
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,300
were kidnapped or abducted here.

571
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,670
Didn't they say there's no physical punishment,

572
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,070
and they only deduct your salary if you make a mistake?

573
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,460
You will die if your salary is deducted to zero.

574
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,860
Yu Louchun does pay us every day,

575
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,340
but everyday food and clothing here cost money.

576
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,350
Once you make a mistake, you'll lose a lot of money.

577
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,620
If you don't have enough money, you'll either starve or freeze.

578
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,460
If you owe too much money,

579
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,530
you'll be sold to the guards outside to get the debt paid.

580
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,390
I didn't expect Girls' Mansion

581
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,460
to be such a place.

582
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,650
Such a place?

583
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,330
People from the martial world like you

584
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,660
still can't wait to come here every year.

585
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,020
I...

586
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,150
Disgusting.

587
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,430
Where are you from, Miss, if you don't mind?

588
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,160
Why were you abducted here?

589
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,610
I'm from the capital.

590
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,390
My family is poor.

591
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,170
We couldn't afford fish or meat.

592
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,710
We could only eat rice to appease our hunger.

593
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,080
Two months ago, when I was watching juggling,

594
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,300
I got abducted here for no reason.

595
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,750
Why did you lie?

596
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,820
You wouldn't be able to afford rice if you are truly poor.

597
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,010
Also, you don't have calluses on your hands.

598
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,440
You're obviously from a rich family.

599
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,070
I didn't want to tell you, okay?

600
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,210
Anyway, that day, I got a sack over my head,

601
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,420
and I passed out over a sweet fragrance.

602
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,370
I have been brought to this hellhole when I woke up.

603
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
So you were drugged.

604
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,820
That makes more sense.

605
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,430
Don't you like to knock around the martial world?

606
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,790
Go and defeat the guards now.

607
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,670
Lower the suspension bridge,

608
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,620
and help me out.

609
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,100
Are you really going?

610
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,100
If what you said is true,

611
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,750
I will seek justice for you.

612
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,700
If you want to go, hurry up.

613
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,480
Yu Louchun's residence is on the summit of Kanyun Peak.

614
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,860
You can't find him if you're there late.

615
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,500
Yu Louchun!

616
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,310
Guard Xin.

617
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,780
I need to talk to your master.

618
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,900
Send me up.

619
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,420
Outsiders are not allowed to enter Master's residence.

620
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,650
You won't be able to spin it.

621
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,590
This spin is really heavy.

622
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,160
It seems that you have extraordinary power skills.

623
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,140
You're quite strong.

624
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,620
It's all for serving Master.

625
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,190
How many treasures do you think are hidden up there?

626
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,360
It's a rude question to ask, distinguished guest.

627
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,940
I'm worried about your master.

628
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,300
I'm afraid that since he has done too many bad things,

629
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,910
the ghost would come to haunt him in the midnight.

630
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:24,720
Forget it.

631
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
There's no use talking to you.

632
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,250
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

633
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,310
You are not going to watch here all night alone, are you?

634
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,830
Don't bother to worry about me, distinguished guest.

635
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,260
The bell of midnight has rung.

636
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,880
Everyone in the Girls' Mansion will sleep.

637
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,040
I'm no exception.

638
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,500
Please leave, distinguished guest.

639
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,380
Yu Louchun, you monster.

640
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll figure it out tomorrow

641
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,920
and send him to Baichuan Court for trial.

642
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,510
How did it go?

643
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,140
I was too late.

644
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,240
He has returned to his residence.

645
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,260
But don't worry.

646
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,130
I'll get even with him tomorrow.

647
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,660
Tomorrow?

648
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,620
I even left you half a cake.

649
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,000
Miss.

650
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,350
You really have a strong appetite.

651
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,570
It's rare that I don't have to pay

652
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,460
for the stuff in this room.

653
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,550
Of course I need to get myself full.

654
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,090
Why did you use all the cups?

655
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,800
So many questions.

656
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,400
By the way,

657
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
has Li Lianhua dropped by?

658
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,670
It's already midnight.

659
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,770
Why hasn't he come yet?

660
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,679
Fang Duobing.

661
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,830
Tell me the truth.

662
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,980
Did you come to the martial world because

663
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,960
you were scared of someone and you wanted to avoid her?

664
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,780
I've never been scared of anyone.

665
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,429
Maybe you were.

666
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,400
And it was a woman.

667
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,510
A woman?

668
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,389
It's more like two women.

669
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,409
Two?

670
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,860
You were quite occupied, weren't you?

671
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,120
One is my mother,

672
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,429
and the other is my aunt.

673
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:37,929
So tough.

674
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Actually, I didn't mean to

675
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,780
lie about my background.

676
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,290
But you'll know in the future.

677
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,540
You helped me out today.

678
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,469
I'll keep that in mind.

679
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,949
As long as you help me get out of here,

680
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,560
I'll let bygones be bygones.

681
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,050
By the way, tomorrow, you...

682
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,220
Fang Duobing, I was talking to you.

683
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,910
I knew you are unreliable.

684
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,140
It's rare that no one is watching tonight.

685
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,910
I'll just run away by myself.

686
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,370
Why did I suddenly fall asleep?

687
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,180
[Flowing Emotions, Light Dreams]

688
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,530
Gals before pals!

689
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,590
Fang Xiaobao.

690
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,260
Why are you so fussy

691
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,180
early in the morning?

692
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,190
You got a beautiful lady in your arms,

693
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,670
so you forgot about our important moon-viewing date.

694
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,860
Isn't that gals before pals?

695
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,110
I wanted to lie down for a while and go find you later.

696
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,590
But I didn't expect that

697
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,810
I'd fall asleep.

698
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,750
Last night,

699
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,540
I slept in the lobby.

700
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,840
Miss Xifei slept in the bedroom.

701
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,800
You were being paranoid, weren't you?

702
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,320
Come here.

703
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,340
Did you secretly

704
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,870
visit the Girls' Mansion yourself last night?

705
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,450
I... I waited for you all night,

706
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,390
but you didn't show up.

707
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,900
But you know what?

708
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,460
That Yu Louchun is not a good person.

709
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,530
He didn't hire any girls here.

710
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,800
They were abducted.

711
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,690
You can tell?

712
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,300
Think about it.

713
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,350
All these years,

714
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,980
no one knows where the Girls' Mansion is.

715
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,460
If they were hired,

716
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,300
and they could quit freely,

717
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,420
the information would have already leaked long ago.

718
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,540
Yu Louchun

719
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,540
built his residence on the summit of Kanyun Peak.

720
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,850
He doesn't allow outsiders to enter.

721
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,720
He must be afraid that someone would come to seek revenge.

722
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,090
I guess the ice shard is hidden there as well.

723
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,080
Physician Li.

724
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,630
That makes sense.

725
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,370
Young Master Fang, you're here.

726
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,260
You two are going to Guanri Pavilion.

727
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,930
I've prepared a cloak for Physician Li.

728
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,460
Young Master Fang,

729
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,750
didn't Qing'er prepare a cloak for you?

730
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,140
Early in the morning, she...

731
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,700
I didn't wake her up because she was sleeping so soundly.

732
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,840
I'll get one for you, Young Master Fang.

733
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,610
Thank you.

734
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,620
Guanri Pavilion is outside the Girls' Mansion and

735
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,500
by the guards' camp.

736
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,180
It's inconvenient for us girls to accompany you there.

737
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,100
Don't catch a cold on the way, young masters.

738
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,890
Thank you, Miss Xifei.

739
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,450
Let's go.

740
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,780
The red leaves and Fragrant Mountain reflect each other's color.

741
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:29,920
This...

742
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,580
The scenery is beautiful,

743
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,990
and the vibe is even more enjoyable.

744
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,690
You have fond memories of last night, Shi.

745
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,460
Sadly, I slept too soundly last night.

746
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:41,890
Lu.

747
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,550
You love drinking.

748
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,500
Did the wine make you sleep all night till dawn?

749
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,790
Mountains Red goes to your head easily.

750
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,870
Of course I slept soundly since I drank a lot.

751
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,640
Fine.

752
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,870
You are all gentlemen.

753
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,190
You only sleep and enjoy the scenery.

754
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,920
I'll get to know the girls more myself today.

755
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,290
I advise you

756
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,990
not to approach the girls inappropriately.

757
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,700
They were all abducted and imprisoned here.

758
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,070
They are not here willingly.

759
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,980
Didn't they say they paid big money to hire them?

760
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm afraid the big money

761
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,580
has all gone in the pocket of human traffickers.

762
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
But I heard that these girls

763
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,330
earn quite a lot of money here.

764
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,310
I don't think they are mistreated.

765
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,390
Dongfang.

766
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,650
How about I give you 10,000 taels of silver

767
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,900
and sell you to the far north as a prostitute?

768
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,610
Hey, you...

769
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,260
Just wait for Yu Louchun to be here and we can ask him.

770
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,930
If what Young Master Fang said is true,

771
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,620
I won't let him get away with this.

772
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,020
What is that?

773
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,100
Isn't this Yu Louchun's thumb ring?

774
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,260
Could it be...

775
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,550
The blood hasn't coagulated.

776
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,540
It should be cut off not long ago.

777
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,110
Why is Yu Louchun's hand here?

778
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:49,990
Where is he?

779
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,100
Let's go check Yu Louchun's residence

780
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,970
and we'll know.

781
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,720
Where is Yu Louchun?

782
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,930
Of course Master is in his residence on the summit of the mountain.

783
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,980
Send us up.

784
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,560
Outsiders are not allowed to enter Master's residence.

785
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,330
Can your master go down the mountain on his own?

786
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,540
One can only take the rattan basket to go up and down Kanyun Peak.

787
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,200
I didn't see Master get down the mountain,

788
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,410
so of course he's up there.

789
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,340
What brought

790
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,850
you here?

791
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,930
We found that

792
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,560
your master's arm was cut off

793
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,890
and left by Guanri Pavilion.

794
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,490
You recognize this jade thumb ring, don't you?

795
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,390
How is that possible?

796
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,730
If you don't send us up,

797
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
it'll be hard to say

798
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,620
if your master is alive or dead.

799
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,260
Hurry up.

800
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,770
I'll summon the guards outside the courtyard to come in the Girls' Mansion

801
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,640
and send us up the mountain immediately.

802
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,230
I'm Xin Jue. I want to see you, Master.

803
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,240
Pardon me, Master.

804
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,530
Where's his stuff?

805
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,480
Why is it all gone?

806
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,470
What room is this?

807
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,530
This is Master's chamber for treasure storage.

808
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,500
But now it's empty.

809
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,270
Look.

810
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,880
The pattern on this silk cloth

811
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,370
is the same as that on the Yipin Tomb.

812
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,430
The cloth is from Nanying.

813
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,030
Could it be because of the ice shard again?

814
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,200
Or maybe it was for the treasure.

815
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,410
Say it.

816
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,080
Where were you last night?

817
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,440
Every guest was sleeping in their own room last night.

818
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,400
Where could they have been?

819
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,860
Of course we were sleeping and dreaming.

820
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,910
Where were you and the other guards last night, Guard Xin?

821
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,470
The guards couldn't have entered Girls' Mansion

822
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,780
without an order.

823
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,950
I also went to bed outside the courtyard at midnight last night.

824
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,130
The guards can testify.

825
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,020
So there's no suspect?

826
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,050
Young Master Fang.

827
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,020
Why did you come to the foot of Kanyun Peak in a hurry last night?

828
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,500
Your master abducted and imprisoned commoner girls here.

829
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,850
I was here to interrogate him as Baichuan Court's detective, of course.

830
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,570
But you secretly inquired yesterday

831
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,740
if there are treasures up the mountain.

832
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,980
It's not normal, is it?

833
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,150
What about you, Guard Xin?

834
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,110
The first thing you checked was the treasure when you rushed in.

835
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,870
It doesn't seem normal either, does it?

836
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,760
Guard Xin.

837
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,660
A leg of Master's was found outside.

838
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,860
There's a person hidden in the cave of the maple forest.

839
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,580
We've blocked him.

840
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,670
Tell the guards

841
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,540
to secure the suspension bridge.

842
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,400
Yes.

843
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,990
No one is allowed to leave.

844
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,250
If you don't come out, we'll set fire and smoke you out.
