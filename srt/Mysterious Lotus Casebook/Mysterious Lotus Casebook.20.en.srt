[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,960
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,830
Wansheng Clan.

5
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,330
Feng Qing.

6
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,060
Back then, Jiao Liqiao secretly purchased thundering fire bombs.

7
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,500
All the funds came from the Wansheng Clan.

8
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,039
My Lord, your plan is good.

9
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,450
You knew that there must be someone who secretly helps Jiao Liqiao

10
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,620
and let the cat out of the bag.

11
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,539
Besides,

12
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,440
when I was investigating Jiao Liqiao,

13
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,710
I also accidentally found

14
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,810
that Jiao Liqiao has been secretly intercepting the clues about the Styx Flower.

15
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,650
I don't know her intention.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,830
Keep an eye on the Styx Flower.

17
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,360
Jiao Liqiao.

18
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,590
I'll investigate her myself.

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,770
Yes.

20
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,400
What do you mean by the secret letter?

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,060
Your master asked me to seize power in the Jinyuan Alliance?

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,840
Saintess Jiao, why are you so nervous?

23
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,710
My master just wants you to think about it.

24
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,060
Sooner or later,

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,990
Di Feisheng will know what you've done.

26
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,500
By then, if you're in charge of the Jinyuan Alliance,

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,170
it'll benefit both of us.

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,660
Tell me.

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,800
Who is your master?

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,740
Ask him to come out to see me.

31
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,000
My Lord.

32
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,120
I...

33
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,980
My Lord.

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
I don't need people who betray me.

35
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,660
My internal power...

36
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,180
Wuxin Huai.

37
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,180
You put Wuxin Huai into his body?

38
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,740
The medicine can only be used a little.

39
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,180
Otherwise, he'll lose his mind.

40
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,980
When he made an attempt on your life,

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,440
he didn't hesitate at all.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,970
That's a matter between me and him.

43
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,580
If Master hadn't rescued you in time,

44
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,060
you would have died.

45
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,750
Don't flatter yourself.

46
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,920
I've already placed Wuxin Huai in his room.

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,620
He smelled it for days.

48
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,290
In a few days,

49
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,700
he'll definitely be addicted to it.

50
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,380
Or what?

51
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,120
His limbs and internal power

52
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,950
are weak today.

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,740
Otherwise,

54
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,940
you couldn't have harmed him.

55
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,350
In that case,

56
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,020
consider it as a help.

57
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,460
Don't worry.

58
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,020
I know you want to keep him.

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,920
The Wuxin Huai I put into his body can't kill him.

60
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,230
He's just injured.

61
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,940
As for how you're going to explain to the Jinyuan Alliance when you go back,

62
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,220
you can only rely on yourself.

63
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,880
Are you forcing me to turn against My Lord?

64
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,560
It's been ten years.

65
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,390
The way to play the game should be changed.

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,800
Master.

67
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,460
Since he found out about us,

68
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,350
we can't keep him alive.

69
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,330
The dose of the Wuxin Huai

70
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,260
is high enough to ruin his martial art skills.

71
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,020
He's useless.

72
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,159
What's there to worry about?

73
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,270
The effect of the knockout incense is so strong.

74
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Hot steamed buns.

75
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,990
Are they fresh steamed buns?

76
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,350
-Have a look.
-I'll buy them later.

77
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,920
Have one.

78
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,830
I just bad-mouthed Li Xiangyi.

79
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,380
Why are you so angry?

80
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,580
What's there to be angry about?

81
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,750
Is Liu Rujing here?

82
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
Are you looking for Liu Rujing?

83
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,740
Blind Liu quit long ago.

84
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,650
He quit?

85
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,580
Blind Liu?

86
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,360
May I ask

87
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,400
why Liu Rujing went blind?

88
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Ten years ago, one of his eyes was damaged

89
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,030
in the great battle.

90
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,070
His other eye also became useless during these two years.

91
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,070
You kicked him out because he went blind?

92
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,770
You're so heartless.

93
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,230
We didn't kick him out.

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,140
He didn't want to stay here for free.

95
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,570
But he uses dead people to do business now.

96
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,070
The money he makes is much more than the money he made when he was a guard.

97
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,170
What kind of business does he do?

98
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,460
This place is not safe.

99
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,020
There are always people who seek revenge.

100
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,630
They don't care whether or not their enemies are dead.

101
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,160
No one dares to deal with those corpses.

102
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,350
Blind Liu

103
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,180
used to belong to the Sigu Sect.

104
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,260
No one dares to make trouble for him even if he deals with corpses.

105
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,830
If you want to find him,

106
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,060
go to an inn in the suburbs

107
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,510
when you see the moon.

108
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,080
If a ghost lantern is lit,

109
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,680
it means he does business tonight.

110
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,050
You'll see him inside.

111
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,300
Thank you.

112
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,550
Ghost lanterns.

113
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,670
He should be here.

114
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,980
Blind Liu, you harmed me.

115
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,580
Damn you!

116
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,890
You want to sell the person who feigned death

117
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,100
for 100 taels of silver?

118
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,250
Wait and see.

119
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,950
This...

120
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,980
Let go of me!

121
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,340
Let's go.

122
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,460
Di...

123
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,390
Why are you here?

124
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,810
You know me?

125
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,680
Who are you?

126
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,250
Don't you remember us?

127
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,060
Don't you know who you are?

128
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,100
Who am I?

129
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,220
You almost died.

130
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,880
You forgot who you are.

131
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,100
I saved you from the river.

132
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,500
You're the husband I matched to the dead woman,

133
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,920
Yi Cunhong.

134
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm your friend.

135
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,180
I'm your good friend.

136
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,180
Friend?

137
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,480
That's impossible.

138
00:10:59,500 --> 00:10:59,810
This...

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,980
What happened?

140
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,620
I haven't gotten even with you.

141
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,500
Look for Li Lianhua.

142
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,180
His illness is not fatal,

143
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,130
but he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

144
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,590
It's hard to return the final boss's favour.

145
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,390
Are you Liu Rujing?

146
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,980
Tell me.

147
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,560
Who do you want to buy?

148
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,620
Yi Cunhong or Xue Lijian?

149
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,960
Let me make it clear.

150
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,710
Xiao Feidao has been chopped into 18 pieces by others.

151
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,620
I only found three pieces.

152
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,130
But I can give you a discount.

153
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,690
We're not here to buy corpses.

154
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,890
I'm already blind.

155
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
I don't know who killed them.

156
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,350
It's none of my business either.

157
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,420
If you want to look for someone or seek revenge,

158
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,540
don't disturb me when I'm doing business.

159
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,820
We're not here to seek revenge.

160
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,760
We are detectives from the Baichuan Court.

161
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,280
Get lost.

162
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,010
Mr. Liu.

163
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,470
I know you used to work

164
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,660
for Shan Gudao.

165
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,330
We are colleagues.

166
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,510
Colleagues?

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,890
My colleagues have already died.

168
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,210
When I left the Sigu Sect,

169
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,700
I said because the Sigu Sect split,

170
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,580
I'd think of them all as dead people.

171
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,730
In my life,

172
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,500
if anyone dares to mention the Sigu Sect in front of me again,

173
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,500
don't blame me for being rude.

174
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,470
You...

175
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,820
Mr. Liu.

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,220
We can leave.

177
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,960
But this person is still alive.

178
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,750
You can't sell him as a corpse.

179
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,670
You...

180
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,080
That's right.

181
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,450
He's a criminal on the blade list of the Baichuan Court.

182
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
I have to take him back.

183
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,820
So what?

184
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,510
This bastard has lain here for five days.

185
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,060
I failed to sell him.

186
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,460
He also ruined my plan.

187
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,970
Even if I don't sell him as a corpse,

188
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,640
I'll ruin his martial art skills

189
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,920
and let him do everything for me.

190
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,430
This...

191
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,750
He's seriously injured.

192
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,260
If he doesn't be treated soon,

193
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,400
he'll really die.

194
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,060
We'll pay 100 taels of silver.

195
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,160
If you were not from the Baichuan Court,

196
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,080
100 taels of silver would be acceptable.

197
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,650
But you're from the Baichuan Court.

198
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,850
1,000 taels of silver.

199
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
1,000 taels of silver?

200
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,620
Why don't you go and rob people?

201
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,700
Are you going to give it or not?

202
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,400
-No.
-Yes.

203
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,020
Didn't you bring money?

204
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,530
You want to spend 1,000 taels of silver ransoming him?

205
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,600
You know I...

206
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,230
I owe you a favour.

207
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,860
I'll explain to you later.

208
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,100
Ransom him first.

209
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,880
That's all I have.

210
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,850
Move over.

211
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,190
I smell of corpses.

212
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,580
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,420
He was poisoned with a lot of Wuxin Huai.

214
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,680
So?

215
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,840
Isn't it satisfying?

216
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,220
Wait.

217
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,650
Once someone is poisoned with Wuxin Huai,

218
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,330
they can't use their internal power anymore.

219
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,190
It's the top incense which can ruin people's martial art skills.

220
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,050
Why does he still have martial art skills?

221
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,360
Look.

222
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,340
He pierced his Laogong acupuncture point first.

223
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,630
He let his Genuine Qi out

224
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,790
to prevent the Wuxin Huai from going into his internal organs.

225
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,580
Then he used his internal power to reverse his meridians

226
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,300
and forced the Wuxin Huai to go into the Baihui acupuncture point behind his head.

227
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,290
Apart from Di Feisheng,

228
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,810
no one can think of the method.

229
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,700
So,

230
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,940
the reason why he didn't lose his martial art skills

231
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,000
is that the Wuxin Huai went into his Baihui acupuncture point.

232
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,040
He also lost his memory because of it.

233
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,760
Even so,

234
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,980
this is not the reason we should save him.

235
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,650
Because the final boss lost his memory,

236
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
should we forget

237
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,950
his evil deeds?

238
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,190
In my opinion,

239
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,460
we should take him

240
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
to the Baichuan Court

241
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,820
and put him in the 188 prisons immediately.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,720
Actually, I've found the evidence before.

243
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,370
Di Feisheng didn't kill Shan Gudao.

244
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,340
When Shan Gudao died,

245
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,370
there was half a stick of Wuxin Huai beside him.

246
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,910
Di Feisheng was also poisoned with Wuxin Huai.

247
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,800
What a coincidence!

248
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Besides, Di Feisheng's martial art skills are unpredictable.

249
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,250
Who could

250
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,630
plot against him?

251
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,430
You mean there's an internal conflict in the Jinyuan Alliance?

252
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,890
The person who killed your father

253
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,620
used this as bait

254
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,220
to start a battle between the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

255
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,920
The Sigu Sect was damaged.

256
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,250
It didn't benefit the Jinyuan Alliance much either.

257
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,050
In the great battle at the East Sea,

258
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,880
the Jinyuan Alliance suffered a great loss.

259
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,620
Di Feisheng wouldn't do things

260
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
which hurt others and don't benefit himself.

261
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,440
I guess

262
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,340
someone in the Jinyuan Alliance is colluding with outsiders

263
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
in scheming something.

264
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,460
Wuxin Huai and ice shards can prove it.

265
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,880
These people haven't stopped during these ten years.

266
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,350
Why don't we keep him

267
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,490
and find a breakthrough from him?

268
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,170
But he lost his memory.

269
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,060
It seems that he can't provide us

270
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,220
with any clues.

271
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,700
That's temporary.

272
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,630
With the help of his power,

273
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,960
he'll recover gradually.

274
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,710
Di Feisheng is like a good knife.

275
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,190
It'll be a pity if we break him.

276
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm afraid he's a snake.

277
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,700
A frozen snake.

278
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
He'll bite you if he's awake.

279
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,260
Think about it.

280
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,200
If he really wants to kill someone,

281
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,510
he won't stop.

282
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,460
Besides,

283
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,520
he wants to get even with the people who betrayed him

284
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,650
in the Jinyuan Alliance.

285
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,770
What about now?

286
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,270
How are you going to use this broken knife

287
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,700
that always wants to kill people?

288
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,580
Don't worry.

289
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,360
This is the most powerful helper in the world.

290
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,750
When the sun rises tomorrow,

291
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,530
among the twenty people,

292
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
only one of you can walk out of this door.

293
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,940
Why do you let us kill each other again and again?

294
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,730
Because only in this way

295
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,410
can you remember the desire

296
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
to win

297
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,510
and

298
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,560
become the best killers.

299
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,079
Don't listen to him.

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,020
It's useless.

301
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,859
They planted that kind of thing in our bodies.

302
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,010
We will always submit to the family.

303
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,359
We can't escape.

304
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,380
It's inappropriate for you to treat your master like this.

305
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,410
Since you're awake,

306
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,380
take the medicine.

307
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,460
Who are you?

308
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,850
Look at your palm.

309
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,880
You can read your own handwriting, right?

310
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,740
The person you're looking for

311
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,820
is Li Lianhua.

312
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,260
That's me.

313
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,670
Look outside.

314
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,530
[Lotus Tower Medical Center]

315
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,040
You must want to ask

316
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,270
who you are.

317
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Your name is Fei.

318
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,790
You're a spy from the Baichuan Court.

319
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,090
Baichuan Court?

320
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,540
Spy?

321
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,030
Make it clear.

322
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,930
The Baichuan Court is the court of the martial arts world.

323
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,530
It specializes in judging cases in the martial arts world.

324
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,370
Recently,

325
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,730
I've been investigating an old case which happened ten years ago.

326
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,900
So I asked you to infiltrate the enemy as a spy.

327
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,140
I didn't expect you

328
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,900
to be found out and plotted against.

329
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,380
It's my fault.

330
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,600
Then why did you say you are my master?

331
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,880
You used to be an abandoned disciple of the Nanhai Sect.

332
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,070
You were caught

333
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,330
as Iron Head Slave before.

334
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,510
I ransomed you.

335
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,700
You were grateful to me.

336
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,660
So you wanted to repay me.

337
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,140
But I'm not a person who helps people for being repaid.

338
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,020
So I advised you

339
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,130
to work in the Baichuan Court.

340
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,040
You helped the weak, eradicated violence,

341
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,370
and helped me investigate cases.

342
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,460
I helped the weak

343
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,220
and eradicated violence?

344
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
I only remember

345
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,010
I killed people.

346
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,500
You said I saved people.

347
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,910
I won't kill you.

348
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,620
I don't believe you either.

349
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,290
Do you think I'm a fool?

350
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,500
You're not a fool.

351
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
At least you saved one person before.

352
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,700
Who?

353
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,890
Me.

354
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,360
Your pulse is a mess.

355
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,840
You were poisoned.

356
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:30,950
Examine me again.

357
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,430
You have my internal power

358
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,510
in your body.

359
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm dying.

360
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,700
You tried to save me before.

361
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,330
You have my internal power.

362
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,380
But why hasn't your condition improved?

363
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,540
Because I've been poisoned with the deadliest poison.

364
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,780
I'll die for sure.

365
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,590
You cried

366
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,940
and transferred your internal power to my body before.

367
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,050
You tried to cure me at all costs, but you failed.

368
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,510
Now I'm dying.

369
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,780
I'm not lying, right?

370
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,150
Do you believe me now?

371
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,660
It seems that you're really important to me.

372
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,020
Are you really...

373
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,990
Your master.

374
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,980
I don't think I can say these two words.

375
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,360
Never mind.

376
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,740
It doesn't matter.

377
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,290
What matters is

378
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,690
that you want to stay alive and repay me.

379
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,840
If you leave now,

380
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,540
there will be many people who want to kill you.

381
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,010
You don't know them,

382
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,080
but they know you.

383
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,460
Should I be afraid?

384
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,700
You're not afraid of fighting.

385
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,800
But it's not easy to avoid being plotted against.

386
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,290
If you die,

387
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,350
who will pay me back?

388
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,810
Let's count.

389
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,930
When I ransomed you,

390
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,020
I spent 1,000 taels of silver

391
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
and asked you to be a spy.

392
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,130
But you found nothing.

393
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,500
Instead, you were taken to a mortuary.

394
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,340
So

395
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,650
I spent 10,000 taels of silver

396
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,390
and ransomed you from Blind Liu.

397
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,310
If you die,

398
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,840
who will pay me back?

399
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,270
What do you want?

400
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,850
Keep investigating cases for me.

401
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,980
Each case is worth 1,000 taels of silver.

402
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,610
You can leave

403
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,420
when you pay me back.

404
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,780
It's strange.

405
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,670
You're dying.

406
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,790
You should think about how I can save your life.

407
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,120
Many things are more important than being alive.

408
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,810
You just said there are many things that haven't been dealt with.

409
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,660
Why were you poisoned?

410
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,180
Why was I plotted against?

411
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,590
What kind of opponent is the Jinyuan Alliance?

412
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
Why do you have so many questions?

413
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,020
No reason.

414
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,120
When you pay me back,

415
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,340
you'll know everything.

416
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,070
Here.

417
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,530
It's a deal.

418
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,920
You're awake.

419
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,030
Can we eat now?

420
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,260
Even Fox Spirit is hungry.

421
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,700
Who is he?

422
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,220
Your colleague.

423
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,890
Colleague?

424
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,950
Are people from the Baichuan Court so bad at martial arts?

425
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,590
What did you say?

426
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,370
If it weren't for me,

427
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,250
you would still lie in the coffin with Yi Cunhong

428
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,890
who has maggots on her body.

429
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,570
Right.

430
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,940
You caught me off guard

431
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,780
before.

432
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,110
But today,

433
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,460
my Erya Sword is very lonely.

434
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,840
Let's have a battle.

435
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,170
Enough.

436
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,540
I cooked a new dish today.

437
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,140
Let me take you to try it.

438
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,540
-Who did you talk about?
-Stop talking.

439
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,930
This place is not strange to me.

440
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,710
It seems that Li Lianhua is not my enemy.

441
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,610
But he's hiding something.

442
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,310
I'll get the truth out of him sooner or later.

443
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,090
Do they smell good?

444
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,450
Look at you.

445
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,020
I created two new dishes.

446
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,220
Have a taste.

447
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,120
So substantial.

448
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,220
There are four dishes today.

449
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,230
Were all these dishes cooked by you?

450
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,100
No.

451
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,760
This one was bought at the market.

452
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,550
In that case,

453
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,780
you eat first.

454
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,820
You're our guest.

455
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,060
Okay.

456
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,960
How is it?

457
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,870
Here.

458
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,160
Try it.

459
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,810
Try this one.

460
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,980
It tastes terrible.

461
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm not blaming you.

462
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,300
Even the person who has no sense of taste

463
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,500
thinks the dishes you cooked taste terrible.

464
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,980
Wait.

465
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,780
You have a sense of taste?

466
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,990
You two have no sense of taste?

467
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,950
Which one was bought at the market?

468
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,540
It tastes good.

469
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,100
You...

470
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,780
Fine.

471
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Why don't you help me?

472
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,460
I'm not hungry.

473
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,510
Eat as much as you want.

474
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,930
He hasn't grown up yet.

475
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,880
Let me tell you.

476
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,530
He is no match for you now.

477
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,020
But the situation might change

478
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,380
in the future.

479
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,590
You do care about him.

480
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,220
Does he know

481
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,980
you were poisoned?

482
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,100
Only you and I

483
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,360
know it.

484
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,460
I hope

485
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,380
you can keep this secret for me.

486
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,480
I have a feeling.

487
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,280
No matter what you said in the room

488
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,710
is true,

489
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,860
there's a sentence I believe.

490
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,590
You said I want you to be alive. I believe it.

491
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,110
You said you only remember how to kill people.

492
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,350
Did you remember

493
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,710
something which happened in the past?

494
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,940
I can remember where I was when I was a kid.

495
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:21,970
Where did you come from?

496
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,890
Mountains of corpses.

497
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,210
Stop talking about these.

498
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:32,740
Wear it.

499
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,700
Now,

500
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,250
you have too many enemies.

501
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,200
It's safe for you to wear this mask.

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,180
I don't do business during the day.

505
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,410
Get lost if you know it.

506
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,700
Mr. Liu.

507
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,950
You always ask people to get lost.

508
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,800
It's not a good habit.

509
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,350
Why did you come again?

510
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Didn't I give you the person?

511
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,900
Mr. Liu.

512
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,670
We're here to ask you

513
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,960
about the Sigu Sect.

514
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,260
You mentioned the Sigu Sect again.

515
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,510
The Sigu Sect is no longer in existence.

516
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,390
Although you said so,

517
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,260
you still hung a token

518
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,460
of the Sigu Sect on your waist.

519
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,900
Mr. Liu.

520
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,980
Since you still think about the Sigu Sect,

521
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
why are you so hostile

522
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,130
to the Baichuan Court?

523
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,410
Ten years ago,

524
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,350
since the Sigu Sect split,

525
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,060
it has no longer been in existence for me.

526
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,700
When Sect Leader was in trouble,

527
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,870
they all had their own schemes.

528
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
No one protected the sect for Sect Leader.

529
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Baichuan Court, the court of the martial arts world?

530
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,050
In my eyes,

531
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,400
it's nothing.

532
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,700
In the world, it's the trend

533
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,030
that things which separate for a long time will unite

534
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,860
and that things which unite for a long time will separate.

535
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,290
The Sigu Sect was resurrected.

536
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,870
Your old colleagues are all there.

537
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,330
If you want,

538
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
you can go back too.

539
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,620
You don't understand.

540
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,320
There's only one Sigu Sect.

541
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,530
That's Li Xiangyi's Sigu Sect.

542
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,170
Sect Leader is gone.

543
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,380
They threw mud

544
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,500
at Sect Leader.

545
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,690
Xiao Zijin is one of them.

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,670
I won't accept him as the sect leader

547
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,690
unless I die.

548
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,310
They all said it was because Li Xiangyi

549
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,500
wanted to take revenge on the Jinyuan Alliance for Shan Gudao's death

550
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,390
that he was trapped.

551
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,700
But the matter is not that simple.

552
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,240
Why did I tell you these?

553
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,460
Leave now.

554
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,080
Mr. Liu.

555
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,410
Hurry up.

556
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,980
We're here for this matter.

557
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,660
Actually, this young hero

558
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,420
is Sect Leader Li's disciple.

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,080
Shan Gudao is his natural father.

560
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,850
What?

561
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,330
Mr. Liu.

562
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,210
Here.

563
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,850
Feel it.

564
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,660
This is my father's token.

565
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

566
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,140
You didn't give me a chance to say it.

567
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,690
Mr. Liu.

568
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,700
You said there's something wrong with my father's death.

569
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,830
Before he died,

570
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,390
did you notice anything unusual?

571
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,910
Or did he offend anyone?

572
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,390
Follow me.

573
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,600
[Jin Banshan]

574
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,650
What is this?

575
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,720
Before Second Sect Leader died,

576
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,800
I found

577
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,060
Xiao Tianhu, who was one of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

578
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
was gathering information.

579
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,660
But back then,

580
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,460
it was I who was in charge of collecting information

581
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,090
in the martial arts world.

582
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,980
I found he did it behind my back.

583
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,860
I was worried that he betrayed the Sigu Sect.

584
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,410
So I followed him several times.

585
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,060
But in the end,

586
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,690
I found it was Second Sect Leader

587
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,790
who ordered Four Tigers with Silver Spears to do it together.

588
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,940
To be honest,

589
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,660
I was a little unhappy.

590
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,130
I thought Second Sect Leader

591
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,780
didn't count me as one of them.

592
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,010
But that night,

593
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,230
he called me

594
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,440
and told me a secret.

595
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,340
What secret did he tell you?

596
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,210
He said he was worried

597
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,140
that the Jinyuan Alliance secretly supported Nanyin's plan to resurrect the country

598
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,660
and harmed Central Plains.

599
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,420
Didn't Nanyin

600
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,180
disappear a couple of hundred years ago?

601
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,780
I had the same reaction.

602
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,460
But Second Sect Leader told me

603
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,230
that

604
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,890
it has always been the Nanyin people's ambition to resurrect their country.

605
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,010
In the past few centuries,

606
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,540
they've successively

607
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,860
sent many people to Central Plains.

608
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,350
The most important people

609
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
are these four people.

610
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,460
These four rich Nanyin merchants

611
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,460
brought countless treasures and four magic weapons

612
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,180
from Nanyin.

613
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,630
It's said that there is one weapon that can destroy the world.

614
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,190
But somehow something went wrong.

615
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,300
These four people didn't take action.

616
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,950
They stayed in Central Plains instead.

617
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,450
Their descendants who are still alive are the third generation.

618
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,880
Liu Rujing.

619
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,340
I want to stop them.

620
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,550
For some unknown reason,

621
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,420
Second Sect Leader found they were colluding with the Jinyuan Alliance.

622
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,160
They were ready to do something.

623
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,300
So he wanted to use this opportunity

624
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,180
to find the descendants of these four people.

625
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,260
Unfortunately,

626
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,380
he only found the Nanyin names

627
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,820
of the four rich merchants.

628
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,150
He couldn't find the third generation of their descendants.

629
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,860
I think

630
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,670
it was because Second Sect Leader

631
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,740
alerted the Jinyuan Alliance

632
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,900
when he was looking for these four people

633
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,740
that he was killed.

634
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,060
Why are you looking at me?

635
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,170
I also went undercover and investigated it.

636
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,660
You mean

637
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,370
that what Deputy Sect Leader Shan showed you

638
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,930
was one of the four names?

639
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,060
Yes.

640
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,260
After he wrote it down and showed it to me,

641
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,900
I burnt it.

642
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
I wanted to help him.

643
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,320
So I wrote it down from memory.

644
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,900
Unfortunately,

645
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,380
I only remember one of them.

646
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,730
Do you still remember

647
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,060
Deputy Sect Leader Shan asked you to go to the Yipin Tomb?

648
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,600
How did you know?

649
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,160
Because the one buried in the Yipin Tomb

650
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,460
was the last princess of Nanyin who was sent here to get married.

651
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,130
There was Bagua Formation outside the Yipin Tomb.

652
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,000
Even if he knew the general location,

653
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,540
Second Sect Leader failed to enter the Yipin Tomb.

654
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,040
Then he died.

655
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,650
No wonder.

656
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,010
Fang Xiaobao.

657
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,180
Do you still remember the box

658
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,900
lost in the Yipin Tomb?

659
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,610
Yes.

660
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,500
What's wrong?

661
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,010
Now that I think about it,

662
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,260
that box is the secret treasure

663
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,130
which the descendants of Nanyin are trying to find.

664
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,920
It can overthrow the martial arts world and the court.

665
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,640
Weeping Guanyin was just the bait

666
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,440
which was used to attract Di Feisheng

667
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,790
to open the Yipin Tomb.

668
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,010
Their ultimate aim

669
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,920
is the secret treasure in the box.

670
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,170
It's been seven days.

671
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,490
Didn't you find the whereabouts of Director?

672
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,330
No.

673
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,430
Don't worry.

674
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Director is capable.

675
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,200
That bit of Wuxin Huai can't hurt him.

676
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,420
Maybe he is being treated somewhere.

677
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,460
It's not his style.

678
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,130
If he was really fine,

679
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,130
he would definitely come back.

680
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,700
Saintess.

681
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,060
Some old followers of Director

682
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,000
gathered in the sanctuary.

683
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,360
They complained

684
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,550
about Director's disappearance.

685
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,890
It seems

686
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,750
that they're going to accuse you again.

687
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,580
Give the order.

688
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,740
Lock all the old followers of Director up.

689
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,470
If there are people who disobey,

690
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,830
kill them.

691
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,770
I just don't want to hurt Director.

692
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,750
I won't show mercy

693
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,150
to those old men.

694
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,370
Yes.

695
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,980
The next piece of Heavenly Ice...

696
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,280
We can't miss it.

697
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,040
Everything I do is for him.

698
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,790
If he wants to be the director of the martial arts world,

699
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,590
I'll help him become the director of the martial arts world.

700
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,900
If he wants to be the number one in the martial arts world,

701
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,200
I'll help him become the number one in the martial arts world.

702
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,800
If he doesn't want them,

703
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,060
I'll become the number one in the world

704
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,880
and make him the husband of the woman who's the number one in the world.

705
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,310
When you get four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice,

706
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,260
open the Rama Vessel,

707
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,080
and get that thing,

708
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,960
the whole world will be in your hands,

709
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,210
not to mention

710
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,330
Di Feisheng.

711
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,740
Sect Leader.

712
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,900
Do you believe what Li Xiangyi said?

713
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,540
He won't come back to the Sigu Sect?

714
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,680
He used to live a great life.

715
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,850
He also had a beauty beside him before.

716
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,500
I don't believe he can let go of the past.

717
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,160
Whether he wants it or not,

718
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,310
I can't give him a chance.

719
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Then

720
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,610
what should we do?

721
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,390
Go and spread the news

722
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,040
secretly.

723
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,740
When Li Xiangyi was the sect leader,

724
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,140
he offended many people.

725
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,810
After he died,

726
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,480
people in the martial arts world forgot it.

727
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,000
I should remind them

728
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,940
what kind of person Li Xiangyi is.

729
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,219
[Jin Banshan]

730
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,170
Nanyin script is hard to read.

731
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,940
Even if you eat the words,

732
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,610
you still can't understand.

733
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,449
Script has its origin.

734
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,820
Maybe I'll be enlightened after I copy them a few more times.

735
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,460
Forget it.

736
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,489
Since you've cooked, let's eat first.

737
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,460
When did I cook?

738
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,580
Isn't it the smell of food?

739
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,980
Mr. Li.

740
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,150
I've also learnt

741
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,010
the dishes you created.

742
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,280
Check if I learnt them correctly.

743
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,929
Why are you here?

744
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,219
I want to learn cooking from Mr. Li.

745
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,200
Is it strange?

746
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,230
It's not strange to learn cooking.

747
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,930
It's strange to learn cooking

748
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,980
from Li Lianhua.

749
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,650
The wound on your face almost healed.

750
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,750
That's great.

751
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,870
My sworn brother's Green Jade Beauty Cream

752
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,840
is the best in the world.

753
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,060
I won't

754
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,870
have a scar.

755
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,810
Mr. Li.

756
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,930
You don't admit it,

757
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,730
but you still care about me.

758
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,340
Don't think too much.

759
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,340
If Fox Spirit broke its leg,

760
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,400
he would care about it too.

761
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,010
My sworn brother is busy these days.

762
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,360
I'll stay in the Lotus Tower for a few more days

763
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,590
and learn cooking from you.

764
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,730
These days,

765
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,830
we've been investigating something urgent.

766
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,690
I'm afraid we can't entertain you.

767
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,320
You're investigating Nanyin names.

768
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,730
You know it?

769
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,730
He copied the words onto the table for so long.

770
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,910
I happened to read them.

771
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,760
I knew it then.

772
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
What's the name?

773
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,220
You don't allow me to live here.

774
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,560
But you want me to answer your questions.

775
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,660
It depends on my mood.

776
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,120
I...

777
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,730
Who is it?

778
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,740
Don't be afraid, Miss Su.

779
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,350
This is Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

780
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,380
He's not only my servant

781
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,740
but also my underling.

782
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,460
He only eats rice.

783
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,230
Why is he wearing a mask?

784
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
He has a bad temper.

785
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,450
So he wears a mask to hide his anger.

786
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,060
Miss Su.

787
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,140
How about this?

788
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,060
If you help me read Nanyin script,

789
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,460
you can live in the Lotus Tower

790
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,470
from now on.

791
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,690
Really?

792
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,140
You can't go back on your word.

793
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,020
I won't.

794
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,990
I'm the granddaughter of the All-Knowing.

795
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,650
Because you've been investigating things

796
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,750
about Nanyin,

797
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,990
I learnt a little from my grandfather.

798
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,570
Although I learnt it in a short time,

799
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,900
it's not hard for me

800
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:40,880
to read a name.

801
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,500
What's this person's name?

802
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,850
Jin Banshan.

803
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,180
His surname is Jin?

804
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,260
Yuanbao Villa?

805
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,240
[Banshan Residence]

806
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,460
I never knew

807
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,050
there is a garden here.

808
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,690
The Nanyin people worship grass and trees.

809
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,230
This garden should be its ancestral shrine.

810
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,230
This is the spirit tablet of Jin Banshan.

811
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,870
This should be Jin Banshan's memorial tablet.

812
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,090
He's Jin Mantang's grandfather.

813
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,460
The names inscribed onto the other memorial tablets

814
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,730
should be the names

815
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,780
of the Jin family's ancestors.

816
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,730
Whether it's ten years ago or ten years later,

817
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,730
everything is connected with Nanyin.

818
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,030
The secret treasure which Blind Liu mentioned

819
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,980
and which can destroy the world

820
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,680
should be the reason.

821
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,670
Then where should we start the investigation of the secret treasure?

822
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,730
Look over there.

823
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,090
This is Suiyan, the fiend of Nanyin.

824
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,800
The one he holds in his left hand should be Wuxin Huai.

825
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,380
Asura Grass is in his right hand.

826
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,310
What is on his head?

827
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,320
Burn your body.

828
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,380
Release your soul.

829
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,170
Offer sacrifices to Suiyan.

830
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,420
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

831
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,780
Burn your soul.

832
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,660
Isn't it the sentence on the ice shard of Jin Mantang?

833
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,940
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

834
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,730
The secret treasure which can destroy the world.

835
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,500
That means

836
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,740
the fire on the head of the fiend

837
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,300
might be the top of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

838
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,980
searing karmic fire.

839
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,710
Searing karmic fire?

840
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,460
That's the king of Gu

841
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,760
and the head of sorcery.

842
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,210
Back then, it was because the ancestors of the Nanyin people

843
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,740
got the searing karmic fire

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,810
that they gathered

845
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,170
tens of millions of evil soldiers to wipe out the southwest seven states

846
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,070
and established Nanyin.

847
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,520
Is it a legend?

848
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,460
That's impossible.

849
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
My grandfather

850
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,190
never writes things without evidence down.

851
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,820
Let me think.

852
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,020
Searing karmic fire.

853
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,550
My grandfather descirbed it

854
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,320
as not only the sorcery which didn't belong to mortals

855
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,750
but also the root of all evil.

856
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,780
This thing is quite evil.

857
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,400
But in the past hundred years,

858
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,840
no one has mentioned it.

859
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,530
I thought they had already disappeared.

860
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,180
The Nanyin people respect grass and trees.

861
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,800
The searing karmic fire is being held at the top.

862
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
There's "fire" in its name.

863
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,740
Fire burns grass and trees.

864
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,490
I guess the Nanyin people not only respect it but also fear it.

865
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,370
The vessel with the searing karmic fire in it

866
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,820
should be the Rama Vessel.

867
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,810
Why does the vessel have such a strange name?

868
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,060
This should be right.

869
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
The Rama Vessel was made in the Blood Realm Tianqiao Palace a few hundred years ago.

870
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,220
It has mechanisms in it, so it is extremely hard to open.

871
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,940
Only by using four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice as a key

872
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,060
can it be opened.

873
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,330
My aunt said

874
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,080
Jin Mantang's ice shard

875
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,410
is a kind of key.

876
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,230
Could the ice shard be the Rama Heavenly Ice?

877
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,740
So the reason why those people

878
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,820
want to collect four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice

879
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,270
is that they want to open the Rama Vessel.

880
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,370
There were four Nanyin people

881
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,920
who came to Central Plains.

882
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,430
Each of them had one piece.

883
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,100
It seems that if we find the remaining three descendants

884
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,950
and the other three ice shards,

885
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,570
we can find the person

886
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,310
who's hidden in the dark.

887
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
If the searing karmic fire

888
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,820
is really scary,

889
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,590
we must inform the Baichuan Court immediately.

890
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,250
No.

891
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,980
Why?

892
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,420
Think about it.

893
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,940
Yipin Tomb and Yuanbao Villa.

894
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,780
Every time when we sent the messages

895
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,180
to the Baichuan Court before,

896
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,710
we would be attacked.

897
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,830
You suspect

898
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,060
there's a spy in the Baichuan Court?

899
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,860
Yes.

900
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,920
So we have to look for the remaining three people

901
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,740
ourselves.

902
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,110
But there're three people.

903
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,700
We only know one name.

904
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,470
How can we investigate the rest?

905
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,400
Miss Zhiyu.

906
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,980
Does Jin Mantang

907
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,810
have any friends who he meets regularly?

908
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,660
Not many.

909
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,060
But he goes out for a few days every fall.

910
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,530
He said he went out for a feast.

911
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,830
Feasts in fall?

912
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,620
Could it be Mountains Red?

913
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,720
"Mountains Red" was written on the invitations.

914
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,330
What is Mountains Red?

915
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,940
Aren't you the granddaughter of the All-Knowing?

916
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,060
You don't even know Mountains Red?

917
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,670
No one knows play

918
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,490
better than you.

919
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,580
-Right?
-Of course.

920
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,030
Let me increase your knowledge.

921
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,010
Every year when the color of maple leaves becomes red,

922
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,590
Yu Louchun

923
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,500
invites six strange people to the banquet.

924
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,800
This is called "Mountains Red".

925
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,280
Coincidentally,

926
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,490
Yu Louchun is also fabulously rich.

927
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,300
He doesn't go out of his house

928
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,140
and lives in seclusion.

929
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,750
He's very similar to Jin Mantang.

930
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,090
Since we're suspicious of Yu Louchun the most,

931
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,300
why don't we

932
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,450
go and see him?

933
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,460
Yu Louchun is not a person

934
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,880
who you can see when you want to.

935
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,940
Although

936
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,570
he holds Mountains Red every year,

937
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,660
so far,

938
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,340
no one knows

939
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,840
where he lives.

940
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,140
Only guests who are invited

941
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,290
can see him.

942
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,960
I wonder if he needs a doctor.

943
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,850
He didn't say he's sick.

944
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,970
Let me put it this way.

945
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,830
If you want to see him,

946
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,190
you must become the most famous strange people

947
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,290
in the martial arts world this year.

948
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,650
If you want to be invited, you have to be strange.

949
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,560
We have to be trange enough?

950
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,650
Among us,

951
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
isn't Fei

952
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,460
the strangest person?

953
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,540
How about we ask him to perform on the street

954
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,970
to attract Yu Louchun?

955
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,070
Don't bother.

956
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,550
Just kill them all.

957
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,150
Don't be afraid.

958
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,620
He likes to talk nonsense.

959
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,680
It seems that if we want to see Yu Louchun,

960
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,070
I have to take matters into my own hands.

961
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,430
Are you here

962
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,490
for the rumors in the martial arts world

963
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,800
which have a negative effect on the Sigu Sect?

964
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,820
Yes.

965
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,830
I wonder who spread the rumor

966
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,710
that Second Sect Leader Shan died because of Sect Leader Li.

967
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,760
The nonsense

968
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,490
is slanderous.

969
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,160
Actually,

970
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,740
I've heard a little about it.

971
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,460
The Baichuan Court sent me here today

972
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,730
to discuss this with you.

973
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,000
What are you going to do?

974
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,190
I've decided

975
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,050
to hold the Sigu Tea Party.

976
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,830
The first aim is to invite our friends in the martial arts world

977
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,300
and let the former subordinates come back.

978
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,840
The second aim is to quash the rumor

979
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,200
and ask everyone to be united.

980
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,690
The Sigu Tea Party is Sect Leader Li's private tea party.

981
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,540
Who are you to hold it?

982
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,340
The word "Sigu" in the "Sigu Tea Party"

983
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,250
refers to the Sigu Sect, not Li Xiangyi.

984
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,270
And now,

985
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm the sect leader of the Sigu Sect.

986
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,170
Can't you just quash it in person?

987
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,800
Why do you want to invite so many people to talk about it?

988
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,960
Rumors are like water.

989
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
It's better to give them rational explanation than stop the spread.

990
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,100
If Sect Leader Li knows his tea party is used to solve the crisis of the Sigu Sect,

991
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,460
he'll be happy.

992
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,030
Wanmian.

993
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,620
I wanted to give you a surprise.

994
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,890
I didn't expect you to find it in advance.

995
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,460
All the flowers in the garden

996
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:49,710
were chosen by me.

997
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,480
Do you like them?

998
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,150
Zijin.

999
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,490
Did you hear the rumors

1000
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,800
about Li Xiangyi?

1001
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,730
They're just rumors.

1002
00:43:59,340 --> 00:43:59,920
But

1003
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,300
you always

1004
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,100
care about him.

1005
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,190
I've investigated.

1006
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,020
Those rumors were spread on purpose.
