[Episode 23]

4
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,720
Come out or we'll set the cave on fire!

5
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,490
Set the fire.

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Hold on.

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,910
Hold on.

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,650
Miss Qing'er?

9
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,220
Where is Master?

10
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Yu Louchun?

11
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,120
How would I know?

12
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,370
You're his guard.

13
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,440
You stole treasures from Master Yu's room.

14
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,380
Where did you hide them?

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
What do you mean?

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
You're confusing me.

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,070
You sneaked out to hide in a cave.

18
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,870
So stop playing dumb.

19
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,260
I came out for a walk and got lost.

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,650
I didn't steal anything.

21
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,500
A walk?

22
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,110
You're dressed as a man.

23
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,290
You didn't need to disguise yourself for a walk.

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,360
That's right.

25
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,730
Mr. Fang asked me to dress like this.

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,480
Mr. Fang?

27
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,590
She left with you last night

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,250
and you asked her to dress like a man today?

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,840
Miss Qing'er.

30
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,640
Yu Louchun is perhaps dead.

31
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,140
No one can threaten you now.

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,140
You can be honest with us.

33
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,140
Yu Louchun got finished off?

34
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,610
That's great!

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,860
Then I'll be frank.

36
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,270
I dressed like a man to escape from the Girls' Mansion at night.

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,180
There were too many guards at the gate

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,950
so I decided to hide here for now.

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,260
I didn't steal anything.

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,520
You did away with Yu Louchun?

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:34,910
I…

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,290
You're quite something.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,190
This is no time for jokes.

44
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,210
You two seem familiar.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,350
Didn't you just meet yesterday?

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
We hit it off. So what?

47
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,100
Aren't you looking for the suspect?

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:53,970
Well,

49
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,780
Yu Louchun's arm and leg

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,329
were cut off by an edged weapon.

51
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,170
After we entered the Girls' Mansion,

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,050
all our edged weapons were taken away.

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,860
So the prime suspect

54
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,520
is no one else but you, Guard Xin.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,830
My sword has the shape of a pine needle.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,850
It's very narrow

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,630
and can only be used for piercing.

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,600
It would've been broken if I had used it to chop up the body.

59
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,000
How could it be me?

60
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,420
Look.

61
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,660
There are body parts.

62
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,659
He…

63
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,540
He…

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,400
Isn't he the head guard who brought us here yesterday?

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
He got chopped into so many pieces.

66
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,220
It's brutal.

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,409
Brutal!

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,800
Things are complicated now.

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,390
His machete is not in its sheath

70
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,500
and his body is near your hiding spot.

71
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,260
You must've snatched his machete and killed him!

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,680
I just happened to be hiding here.

73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,890
I didn't kill him.

74
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,740
It's fine that you wouldn't confess.

75
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,570
After I pull your fingernails out one by one,

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,020
you'll tell us everything.

77
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,340
How dare you!

78
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,960
Do you know who I am?

79
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm the princess.

80
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,240
If you trifle with me,

81
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
I'll wipe out your whole family!

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,750
Princess?

83
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't care even if you're the dowager empress.

84
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,300
Guard Xin, are you going to

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,520
torture her into confessing in front of a detective of the Baichuan Court?

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,180
Help me.

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,350
I'll reward you generously.

88
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,659
You don't need to come up with such a ridiculous lie

89
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,380
to get my help.

90
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:33,900
I…

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,510
You keep covering for her.

92
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,510
Are you afraid I'll get something out of her?

93
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm not covering for her.

94
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,610
She doesn't know martial arts.

95
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,150
Even if you gave her a sword,

96
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,320
how could she kill Yu Louchun?

97
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,720
She couldn't but you could.

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,180
You two slept in the same room last night

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,330
and you're so protective of her now.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,100
Maybe you're her accomplice!

101
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,730
Wait.

102
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm curious about something.

103
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,210
If they conspired together,

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,400
how did they get up the Kanyun Peak?

105
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,350
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,350
This wheel is so heavy.

107
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,050
Did they fly up there with the flying skill?

108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,340
Is there anyone in this world

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,220
with such excellent flying skill?

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,100
Fei?

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,060
There you are.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,550
Su Xiaoyong is too noisy.

113
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,910
I'm afraid I can't help killing her.

114
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,210
I prefer to stay with you.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,710
How did you get up here?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,480
Flying skill.

117
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,780
I searched peak after peak.

118
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,960
It took me some effort

119
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,070
but the singing arrow just now helped a lot.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,290
Perfect timing.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,080
Li Lianhua.

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,460
You just said

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,270
that no one has such excellent flying skill in the world.

124
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,770
This place is thousands of feet high.

125
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,590
He can get to the Girls' Mansion

126
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,300
and can definitely go up the Kanyun Peak.

127
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,230
You guys killed them!

128
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,920
It's just a misunderstanding.

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me introduce him.

130
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
He's Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

131
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,980
He's my servant.

132
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,940
He's got great flying skill,

133
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,190
but he's a weird guy

134
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,650
and never picks up fights.

135
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,630
Yeah.

136
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,510
This guy called Fei can fly wherever he wants.

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,070
He didn't need to snatch the head guard's machete to kill him.

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
He could bring one up here.

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,570
Miss Qing'er.

140
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,000
You're not helping.

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,840
What's on Fei's back?

142
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,250
My machete.

143
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
A big machete it is.

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,490
His machete is a bit special.

145
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,970
It's made of special material.

146
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,210
The cut it leaves is very different from those on the severed limbs.

147
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,980
Fei.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,730
Wield your machete.

149
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,990
No.

150
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,810
Just wield it once.

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll make dinner for you tonight.

152
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,750
Your cooking sucks.

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,820
What makes you think you can bribe me with that?

154
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,730
Forget it, Li Lianhua.

155
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,530
Your servant won't do it.

156
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,190
You don't know that.

157
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,880
Come closer.

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,940
Sure.

159
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,890
He agreed?

160
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,900
What did you say?

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,350
One secret for three favors.

162
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,830
I…

163
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,830
Young Master Shi.

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
You're an expert from the Weapon Valley.

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,130
Why don't you check the cut on the trunk?

166
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
Fei's machete is double-edged.

167
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,980
The cut is indeed different

168
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,059
from those on Yu Louchun.

169
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,940
He's so powerful.

170
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,080
Who did he train under?

171
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,480
I've never seen such swordsmanship.

172
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,940
That doesn't matter.

173
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,180
What matters is that Fei is not a suspect.

174
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,620
Right?

175
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,360
Then who is it?

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,930
Do we have no clues at all?

177
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,900
The clue has been there all the time.

178
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,740
The body was put back together.

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,810
Look.

180
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,590
That seems to be a hash mark.

181
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,290
Why are you shaking?

182
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,220
I think of a rumor.

183
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,290
Rumor?

184
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,920
A swordsman once died violently in the Fragrant Mountain

185
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,690
and turned into a vengeful ghost,

186
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,700
killing people in the Fragrant Mountain all day long.

187
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,680
He was called the Machete Ghost.

188
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,480
This is his Hash Slash.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,360
The Machete Ghost was a real person.

190
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,170
He was good with a machete

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,520
but went missing seven years ago.

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,240
Look at the cuts on the head guard.

193
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,720
They're rough but were indeed left

194
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,950
by the Hash Slash which made the Machete Ghost

195
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,060
famous.

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Were Yu Louchun's limbs

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,260
cut off by the Hash Slash too?

198
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,560
Then I'm afraid he's already dead.

199
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,170
He just lost one arm and one leg.

200
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,150
Master still stands a chance of living.

201
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,870
He's dead.

202
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,710
What did you say?

203
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,970
Follow me.

204
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,440
It's Yu Louchun's torso.

205
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,720
He really died.

206
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,080
Putting these body parts together,

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,270
we don't need to find the rest of his body

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,850
to recognize the Hash Slash.

209
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,360
[Kill the evil and send them back to hell.]

210
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,300
The Machete Ghost! It's the Machete Ghost!

211
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,190
Kill the evil

212
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,360
and send them back to hell.

213
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,960
Do ghosts really exist?

214
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,280
The guy was killed,

215
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,700
but not necessarily by a ghost.

216
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,320
What do you mean?

217
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,640
Don't they sell weapons in the underworld?

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
Fei means

219
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,530
if the murderer were a ghost,

220
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,840
why did he snatch a sword before the killings?

221
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,680
So the Machete Ghost can only be a human.

222
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,260
Mr. Fang and Physician Li solved many tricky cases.

223
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,220
In your opinion,

224
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,000
what should we do now?

225
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,480
The drawbridge of the Girls' Mansion hasn't been set down.

226
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
Few people's flying skill

227
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,460
is as great as Fei's.

228
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,420
So the suspect must be among us.

229
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,460
First,

230
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,070
let's narrow it down.

231
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,800
The girls in the Girls' Mansion seem the least suspicious.

232
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,990
Why?

233
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,890
Yu Louchun's arm

234
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
was found in the Guanri Pavilion.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,350
The Guanri Pavilion is outside the Girls' Mansion.

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,750
The girls are banned from going out

237
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
so they couldn't put the arm there.

238
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,030
That's why they're the least suspicious.

239
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,690
Next, let's turn our focus

240
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,630
to Guard Xin and the other guards.

241
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Before you came here,

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
everything was fine.

243
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,280
The murderer must be among the guests.

244
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,750
May I say something?

245
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,020
The head guard was not allowed in the Girls' Mansion

246
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,360
but died in the Girls' Mansion.

247
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,240
Guard Xin.

248
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't you find that worth investigating?

249
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,980
The head guard was a peeper.

250
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,980
He sneaked in every year during Mountains Red

251
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,330
to spy on the guests and girls at night.

252
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,800
He never hurt anybody

253
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,600
so I just let him be.

254
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,160
Are you satisfied with my answer?

255
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,930
Yes, yes.

256
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,220
That means

257
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,390
as long as Guard Xin turns a blind eye,

258
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,900
those guards

259
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,900
can enter the Girls' Mansion freely, right?

260
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,210
Yes.

261
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,570
Here is my second question.

262
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,670
The wheel at the foot of the Kanyun Peak

263
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,230
is so heavy that Guard Xin

264
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,610
is the only one in the Girls' Mansion who can spin it

265
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,500
without anyone's help, right?

266
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,540
Yes.

267
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,010
Good.

268
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,860
The murderer needed to spin the wheel

269
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,250
and got up the peak in the cane basket for the killings.

270
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,320
It's almost impossible

271
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,980
to do those two things at the same time.

272
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,240
So the murderer had an accomplice.

273
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,550
Other than you two,

274
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,050
are there other guests who are acquaintances?

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,620
We don't know that.

276
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,120
What I want to say

277
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,500
is that we can't know

278
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,810
who may know whom personally.

279
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,050
Maybe

280
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,820
one of the guards

281
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,240
knows one of the guests.

282
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,400
The guards would in no way kill Master.

283
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Why?

284
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,680
Guard Xin.

285
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,530
You've been acting weird.

286
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,830
So have the other guards.

287
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,780
You seem to care more about the treasures

288
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,110
than Yu Louchun.

289
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,420
If you can't prove yourself innocent,

290
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,610
you'll be in a dangerous situation.

291
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,240
I and all the other guards in the Girls' Mansion

292
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,770
would never kill Yu Louchun

293
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,910
because he poisoned us all

294
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,850
with the Loyal Potion.

295
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,740
We must take the antidote every month

296
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,810
or our entrails will melt into blood

297
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,580
and we'll die in excruciating pain.

298
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,610
The antidote is hidden in the secret room.

299
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,700
The day we should take the antidote this month

300
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,180
is tomorrow.

301
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
So if you can't get the antidote by tomorrow,

302
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,610
you'll die?

303
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,600
Yes.

304
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
I beg you to save us.

305
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,830
Otherwise,

306
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,110
the guards may be driven mad

307
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,000
by the unbearable pain before they die

308
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,090
and hurt you guys.

309
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,790
Are you begging them or threatening them?

310
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,440
Guard Xin.

311
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,510
Get up.

312
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,940
I'm a detective of the Baichuan Court.

313
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,500
We'll find out

314
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,010
whether you're innocent or not.

315
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,750
I'll find it out with you.

316
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,190
Fang Duobing.

317
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,920
We can use

318
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,930
Miss Qing'er's help.

319
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,780
She's familiar with this place.

320
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,640
From now on,

321
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,480
except for Physician Li and Mr. Fang,

322
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,010
no one is allowed to leave the Girls' Mansion

323
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,790
until the murderer is found.

324
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,850
Don't blame me for being rude if you violate it.

325
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,910
How did the murderer get up the Kanyun Peak?

326
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,490
Fei can fly.

327
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,930
Maybe the murderer flew up there.

328
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,770
Few people can be as good at the flying skill

329
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,560
as Fei.

330
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,490
By the way, where is Fei?

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,400
Fei doesn't care about all this

332
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,840
and is probably sleeping.

333
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,330
Maybe the murderer climbed up the rope.

334
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,830
This rope has oil on it

335
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,490
and is very slippery.

336
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,060
Climbing it

337
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,420
is even harder than flying.

338
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,810
I got it.

339
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,280
This is how the murderer went up the peak.

340
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,370
Vine?

341
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,430
It's burnt.

342
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,050
Tie a slipknot with the vine

343
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,580
and hang it under the cane basket.

344
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,130
When the cane basket reached the peak,

345
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,080
the knot was untied by the hook at the foot of the mountain

346
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,890
and the vine was put down.

347
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,940
The murderer went up and down through the vine

348
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,410
and then burned it

349
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,400
to wipe all the traces.

350
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,620
With the vine,

351
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,690
he wouldn't need anyone's help

352
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,840
to go up and down the Kanyun Peak.

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,210
But it's conspicuous

354
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
to hang a vine under the basket.

355
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,160
Why didn't Xin Jue notice it?

356
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,880
Unless he's the one who did it.

357
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,370
He's the Machete Ghost.

358
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,060
But Xin Jue uses a sword.

359
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,650
Who says the Machete Ghost can't use a sword?

360
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,260
I have another question.

361
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,140
Why did he dump the body parts in plain sight?

362
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,860
To become a hero and set an example.

363
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,570
The Machete Ghost is rumored

364
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,850
to be a ghost hero.

365
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,020
That guard said

366
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,300
the Machete Ghost killed innocent people.

367
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,540
Why is he a hero?

368
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,530
Those guards are afraid of him,

369
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,120
but the girls in the Girls' Mansion

370
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,580
all look forward to his coming.

371
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,060
Why?

372
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,560
It's said that many years ago,

373
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,099
the Machete Ghost's wife was abducted here.

374
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,290
He came to find her but got killed.

375
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,890
Then

376
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,680
something very unusual happened.

377
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,060
Tell us.

378
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,890
The mountain god appeared.

379
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,220
He pitied the Machete Ghost

380
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,589
and used his magic

381
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,400
to turn the Machete Ghost into a real ghost

382
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,300
who has been upholding justice since then.

383
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,520
I see.

384
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,800
Miss Qing'er.

385
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,800
Save your bedtime story for another day.

386
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,150
What we're looking for now

387
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,350
is the Machete Ghost in the real world.

388
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,090
The Machete Ghost is in the real world.

389
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,660
His wife Luo Hongyan

390
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,260
was once cooped up in the Girls' Mansion.

391
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,960
Miss Qing'er.

392
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,760
Did you know her?

393
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,170
No.

394
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,310
I arrived here too late.

395
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,740
She died a few years ago.

396
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,250
Then how did you know about her?

397
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,430
The ledger.

398
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,220
Yu Louchun recorded all his incomes

399
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,930
and expenses these years on his ledger.

400
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,430
Luo Hongyan's name is on it.

401
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,810
So, Miss Qing'er,

402
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,210
do you have the ledger?

403
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,980
Of course.

404
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,500
I have it.

405
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,060
I planned to use it to kill Yu Louchun,

406
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,930
but someone did it before I could.

407
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,660
Then show it to us.

408
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,760
Now you think I'm useful?

409
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,960
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,730
Miss Qing'er, you're so smart.

411
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,500
It was a brilliant idea to steal the ledger.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm so impressed.

413
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,040
Come with me.

414
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,650
[Qunfang House]

415
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,190
What is this place?

416
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,480
This is where the girls live.

417
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,160
I've forgotten that it's the laundry day.

418
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,970
Wait for me here.

419
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,750
I'll be right back.

420
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,090
Here is the ledger.

421
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,270
Why does it stink?

422
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,030
Yu Louchun hit the ceiling after his ledger was lost.

423
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,130
I had to hide it.

424
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,940
Where did you hide it?

425
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,970
Under the chamber pot.

426
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,260
Don't be so picky.

427
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,600
Take it.

428
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Luo Hongyan's name

429
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
is mentioned in an entry eight years ago.

430
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,780
Here it is.

431
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,000
Luo Hongyan, female,

432
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,280
23 years old,

433
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,740
bought with 20 bags of opium.

434
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,660
Luo Hongyan was sold here

435
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,070
just for 20 bags of opium.

436
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,370
Dongfang Hao?

437
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,700
Dongfang Hao sold Luo Hongyan here.

438
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,290
Who else would trade girls for opium?

439
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,650
He sold me here too.

440
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,840
I can never forget

441
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,040
the stink of opium on him.

442
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,420
If the Machete Ghost aims at revenging his wife,

443
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,840
his next target

444
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,250
will be Dongfang Hao.

445
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,050
Let's go.

446
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,060
Dongfang Hao

447
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,380
is already dead.

448
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,050
The Hash Slash.

449
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,730
We're too late.

450
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,650
He killed Dongfang Hao in this room.

451
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,460
That's a very useful clue.

452
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,030
How could this happen?

453
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,070
He's dead.

454
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,510
Dongfang Hao is dead too?

455
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,230
What happened?

456
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,610
Does the Machete Ghost want to kill us all

457
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,800
instead of just Yu Louchun?

458
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,950
That question

459
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,030
can only be answered by the Machete Ghost.

460
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,490
Have you found him, Physician Li?

461
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,250
Everyone,

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,100
can I have a smell of you?

463
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,660
You can smell out the murderer?

464
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,540
You're a great physician.

465
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,830
Do you also have an incredible sense of smell?

466
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,250
Dongfang Hao's room stinks of opium.

467
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Killing him in the room

468
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,220
would make the murderer smell of it too.

469
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,000
So we just need to have a smell of you.

470
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,840
Please hold out your hands.

471
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,700
[Gather Fortune]

472
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,730
It's really you!

473
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,920
What do you mean, Physician Li?

474
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,810
I don't smell like opium.

475
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,490
That's what gave you away.

476
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,270
We've been running around the whole morning for the case.

477
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
Guard Xin, it's amazing

478
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,880
that you don't have a sweaty smell

479
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,320
and even smell like soap.

480
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,050
I just took a shower and changed.

481
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,160
What's wrong with that?

482
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,410
There's nothing wrong with that.

483
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,990
But your master just died

484
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,790
and the antidote was stolen.

485
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,790
You shouldn't be in the mood for showering and changing.

486
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,120
If I'm right,

487
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,690
you're the Machete Ghost, aren't you?

488
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,290
You saw my sword yesterday.

489
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,590
It's in the shape of a pine needle.

490
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,310
Why are you still suspecting me?

491
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,300
The Machete Ghost can use a sword too.

492
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,290
Fei.

493
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,590
[Gather Fortune]

494
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,420
The second favor.

495
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:23,980
Everyone.

496
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,150
Look.

497
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,880
The Hash Slash. You're the Machete Ghost.

498
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,190
I told you the Machete Ghost can use a sword too.

499
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,480
Let's go check Guard Xin's bedroom.

500
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,470
Guard Xin, you've put on quite a show.

501
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,970
I'm not the murderer.

502
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,570
Guard Xin.

503
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,750
The treasures are here.

504
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,520
The head guard's machete is also here.

505
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,340
There's even still blood on it.

506
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,260
Just confess.

507
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,850
Someone is framing me.

508
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,230
The Machete Ghost.

509
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,950
The hash mark on the wall could only be made by great power.

510
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,160
You can't deny that.

511
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,380
I am the Machete Ghost

512
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,310
and wanted to kill Yu Louchun.

513
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,680
But I didn't kill him.

514
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,750
Seven years ago, my wife was sold to the Girls' Mansion.

515
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,170
I came to find her and was told that she killed herself.

516
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,780
Yu Louchun was skilled in martial arts

517
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,790
and took me down.

518
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,770
To stay alive,

519
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,260
I took the Loyal Potion and became his guard.

520
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,410
I'm…

521
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,150
I'm a coward who couldn't protect my wife

522
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,160
and became my enemy's lackey to stay alive.

523
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,050
How could I have the courage to kill Yu Louchun?

524
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,470
What a touching story.

525
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,740
But you changed your clothes

526
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,840
because you killed Dongfang Hao, didn't you?

527
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,120
When I saw the words written in blood on the tree this morning,

528
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,780
I was worried that someone might frame me.

529
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,940
When I came back,

530
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,320
I saw those treasures and the machete.

531
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,100
The machete was stained with opium powder

532
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,990
so I thought it must have something to do with Dongfang Hao.

533
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,550
When I got to his room, he was already dead.

534
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,740
Only then did I realize that I was set up.

535
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,850
I hurried back to shower and change.

536
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,320
Before I could put these things away,

537
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,520
I was called out.

538
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,200
I…

539
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,000
Xin Jue, come out!

540
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,090
What's this?

541
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,580
I saw you hiding something

542
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,100
outside the door just now.

543
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,500
I dug it out and it's actually the antidote.

544
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,110
You killed Yu Louchun

545
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,360
and hid the treasures.

546
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,500
Now you're keeping the antidote for yourself?

547
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
Are you going to use it alone

548
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,040
and watch us die?

549
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,740
-You're dead!
-Wait.

550
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,520
Now that the murderer has been found,

551
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,610
the Baichuan Court will decide his punishment tomorrow.

552
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,190
Please calm down.

553
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,340
The antidote is two months' worth.

554
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,330
You scumbag don't deserve to take it.

555
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,310
Lock him up in the woodshed.

556
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,960
I shouldn't have hidden the antidote,

557
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,980
but it was put on my table

558
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,890
with the treasures.

559
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,140
I just want to stay alive. What's wrong with that?

560
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,050
Mr. Fang. Physician Li.

561
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,310
I didn't do it. I didn't do it!

562
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm being framed. I'm being framed!

563
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,210
Move.

564
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,460
The Baichuan Court

565
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,860
lives up to its reputation.

566
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,510
You said you could solve the case tomorrow,

567
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,500
but you solved it today.

568
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,390
You're so amazing.

569
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,660
I admire you.

570
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,390
I finally got a new topic for my poetry and paintings.

571
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,370
I haven't been in the Central Plains for long

572
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,970
and thought people here only cared about profits and pleasure.

573
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,000
You two are wise men.

574
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,960
I respect you.

575
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,380
It's getting late.

576
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,810
Go back and have a good sleep.

577
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,710
After my colleagues from the Baichuan Court arrive tomorrow,

578
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,420
we'll go down the mountain.

579
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,910
I'm so disappointed.

580
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,290
Who'd have known the Machete Ghost was a coward?

581
00:26:59,290 --> 00:26:59,880
Don't worry.

582
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,210
Li Lianhua.

583
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,180
[Girls' Mansion]

584
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,070
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

585
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,490
Li Lianhua.

586
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,220
What's wrong?

587
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,090
Xin Jue doesn't have the ice shard.

588
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,900
Did Yu Louchun hide it somewhere else?

589
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,180
Xin Jue doesn't know

590
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,100
where the missing parts of Yu Louchun's body are either.

591
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,350
Did Xin Jue hide it somewhere else?

592
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,960
Mr. Fang, Physician Li.

593
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,200
When these guards saw that Yu Louchun was killed

594
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,930
and Xin Jue was locked,

595
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,390
they barged in

596
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,190
and tried to…

597
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,180
You're all poisoned

598
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,640
and deserve sympathy

599
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,670
but are here assaulting those poor girls.

600
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,470
So pathetic.

601
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,600
They're kept to entertain guests.

602
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,320
Who is entertained doesn't matter.

603
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,380
You'll die eventually.

604
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,360
So when you die doesn't matter, does it?

605
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,040
The antidote can only last you

606
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,270
for two months.

607
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,350
If you do this again,

608
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,400
I'll forget about giving you its formula.

609
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,730
Sorry. We won't do it again.

610
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,590
Go, go, go.

611
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,220
Hurry.

612
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,980
Girls,

613
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,320
Yu Louchun is dead.

614
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's leave here together tomorrow.

615
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,180
Qing'er.

616
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,000
Master treated us well.

617
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,410
How can you be so ungrateful?

618
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,680
He treated us well?

619
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,930
Xifei, are you crazy?

620
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,050
We were locked here day after day,

621
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,430
worrying about not having food and clothes

622
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,050
if we lost money,

623
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,500
living in fear of being sent to the guards outside.

624
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,470
How was that treating us well?

625
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,970
The outside world is more dangerous than the Girls' Mansion.

626
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,110
Just look at what those guards

627
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,780
did today.

628
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,210
All these years,

629
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,370
it was Master who protected us.

630
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,680
That was imprisonment, not protection.

631
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,020
He locked us here

632
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
as if we were animals.

633
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,260
He never treated us like humans!

634
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,420
Binrong. Yuyan.

635
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,650
Say something.

636
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,920
You're all crazy.

637
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,810
Being locked here has made all of you crazy.

638
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,870
Do whatever you want, you cowards.

639
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,280
Since you like being cooped up,

640
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,770
lock yourselves here forever

641
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,200
and say prayers for him every day.

642
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,760
Thank you for finding out the truth

643
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,220
and avenging Master.

644
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,050
Do you not hate Yu Louchun at all?

645
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,300
The outside world

646
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,990
is too dangerous for women.

647
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,180
We got no worries when we stayed here serving Master.

648
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,570
Entertaining one person

649
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,990
is easier than entertaining lots of people.

650
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,610
But…

651
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,090
Not everyone wants the same thing.

652
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,560
I wish you all the best.

653
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,820
They've been cooped up here for too long

654
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,910
and gotten used to it.

655
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,260
Don't force them.

656
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,180
They're cowards.

657
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,450
So is Xin Jue.

658
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,850
Is everyone in the martial world so cowardly?

659
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,520
That's so boring.

660
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,950
Some people are fearless,

661
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,030
some just want to stay alive.

662
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,780
That's the real martial world.

663
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,060
Li Lianhua.

664
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,930
You've been quiet tonight.

665
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,210
What are you thinking?

666
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,910
I'm thinking

667
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,470
why there was mud on the flower.

668
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,050
I didn't see any mud.

669
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,470
I mean the night of Mountains Red.

670
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,420
Flowers grow in the soil.

671
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,620
What's weird about that?

672
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,800
The hibiscus tree is more than three meters high.

673
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,270
The flowers blooming high were stained with mud.

674
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,880
That's very weird.

675
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,690
Maybe the girls dropped them on the ground when picking them.

676
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,660
It was mud splash

677
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,840
so the flowers weren't stained

678
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,230
by being dropped to the ground.

679
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,550
How did the girls splash mud

680
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,660
over the flowers three meters high?

681
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:28,950
Also,

682
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,690
half of the body was in plain sight.

683
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,330
Why is the other half hidden?

684
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,380
Xin Jue admitted that he was the Machete Ghost.

685
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,390
But why wouldn't he confess to murder?

686
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,070
It's obvious.

687
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,110
What?

688
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,950
The answer is obvious.

689
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,430
Obvious?

690
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,680
Fine. Tell us what you think.

691
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,800
You tell me a secret

692
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,820
and I help you three times in the Fragrant Mountain.

693
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,360
Is this the third favor?

694
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,040
Don't push your luck.

695
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,230
Why don't you tell me the secret first?

696
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,500
Who knows if you'll go back on your word?

697
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
How could you say that, Fei?

698
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,230
Have I ever gone back on my word openly?

699
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,140
Don't look so sulky.

700
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,870
Fine. I'll tell you.

701
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,040
You said

702
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,540
you know you don't want me to die

703
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,560
but don't know why.

704
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,240
The reason

705
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,340
is that you want me

706
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,800
to save an important person for you.

707
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:26,880
Save someone?

708
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,440
Who's it?

709
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,350
That's another question.

710
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,310
Fei, tell us.

711
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,300
What have you found?

712
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,710
The cuts on those three bodies are different.

713
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,260
The cuts on the three of them

714
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,760
look the same,

715
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,500
but when examining more carefully,

716
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,000
we can notice differences in the murderers' states of mind.

717
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,400
The cuts on Dongfang Hao are quite calm.

718
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,630
Those on Yu Louchun

719
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,570
are determined.

720
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,770
Those on the head guard are hesitant.

721
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,430
So there are three murderers?

722
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,670
It's imitation.

723
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,000
Imitation?

724
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,970
Don't get distracted by the Hash Slash.

725
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,930
Yu Louchun died first.

726
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,280
The head guard is the second.

727
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,940
To imitate the Hash Slash

728
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,400
on Yu Louchun's body,

729
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,650
the murderer left slashes on the head guard that looked like hash marks.

730
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,220
Same goes for Dongfang Hao.

731
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,170
But the cuts on the head guard show a different state of mind

732
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,030
from those on Dongfang Hao.

733
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,320
That's because the murderer was inexperienced

734
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,180
when killing the head guard.

735
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,750
When he killed Dongfang Hao,

736
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,710
he was much more skilled.

737
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,250
Li Lianhua.

738
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,420
That's not right.

739
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,300
Yu Louchun died first

740
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,250
but the cuts on him are the most skilled.

741
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,700
Why did the murderer become less skilled

742
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,860
when killing the head guard?

743
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,510
Also,

744
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,590
if Yu Louchun died first,

745
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,230
where is the machete that ended him?

746
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,980
He couldn't be dismembered without a machete.

747
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,700
You remind me.

748
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,960
We haven't found that machete yet.

749
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,800
No.

750
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,210
No one can do the Hash Slash without a machete.

751
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
We don't know how the murderer

752
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,990
dismembered Yu Louchun without a machete,

753
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,370
but since he was capable of that,

754
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,370
we can be sure that Xin Jue is not the murderer.

755
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,420
Because in that case, he wouldn't have to hide his machete

756
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
to arouse suspicion.

757
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,739
The missing part of Yu Louchun's body

758
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,730
can definitely tell us who killed him.

759
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,590
That's all we need to know

760
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,909
that Xin Jue is not the murderer?

761
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,840
And this.

762
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,500
Take it, Fei.

763
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,610
We thought

764
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,630
that Xin Jue is the most likely one

765
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,350
who hung the vine under the cane basket.

766
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,040
Yes.

767
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,350
He burned the vine after he came down the peak.

768
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,239
That's not right.

769
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,340
Think about it.

770
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,699
If the vine were put down from above

771
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,730
and lit from below,

772
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,239
only one end would be burnt.

773
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,940
But both ends of the vine are burnt.

774
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,270
Didn't you notice that?

775
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,620
Do you mean someone is trying to make us believe

776
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,409
that Xin Jue is the murderer?

777
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,679
Xin Jue is not the murderer?

778
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,360
Then who is the murderer?

779
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,340
The murderers are a few smart people.

780
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,610
A few?

781
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,480
Xin Jue isn't the murderer,

782
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,110
so the killings required collective cooperation to be done.

783
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,210
Let's go meet Xin Jue.

784
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,190
Those guards beat you like this?

785
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,500
They beat me the same way

786
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
I used to beat them.

787
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,800
Now all the evidence points to you.

788
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,180
Tell me whatever you want to say.

789
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,960
Tomorrow morning,

790
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,530
I'll die from the Loyal Potion.

791
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,930
No one can save me now.

792
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,650
You…

793
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Why did you save me?

794
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,380
I gave you the antidote

795
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,750
because I don't want anyone to be wrongfully convicted.

796
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,150
I didn't kill Yu Louchun.

797
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,020
Neither did I kill Dongfang Hao.

798
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,650
But I've sinned.

799
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,820
From the moment I worked for Yu Louchun,

800
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I was beyond redemption.

801
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,350
Sirs,

802
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,110
ask me whatever you want.

803
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,760
I'll tell you everything I know.

804
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,010
Did you notice anything or anyone

805
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,520
unusual yesterday?

806
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,820
Yesterday?

807
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,010
We were preparing for Mountains Red,

808
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
so the whole Girls' Mansion was unusual.

809
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,740
Was there anything too strange?

810
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,530
No.

811
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,540
What about you?

812
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,550
Me?

813
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,740
You claim that someone knows you're the Machete Ghost

814
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,660
and framed you.

815
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,820
Maybe you can recall something unusual

816
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,790
about yourself.

817
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,890
About myself?

818
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,170
Except that I woke up very early,

819
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,960
nothing was unusual.

820
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,820
Did you wake up very early yesterday?

821
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,360
Yes.

822
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,440
As Yu Louchun's guard, I went to bed at midnight

823
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,500
and had to get up at four.

824
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,300
Usually, when the bell chimes four,

825
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm still very sleepy.

826
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,380
But yesterday, I waited for a long time after waking up

827
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,880
before the bell chimed four.

828
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,710
The moon.

829
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,910
Yes. Something's wrong with the moon.

830
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,150
Calm down.

831
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,840
What's wrong?

832
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,260
The moon is wrong so the time is wrong.

833
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,330
It's the eighth today.

834
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,080
Yesterday was the seventh.

835
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,300
The moon at midnight

836
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,980
should hang low in the western sky.

837
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,350
After I met Yu Louchun here last night,

838
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,810
the bell chimed midnight.

839
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,770
Bihuang was dancing at that moment.

840
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,120
But the moon was in the west above her head,

841
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,720
hanging high in the sky.

842
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,990
So the chimes of midnight

843
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,260
were early last night.

844
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,340
Xin Jue went to bed at twelve and got up at four.

845
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,920
Since he isn't the murderer,

846
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,880
the real murderer had only four hours

847
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,720
to go up the peak and commit murder.

848
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,800
But if the bell chimed early,

849
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,040
the murderer would have more time.

850
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,700
If Yu Louchun was killed

851
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
before four o'clock,

852
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,090
why was his severed arm still bleeding

853
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,480
when it was found in the morning?

854
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,060
Let's find out why the bell chimed early first.

855
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,180
The bell is in a faraway temple.

856
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,710
We can definitely find clues there.

857
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,060
But those from the Baichuan Court won't arrive until tomorrow

858
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,030
and only then will the drawbridge be put down.

859
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,260
Fang Xiaobao,

860
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,210
how can we go to that temple now?

861
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,370
Fei!

862
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,870
You…

863
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,110
Don't point at me.

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,830
Go to the temple with the bell

865
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,430
and find out why the bell chimed midnight early last night!

866
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,970
It's fine that he orders me.

867
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,320
Who are you to order me around?

868
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,310
You helped Li Lianhua three times in exchange for one secret.

869
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,480
I'll tell you a secret too.

870
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,600
You just need to help me once.

871
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,250
What do you think?

872
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,260
Isn't it a bargain?

873
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,730
Can I believe you?

874
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,140
I'll tell you the secret first.

875
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,250
You used to be a super villain

876
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,380
who was great at martial arts

877
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,940
and killed lots of people.

878
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,020
Many people wanted you dead but no one dare to mess with you.

879
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,320
What do you think?

880
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,370
It is a bargain, isn't it?

881
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,410
You can go to the temple now.

882
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,320
OK.

883
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,640
Fang Xiaobao.

884
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,750
You shouldn't tell him that

885
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,350
so early.

886
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,350
You're so glib.

887
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,130
You can make it up later.

888
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,430
By the way,

889
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,020
what should we do next?

890
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,030
You tell me!

891
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,090
Detective Fang.

892
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,400
She danced on the Zhaixing Stage the whole night.

893
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,250
We should meet her.

894
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,120
[Qunfang House]

895
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,400
Where are you going?

896
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,830
I'm moving out.

897
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,770
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

898
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,610
I don't want to stay

899
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,360
with those cowards.

900
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,560
Aren't you supposed to be with Xin Jue?

901
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,440
What are you doing here?

902
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,740
Bihuang danced all night last night.

903
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,120
How is she?

904
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,150
You're very caring.

905
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,720
I…

906
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,700
Come tomorrow.

907
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,350
Bihuang caught a cold last night

908
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,900
and has gone to bed.

909
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,850
Qing'er.

910
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,640
What kind of person is Bihuang?

911
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,500
She's the housekeeper of the Girls' Mansion.

912
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,350
She seems strict

913
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,180
but is actually soft-hearted.

914
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,170
She's a good person.

915
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,030
Did she like Yu Louchun?

916
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,670
She was meticulous with everything he asked her to do.

917
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,560
Of course she liked him.

918
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,280
Yu Louchun must have put a spell on her.

919
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,450
Was there anything

920
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,820
in her charge yesterday

921
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,070
during Mountains Red?

922
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,920
The rouge.

923
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,310
She made the girls'

924
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,770
rosy rouge herself.

925
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,180
I have some here.

926
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:00,960
Here.

927
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,490
There are opium poppies in it.

928
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,580
Are there opium poppies in the Girls' Mansion?

929
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,020
There is an opium poppy field behind the mountain.

930
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,520
Opium poppies are used to make opium.

931
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,820
So Yu Louchun

932
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,250
did illegal business to make money.

933
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,300
No wonder that junkie Dongfang Hao

934
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,220
sold him girls to cozy up to him.

935
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,090
Bihuang has opium poppies

936
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,320
so she could make anesthetics here.

937
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,400
Do you remember

938
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,780
the fish soup during Mountains Red?

939
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,760
Late Spring Nowhere to be Found.

940
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,760
There was Baizhi and Danggui in it.

941
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,880
Opium poppy, Baizhi, and Danggui

942
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,980
make up an anesthetic.

943
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,620
That's why those who had the fish soup

944
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,320
and kissed the girls fell into heavy slumber yesterday.

945
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,170
No wonder they all slept in.

946
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,110
Li Lianhua.

947
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,460
I fell asleep because I used her glass

948
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,170
by accident.

949
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,680
What happened to you?

950
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,050
Don't ask so many questions.

951
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,260
-I…
-Miss Qing'er.

952
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,860
Last night,

953
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,680
the girls gave the guests

954
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,140
hibiscuses as gifts.

955
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,300
Where did they pick them?

956
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,020
The best hibiscuses here

957
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,700
grow on Yu Louchun's Kanyuan Peak.

958
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,210
So we have to go the Kanyun Peak

959
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,430
to find other evidence against Bihuang.

960
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,930
Are you suspecting Bihuang?

961
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,480
It can't be her.

962
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,380
She's very nice

963
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,720
and liked Yu Louchun very much.

964
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,290
How could it be her?

965
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,290
Miss Qing'er.

966
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,290
If Bihuang really liked Yu Louchun,

967
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,850
why would she put her silk handkerchief

968
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,280
among the items?

969
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,950
She knew that if her item got picked, she'd have to sleep with the guest

970
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,880
but she did it nonetheless

971
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,200
because she wanted to be punished in front of everyone.

972
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,410
Why did she want that?

973
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,300
The answer is at the Kanyun Peak.

974
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,900
I see.

975
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,530
Li Lianhua.

976
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,620
Have you figured out

977
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,690
the reason why Bihuang wanted to be punished on the Zhaixing Stage?

978
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,430
She needed to know the situation at the Kanyun Peak

979
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,320
and keep an eye on the guards.

980
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,710
In the Girls' Mansion,

981
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,390
the only place where she could do that

982
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,680
is the Zhaixing Stage.

983
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,360
Do you mean that Bihuang was keeping watch

984
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,120
on the Zhaixing Stage for the real murderer?

985
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,280
Who on earth is the murderer?

986
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,560
Yu Louchun's missing body parts can tell us the answer.
