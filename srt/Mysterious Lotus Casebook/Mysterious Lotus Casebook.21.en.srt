00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,140
Wanmian.

5
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,820
I wanted to give you a surprise.

6
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,979
I didn't expect to bump into you.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,690
I chose all the flowers in the yard

8
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,759
for you.

9
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,590
Do you like it?

10
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,380
Zijin.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,830
Did you hear the rumors

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,970
about Li Xiangyi?

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,990
They're just rumors.

14
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,560
But about him,

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,510
you're always especially nervous.

16
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,480
I've checked.

17
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,289
Those rumors were spread on purpose.

18
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,330
Are you suspecting me?

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,850
I no longer have any feelings for Xiangyi.

20
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,620
He's just a friend.

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
In the past ten years,

22
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,630
you were the only one by my side.

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,570
Why don't you trust me?

24
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,910
When I became in charge of Sigu Sect,

25
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,430
you never once helped me with the discussions.

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,950
But as soon as the rumors about Li Xiangyi spread,

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,430
you rushed to question me.

28
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,570
You don't have romantic feelings for him,

29
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,180
but your feelings for him are true.

30
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,210
I never joined your discussions

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,370
because it's your first time being in charge of Sigu Sect.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,310
I'm a senior in Sigu Sect.

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,480
If I were here, I was afraid I'd be in your way.

34
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,260
How could you be such a petty...

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,450
A petty man?

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,480
He founded Sigu Sect,

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,860
and I rebuilt Sigu Sect.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,080
He's a Sect Leader.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,890
I'm also a Sect Leader.

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
I don't understand

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,220
why I'm always inferior to him

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,380
in your heart?

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,930
Zijin.

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,700
We're both tired.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,040
We need to calm down.

46
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,130
Think about why you've come this far.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,910
What do you mean?

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,310
I thought you took over Sigu Sect

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,579
just to bring peace back to the martial world.

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,100
But I didn't expect

51
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,810
that you only wanted a war trophy.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,670
The problem between us was never him,

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,560
but you.

54
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,790
You said I couldn't let him go.

55
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,940
Actually, the one that couldn't let go of him

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,120
is you.

59
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,710
Why are you always haunting me?

60

What's so special about these calligraphy paintings?

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,730
These calligraphy paintings are all painted by famous martial artists.

73

Each of these calligraphy paintings

76
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,190
is like a book on martial arts.

77
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,570
If Yu Louchun heard about this,

78
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,409
how could he not be curious?

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,680
You're a scumbag.

Shut up!

Is it useful for me to print so many notices?

85

Don't worry.

86
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,370

It looks like a notice from someone else in the city

91
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,140

92

He just became the Sect Leader

95
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,590
and now he's holding the Sigu Tea Party like my master?

96

It says that Shan Gudao was killed by Li Xiangyi.

98
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,610

99

those from the martial world to attend the tea party to redress a grievance.

100
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,860
Really?

101

Now that you know it's slander,

102
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,940
why bother to confront them about it?

But killing me alone is not enough.

to go down the drain.

00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,870
and Li Xiangyi's disciple,

189
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,120
Fang Duobing.

190
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,820
Well said.

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,310
You can't trust gamblers and thieves.

192
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,190
But what about me?

193
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,150
He Zhang?

194
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,870
As the head of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

195
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
I should be trustworthy, right?

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,620
Kid.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,050
Just now, you sought justice for Li Xiangyi.

198
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,310
You should recognize his handwriting.

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,150
This letter is a secret order from Li Xiangyi.

200
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,000
The letter ordered Shan Gudao to travel to Yangsha Valley alone.

201
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,680
That Yangsha Valley

202
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,010
is Jinyuan Alliance's secret sanctuary.

203
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
That's why Shan Gudao was besieged and killed by the four kings.

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,280
[Something is off with Jinyuan Alliance.
You should go to Yangsha Valley immediately.
I'm also rushing there to meet you.]

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,280
[Xiangyi]

206
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,090
Since it's a secret,

207
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,920
how would my master know?

208
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,390
It's just a coincidence.

209
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,800
I told Li Xiangyi this myself.

210
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,500
If he didn't mean to harm me,

211
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,810
he wouldn't have let Shan Gudao go there to die.

212
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,650
You want to frame Li Xiangyi with this alone?

213
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,220
Master He sure is talking nonsense.

214
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,190
I have more evidence.

215
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,520
Sect Leader Xiao.

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,530
May I ask

217
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,820
where the Bluestone Chessboard of Shan Gudao's courtyard

218
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,250
is at now?

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,030
It's still sealed in its original form in his room.

220
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,590
Please send someone to carry it here.

221
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,900
Minghuang Jinyun? It's a letter from the imperial court.

222
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,580
This is a letter from the imperial court?

223
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,330
Yes.

224
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,980
It's a letter from the imperial court.

225
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
Back then, Li Xiangyi refused the incorporation of the court,

226
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,280
so the court wrote a secret letter to Shan Gudao

227
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,840
to get him to replace Li Xiangyi's position

228
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,130
and become the leader of the Sigu Sect.

229
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,730
Of course Sect Leader Shan didn't agree.

230
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,950
So he sealed this envelope in the Bluestone Chessboard.

231
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,440
But this kind of thing naturally couldn't be hidden from Li Xiangyi.

232
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,150
So he came up with a plan to kill two birds with one stone.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,290
Li Xiangyi had long wanted to break

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
the agreement with Jinyuan Alliance

235
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,870
and unify the world.

236
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,060
But he is the leader of an orthodox sect.

237
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,620
It was inappropriate for him to initiate the battle.

238
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,570
So he sent Sect Leader Shan to die

239
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,870
and used it as an excuse to attack Jinyuan Alliance

240
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,380
in order to destroy it.

241
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,020
If his plan succeeded,

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,010
the two troubles in his heart would have been solved together.

243
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,440
Unfortunately for him,

244
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,100
God isn't blind.

245
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,280
The human will cannot defy God's will.

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
Liu Rujing.

247
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,700
Let me ask you.

248
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,390
That night, when Sect Leader Shan went to Luoyan Ridge,

249
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,640
we were both on duty in the courtyard.

250
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,140
Have you heard

251
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,520
about the dispute between him and Li Xiangyi?

252
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,500
What?

253
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,890
You don't dare to say it now?

254
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,980
What do I have to be afraid of?

255
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,010
I did hear them

256
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,450
arguing about the matter of the imperial court.

257
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,700
Xiangyi.

258
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Do you think

259
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,700
what you say is always right

260
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,390
and the truth,

261
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,520
and that Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

262
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,710
Yes.

263
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,420
You can lose anyone in the Sect

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,290
except Li Xiangyi.

265
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,200
I'd been silent for ten years

266
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,080
because Li Xiangyi is too famous

267
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,180
and I had nowhere to seek justice.

268
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,200
Taking the chance of today's Sigu Tea Party,

269
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,410
I request that you

270
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,130
move Li Xiangyi’s memorial tablet out of the Heroes Hall of Fame.

271
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,350
How dare you!

272
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,600
Why not?

273
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,650
If he dared to kill his senior,

274
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,460
then I'd dare to let his stinky reputation be known throughout the martial world.

275
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,240
I want Li Xiangyi out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

276
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,170
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

277
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,420
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

278
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,210
Whoever dares to touch Sect Leader's memorial tablet,

279
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,820
I'll kill you.

280
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,100
A bunch of thugs.

281
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,220
Sigu Sect was built by Li Xiangyi.

282
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,420
Let's see who dares to mess around!

283
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,980
How dare you!

284
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,370
What kind of place do you think this is?

285
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,570
Although Sigu Sect was rebuilt,

286
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,850
I had already bought this place ten years ago.

287
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,310
It's a part of the private mansion of my Mumian Villa.

288
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,250
I didn't invite you all...

289
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,830
nor did I agree to lend it to Sect Leader Xiao.

290
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,390
If you are here for a cup of tea,

291
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,420
I welcome you.

292
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,720
But if you humiliate your former Sect Leader here,

293
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,360
don't blame me for ordering you to leave.

294
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,300
Sorry, everyone.

295
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,450
Let's go.

296
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,960
Let's go.

297
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,180
He Zhang.

298
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,200
What a coincidence that you came at this time.

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,580
Miss Qiao.

300
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,290
You're the one that's late.

301
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,740
Mr. Fang.

302
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,350
This matter is very complicated.

303
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,550
It's not exactly like what they said.

304
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,340
Of course,

305
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,010
I have always trusted Li Xiangyi.

306
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,450
Thank you for today, Miss Qiao.

307
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,490
I'll take my leave.

308
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,190
Did you arrange all this?

309
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,370
What are you talking about?

310
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,370
This chessboard was long gone from Shan Gudao's room.

311
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,290
[To Shan Gudao]

312
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,270
Did you specially get it out?

313
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,570
Yes.

314
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,590
In order to smear him,

315
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,300
you actually went this far.

316
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,360
I just threw the bait

317
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,370
and so many people came to back it up.

318
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,570
There are so many people in the world who hate Li Xiangyi.

319
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,500
Is that also my fault?

320
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,060
I thought you just need some time

321
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,290
to let it go.

322
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,710
I was wrong.

323
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
About our wedding...

324
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,020
Let's forget it.

325
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,970
You can't live the rest of your life

326
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,910
with this emotional knot.

327
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,150
Mian.

328
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,130
It's not some top-notch tea.

329
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,690
Drink some to quench your thirst.

330
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,930
Mian.

332
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

333
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,230
Why are you apologizing?

334
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,100
Besides,

335
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,170
about Shan Gudao's matter,

336
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,170
Li Xiangyi is also responsible.

337
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,530
But those rumors were spread by Zijin.

338
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,319
I tried to persuade him,

339
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,310
but he's too petty about the past.

340
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,569
That means he cares.

341
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,200
Mian.

342
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,930
It's better than being dull

343
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,780
and not taking anything to heart.

344
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,770
I shouldn't have come to you.

345
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,140
This time, I'm here

346
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,000
to ask for your forgiveness on behalf of Zijin.

347
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,590
On account of our past friendship,

348
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,530
can you forgive him for a moment of foolishness?

349
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,070
Li Xiangyi is gone,

350
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,850
and Li Lianhua doesn't care about these.

351
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,120
Can you promise me

352
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,850
that you won't hold a grudge against Zijin?

353
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:50,910
Okay.

354
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,170
I promise you.

355
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,110
Thank you.

356
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,630
I remember the last time I begged someone

357
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,960
was 14 years ago.

358
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,010
I begged the Sword Demon

359
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,590
to allow him to give Li Xiangyi one more year

360
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,510
before battling him.

361
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,980
Yes.

362
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,150
One year later,

363
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,890
Li Xiangyi perfected his swordsmanship,

364
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,860
beat the Sword Demon,

365
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,290
and became the best in the world.

366
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,390
Time

367
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,950
really flies.

368
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,660
Yeah.

369
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,040
Time flies indeed.

370
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,380
Is she your lover?

371
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,130
Fei.

372
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,720
Don't you have manners?

373
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,670
Am I right?

374
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,620
No.

375
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,910
Do you have a crush on her?

376
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,940
I'll help you kidnap her back

377
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,090
in exchange for a secret of one's origin.

378
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,980
Don't do anything stupid.

379
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,570
Let me tell you.

380
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,460
She's an old friend of mine

381
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,340
named Qiao Wanmian.

382
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,490
She's Xiao Zijin's fiancee.

383
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,760
Xiao Zijin?

384
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,230
The leader of the Sigu Sect?

385
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,070
That's right.

386
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,030
They are very close.

387
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,300
Listen.

388
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't make any trouble.

389
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,070
So you have a crush on Qiao Wanyu

390
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,930
and you're afraid of Xiao Zijin,

391
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,850
so you dare not admit it.

392
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

393
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,840
Tell me a secret about your origin.

394
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,510
Why do I have to?

395
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,120
Or I'll go to Xiao Zijin

396
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,850
and tell him that you have a crush on his lady.

397
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,700
How unreasonable.

398
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,420
Are you going to tell me or not?

399
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,840
Fine.

400
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,030
I'll tell you then.

401
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,730
Actually,

402
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,410
you lost your memory because of someone you trust.

403
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,730
Aren't you the one I trust?

404
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,840
There's someone else

405
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,830
besides me.

406
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,710
Who?

407
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,540
I'm afraid we don't know yet.

408
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,390
But let me tell you,

409
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,610
with your skills,

410
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,110
the person who can hurt you must be someone around you.

411
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,770
Li Lianhua!

412
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,980

419
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,160
Stop what you're doing!

420
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,740
Stop!

421
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,940
I've got a prescription to cure your amnesia.

422
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,420
Here, drink the medicine while it's hot.

423
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:14,860
Drink it.

424
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,420
Are you crazy?

425
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,850
I am.

426
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,260
I've searched every town nearby

427
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,630
and got the folk prescription.

428
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
You must take the medicine today.

429
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,630
Drink it!

430
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,140
Are you really crazy?

431
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,070
You...

432
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,290
Fei.

433
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,020
Don’t blame Fang Duobing.

434
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,060
Although he's a bit abnormal today,

435
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,730
the medicine he bought is real.

436
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,660
Fang Xiaobao.

437
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,780
I know you mean well.

438
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,740
But Fei

439
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,020
really doesn't have amnesia.

440
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,250
It's useless for him to take this medicine.

441
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,620
If you really want to help him,

442
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,140
you have to find another way, okay?

443
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,980
I'm not trying to help him.

444
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:58,870
I...

445
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
I just want him to remember

446
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,380
what happened ten years ago.

447
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,120

You didn't even eat dinner.

461
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,200
You said my master had a cold nature,

Yes.

Then could he have

466
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,700
hurt your father?

467
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,360
I didn't say that.

468
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,070
Fang Xiaobao, think about it.

469
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,580
Your father forced you to marry the princess.

Do you hate them?

473
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,910
Of course not.

474
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,380
Doesn't that explain it all?

475
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,770
As brothers and as family, Li Xiangyi and Shan Gudao

Things that are worthy

486
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,810
are few.

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,970

Because I still think

00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,180
the swordsman in white in the Yuanbao Villa was strange.

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,370
Dear guests,

559
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,790
the horse carriages are ready.

560
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,700
Please get in.

561
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,290
Why are there three carriages?

562
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,680
Xiaoyong.

563
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,420
You and Fei can share one,

564
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,570
while Xiaobao and I will share one.

565
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,500
Go.

566
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,470
Strange.

567
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,510
Why aren't their carriage following us?

568
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,740
Let it be.

569
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,390
What smells so good?

570
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,620
Get some sleep.

571
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,500
Why did I fall asleep?

572
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,540
You're awake.

573
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,580
Why am I so drowsy?

574
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Where are we going?

575
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,220
I've never this scenery before.

576
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,770
I don't know too.

577
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,500
Why did you sleep so soundly?

578
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,030
You were put to sleep as soon as you entered the carriage.

579
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,730
It seems that Yu Louchun

580
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,220
doesn't want anyone to know

581
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,010
where Mountains Red is.

582
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,580
Sir.

583
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,660
We're almost there.

584
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,540
You'll have to transfer to the bamboo boat soon.

585
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,260
Where are my two other friends?

586
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,370
Our master only receives guests who received the invitation.

587
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,880
Your friends are being taken care of elsewhere.

588
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,080
Once Mountains Red is finished,

589
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,390
we will send you back.

590
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,760
You're really good at making decisions on your own.

591
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,550
Forget it.

592
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,750
Let's just follow the host's orders as guests.

593
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,950
We changed boats three times in total.

594
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,600
The first two times, our eyes were covered.

595
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,750
It felt like we were going all the way up.

596
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,450
They're so cautious.

597
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,020
No wonder no one knows where Yu Louchun lives.

598
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,270
This is quite funny.

599
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,750
It's been half a day, yet no one has come to pick us up.

600
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,910
Don't they know I can't wait?

601
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,900
Anyone out there?

602
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,670
You're no match for him even if you act cool.

603
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,140
It's just a small trick.

604
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,740
If you hadn't stopped me,

605
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,070
I would have flew here.

606
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,130
Hey pal.

607
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,640
Are you going to the Mountains Red too?

608
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,370
How rude.

609
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,780
What kind of person is this?

610
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,200
You said it yourself.

611
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,940
All of Yu Louchun's guests are extraordinary people.

612
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,790
Are you alright?

613
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,050
I almost vomited.

[Tiejia Sect Shi Wenjue]

615
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,470

616
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,030
My savior!

617
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,530
Shi Wenjie, it's you.

618
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,440
Long time no see.

619
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,670
You're the young master of Tiejia Sect who was resurrected by Li Lianhua

620
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,980
after you committed suicide in order to get an academic title?

621
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,240
That's me.

622
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,550
Why are you here?

623
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,710
When he was about seven years old,

624
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,700
he was know as an extraordinary talent.

625
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,110
But he took the exam ten times and failed every time.

626
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,500
Isn't it rare?

627
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,170
It's said that this white-faced scholar...

628
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,030
White-faced scholar?

629
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,230
He looks like an official.

630
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,760
He doesn't look like a scholar at all.

631
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,090
I study while I play with iron.

632
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,070
How do I put this?

633
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,240
It's pleasant to learn with constant perseverance and application.

634
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,840
You know?

635
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,090
Even if I failed the exam ten times,

636
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,390
what's important is my participation.

637
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,670
Brother.

638
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,900
Are you here to see red leaves?

639
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,640
You look like Mr. Fang.

640
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,480
You must be joking.

641
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,210
Coming to the Girls' Mansion this time is to appreciate the artistic conception.

642
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,400
How can it be red leaves?

643
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,880
Girls' Mansion?

644
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,700

Let's hurry,

647
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,710
or we'd be late and miss it.

648
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,600
This place is surrounded by mountains.

649
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,620
No wonder no one noticed

650
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,910
where Yu Louchun lives for so long.

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,190
Choosing an item from the Girls' Mansion

743
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,860
is the rule here.

744
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,800
Every guest entering has to choose one

745
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,380
as a token.

746
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,240
Don't be afraid.

747
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,230
Don't worry, Young Master Mu Rong.

748
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
Master has ordered that

749
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,300
this year’s item

750
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,280
will be chosen by Physician Li and Mr. Fang first.

751
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:52,860
Please.

752
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,520
Mr. Fang, it’s your turn.

753
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,680
Let me think about it.

754
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,130
You guys go first.

755
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,820
Since Mr. Fang's letting others go first,

756
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,590
please go ahead.

757
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,200
Mr. Fang.

758
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,020
I’ll take this one.

759
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,230
Maybe some lady made a mistake.

760
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,080
I’ll change it for Mr. Fang later.

761
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,630
No need. I’ll take this one.

762
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,160
Please come in.

763
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,030
Li Lianhua.

764
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,370
Yu Louchun's mansion

765
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,470
is not a proper place.

766
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,670
What are you afraid of?

767
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,120
This Girls' Mansion just

768
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,220
has more ladies.

769
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,550
I-I'm not afraid.

770
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,900
I'm afraid I'll get held up and our main affairs will be delayed.

771
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,360
I thought too much. You are so well-mannered.

772
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,130
You do look decent too.

773
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,380
How about I give you an idea?

774
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,050
Just apply some soil on your face.

775
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,990
Won't that do?

776
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,390
Stop messing around.

777
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,430
Let's go.

778
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,990
Other than the master and the guests,

779
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,560
other men are not allowed in the Mansion.

780
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,770
I'll see you off until here.

781
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
I'll leave the rest of the guiding to Miss Bihuang.

782
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,100
[Girl's Mansion]

783
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,980
I'm Bihuang, the steward of the Girls' Mansion.

784
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,600
[The steward of the Girls' Mansion, Bihuang]

785
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,500
I welcome you, our distinguished guests, on behalf of my master.

786
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,360
Welcome, distinguished guests.

787
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,000
Please come in.

788
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,740
Please.

789
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,070
Miss Bihuang,

790
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,770
what's the name of the mountain where the Girls' Mansion is?

791
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,340
This mountain has no name on the map.

792
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,280
Only because of the fragrance of the flowers all year round,

793
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,190
Master named it Fragrant Mountain.

794
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,470
Fragrant Mountain?

795
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,690
Did you figure out the way out?

796
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,680
What way out?

797
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,760
The suspension bridge at the entrance rises as soon as we entered,

798
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,540
and closed the road in.

799
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,810
The guards are not allowed to enter without orders.

800
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,920
Looks like Yu Louchun

801
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,400
is more cautious than Jin Mantang.

802
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,540
This is the Liujin Longevity Pine.

803
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,850
This is the one-in-a-million Luohan Pine.

804
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,150
One of it takes a hundred years to be cultivated.

805
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,650
I don't even have one at home.

806
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,670
I can't believe it's here.

807
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,390
Looks like the taste of this mansion

808
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,630
couldn't have been made overnight.

809
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,230
There were at least three generations.

810
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,480
Three generations?

811
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,140
Doesn't it match the time

812
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,930
of the four Nanyin people from the Central Plains?

813
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,610
Looks like the person we're looking for

814
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:23,860
is here.

815
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,720
Let's go.

816
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:36,620
[Huansha Pavilion]

817
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,810
Welcome, distinguished guests.

818
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,770
This way, please.

819
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,580
Where is Li Lianhua?

820
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,950
Sir, please come with me.

821
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,340
Miss.

822
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,070
What are you doing?

823
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,630
To help you wash off the dust.

824
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,320
I'm not taking a bath.

825
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,460
Excuse me.

826
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,870
[Shuixie Zhilan]

827
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,340
What's the matter?

828
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,070
Is she not to your liking?

829
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,820
I'm not taking a bath.

830
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,950
Because I took a bath before I came out.

831
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,640
The one who served you in the bath should be Rongqiu.

832
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,610
I meant for others to hear it.

833
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,380
By the way,

834
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,910
there's another distinguished guest

835
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,600
from Shaoyu of Yueqian

836
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,890
who doesn't like to bath either.

837
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,940
He's having tea in the tea room right now.

838
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,270
I want tea too.

839
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,360
Miss Bihuang.

840
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,080
Have you seen Li Lianhua?

841
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,600
Physician Li?

842
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,730
I didn't see him come out of the Huansha Pavilion.

843
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,660
He must be taking a bath.

844
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,960
He's staying inside?

845
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,400
You must be tired from traveling.

846
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,020
It's natural to take a bath and get changed.

847
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,120
Sir, after you.

848
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,220
I'll ask someone to serve you tea.

849
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,440
Li Lianhua.
