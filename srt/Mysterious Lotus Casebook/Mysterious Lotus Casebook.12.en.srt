[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,950
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,710
Do you have to

5
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,900
wrapped yourself up like that?

6
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,820
We have to find a reason to stay.

7
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,810
What about Guo Kun?

8
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,660
He always runs around carrying a skeleton.

9
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,600
Have you ever thought

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,570
where did the skeleton

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,530
come from?

12
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,450
Could it be from the lotus pond?

13
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,930
It shouldn't be a coincidence.

14
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,610
Let's go.

15
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,580
Let's talk to Guo Kun.

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,120
You go ahead.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,060
I said I don't care.

18
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,280
Let's go.

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
You guys are really going without me?

20
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,740
It's miserable!

21
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,060
It's not worth it.

22
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,300
Guo Kun.

23
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,260
Guo Kun.

24
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,950
Do you know this?

25
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,090
Do you really like the woman

26
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,060
who wore this brown wedding dress?

27
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,220
Where are you going?

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,360
Where are you going?

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,270
I found it strange yesterday.

30
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,710
Guo Kun went crazy when he saw a person

31
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,630
in brown wedding dress.

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,930
Then why did he

33
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,360
hang up this brown curtain in his room?

34
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,340
In fact,

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,620
he doesn't care about
this wedding dress at all.

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,340
Why are you carrying the skeleton all day?

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,890
Tell me,

38
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,290
and I'll give it back to you.

39
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,829
You bastard!

40
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,790
Why are you here?

41
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,050
The day before yesterday was 5th day,

42
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,340
yesterday was 6th day,

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,980
and today is 7th day.

44
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,060
Today is 7th day, I going to play
at the center of the lake.

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,380
We can't get anything from this lunatic.

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,790
Let's go.

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,620
Wait.

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,850
Guo Kun.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,490
Who is this bastard?

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,670
Monster!

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,830
Monster!

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,080
Monster!

53
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,950
If Guo Kun is not sensitive to the bride,

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,530
why don't we try someone else?

55
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,580
Lion Soul.

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,940
Do you remember me?

57
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,780
Bastard!

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,970
You can't escape.

59
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,220
Go to hell!

60
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,510
Just like what happened
in front of the mirror stone yesterday.

61
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,450
He made a palm hit first,

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,440
but it was weak.

63
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,409
Guo Kun practiced the Arhat legs.

64
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,730
But this palm

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,770
is immature Bagua Xingyi Palm.

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,460
Bagua Sect?

67
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,100
Guo Qian's Sect?

68
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,659
It seems Guo Kun imitated his brother.

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,970
I looked through the casebook again
last night.

70
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,820
When the three women died,

71
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,890
there are no palm marks on their bodies.

72
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,650
Then, who is the target of this palm?

73
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,360
When Madam Xu died,

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,600
Lion Soul should have been present.

75
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,500
I haven't eaten anything since last night.

76
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm starving.

77
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Is Second Master's medicine ready?

78
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,850
Yes.

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,420
Why did you brew it
according to yesterday's prescription?

80
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,620
It's wrong.

81
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,500
Throw it away, hurry!

82
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,230
Don't blame us.

83
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,560
Granny Housekeeper.

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,260
Today is Madam Wang's death anniversary.

85
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,620
Accidents happened in Cailian Manor
one after another.

86
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,140
There's a vengeful spirit.

87
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,980
I need to burn more joss paper for her.

88
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,170
Don't blame us.

89
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,700
Please forgive us.

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,810
Death anniversary?

91
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,430
It was the day the second murder happened

92
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,640
in Cailian Manor seven years ago.

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,260
The day before yesterday was 5th day,

94
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,760
yesterday was 6th day,

95
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,780
and today is 7th day.

96
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm going to play at the center of the lake.

97
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,720
Center of the lake?

98
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,020
Young man,

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,700
are you waiting for Second Master Guo?

100
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,340
Who are you?

101
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,480
Are you from Lotus Manor?

102
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,020
Why are you waiting for him?

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,880
Today is my birthday.

104
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Every year on my birthday,

105
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,810
Mr. Kun will come to play with me

106
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,860
and learn opera together.

107
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,040
But why didn’t he come today?

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,700
Did his brother lock him up again?

109
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,940
Every birthday...

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,140
Today...

111
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,380
Young man,

112
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,220
have you known Mr. Guo for a long time?

113
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,420
It's been seven years.

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,670
You recall it so clearly

115
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,050
without even thinking about it?

116
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,460
Of course.

117
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,659
Because it was on the evening
of my eighth birthday.

118
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,130
I was separated from my family.

119
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,670
When I was crying alone in the alley.

120
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,620
Mr. Kun also sneaked out to play.

121
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,820
He saw me crying,

122
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,340
and came to play with me.

123
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,470
We played together until dawn.

124
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,810
He left after my family found me.

125
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,320
So,

126
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,040
Guo Kun wasn't at Cailian Manor

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,330
at the night when Madam Wang died.

128
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,520
What are you doing here?

129
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,330
I know you haven't eaten anything

130
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,630
since last night.

131
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,860
Eat up.

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,960
You have a conscience.

133
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,220
Don't think you can

134
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,170
calm me down with a chicken.

135
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,580
My gut feeling is right.

136
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,549
Fei's background is not simple.

137
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,289
I don't know how much you know about him.

138
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,860
But in the martial world,

139
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,130
it's always good to be alert.

140
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,799
You're just a kid,

141
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,280
but you're lecturing me.

142
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,170
My biggest advantage is
to learn from mistakes.

143
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,130
I'll learn ten things from a single mistake.

144
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,620
I can remember every time

145
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,380
when I got scammed by someone.

146
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,110
You,

147
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,030
you're a big mouth,

148
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,340
a little cheap,

149
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,930
and also keeping many secrets,

150
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,850
but still you're considered a good person.

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,520
You are also

152
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,100
the first friend I made in the martial world.

153
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,810
I don't want you to be in danger.

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,260
Fine.

155
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,740
I will be more cautious

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,570
in everything.

157
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,300
This chicken is not for free.

158
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
If Detective Fang doesn't participate

159
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,380
in the case of Cailian Manor,

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,250
there’s no way to investigate it further.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
Since you said so,

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,650
I'll help you.

163
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,870
Are you also wondering

164
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,100
why Guo Kun suddenly
attacked you last night?

165
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,560
This is the residue of Guo Kun's medicine yesterday.

166
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,820
I checked his prescription.

167
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,980
Guess who ordered the servants
to change his medicine?

168
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,300
Of course it was his brother.

169
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,460
Guo's Sect is green with a pond of silk,

170
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,210
accompanied by ten miles of jade hairpins.

171
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Just a man of the Sect in the woods,

172
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,700
watching lanterns with chrysanthemum wine
in a melon field.

173
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Not bad.

174
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,650
It's a good poem.

175
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,070
I didn't expect that Doctor Li has some literary talent.

176
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,840
Wait.

177
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,840
Dad.

178
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,940
It seems to be

179
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,360
an acrostic poem.

180
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,060
Guo Shi Sha Gua.

181
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,160
Guo is a fool.

182
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
Master, bad news.

183
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
The guests are in Madam Xu's study again.

184
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,720
You keep barging into my manor's backyard.

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,930
You really don't respect me.

186
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,400
In that case,

187
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,620
don't blame me for being rude.

188
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,430
See them out.

189
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,480
You...

190
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,620
You're afraid of people entering this room

191
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,810
because you don't them want to see this.

192
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,160
When the moon is bright,

193
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,060
with the wedding dress,

194
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,310
See you next to the mirror.

195
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,420
be there or be square.

196
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,580
Lord Guo,

197
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,700
if my guess is right,

198
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,360
this should be a letter from Shi Hun to Madam Xu.

199
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,820
They are both in the manor.

200
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Why did they need to date

201
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,700
in such a vague way?

202
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,130
What did you do to them?

203
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,820
How would I know what happened?

204
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,820
Maybe they had an affair,

205
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,980
and dated secretly by a secret letter.

206
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,980
However, they ran into my crazy brother,

207
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,220
and he killed them.

208
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,210
Imposing a charge on a lunatic,

209
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,340
it's really safer.

210
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,790
But seven years ago,

211
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,550
when Madam Wang died,

212
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,710
Guo Kun wasn't in the manor.

213
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,250
Young Master Liu in the town can prove that

214
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,530
he wasn't there at all.

215
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,090
Guo Kun was not there when Madam Wang died.

216
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,740
But it can't prove that

217
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,460
he didn't kill Madam Xu.

218
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,300
You’re so stubborn.

219
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,270
Lord Guo,

220
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,850
Can you recognize these two residues

221
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,930
of herb medicines.

222
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,840
One of these is the medicine

223
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,820
that Kun usually takes to heal the madness.

224
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,860
And this one,

225
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,990
I found it from the trash.

226
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,930
I've shown it to the doctor.

227
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,500
These two medicines are totally different.

228
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,570
Yesterday's medicine is clearly not right.

229
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,460
It'll make him more irritated.

230
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,630
That's why Guo Kun came out last night to scare people.

231
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,520
This is all because you want Guo Kun
to be the scapegoat.

232
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,840
Am I right, Lord Guo?

233
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,090
Lord Guo.

234
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,140
Obviously, Shi Hun stayed

235
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,940
in the Cailian Manor for a long time.

236
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,640
The Corpse Fragrant Flower Tomb in the lotus pond

237
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
is the best proof.

238
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,370
But you said he only stayed for three days.

239
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,060
If you are not guilty,

240
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,190
why did you lie for such a trivial matter?

241
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,010
Corpse Fragrant Flower Tomb?

242
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

243
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't you know the corpses 
in the mass grave outside the city

244
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,320
that has been missing for ten years?

245
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,720
Do you want me to help you recall it?

246
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,110
Or ask someone to dig up the lotus pond and take a look?

247
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,400
Even a fool

248
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,960
can't learn from anyone he sees.

249
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,570
He must be learning from the closest person.

250
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,130
So what Guo Kun said

251
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,330
is not nonsense at all.

252
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,580
He is imitating what you said

253
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,370
on the night of the murder.

254
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,190
-Uncle. -You can't escape!

255
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,820
-You can’t.
-Uncle.

256
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,220
Let's go.

257
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
Where can you run to?

258
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,940
The palm that Guo Kun hit Fang Duobing

259
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,420
was the Bagua Xingyi Palm
you hit Shi Hun with.

260
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,860
Why did Madam Xu die in the end,

261
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,010
instead of leaving?

262
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Where did Shi Hun go after that?

263
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,760
Lord Guo,

264
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,380
don’t you want to tell me?

265
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,550
If you don’t,

266
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
let me speak for you.

267
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,900
I guess it's like this.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Ten years ago,

269
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,980
Lion Soul accidentally fell into your lotus pond.

270
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,620
and was saved by Madam Xu.

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,690
Lion Soul suffered a lot

272
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,730
because of his appearance.

273
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,750
That's why he's timid and self-abased.

274
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,950
But Madam Xu was kind-hearted

275
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,300
and didn't treat him as a monster.

276
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,940
She took him in to stay.

277
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,110
That's why they fell in love.

278
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,130
All right.

279
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,800
Thank you.

280
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
You were suspicious.

281
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,250
You must had been harsh on Madam.

282
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,880
So Shi Hun asked her to elope.

283
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,980
[When the moon is bright, with the wedding dress, 
by the mirror stone, See you]

284
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,490
But you found out the secret
on this calligraphy.

285
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,980
That's why you killed them in anger.

286
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,100
Go to hell!

287
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,400
That night,

288
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,630
Guo Kun witnessed the whole process of your murder.

289
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,610
Guo Kun memorized your move to Shi Hun.

290
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,500
and saw how you carried and hid the bodies.

291
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,820
That's why he runs around
carrying a skeleton.

292
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,460
Who cares about what a crazy man does?

293
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
But you knew that

294
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,150
all his actions

295
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,660
were just an imitation of your murder.

296
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,530
You were afraid of being exposed,

297
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,940
so you played along

298
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,460
and put the blame on your

299
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,500
crazy little brother.

300
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,810
Am I right?

301
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,670
No, it's not.

302
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,580
My father didn't kill them.

303
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,640
No.

304
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,060
It's only your guess.

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,300
There is no evidence.

306
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,570
Does Baichuan Court have to pin the crime

307
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,720
on me?

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,030
You want evidence?

309
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,260
Easy.

310
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,740
What do you want?

311
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,580
I have plenty of ways

312
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,030
to make people talk.

Are you going to tell me or not?

Dad! Dad!

318
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,980
Fei, you're extorting a confession
by torture.

319
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,850
You want to extort a confession by torture

320
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,980
and frame me.

321
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,000
Since you said so,

322
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,030
how about I throw you into this pond

Fei!

325
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,520
I'll confess!

326
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I killed Shi Hun you were looking for.

327
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,330
I drugged Guo Kun.

328
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,700
Back then,

329
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,250
Madam Xu saved that Six Fingers Monster.

330
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,220
I didn't expect

331
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,329
that he would fall in love with Madam Xu.

332
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,650
He sneaked into my Cailian Manor
as a servant

333
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,599
and used his secret technique to nurture the lotus

334
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,359
to make Madam Xu happy.

335
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,780
Because he saw me hurt her,

336

he instigated her to leave me,

337
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,850
and eloped on my wedding night.

338
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,790
You're here.

339
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,490

Okay.

342
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,110
I'm glad I found out.

343
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,710
So you killed them for that?

344
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,380
I killed that Six Fingers Monster

345
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,300
in a rage.

346
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,540
As for that bitch,

347
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,640
she was too flustered

348
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,700
and drowned herself in the pool.

349
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,190
But that bitch deserves to die, too.

350
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,280
Lotus is noble.

351
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
That bitch is a slut

353
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,810
She doesn't deserve to love the lotus.

was thrown into the pool to be fertilizer.

363
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:28,920
Okay.

364
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,860
You all go into the water

365
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,260
and get all the corpses.

366
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,690
We must find the body with six fingers

367
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,610
even if we have to turn over
the bottom of the pond.

368
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,850
Go into the water.

369
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,860
Lotus is noble,

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,940

Didn't you say Shi Hun
never leaves his things behind?

374
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,260
The body has been soaked in water
for so many years.

375
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,220
Even if he has any relic with him,

376
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,590
it would have been rotten.

377
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,150
The Kun's skin bag of Shi Hun
is a treasure of Tianshan.

378
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
It won't rot.

379
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,290
Since he's here, but the thing is not,

380
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,600
it must still be somewhere
in Cailian Manor.

381
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,940
We will go find it.

382
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,770
Where are you going?

383
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,250
Where are you going?

384
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
We've searched the whole Cailian Manor,
but still couldn't find it.

385
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,400
Take them back to Baichuan Court first.

386
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,750
As for Shi Hun,

387
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,040
I will come up with another way.

388
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,180
Let's go.

389
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,580
You killed Madam Xu,

390
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,140
because she wanted to leave with Shi Hun.

391
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,700
But why did you kill

392
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,050
the second and the third?

393
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,010
I killed them anyway.

394
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,790
Why?

395
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,820
Is it important?

396
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,770
Beef with coriander.

397
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,090
I'm really sorry, guests.

398
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,170
Corianders is sold out today.

399
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,920
I've replace it with celery.

400
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,340
I just bought some

401
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,690
famous coriander meat cakes.

402
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,850
Would you like to try one?

403
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,750
I have two.

404
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Come on.

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
Thank you. No need.

406
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
My Lady,

407
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,840
I brought you the wedding shoes

408
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,800
embroidered by Old Madam.

409
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,210
But why did the wedding become a funeral?

410
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,590
My lady.

411
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,450
My lady.

412
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,780
My condolences.

413
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,110
May I ask

414
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,470
why does your lady use plain colors?

415
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,460
Does she not like other colors?

416
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,480
Because...

417
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,170
Because my lady has slight color-blindness.

418
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,590
She can't distinguish many colors.

419
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,180
So she only used things with plain colors.

420
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,800
My lady

421
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,590
doesn't allow us to tell anyone.

422
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,950
No, turn around.

423
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,210
[Cailian Manor]

424
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,930
Let's go.

425
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,130
Hurry up!

426
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,670
Run!

427
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,040
Let's go. Hurry.

428
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,830
Hurry up.

429
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,110
Young Master Guo.

430
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,420
Young Master Guo.

431
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,650
Where are you going in such a hurry?

432
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,040
Li Lianhua.

433
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,020
Didn't you leave?

434
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,860
I-I did leave.

435
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,800
But on the way,

436
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,190
I didn't figure out a question.

437
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,050
So I came back to ask Young Master Guo.

438
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,600
The lady from Weiyuan Escort Agency

439
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,900
knew that the pomegranate dress

440
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,530
in Cailian Manor is an ominous thing.

441
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,500
So she hates wearing this wedding dress.

442
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,980
Then why did she suddenly come back

443
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,840
and wear this wedding dress when she died?

444
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,070
I don't understand.

445
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,220
Young Master Guo.

446
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,270
The same purple pomegranate skirt.

447
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,450
I found it in your room.

448
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,690
Can you explain it?

449
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,890
Young Master Guo,

450
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,700
If you're too shy to speak.

451
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,160
Let me speak for you.

452
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,720
I

453
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,980
asked the maid of the bride.

454
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,740
Her lady was born with slight colorblindness

455
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,680
and thin-skinned.

456
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,790
She wouldn't let others know
her natural flaws.

457
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,930
She only told her future husband about that,

458
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,060
which is you, Young Master Guo.

459
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,720
I heard from the servant that

460
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
Young Master Guo wanted to prepare

461
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,720
a new wedding dress for her.

462
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,740
However, this wedding dress

463
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,050
has never seen by anyone

464
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,260
except the maid of the bride.

465
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,900
Young Master Guo said

466
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surprise everyone
on the wedding day.

467
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,890
But a few days before the wedding,

468
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,720
the bride suddenly lost her wedding shoes.

469
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,120
So she had to ask her maid to go back

470
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,950
to her parent's home to get another pair.

471
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,540
After the maid left,

472
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,020
you secretly replaced the wedding dress

473
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,090
with a brown and purple pomegranate dress.

474
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,340
The bride who can't distinguish colors

475
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,300
put on this brown pomegranate dress

476
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,660
when she was trying it on.

477
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,530
Why is this pair of red shoes found in your room

478
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,060
are exactly the same with that pair

479
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,370
the maid got back.

480
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,060
Because the so-called lost of the red shoes

481
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,900
is what you did on purpose.

482
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,490
You wanted to send away
the maid of the bride

483
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,160
so that she can't distinguish colors.

484
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,010
I thought I had deceived you.

485
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,370
I didn't expect you to come back

486
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,150
and found out all of this.

487
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Not only this.

488
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,320
I guess the reason

489
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,140
why Young Master Guo did all this

490
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,570
is for Miss Lyurou, right?

491
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,940
Young Master Guo loves Miss Lyurou.

492
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,260
But Lord Guo insisted you

493
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,520
to marry the daughter
of Weiyuan Escort Agency.

494
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,440
But Young Master Guo, you dare not resist.

495
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,950
So you set up a trap to kill your bride.

496
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,250
Do you remember?

497
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,360
That day at Cuihua Restaurant,

498
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,730
Miss Lyurou pretended to be
unfamiliar with you.

499
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,710
But she knows your taste very well.

500
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,040
She switched the coriander on your desk quietly.

501
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,680
Am I right, Miss Lyurou?

502
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,070
Lyurou.

503
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,020
We always thought

504
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,420
those three people were killed by the same person.

505
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,380
After we figured out the first case,

506
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,930
we mistook the other two murders

507
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,360
that seems to be done in the same way

508
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,860
were all committed by Lord Guo.

509
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,540
Actually, this is also a misunderstanding.

510
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,930
Young Master Guo,

511
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,100
you did this on purpose, didn't you?

512
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,390
It's all my fault, Lyurou.

513
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,460
It's not his fault.

514
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,980
I forced him to marry me.

515
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,080
Arrest me if you want.

516
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,230
Please let him go.

517
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,290
Get up!

518
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,860
Lyurou.

519
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
I'll take the responsibility.

520
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,380
I did kill him.

521
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,570
It has nothing to do with Lyurou.

522
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,170
Why are you being lovey-dovey here?

523
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,410
The people you killed are innocent.

524
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,940
I killed the princess
of Weiyuan Escort Agency

525
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,790
not only because I love Lyurou,

526
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,490
but also because

527
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,220
I hate him, Guo Qian.

528
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,120
I hate everything he arranged for me,

529
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,630
and controlling me.

530
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,830
My father Guo Qian...

531
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,930
He likes to

532
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,330
put everything

533
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,650
under his control.

534
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,440
He can't tolerate others

535
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,260
to disobey him.

536
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,170
My mother

537
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,490
was forced to death by him.

538
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,060
And I...

539
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,880
And I was almost suffocated by him.

540
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,820
So,

541
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,160
I will never give in
to his control and oppression.

542
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,240
Never.

543
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
Darling Guo.

544
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,170
do you think

545
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,540
Madam Xu had an affair with Shi Hun?

546
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,200
In fact, Madam Xu

547
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,530
was tortured and abused by Guo Kun.

548
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,910
This was all seen by Shi Hun.

549
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,740
He wanted to save her.

550
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,390
But they failed

551
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,600
and killed by Guo Qian.

552
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,210
But it's good.

553
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,140
When I saw how Madam Xu
in the pomegranate dress

554
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,620
fell into the lotus pond
and drowned to death,

555
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,650
I found a good way

556
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,930
to kill.

557
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,280
A good way to kill.

558
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,890
So the mirror in the house

559
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,870
and the mirror stone outside

560
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
were also designed by you, right?

561
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,180
You also missed

562
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,950
the Shoushan Stone and stumbling block.

563
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,270
They were arranged by me on purpose.

564
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,890
I also found that Feng Shui master.

565
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,440
It's all Guo Qian's fault for being stupid.

566
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,990
He believes everything so easily.

567
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,880
Young Master Guo,

568
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,160
you killed your newlywed wife

569
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,860
just to get rid of your father's control.

570
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,030
But your father's second wife

571
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,860
has nothing to do with this.

572
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,780
Why did you kill her?

573
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,450
So what?

574
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,020
He forced my mother to die

575
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,050
and ruined my life.

576
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,700
Do you think I'll let him live a happy life?

577
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,350
I will not let him have

578
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,820
anything he wants.

579
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,540
Young Master Guo,

580
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,100
Your father already knew

581
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,620
everything you did.

582
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,980
He didn't turn you in

583
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,240
only because

584
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,070
he still want to protect his son.

585
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,360
Ridiculous.

586
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,500
Even if he turns me in,

587
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
he will still be punished.

588
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,480
He just planned the last step

589
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,710
that I can get him out.

590
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,050
But he never thought

591
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,580
I wanted him to die.

592
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,620
There are thousands of ways

593
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,570
to break free from the control
of a despicable person.

594
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,140
Why did you choose to become

595
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,920
a more despicable person?

596
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,430
If you want revenge,

597
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,870
why did you involve innocent people in this

598
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
to fill your hatred?

599
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,540
You haven't experienced my life

600
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,150
and my pain.

601
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,400
You have no right to lecture me.

602
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,620
I know

603
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,980
you want to find

604
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,950
what Shi Hun left back then.

605
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,160
Back then, Shi Hun

606
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,600
hid all his belongings

607
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,010
in a place, in order not to

608
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,540
expose himself as the remnant

609
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,630
of Jinyuan Alliance.

610
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,050
And only I know this place.

611
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,540
If you let me go,

612
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,220
I'll tell you.

613
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,650
Darling Guo,

614
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,760
I hate people threatening me the most in my life.

615
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,160
If you don't tell me,

616
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,140
I'll break your neck.

617
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:40,890
Okay.

618
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,210
As long as you let go of me,

619
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I'll tell you where it is.

620
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,180
Let's go!

621
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,490
Stop!

622
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,780
Fabric of the Jinyuan Alliance.

623
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,340
This is the handwriting of Shi Hun.

624
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,450
Lion Soul hasn't recovered,

625
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,910
and the master's order
hasn't been implemented.

626
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,200
I dare not neglect it.

627
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,190
Therefore, I kept the body of Shan Gudao
in the herb coffin

628
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,150
to keep it intact.

629
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,390
It is hidden under the willow tree
of the south gate of Cailian Manor.

630
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,570
Senior.

631
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,940
I finally found you.

632
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,250
I told you,

633
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,910
no one can escape from me.

634
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,720
I tied those two up.

635
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,220
Li Lianhua, what are you doing?

636
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,620
Whose tomb is this?

637
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,290
Fang Duobing.

638
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,130
This

639
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,080
is the remains of your uncle Shan Gudan.

640
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,610
Actually, he is who we've been looking for.

641
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,060
Come.

642
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,090
Come and pay your respects to your uncle.

643
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,400
It's you.

644
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,340
Are the flowers pretty?

645
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,780
You want to kill me?

646
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,620
Are you willing to do that?

647
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,220
Besides,

648
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,110
you are no match for me.

649
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,580
What else do you want?

650
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,810
I've killed the master for you.

651
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,980
For the past ten years,

652
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,210
I've drawn the ground as a prison.

653
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,270
I have nothing now.

654
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,420
You still have one thing.

655
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,580
You have me.

656
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,950
Mr. Yun, long time no see.

657
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,830
Do you miss me?

658
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,840
Don't lie to yourself.

659
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,240
From ten years ago,

660
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,060
you had no resistance to me.

661
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,150
Looking at you now,

662
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,989
I feel sorry for you.

663
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,050
You have to live well for me.

664
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,870
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

665
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,560
What is it?

666
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,139
I want the maps of 188 prisons.

667
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,139
Di Feisheng is back.

668
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,020
Are you planning for him again?

669
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,020
Yes.

670
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,700
All Sects in the martial world

671
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,020
have your admirers.

672
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,810
I'm no different from them.

673
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,350
We are only tools for your ambition
of ruling the martial world.

674
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,900
Mr. Yun,

675
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,090
I trust you the most.

676
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm not ruling the martial world for myself.

677
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,600
Ruling the martial world is boring.

678
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,230
But some people

679
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,830
are destined to rule the martial world.

680
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Don’t worry.

681
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,900
When my great cause is achieved,

682
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,180
you will

683
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,140
have your place beside me.

684
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,580
I-I can't get all of them.

685
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,660
They will be wary of me.

686
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,320
Be patient.

687
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,810
Let's take our time.

688
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,960
You know my uncle?

689
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,270
We are old friends.

690
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,140
Your uncle once said

691
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,420
if he dies,

692
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,640
he wants to be burried in Yunyin Mountain
where he studied

693
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,650
I just want to fulfill
my old friend's last wish.

694
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,390
Go to Yunyin Mountain with me to bury him.

695
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,540
It's always good

696
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,370
to have

697
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,860
[Tomb of Shan Gudao]

698
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,170
Senior,

699
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,800
you

700
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,510
Soon,

701
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,630
I will come and accompany you.

702
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,420
Li Lianhua,

703
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,270
can you tell me

704
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,980
the past of my master and my uncle?

705
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,590
You can bury my uncle

706
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,180
by his master's tomb.

707
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,150
You must know their past.

708
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,940
Although they are my family and grandmaster,

709
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,750
but I can only hear their story

710
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,500
from the rumors,

711
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,220
I really don't know anything about it.

712
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,760
Tell me about it.

713
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,410
Shan Gudao was only a teenager back then.

714
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,800
He barely lived on the street.

715
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,300
But he found an four-year-old orphan.

716
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Li Xiangyi,

717
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,710
you must be hungry.

718
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,640
Eat up.

719
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,030
You too.

720
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,530
I'm not hungry.

721
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,750
Eat up.

722
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,120
It's him. What are you doing?

723
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,660
Don't be afraid.

724
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,580
Beat him!

725
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,190
If Master Qi Mushan

726
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,280
didn't adopt them,

727
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,210
I wonder how long they can live.

728
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,870
My master must be grateful to uncle.

729
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,200
Li Xiangyi

730
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,050
should be grateful.

731
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,250
But he was born

732
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,100
rebellious

733
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,270
and always goes his own way.

734
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,390
Since he was a kid,

735
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,760
his senior has been treating him well.

736
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,580
But when he grew up,

737
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,470
he became more arrogant

738
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,390
and pissed his senior off,

739
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,750
which broke his heart.

740
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,980
Best in the martial world?

741
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,710
Master of the Sigu Sect?

742
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,690
He's just

743
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,030
a heartless person.

744
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,230
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,650
My master is not that kind of person.

746
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,230
Without him,

747
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,210
I would be

748
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,400
a cripple sitting on a chair.

749
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,190
When I was a kid, everyone laughed at me
and bullied me.

750
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,610
Only my master encouraged me
to practice martial arts.

751
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,180
He treated me like this,

752
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,750
how could he be cold to his senior?

753
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,460
Besides, everyone knows

754
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,090
he fought the Jinyuan Alliance

755
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,720
because of the death of Shan Gudao.

756
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,770
They should be very close.

757
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,370
Don't talk nonsense.

758
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,010
[Sigu Sect]

759
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,760
Today, Sigu Sect is established.

760
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,240
Red silk was lifted

761
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,660
to bring good luck.

762
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,530
Junior,

763
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,500
You're the master today now.

764
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,540
Why are you still acting like a child?

765
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,490
Senior, you're also the master.

766
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,460
From now on, we will

767
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,190
uphold the martial world together.

768
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,390
Good.

769
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,020
With me and the Sigu Sect,

770
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,150
there will be no evil in the martial world.

771
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,980
We will follow the master to the death!

772
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,300
All members of the Sigu Sect, listen up!

773
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,020
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance with me!

774
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,550
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance!

775
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,970
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance!

776
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,180
Let's go.

777
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,490
Yes.

778
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,200
No, Senior.

779
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:13,630
Junior,

780
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,460
what do you mean?

781
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,040
The master's order is here.

782
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,500
Sigu Sect can't act rashly

783
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,260
without my order.

784
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,180
The Jinyuan Alliance has done many evils,

785
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,020
why can't we eliminate them?

786
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,700
One year ago,

787
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,740
Sigu Sect destroyed the cult in Mobei.

788
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,690
Our vitality is greatly damaged.

789
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,360
Now the Jinyuan Alliance is more powerful.

790
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,660
I've made a treaty of peace
with Di Feisheng.

791
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,220
We won't interfere with each other

792
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,160
or draw a war in five years.

793
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,420
The martial world has been
turbulent for too long.

794
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,220
It's rare to have peace for five years.

795
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,570
Why do you want to break it?

796
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,810
You signed such an important agreement

797
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,800
without telling me?

798
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,720
That's the best choice.

799
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,440
Fine.

800
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,790
I don't need our people to help me.

801
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,860
The royal court has agreed to help me.

802
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,090
Stamp your master's seal

803
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,810
[To Shan Gudao]

804
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,380
on this secret letter.

805
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,450
Tomorrow, the royal court
will send a great army

806
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,820
to wipe out the Jinyuan Alliance.

807
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,680
Senior,

808
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,140
are you confused?

809
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,340
What?

810
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,980
If Sigu Sect is controlled
by the royal court,

811
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,350
it's no different from
the government offices.

812
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,430
Don't forget that

813
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,450
when we founded Sigu Sect,

814
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,760
we wanted an independent place
in the martial world

815
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,150
with absolutely justice.

816
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,720
Senior,

817
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,160
don't forget your original intention.

818
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
You're the one who's forgotten, not me.

819
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,130
You said

820
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,470
to uphold the martial world with me.

821
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,390
Now the Jinyuan Alliance has done many evils,

822
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,690
but you acted like a coward

823
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,390
and ignored them.

824
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,670
And you even signed an agreement with them

825
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,410
and kept all of us in the dark.

826
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,080
It's settled.

827
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,720
No more discussion.

828
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,280
Xiangyi,

829
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,040
Sigu Sect was established by us together.

830
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,820
You're not the dictator of it.

831
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,790
As long as it's beneficial to Sigu Sect,

832
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,920
what's wrong with being a dictator?

833
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,990
Xiangyi,

834
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,900
do you think

835
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,140
what you said is always right

836
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:21,800
and the truth?

837
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,780
Do you think Sigu Sect can't be without you?

838
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,740
Yes.

839
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,620
It has been proved over the years.

840
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,900
Exactly.

841
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,030
Sigu Sect can exist without anyone,

842
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,830
but not Li Xiangyi,

843
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,570
it can't.
