(Board Meeting to be Held to Discuss Dismissal of CEO)

3
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,729
Anyone who sends a false tip to the prosecution...

4
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,228
is charged with obstruction of justice.

5
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,368
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

(Witness)

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,068
What's the settlement cost for next month...

8
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,438
from the businesses in the department store?

9
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,480
- 140 million dollars, ma'am. - Make them into postdated checks.

10
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,479
- Sorry? - I'm going to invest...

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,078
those 140 million dollars into New Data Technology.

12
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,279
CEO Jin, that's the department store's...

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,279
I am Soonyang Department Store,

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,188
and Soonyang Department Store is me!

15
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,949
What's going on? That is Director Im's voice.

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,359
- Director Im? Why? - I have no idea.

17
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,688
Can anyone reach Director Im right now?

18
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,358
This recording was sent to the Prosecutors' Office...

19
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,230
by Ms. Im Myeong Sook, the former director of finance.

20
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,230
That was your voice, right?

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,709
So she secretly recorded our conversations?

22
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Since when?

23
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,709
I believe this proves that you are indeed guilty of embezzlement.

24
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,049
The false tip didn't come from Miracle.

25
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,120
It came from you, Ms. Jin.

26
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,129
(Episode 10)

27
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,509
As for Ms. Jin,

28
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,210
I'm afraid she'll be investigated for embezzlement.

29
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,009
Did you say the prosecutors obtained evidence...

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,849
from one of the directors at the department store?

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,650
I apologize, sir.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,590
When a dog bites its master,

33
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,830
whose fault is it?

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,299
Try all you want. 5 years? 10 years?

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,769
No. Even if I have to rot in prison for 50 years,

36
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,780
I will not hand over my shares to you.

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,549
Then I guess you'll end up rotting in prison,

38
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,949
and the department store stock will become worthless.

39
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,418
If you fail to pay off the promissory notes this month,

40
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,159
the department store will go bankrupt.

41
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,229
Then the creditors and banks will be the ones...

42
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,189
liquidating the subsidiaries that are of any worth.

43
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,829
If the group even had to lose its subsidiaries because of you,

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,629
do you think Grandfather would accept you back?

45
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,139
Thanks to you, Uncle Chang Je's political career would be over too.

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,509
Do you think he'll have you back?

47
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,280
This is your last chance. Hand over your shares.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,848
Then I'll let you keep your dignity...

49
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,449
as Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's only daughter.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,490
The prosecutors making you pose in front of the cameras...

51
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,219
I do not want Grandfather to see that.

52
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,198
Hey, why me? Why Soonyang Department Store?

53
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,729
I have never wronged you in any way!

54
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,439
You taught me.

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,840
Don't you dare delude yourself into thinking...

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,879
that you can be a rightful heir.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,379
You guys...

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,889
are different...

59
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,960
from us.

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,189
That I'd never be the rightful heir to Soonyang.

(Share Transfer Agreement)

62
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,870
Then I should buy it.

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,470
Like this.

(Reborn Rich)

67
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,149
It's an honour, sir. Please allow me to escort you.

68
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,670
I heard you made my one and only daughter...

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,938
cry her eyes out...

70
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,810
so you could make this department store all yours.

71
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,040
But seeing how you hired a management specialist...

72
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,980
Why? Do you not feel confident about running it after all?

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,519
This furniture boutique's sales...

74
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,860
rose by 380 percent.

75
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,430
We believe it's because people are finally...

76
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,329
getting married and moving now that the economy is improving.

77
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,069
All right.

78
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,069
Since you joined us, this furniture boutique...

79
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,540
has become one of the best-performing shops.

80
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,879
Have you set the sales goal for next year?

81
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,979
What's the goal?

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,948
Various indexes that directly affect furniture sales,

83
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,879
such as the country's birthrate and marriage rate,

84
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,149
keep on dropping every year.

85
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,458
We should be as conservative as possible when setting the goal...

86
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,899
Do Jun, you should get this CEO of yours a pair of reading glasses.

87
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,870
I guess his eyesight is bad. He can see one thing...

88
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,670
but not the other.

89
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,939
Pardon me?

90
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,169
Even if the population were to decrease,

91
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,639
the number of single-person households will continue to rise.

92
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,379
At the moment, we struggle to sell a couch to each household.

93
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,379
Soon, we'll be able to sell a couch for each room.

94
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,620
What's your problem? Do you not want to earn money?

95
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,889
I should've been more thoughtful, sir.

96
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,889
Please forgive me.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,068
Get your calculations right. Once you have set the sales target,

98
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,470
submit it to me.

99
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,040
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,568
How would you face your wife...

101
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,079
if you got fired before your contract was up?

102
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,249
As for Ms. Jin... It's not only circumstantial.

103
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,860
We have firm evidence that she committed embezzlement.

104
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,789
Yet you want me to wrap it up as a case of non-indictment?

105
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,088
What's the problem? She paid back what she had embezzled.

106
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,660
- Sir. - Prosecutor Seo.

107
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,670
You're young. Keep up with the trends, will you?

108
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,040
The ability to think flexibly is important in the 21st century.

109
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,309
I always thought it was such a shame that we were settling...

110
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,910
for a punishment-focused justice system.

111
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,378
It's about time the prosecution...

112
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,180
contributed to paving the way for reconciliation and forgiveness.

113
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,879
While she lost 140 million dollars due to a speculative investment,

114
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,519
a total of 37 businesses went bankrupt,

115
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,160
and 946 people lost their jobs.

116
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,329
Has she compensated the victims for their suffering?

117
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,399
Reconciliation and forgiveness?

118
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,029
Forcing the victims to forgive.

119
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,399
Do you call that restorative justice?

120
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,610
Aren't you doing this because you wish to reconcile with Soonyang?

121
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,910
Look, Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

122
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,449
Prosecutors have the right to prosecute crimes.

123
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,990
I'd like to exercise my rights and indict Ms. Jin.

124
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,289
Please help me, sir.

125
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,429
Darn it.

126
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,000
This is why I don't like working with women.

127
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,768
Hey, I bet you don't know...

128
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,940
why female prosecutors never get the key positions.

129
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,768
You never served in the army,

130
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,080
so you don't know how to work in an organization.

131
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,079
Article Seven of the Prosecutors' Office Act.

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,309
The Principle of Identity of Public Prosecutors. Don't you know?

133
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,148
"Obey any order of your superiors."

134
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,879
Just do as I say, you little brat!

135
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,690
I should get going.

136
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,959
- Grandfather. - Yes, I'm fine.

137
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,100
- Are you all right? - I'm totally fine.

138
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,879
- Here, have some water. - What? Okay, thanks.

139
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,029
Hey, take a seat.

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,769
Okay.

141
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,840
Keep this to yourself, Do Jun.

142
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,919
The doctors at the medical center wanted to run some tests on me,

143
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,250
so I took some X-rays.

144
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,690
What did the results say? Are you undergoing treatment?

145
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,499
For others, only their organs show up on their X-rays.

146
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,799
But below my chest, I have three things...

147
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,669
that others don't have.

148
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,110
Here resides my greed for money.

149
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,840
Here lies my distrust of those who work for me.

150
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,909
And down here...

151
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,379
is where you'd find...

152
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,980
my ability...

153
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,820
to betray anyone,

154
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,990
anytime.

155
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,570
You see,

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,210
I grew Soonyang to what it is today with those three things.

157
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,679
Did you say you wanted to buy Soonyang?

158
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,620
You won't be able to,

159
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,820
if all you've got is what everyone else has.

160
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,269
Let them...

161
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,870
do the work.

162
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,769
But...

163
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,440
never trust them.

164
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,679
Hwa Young ended up in that mess because she trusted her employees.

165
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,389
Do not trust anyone.

166
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,200
Do not open up to anyone.

167
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,870
If you do, it'll end up...

168
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,169
becoming nothing but your weakness.

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,679
You little rascal.

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm off.

171
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,499
Then I may distrust you...

172
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,960
and betray you too, Grandfather.

173
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,870
Will that be okay?

174
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,779
Do Jun.

175
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,720
Do you think...

176
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,450
I trust you?

177
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,429
Oh, dear.

178
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,389
The case has been reassigned to a different prosecutor.

179
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,990
It's obvious.

180
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,830
You're a woman of principle.

181
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,259
You'd never blindly obey Chief,

182
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,330
so I bet this was the only way.

183
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,509
I know you worked hard on the case.

184
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,539
I'm sorry this happened.

185
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,679
This means I won't have to work late for a while. This is great.

186
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,720
Well, since we have nothing to do today,

187
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,049
why don't we leave right on the dot for once?

188
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,750
Like other civil servants.

189
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,259
Bye, I'm off.

190
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,909
Let's meet up.

191
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,659
You knew from the get-go.

192
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,229
That I wouldn't be able to indict Jin Hwa Young...

193
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,259
and that I'd have no choice but to let it go.

194
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,700
I had never once heard from you...

195
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,500
until you suddenly showed up and tipped me off.

196
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,370
From beginning to end,

197
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,970
you used me.

198
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,210
You knew from the get-go...

199
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,549
that I didn't tip you off for the sake of law and order.

200
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,119
- Hey, that's... - "Let me use..."

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,990
"a third-generation heir to realize justice."

202
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,860
That's what you said. Don't you remember?

203
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,399
Hey, why... You really do have a way with words.

204
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,029
Do you take special lessons?

205
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,399
Do you take special lessons?

206
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,039
You're quite eloquent.

207
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,570
It is you.

208
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,740
The Seo Min Yeong I know.

209
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,250
Don't make that face.

210
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,990
Those eyes and that face, as if you know everything about me.

211
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,850
Don't do that.

212
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,190
I nearly bought...

213
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,830
your lie.

214
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,940
I'll become a great prosecutor?

215
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,168
When my boss told me I'd never be able to return...

216
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,240
to the Central Office if I got transferred because of this,

217
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,009
I couldn't even say anything...

218
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,480
because I didn't want to grow old as a mediocre civil servant...

219
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,609
who had to pack up every two years...

220
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,850
to transfer from a small-town office to another.

221
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,990
I'm so cowardly and materialistic.

222
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,919
You think I'll be a good prosecutor?

223
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,600
I bet you have no idea how sly I can be.

224
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,669
When they reassigned the case to someone else to reprimand me,

225
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,070
everyone else in the office was worried about me.

226
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,110
But the truth is, I was so relieved...

227
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,909
because it meant that no one would ever find out...

228
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,649
how cowardly and servile I was...

229
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,789
in front of my boss.

230
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,740
Why are you telling me all this?

231
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,710
I wonder too.

232
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,779
I always let you see right through me.

233
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,250
From the very beginning...

234
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,660
I should get going before I give more away.

235
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,789
I won't be a great prosecutor,

236
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,130
which means...

237
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,730
you lied to me.

("Explore Current Affairs," Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong)

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:27,980
Oh, my.

241
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,008
- I can't believe this. - Me neither.

Isn't he so cool?

244
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,018
- This feels so surreal. - I know.

245
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,890
- I knew it. - I love him so much.

Who says...

250
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,490
I lied to you?

251
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Let's go.

252
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,890
I wanted to show you.

253
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,289
What?

254
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,089
Look.

Do you still think...

258
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,390
I lied to you?

00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,200
If you can't trust yourself,

260
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,640
just trust me, Min Yeong.

261
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,680
The Seo Min Yeong I know...

262
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,880
will become a great prosecutor. I'm sure of it.

263
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,039
I told you to stop making that face.

264
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,419
The foreign exchange crisis, also known as the IMF crisis...

265
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,719
that occurred 3 years 8 months ago...

266
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,549
has officially ended today.

267
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,588
We have officially graduated...

268
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,288
from IMF.

269
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,660
Once again, I deeply express my gratitude.

270
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,429
Babies' first-birthday rings and wedding rings came out...

271
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,599
of wardrobes,

272
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,829
and people collected dollars cooperatively.

273
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,469
But as corporate restructuring started...

274
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,970
due to sovereign default,

275
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,609
jobless and homeless people increased exponentially.

276
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,368
By working our fingers to the bone...

277
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,279
and repaying the IMF debt of 19.5 billion dollars today,

278
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,179
the economic indicators...

279
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,680
such as foreign exchange reserve increase improved,

280
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:59,480
and foreigner investors have returned as well.

281
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,720
Does this make sense?

282
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,858
The redemption period Korea promised IMF...

283
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,588
was 2004, which is 3 years later.

284
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,558
Nobody from Wall Street expected Korea...

285
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,829
to repay the debt this fast.

286
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,829
Can you explain this?

287
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,369
Didn't you know?

288
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,939
It is Koreans' hobby to overcome a national crisis.

289
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,839
No. What I mean is,

290
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:28,479
how could you have been the only one who predicted this accurately?

291
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,579
Just like when IMF started.

292
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,220
Do you know what's the strangest?

293
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,890
You don't get excited at all.

294
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,818
If I were you, I wouldn't be here.

295
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,758
If the world moved as I predicted,

296
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,960
I would have died from my heart exploding...

297
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:45,730
or would have been jailed for leading a cult.

298
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,829
Calm down.

299
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,569
How can you stay so calm at that age?

300
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,210
It's as if you're much older.

301
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,309
Is that it?

302
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,980
Are you from another universe?

303
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,549
Don't laugh at his jokes.

304
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
It's Miracle Investment's investment rule.

305
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,559
You need to keep your cool when evaluating a performance.

306
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,529
I looked into it with a cool head.

307
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,460
Wouldn't the president who even won the Nobel Peace Prize...

308
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,268
want to secure the title of finishing IMF early...

309
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,529
no matter what?

310
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
- Especially before... - The presidential election.

311
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,339

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:29,940
So?

As expected, all economic policies were focused...

314
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,650
on securing dollars.

315
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,150
By opening the market to foreign investors?

316
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,250
Yes.

317
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,459
From now on, money will decide the big and small events...

318

of companies.

319
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,160
And that will be...

320
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,390
a good opportunity...

321
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,000

324

How can we do business when the bank loan rate is so high?

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,750
Not manufacturing, but finance.

334
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,420
By finance,

335
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,289
do you mean insurance and investment?

336
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,229
Here is the plan for establishing...

337
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,259
Soonyang Financial Holding Company as instructed.

338
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,900
By Soonyang Financial Holding Company, you mean...

339
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,539
Soonyang Investment, Card, Insurance, Savings and so on.

340
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,369
To strengthen the affiliates related to finance,

341
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,809
he's planning to set up a financial holding company.

342
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,779
That's why you transferred 34 percent of Soonyang Card's share...

343
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,950
that was owned by Soonyang Electronics...

344
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,690
to Soonyang Insurance?

345
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,390
To set up a financial holding company separate from manufacturing?

346
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,959
It was unexpected of him...

347
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,759
to set up Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

348
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,269
Chairman Jin finally made a move.

349
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,769
He went against the political regulation,

350
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,910
the separation of industrial and financial capital.

351
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,440
That's merely a justification.

352
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,710
He's thinking of something else on the inside.

353
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,619
Did you not hear what Direct Jung of the medical center say?

354
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,490
There's a time bomb...

355
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,960
in my father's head.

356
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,490
There's a reason he is in a rush.

357
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,730
- Then why... - Think about it.

358
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,669
What will happen if Soonyang Financial Holding Company...

359
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,269
secures just five percent of Soonyang Corporation?

360
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,569
It can exert influence on every manufacturing affiliate...

361
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,279
- under Soonyang Corporation. - Bingo.

362
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,079
The owner of the financial holding company...

363
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,450
will become the owner of Soonyang Group.

364
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,819
(Daily Report on Executive Manager Jin Seong Jun)

365
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,959
It would be perfect for Seong Jun to take a position...

366
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,430
in the financial holding company.

367
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,339
Hyeon Min is doing her best every day.

368
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,740
To soothe your anger.

369
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,579
Seong Jun repented a lot for the past two years.

370
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,690
Look, Father.

371
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,789
(Daily Report on Executive Manager Jin Seong Jun)

372
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,959
He's getting along really well with the employees...

373
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,759
and is down-to-earth...

374
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,170
that most employees don't know...

375
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,240
that he is your eldest grandson.

376
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,339
The distribution warehouse has the highest sales as well.

377
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,180
You're right.

378
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,210
He's getting along well.

379
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,549
Tell him to stay there.

380
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,619
It suits him perfectly.

381
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,390
I'm too ashamed to see Hyeon Min, that's why.

382
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,599
Father, please.

383
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,500
Welcome.

384
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,200
- Welcome back. - Welcome back.

385
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:57,640
Hello, Hyeon Min.

386
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:59,940
You're here, Aunt Ji Na.

387
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,279
Why do you look so dull?

388
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,650
Living with your in-laws must be hard.

389
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,818
Tell me about it. You have both mother-in-law...

390
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:09,519
and grandmother-in-law.

391
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,288
Your grandmother-in-law is difficult,

392
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,589
and your mother-in-law is fussy.

393
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,160
On top of that,

394
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,930
your aunt-in-law is rude.

395
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,299
- Jeong Rae. - Hyeon Min.

396
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,298
How are you managing your facial expression...

397
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,499
that you get such a comment?

398
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,240
Remember you're living with your grandparents-in-law.

399
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,108
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,609
Why are you scolding her?

401
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,308
I'm the one you dislike.

402
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,450
You know that well.

403
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,920
If you have anything to say to her, tell me instead.

404
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,749
- Okay. - She's already having it hard...

405
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,989
with her in-laws. You don't need to add to that.

406
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,019
Sure.

407
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,670
Why would you take your sorrow of not having a son out on her?

408
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,769
If I talk to you,

409
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,970
would you even understand?

410
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,109
A special exhibition of Yun Hyong Keun...

411
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,219
and Park Seo Bo will be held at Hyeon Min's gallery,

412
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
so I wanted to buy some paintings.

413
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,049
Do you even know...

414
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,589
what monochrome painting...

415
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,019
or abstract art is?

416
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,559
What about pointillism?

417
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,160
The only art you know...

418
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,200
is the oriental art on your cushion.

419
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,049
- Are you done talking? - Yes.

420
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,740
What...

421
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,108
What are you doing? You're so uncultured!

422
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,249
Yes! I'm the daughter of a private loan market's financer,

423
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,880
and you're the daughter of a finance minister.

424
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,250
Seong Jun is going through this hardship because of you!

425
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,490
What do you think you are doing?

426
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,730
Your father is here.

427
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,640
Mother.

428
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,869
Jeong Rae.

429
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,740
Did you do this to her?

430
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,710
It's me, Grandmother. I did it.

431
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,419
Excuse me, bring the cleaning equipment.

432
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,450
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,839
You did?

434
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,769
I stumbled while I was walking down the stairs.

435
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,609
I'm sorry for making a fuss.

436
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,750
Are you okay, Aunt Ji Na?

437
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,019
Hyeon Min.

438
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,519
Come to my gallery.

439
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,789
I'll give you a nice painting as a present.

440
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,288
Mother really liked the monochrome paintings...

441
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,759
of Painter Park Seo Bo as well.

442
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,299
Because she could feel the ascetic life of the painter.

443
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,339
Do you think this makes sense?

444
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,869
You know Jung Hee Gu, the multi-level financial scammer?

445
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I just came back from interviewing the victim,

446
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,380
and it's a total nightmare for them.

447
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:30,879
She invested 250,000 dollars...

448
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,149
which was her daughter's death benefit,

449
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,420
but she couldn't get back a cent.

450
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,949
But Jung Hee Gu, that jerk,

451
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,390
won't even get punished because he died in Southeast Asia.

452
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,490
Imagine how wronged she feels. It was her daughter's death benefit.

453
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:43,789
Don't you think so?

454
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,630
I see.

455
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,000
You worked hard.

456
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,670
Being late for 40 minutes is not bad.

457
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,240
Thank you.

458
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,509
I know you're late from listening to her story.

459
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,719
So stop being sorry, and let's eat.

460
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,119
When did you order?

461
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,190
Just now.

462
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,230
When you were running and fixing your makeup.

463
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,829
I don't get it.

464
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
What do you mean?

465
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,500
Why do you need to fix your makeup when you're pretty?

466
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,369
Eat up.

467
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,210
Thank you.

468
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,349
What a world.

469
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,719
The damage was over four billion dollars,

470
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,360
and there were over 70,000 innocent victims.

471
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,530
But in the end,

472
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,460
the case was closed for not having the authority to file prosecution.

473
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,670
Capital market runs...

474
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,300
on an appropriate amount of ignorance and greed.

475
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:10,610
Is Miracle Investment in that market as well?

476
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,690
Why? Are you worried?

477
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,260
That I might stand in front of you as a suspect?

478
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,050
You know New Data Technology, right?

479
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,250
I heard it was under investigation.

480
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,459
They are investigating accounting fraud...

481
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,360
and matched orders.

482
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,860
We received a complaint.

483
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,259
A third-generation conglomerate family member...

484
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,030
is one of the people who manipulated stock prices.

485
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,900
The rich are always greedier.

486
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,840
Prosecutor Seo, take charge of the case from search and seizure.

487
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,170
It's a sensitive matter.

488
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,510
It says whose son he is, right?

489
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,780
They wrote the news without checking the facts?

490
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,518
Which newspaper company is it?

491
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,249
Hyunsung Daily released it on the internet first...

492
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,719
saying it's exclusive news.

493
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,089
Hyunsung Daily?

494
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,030
Now, evening economic newspapers will follow suit...

495
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,230
and 9pm news will become their speakers.

496
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,800
Look.

What operation? Does this make sense? Me?

500
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,480
We got dragged into their operation.

501
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,309
Darn it.

502
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,009
We're from the prosecution. Stop what you're doing...

503
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,150
and get up from your seat.

Everyone, stand up.

I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong of FTCD...

at Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

507
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,319
We received a complaint saying Miracle Investment...

508
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,119
was systematically involved in the stock price manipulation...

509
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,889

Will you cooperate?

513
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,380
Based on the information you tipped off,

514
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,079
the prosecution is investigating.

515
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,250
Isn't it strange?

516
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,550
Do Jun...

517
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,988
sold off all of his shares of New Data Technology...

518
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,360
right before the stock price plummeted.

519
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,819
As if he knew...

520
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,530
what was going to happen after that.

521
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,599
Internal trading using private information?

522
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,139
He was able to set a perfect trap for my wife because of that too?

523
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,239
Oh, dear.

524
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,280
Anyway,

525
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,579
deal with him well...

so that Hwa Young doesn't feel wronged.

527

But...

528
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,118
it is against the securities exchange act,

529
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,460
but it won't be easy.

530
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,788
It's always hard to prove that they used internal information...

Does that matter?

A trial doesn't only take place in court.

534
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,968
I see.

535
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,340
Why did he manipulate the stock price? What does he lack?

536
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,138

An official says other than Mr. Jin of a certain company,

542
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,388
three more heirs of conglomerates are suspected to be involved,

543
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,129
but it is not easy to prove the charge against them,

544
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,170
so they cannot investigate openly.

545
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,500
The stock price manipulation...

546
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,679
Are you holding a court of public opinion first?

547
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,280
When the prosecutor in charge just started?

548
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,920
Am I that unreliable?

549
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,058
Or are you not confident of this case?

550
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,718
He's the third-generation heir of Soonyang.

551

You're relying on whimsical public opinion...

because you're afraid of Soonyang?

00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,598
You're a prosecutor, at that. How embarrassing.

don't share internal information with reporters in a sauna.

560

and investigate the case thoroughly...

571
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,710
I'm going to repeat what you just said.

You want to cancel...

573
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,949
Of course. I will return your investment according to the process.

Miracle Investment won't be shaken just from this.

575
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,759
As you know, there aren't many investment companies...

576
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,789
in the market that makes as much profit as us.

577
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,599
Okay. I'm hanging up.

578
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,070
I gave it a thought.

579
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,538
They attacked us with New Data Technology...

580
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,239
and even moved the prosecution,

581
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,380
so I thought it was CEO Jin Hwa Young taking revenge.

582
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,110
But no.

583
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,578
They know about the flow of our stock trading in detail.

584
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,679
- That means... - Yes.

585
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:26,219
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki of Soonyang Investment.

586
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,559
If you meet him, tell him...

587
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,260
that his operation was successful.

588
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:35,599
How many people want...

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,699
their investment returned?

590
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,670
For rich people, security is as important as the rate of return.

591

A scandal like this...

592
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,880
- is critical. - Exactly.

593
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,079
How much is it?

594
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,750
Hello, sir.

00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,320
- Yes. - Thank you.

597

Grandfather is very worried about you.

598
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,439
I'm finding out...

599
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,909
just how strong Hyunsung Daily is.

600
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,849
If you need my help, tell me anytime.

601
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,550
We're family.

602
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,789
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

603
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,630
You should go inside. The elders must be waiting.

604
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,610
Is it true?

605
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Well...

606
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,989
I never considered stock manipulation, Grandfather.

607
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:06,519
What I made from New Data Technology...

608
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,789
was just average by Miracle's standards.

609
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,599
Then...

610
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,070
is this innocent kid...

611
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,170
being harassed by the joint forces of the media and prosecution?

612
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,010
My own grandson?

613
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,610
They should know better.

614
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,149
Do you want me to call Director Park at the Central Prosecutors' Office?

615
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,218
You can't do that, not in this day and age.

616
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,948
Just one missed call from you...

617
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:39,019
will make them say we're invading their right to investigate.

618
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,789
Is that what you want them to say, Father?

619
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,260
Right now,

620
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,969
the investigation isn't what Do Jun should be worrying about.

621
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,699
Miracle's investors are calling, demanding refunds.

622
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:57,670
They want their money back.

623
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,840
It'll be too much for him to handle on his own.

624
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,249
Miracle must handle a massive amount of cash.

625
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,078
He can't retrieve it all immediately.

626
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,718
How much longer do you think he can survive...

627
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,320
without an influx of capital?

628
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:17,929
What do you think will happen if he can't return the investments?

629
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,360
Soonyang will be the one to take the hit.

630
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,530
They'll say the financial market isn't a playground for the rich.

631
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,199
Then what?

632
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,570
Do you have a solution?

633
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,480
Miracle Investment...

634
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,579
Soonyang Investment will acquire the company.

635
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,320
Let's turn it into a PR coup, Father.

636
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,260
An uncle who took responsibility for his nephew's errors.

637
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,399
If Soonyang gets involved, the investors will calm down,

638
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,199
and they'll stop demanding a refund.

639
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,868
If Soonyang Investment takes over Miracle,

640
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,738
financial authorities will stop complaining we're amassing...

641
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,949
a slush fund or that we must be investigated for tax evasion.

642
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,860
It makes sense.

643
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:29,000
- Grandfather... - Dong Ki.

644
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,699
Then...

645
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,900
you'd better pay Do Jun...

646
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,639
the right price.

647
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,179
Yes.

648
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,380
Good.

649
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,480
That's done.

650
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,449
Grandfather.

651
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,889
All I need right now is time.

652
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,559
Once the prosecutors realize I didn't manipulate the stock price,

653
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,760
everything will go back to normal.

654
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,230
You don't have to worry about Miracle.

655
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,869
Come on.

656
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,199
I'm not worried about you.

657
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,179
It's Soonyang, that I'm worried about.

658
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,550
Okay?

659
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,829
Right now, we need 480 million. There's no other way.

660
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,829
The Soonyang Department Store and Ahjin Motors shares we own.

661
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,868
We have to sell them all.

662
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,610
There's no guarantee we can liquidate it all.

663
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,039
In the current market,

664
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,038
finding someone with that much buying power...

665
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,439
will take time.

666
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,780
What if we take longer and miss the repayment deadline?

667
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,949
That could cause a massive delay.

668
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,750
Darn it.

669
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,949
Will you say something? Anything.

670
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,820
I'm getting frustrated over here.

671
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,260
If I speak up,

672
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:08,099
will you two do as I say?

673
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,509
There can be no issues with the repayment schedule.

674
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,780
No delay, suspension, or legal restrictions.

675
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,348
Because then, Jin Yang Cheol will get involved...

676
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:26,518
and won't stop at anything to feed Miracle...

677
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:27,749
to Soonyang Investment.

678
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,948
So what?

679
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,519
The overseas shares Miracle invested in.

680
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,960
Liquidate them all.

681
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,559
Rachael. How much will that be worth in today's exchange rate?

682
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,159
You want to bring that money in now?

683
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,029
When prosecutors are watching...

684
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,969
this black-haired foreigner so closely?

685
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:49,339
Wake up. We'll never see a cent of it if you do that.

686
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,010
They'll take it all saying it's tax.

687
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,840
Wouldn't that be a waste?

688
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,178
Those overseas shares ensured us a stable profit...

689
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,280
over the past five years.

690
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,550
Mr. Oh.

691
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,050
Do you remember what I said to you five years ago in the US?

692
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,420
I asked you...

693
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,760
to turn my hunch into data and profits.

694
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,300
This is the only option I can think of.

695
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,099
Retrieve everything we invested overseas. Please.

696
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,650
To uproot Do Jun completely,

697
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,420
this is the perfect timing.

698
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,519
According to numerology,

699
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,260
Do Jun's time and date of birth clash with the current time.

700
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,630
The negative energy,

701
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,199
the misfortune index has doubled.

702
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,630
What's the clash?

703
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,539
Figuratively, "a tiger bites and you bleed."

704
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,099
In other words, you will die an unnatural death.

705
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,539
He'll die away from home.

706
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,840
The one issue is,

707
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,780
if you factor in his date of birth,

708
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:07,419
if he manages to overcome the tiger's deadly bite,

709
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,849
he can attain riches and fame beyond that of anyone else's.

710
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,190
So I must not miss out this time?

711
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,730
I must do whatever I can to make Miracle mine.

712
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,059
Make the call.

713
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,699
Tell that guy to bring me Do Jun's investment portfolio.

714
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:34,139
- Sir. - Yes?

715
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:38,309
Do you think the prosecutors could find Do Jun guilty?

716
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,650
I'm a businessman.

717
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,879
If you make money, you're innocent.

718
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,150
If you lose money, you're guilty. That's it.

719
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,730
Mr. Lee. Do you know...

720
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,530
what's most important in the capital market?

721
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,400
- No. - The IMF said...

722
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,999
- it's the global standard. - What?

723
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,638
Work like a dog to spend like a mogul.

724
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,579
That's the Korean standard.

725
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,280
The global standard says we must earn like a mogul too.

726
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,320
Without getting dirty.

727
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,449
While observing the law.

728
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,619
And being moral.

729
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,829
The capital market won't consider Do Jun as a mogul.

730
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,969
He's dirty all over.

731
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,939
Is that why you agreed...

732
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,969
to let Mr. Jin Dong Ki take over Miracle?

733
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,170
Dong Ki is good with numbers.

734
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,178
He pushed aside Heavy Machinery and Chemicals...

735
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,079
to take over the investment and insurance business.

736
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,650
If the picture he wants to paint is the same as mine,

737
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
it wouldn't be a bad idea...

738
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,159
for Dong Ki to take my seat.

739
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,230
The financial holding company.

740
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,929
Will you give it to him?

741

743
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:28,820
So...

744
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:32,488
Miracle's incredible rate of earnings...

745
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,159
was due to overseas shares?

746
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,760
Yes, sir.

747
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,800
And these are what they invested in?

748
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,239
Give it to him.

749
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,519
- I'll leave now, sir. - Okay.

750
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:59,019
- I expect a lot from you. - Okay. Thank you.

751
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,840
I know that...

752
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,309
a terrible tragedy that no one can even imagine...

753
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,480
is about to happen.

754
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,829
What happened when I was a child in my other life.

755
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:40,899
If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign.

756
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,198
Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung of the Democratic Party...

757
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,768
decided against single candidacy earlier today.

758
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:49,569
An aircraft with 95 passengers and 20 flight attendants...

759
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,939
went missing above Yangon, Myanmar.

760
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,710
They also most definitely happen in my current lifetime...

761
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:57,480
of Jin Do Jun.

762
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,920
As if mocking...

763
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,650
my efforts and desires.

764
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,829
They most definitely happen.

765
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,130
All I can do...

766
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,969
is to make my own choices.

767
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,109
This just came in.

768
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,218
You're looking at a clearly very disturbing live shot there.

769
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,618
A plane has crashed into one of the towers...

770
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,349
of the World Trade Center this morning.

771
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,300
What effects do we expect?

772
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,968
How much will we lose?

773
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,698
Between 10 to 15 for KOSDAQ, 17 for KOSPI.

774
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,368
Korea's stock market will open three hours later tomorrow.

775
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,110
The US market will be closed for four days.

776
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:58,669
As soon as it opens tomorrow,

777
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,779
people will sell in a panic across all industries.

778
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,939
Call the fund managers and traders.

779
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,078
Tell them to sell the prices-sensitive stocks first.

780
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,948
Have them on standby three hours ahead!

781
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:07,980
Yes, sir.

782
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,360
Sir. There's another more pressing issue.

783
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,530
The shares you bought in New York...

784
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,630
that were in Miracle's portfolio.

785
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,639
Airlines, hotels, travel agencies, and insurance companies.

786
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:30,170
They're businesses that'll suffer the most after this incident.

787
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,710
A loss is inevitable.

788
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,539
You punk!

789
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,380
This is all on you.

790
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,988
You said Do Jun is lucky with money!

791
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:44,989
I apologize, sir.

792
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,289
Scrape together all the money we have.

793
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:55,099
As soon as the market opens tomorrow,

794
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,730
buy put options.

795
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,499
Put options?

796
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,769
They're designed to protect you against a loss!

797

Even if the stock market crashes,

798
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,780
I will survive and get out somehow.

00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,619
No, right?

800
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,920
Young expat, you didn't know this would happen.

801
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,899
How could you have known?

802
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,030
Not even the FBI or CIA knew.

803
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,670
It was the only option...

804
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,639
we could choose.

805
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,070
It was a terrorist attack in the center of New York.

806
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,139
No one can say when Wall Street will recover from the shock.

807
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,249
If we hadn't done...

808
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,979
what you'd said and didn't sell our shares in the overseas markets...

809
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,050
Mr. Oh.

810
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,389
To all the victims of this attack,

811
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:52,949
send a donation.

812
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,320
In Miracle's name.

813
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,699
Why don't we buy some put options?

814
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,139
The market will crash for the next few days.

815
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,369
We made a lot from selling all we had in the New York market.

816
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,510
When the market opens tomorrow,

817
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,739
people will try to sell whatever they own.

818
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:19,150
I'll buy up some blue-chip stocks.

819
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,579
You'll go against the tide?

820
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,989
If you buy put options that bet the market will crash,

821
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,019
we could make some money.

822
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,989
Because that's going with the flow.

823
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,130
But what I want...

824
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,900
is to change the flow.

825
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,300

00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,889
By our hands, with our efforts,

831
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,550
let's buy miracles.

832
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,920
Buy Miracle.

833
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:03,159
We believe in the Korean economy.

834
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,159
Miracle Investment.

835
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,828
Do Jun's using aggressive strategies to make funds...

836
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,699
more accessible and popular.

837
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,670
It's just that the domestic stock market...

838
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,969
hasn't yet recovered from the 9-11 attacks.

839
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,969
(Buy Miracle)

840
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:24,179
What's today's KOSPI index?

841
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:28,550
The KOSPI index is 472 points, the lowest it has ever been,

842
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,519
but that's okay.

843
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,320
After just one week, the Buy Miracle Fund...

844
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,319
(Accumulated sales exceeded 1 billion dollars)

845
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,690
exceeded one billion dollars.

846
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:42,099
Young expat, ever heard of "Retire45" or "56Thief?"

847
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,900
The retirement age is 45.

848
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,069
If you stay on until you're 56, you're a thief.

849
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,269
What about "38 Line?"

850
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:51,409
If you turn 38,

851
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,880
you're nearing the end of your working life.

852
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,178
That's the 38 Line.

853
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:59,249
Right. They're all people who can't rely on the interest rate.

854
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,320
Our clients.

855
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,650
Buy Miracle Fund will end the age of saving accounts...

856
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,650
and open the age of investments.

857
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:08,559
(Accumulated sales exceeded 1 billion dollars)

858
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,769
Buy Miracle Fund was released two weeks ago,

859
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,940
and we now have four billion dollars.

860
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,538
Yes!

861
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:25,669
Other funds that our competitors launched...

862
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,980
are doing well also.

863
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,210
Altogether, the money we flooded the market with is 90 billion.

864
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:31,379
(Fund sales on a high, 90 billion)

865
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,819
The KOSPI index has been rising for a month...

866
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,280
and broke the 540 mark.

867
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,989
We're completely over the 9-11 attacks.

868
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,590
Young expat.

869
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,760
You did change the flow.

870
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,130
(Stock Market)

871
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,399
Isn't this all wrong?

872
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,738
(Stock Market)

873
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,010
How can the KOSPI index...

874
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,940
be on the rise already?

875
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:04,710
Answer me!

876
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,078
Over 3,000 died in a terrorist attack...

877
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,618
in the center of New York.

878
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:13,690
So how, why, how on earth...

879
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,130
How could things recover after just one month?

880
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,699
Where are all the people who said there'd be a war?

881
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:23,229
How come everything is so peaceful?

882
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,670
(Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki)

883
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,099
The US lowered the interest rate, improving liquidity.

884
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,409
Future stocks sold at a record high,

885
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,779
so the ten million dollars you invested in put options...

886
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,949
in case the market crashed...

887
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,849
was lost.

888
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:46,219
No one could have foreseen this kind of bull market.

889
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,319
Miracle Investment's Buy Miracle fund.

890
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,590
Who could've thought they'd create such a dramatic turnaround...

891
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,489
in the Korean market?

892
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:56,429
Why you...

893
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:02,369
Sir, you have a visitor.

894
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,719
Hello, Mr. Baek.

895
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,320
Thank you.

896
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:25,460
Hello, Uncle.

897
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,670
"Buy Miracle?"

898
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,268
You scraped together what little you had to launch...

899
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:36,939
a successful fund,

900
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,269
and you're acting like a victorious hero.

901
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:43,639
Do you think I don't know? You also...

902
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,280
You lost just as much as I did.

903
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,218
The airlines, travel agencies, hotels, and insurance companies...

904
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:51,820
you'd invested in through the New York Stock Exchange.

905
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,689
Do you think I don't know you lost all that...

906
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,059
in the 9-11 terrorist attacks?

907
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:58,559
Oh, that?

908
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,428
New York Air, the Lavender Hotel chain,

909
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:05,469
Seventy Insurance, and Tour Eagles?

910
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,739
How odd.

911
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,239
Miracle's investment portfolio is top secret.

912
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,079
How do you know all that?

913
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,519
You can't let in a neighbour’s dog just because they're cute.

914
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,360
You're the one who'll lose out.

915
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,360
You punk!

916
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,210
Why did you come here?

917
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,219
Did you come here to lecture me?

918
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:56,750
No.

919
01:01:58,389 --> 01:01:59,690
I'm here to buy...

920
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,389
Soonyang Investment.

921
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,659
What?

922
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,409
Regardless of the country's economy,

923
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,639
regardless of whether your customers lose their savings,

924
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,308
you're praying the market will crash...

925
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,679
when you're the head of an investment company.

926
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,750
I can't let you stay in charge any longer.

927
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:35,590
Do Jun.

928
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,130
Do Jun!

929
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:45,500
Do you think...

930
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,769
the world will go the way you want?

931
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,079
Of course not.

932
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,849
Oh, right.

933
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,980
The National Pension, Teachers' Pension,

934
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,679
and Pension and Funds Bureau...

935
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,219
decided to cut ties with Soonyang Investment.

936
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,789
What?

937
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:15,059
Oh, you didn't know?

938
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:26,209
You lost over ten million dollars...

939
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,980
in a speculative put option investment,

940
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,678
and they want to hold you responsible...

941
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,650
for the extreme and dogmatic decision.

942
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:39,190
Uncle. The Pension and Funds Bureau.

943
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:43,359
They're your largest client and second majority shareholder...

944
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,860
with a 12-percent stake.

945
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,329
If they cut ties with you,

946
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,900
does that mean selling their stake...

947
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,199
or cancelling all transactions?

948
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,840
No, wait. It could be both.

949
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,909
Too bad.

950
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,690
If Miracle were to take over...

951
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:13,090
and we appoint...

952
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,359
(Contract of Acquisition)

953
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,130
an investment expert,

954
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,860
the worst can be avoided.

955
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:29,539
A nephew takes the responsibility for his uncle's shortcomings.

956
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,510
I like that picture.

957
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,949
Here you go.

958
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,329
- Have a coffee. - Thank you.

959
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,099
Mr. Ha. I have a question.

960
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:08,239
You could've gone back to work for Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

961
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,409
Why did you choose me?

962
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,849
I didn't make a choice.

963
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:19,289
If I were to lose this job,

964
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,360
it would only mean I'd messed up.

965
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:28,159
Do you think anyone at Soonyang would take me back then?

966
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,570
From the start, I was never allowed...

967
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,070
a choice.

968
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:43,539
You were born into this family as 4-2,

969
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,510
so you wouldn't get it.

970
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:48,150
I'm 4-2?

971
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:54,260
My gosh. I apologize.

972
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:00,730
Chairman Jin's fourth son's second son.

973
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,530
Is that it?

974
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,769
Yes.

975
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,769
That 4-2...

976
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:13,840
asks you to do your best.

977
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,880
Right.

978
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,119
Thank you.

979
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:25,420
Move.

980
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:28,920
Where is Father?

981
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,929
What a lovely sight.

982
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,699
Mom. Where is Father?

983
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,158
Father!

984
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,269
Dong Ki!

985
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:41,170
You, stay out of it.

986
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,369
Father, where are you? Come on out!

987
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,980
I have something to settle with the old man!

988
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,949
Father, I have something to say!

989
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,150
What's all this noise about?

990
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,449
Father.

991
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,059
I know everything.

992
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:06,130
I know that...

993
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,030
you're behind Do Jun. I know that now.

994
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,768
Hwa Young and I,

995
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:15,968
the fact that we lost everything...

996
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:18,468
to our nephew who's just a kid.

997
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,738
It makes no sense...

998
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,939
unless you're behind him!

999
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,210
- That's enough! - Soonyang!

1000
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:29,650
You wanted Do Jun to take over from the very beginning.

1001
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:32,920
Isn't that so? Right?

1002
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:36,289
Why... Why is it...

1003
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:38,788
Why is it always me...

1004
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:43,460
Why am I always pushed to the wayside?

1005
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:46,530
My gosh...

1006
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,610
How much longer must I struggle and grovel?

1007
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,738
What can I do, what am I to do to make you care about me?

1008
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,050
For how long...

1009
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,480
How much longer must I live like this for?

1010
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,219
My gosh... Father.

1011
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,828
Father...

1012
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:17,199
Is that all he's capable of?

1013
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,000
My goodness.

1014
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:23,670
I had no idea.

1015
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,310
Father.

1016
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,710
Father.

1017
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:42,720
It's cold outside.

1018
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:45,229
I'm burning with fury inside.

1019
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:51,670
You must sort things out for them before it's too late.

1020
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:55,938
Making sure the siblings stay close is another way to protect Soonyang.

1021
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:57,069
It's only natural...

1022
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,438
that they resent Do Jun.

1023
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:03,840
Hang Jae, do you also think Do Jun is going too far?

1024
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,220
What are you doing here?

1025
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,029
The chairman wants to see you.

1026
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,569
What? You look like you saw a ghost.

1027
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:30,239
You didn't call ahead.

1028
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:32,140
Get in.

1029
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,909
There's somewhere we must go.

1030
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,300
Do you think this is allowed?

1031
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,999
Hwa Young and Dong Ki...

1032
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,439
are your aunt and uncle.

1033
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:07,409
They're my kids.

1034
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,439
Your father's siblings.

1035
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,380
Must you go to the very end?

1036
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,920
If need be.

1037
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:22,289
What?

1038
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,159
I guess I'm like you.

1039
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:29,760
I have three extra things in here.

1040
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:33,630
They're full of greed, suspicion, and change of mind.

1041
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,640
That's three.

1042
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:59,229
What?

1043
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Are you sure?

1044
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,430
Father...

1045
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,270
is with Do Jun?

1046
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:12,770
- What? - A press conference is scheduled.

1047
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,278
Reporters from TV stations and the major papers...

1048
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,539
are waiting for the chairman to arrive.

1049
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,720
He's going to make it official.

1050
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,220
Without even a word to us.

1051
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,618
(Soonyang History Museum)

1052
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:30,059
- Where's the chairman? - What's going on?

1053
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,559
- Can you tell us what it's about? - What do you know?

1054
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,728
Any comments, sir?

1055
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:36,229
Calm down, please, everyone.

1056
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,000
This press conference is about...

1057
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,270
Soonyang Financial Holding Company's establishment.

1058
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,398
We'll begin as soon as the chairman arrives which will be shortly.

1059
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,739
Please bear with us.

1060
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,339
Is it true the holding company is to decide who his heir will be?

1061
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,608
Has he decided on someone?

1062
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,608
Will the new CEO become his successor?

1063
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:52,979
- Please tell us. - Come on, now.

1064
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:56,850
Please ask those questions to the chairman himself.

1065
01:11:58,289 --> 01:12:00,649
Do Jun, how about you run it?

1066
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,119
Pardon?

1067
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,430
Soonyang Financial Group.

1068
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,829
I'm going to give it to you.

1069
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,600
Now, I know the reason why...

1070
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,340
I remember nothing about 4-2, Jin Do Jun.

1071
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,409
(Jin Do Jun, 4-2, Deceased)

1072
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:54,509
(Jin Do Jun, 4-2, Deceased)

1073
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,109
It's because I died.

1074
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:01,119
And...

1075
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,819
things that are bound to happen...

1076
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,720
always happen, without fail.

1077
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:19,100
