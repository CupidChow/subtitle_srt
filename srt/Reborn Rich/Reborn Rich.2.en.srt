The founder of Soonyang.

It's him. Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

14

This is a dream. It can't be reality.

Do Jun.

18
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,729
Forgive me, Father.

19
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,409
Do Jun. You must watch your manners when you're around Grandfather.

20
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,719
He's young. It happens when you're overwhelmed.

21
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,590
I'll watch Do Jun. You can go on ahead.

22
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:03,789
Okay, then.

23
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,759
You sweet boy.

24
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,530
That's what your grandfather is like.

25
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,330
Nothing about his life is fun.

26
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,839
Would thorns break out on his hand...

27
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,509
if he were to just stroke your head?

28
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,580
Do Jun. Come with Grandma.

29
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,879
- "Grandma?" - Yes, sweetie.

30
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,449

31
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,159
Who am I?

You're so silly.

It's the year 1987?

37
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm a member of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's family?

38
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,659
The youngest?

39

Hyeong Jun, Do Jun, it's your first visit, isn't it?

This is Grandpa's place.

45
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,449
Whoa. Is this the main entrance?

46
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,518
It's massive.

picked out the auspicious spot for a home and told Chairman Jin...

51
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,029
as long as they were good at heart, money would never dry up.

52

- Do not scrimp on the salt. - I understand.

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,378
People these days eat less salt to stay healthy,

82
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,350
but food must be seasoned enough.

83

Don't worry about that, Mother.

Your first daughter-in-law has it under control.

85
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,458
I'll teach my sister-in-law how we do things.

Don't worry, okay?

Don't worry about anything and stay by Father's side.

90
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,110
You're the guest of honor.

91
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,310
It's your father-in-law's birthday, and he's the one who won the medal.

92
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,948
How am I the guest of honor?

93
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,019
Don't say that.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,389
Soonyang owes its immense growth to you, Mother.

95

Who doesn't know that?

96
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,730
That's such a sweet way of telling me to stop nagging...

97
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,360
and get out of the kitchen.

98
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,100
Hello, Hae In.

99
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,569
What should I do, Mother?

100
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,709
Don't you even think of doing anything.

101
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,649
Stay with Yoon Ki and the boys.

102
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,219
- Mother, leave it to us. - Okay.

103
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,549
Go on.

104
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,959
Do you want me...

105
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,158
- to prepare the fruit? - Mr. Ko, get the fruit.

106
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,389
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,730
They're gutsy.

108
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,298
He cut contact to marry a woman his parents disapproved of.

109
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,429
They then showed up after ten years...

110
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,870
to laugh and smile and enjoy having a family.

111
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,009
I'm incapable of putting on such an act.

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
She's not like us at all.

113
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,909
She was an actress.

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,450
She doesn't suit this family.

115
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,350
She belongs on stage.

116
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,450
Right?

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,190
Are you being bullies now because you weren't in school?

118
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,960
You have way too many wrinkles by your eyes.

119
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,659
- Ms. Ye Jun. - What are you doing?

120
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,500
When so many people are present?

121
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,240
Ms. Lee.

122
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,509
Don't try to play a daughter-in-law...

123
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,210
and stick to what you did.

124
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,779
Stand still like a portrait and smile prettily.

125
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,779
You're good at that.

126
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,899
Happy birthday, sir.

127
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,639
Happy birthday, sir.

128
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:01,809
Let's have a drink.

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,809
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, sir.

130
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,720
He studied in Tokyo...

131
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,190
and works as a master at a sushi restaurant in Ginza.

132
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,058
The Japanese refused to let him go,

133
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,388
but I literally abducted him and got him...

134
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,330
on an early flight so he could cater to you today.

135
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,759
It's good, isn't it?

136
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,330
Yes.

137
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,529
I knew it.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,269
Domestic goods still can't compare to Japanese.

139
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,139
How many?

140
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,350
Grains of rice. How many are there?

141
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,949
The ideal weight of fish and rice is 15g...

142
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,980
So how many?

143
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,320
- I apologize, sir. - There are 320.

144
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,230
A trained sushi master...

145
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,960
usually picks up 320 grains of rice to make one piece.

146
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,100
That many might be appropriate for lunch,

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,899
but on a day like this, or when served with alcohol,

148
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,769
use just 280 grains of rice, okay?

149
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,379
So it's not too filling.

150
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,480
I'll do that, sir.

151
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,620
Cheongwadae sent a messenger, sir.

152
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,429
- The Blue House? - Yes.

153
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,740
Sir.

154
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,409
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

155
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,579
Thank you. Eat your fill.

156
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,649
- Thank you. - Thank you.

157
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,549
Father. How did you know the number of rice grains?

158
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,960
Is there a Japanese restaurant in Soonyang Hotel, yes or no?

159
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,489
Of course...

160
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,789
There. Must I say more?

161
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,029
Hey, you.

162
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,000
Deputy CEO of Soonyang Electronics. Tell me.

163
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,639
What is this year's sales?

164
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,969
It's 2.3 billion dollars.

165
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,008
- Up by 15 percent... - And the Japanese?

166
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,509
H made 26.5 billion dollars, and T made 20 billion dollars.

167
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,678
Both more than ten times we did.

168
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,049
Our deputy CEO is right, then.

169
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,889
We still can't compare to the Japanese.

170
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,159
Is that true?

171
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,129
Still, we're number one in our country.

172
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,288
We never lost...

173
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,058
the top spot in Korea in the white goods market.

174
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,370
The top spot in Korea.

175
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,740
The top spot in Korea?

176
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,139
Are you competing in a national competition?

177
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,009
Father.

178
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,720
Yoon Ki wishes to say hello.

179
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,889
Congratulations on winning a medal and happy birthday, Father.

180
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,929
He opened a film distribution company.

181
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,700
His first movie will be shown this year.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,869
Aren't you proud of him?

183
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,039
He did it all without your help.

184
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,509
He'll do well. He's your son.

185
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,850
He said he'll visit every weekend like the others.

186
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:29,679
If you permit it.

187
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,590
He did a great job raising both boys.

188
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,860
Hyeong Jun, Do Jun, come and meet your grandfather.

189
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,889
Bow.

190
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,789
Yes, Father.

191
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,928
Don't be so angry with him.

192
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,429
Do movies make money, mister?

193
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,829
Something more valuable than money...

194
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,370
Will it help Soonyang?

195
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,839
- Father. - It makes no money...

196
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,309
and won't help Soonyang.

197
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,110
Why are you my son?

198
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,179
- Honey. - Guests are leaving.

199
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,049
Throw salt after them.

200
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,320
It really is a party.

201
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,730
There are beggars everywhere.

202
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,330
He doesn't mean what he says.

203
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,669
Yoon Ki, you know what your father's like.

204
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,009
Don't take it to heart, okay?

205
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,308
Yes. Leave it at that today.

206
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,779
Let's take it slowly.

207
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,750
Let's go and eat.

208
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,350
You eat lots.

209
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,289
He married against his parents' will,

210
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,558
so 4-0's right to succession was revoked.

211
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,690
Hello.

212
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,029
That's exactly what I know.

213
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,720
But...

214
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,389
I'm missing.

215
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,899
I know all there is to know about Soonyang's Jin family.

216
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,600
But...

217
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,730
(Late Jin Yang Cheol, Late Lee Pil Ok)

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,370
(Jin Yoon Ki, Lee Hae In, Jin Hyeong Jun)

219
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,409
I have no information on 4-2 Jin Do Jun.

220
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,580
Why...

221
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,090
is my mind blank when it comes to 4-2 Jin Do Jun?

222
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,360
Why is that?

223
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,599
You know, sir,

224
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
how the great 6.29 Declaration came to be.

225
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,610
It was all thanks to the President's concern and thoughtfulness.

226
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,639
History will record him...

227
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,850
as the father of democracy in our land.

228
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,279
Try the tea.

229
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,820
It smells lovely.

230
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,090
In the next administration,

231
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,860
shouldn't the average man take the lead role?

232
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,830
History is marching on,

233
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,039
and Soonyang should join the flow.

234
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,840
The President wishes to give you an opportunity.

235
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,620
Mr. Lee.

236
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,490
Were you aware?

238
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,099
This gentleman from the Blue House knew.

239
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,309
This medal you see here.

240
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,240
The payment is deferred.

241
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,650
He's here to collect.

242
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,079
So,

243
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,019
how much do you want for it?

244
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:53,210
Your window just won't open

245
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,480
I'll knock on it with the moonlight of love

246
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Jeez...

247
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:19,299
Oh, my love

248
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,909
Open the window to let in the breeze

249
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,910
Shoot.

250
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,099
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun?

251
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,509
It's obvious what movies make money.

252
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,139
- Hong Kongers shooting guns. - "A Better Tomorrow?"

253
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,380
- Or Americans going to war. - "Platoon."

254
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,509
So what kind of movie are you making?

255
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,579
It's about the French people praying.

256
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,519
It's called "Under the Sun of Satan."

257
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,819
I thought you wanted to make a movie, not build a hotel.

258
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,920
Do you want to make everyone fall asleep?

259
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,160
Dad! Do Jun is in trouble.

260
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,660
He's upstairs now.

261
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,309
You broke this vase. Okay, kiddo?

262
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,710
We're the only ones in this room right now.

263
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,779
No matter what you say, everyone will believe me.

264
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,289
Why? Because I'm the rightful heir to the throne,

265
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,460
and Grandpa will side with me no matter what.

266
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,099
Did you just scoff?

267
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,609
You were a real mess even when you were young.

268
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,338
What? Have you lost your mind?

269
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,480
Seong Jun!

270
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,518
- Hey. My gosh, are you all right? - What happened?

271
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,548
- Do you know how much this costs? - Are you okay?

272
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,660
Father absolutely treasures this porcelain vase.

273
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,358
It was him.

274
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,660
He broke it. He tried to run away, but I caught him.

275
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,799
- Oh, dear. - Do Jun.

276
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,970
Is that true?

277
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,869
Hold on. Yoon Ki.

278
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,479
This is making me very uncomfortable.

279
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,549
Are you implying that Seong Jun could be lying?

280
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,818
How could you accuse Seong Jun of lying...

281
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,519
He is lying.

282
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,349
What? What do you mean?

283
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,990
The vase...

284
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,329
He's the one who broke it.

285
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,400
He was trying to steal the chairman's belonging.

286
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,529
I caught him in the act.

287
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,150
He got flustered and tried to run away, but...

288
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,089
- Hey! - No!

289
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,519
- Seong Jun! - Do Jun.

290
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,859
- Are you all right? - What is going on?

291
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,759
- Father. - Seong Jun...

292
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,699
It wasn't me, Grandpa.

293
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,970
- I didn't break it. I swear... - Enough.

294
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,640
Shut your mouth.

295
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,380
This happened in 1987,

296
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,379
at the 60th birthday party for your grandfather,

297
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,720
former Chairman Jin.

298
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,650
Year 1987.

299
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,359
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

300
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,729
And his 60th birthday party.

301
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,099
You smashed the Goryeo celadon that he cherished...

302
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,829
and was scolded by him for the first time.

303
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,940
The smashed vase?

304
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,170
Seong Jun.

305
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,440
Do you know what you did wrong?

306
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,480
Come here.

307
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,720
Sit down.

308
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,599
You see, I don't care about this vase.

309
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,500
Seong Jun, you will continue my legacy...

310
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,700
and become the owner of Soonyang in the future.

311
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,910
Okay?

312
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,180
Everything you say...

313
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,880
and do...

314
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,119
could make or break ten thousand employees' livelihoods.

315
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,190
Even their families' livelihoods will depend on you.

316
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,799
Yet you can't even keep your emotions under control?

317
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,869
Acting up like this...

318
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,799
It wasn't an adequate quality...

319
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:21,869
"Isn't an adequate quality..."

320
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,109
isn't an adequate quality...

321
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,779
"in someone who will run a business that is Soonyang."

322
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,619
in someone who will run a business...

323
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,579
that is Soonyang.

324
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,190
What I read in his autobiography is unfolding before my eyes.

325
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,289
It was white porcelain.

326
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,829
My grandfather's vase that I broke.

327
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,430
It wasn't Goryeo celadon. It was a white porcelain vase.

328
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,509
Everything is happening...

329
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,450
exactly as I know it.

330
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,299
The past as I know it.

331
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,029
I'm in Korea in Year 1987.

332
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,170
Then...

333
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,268
If that's the case...

334
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,640

That was a great meal. Let's go.

00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,939
- Thank you. - Did you enjoy the food?

338
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,548
- Yes. - Get back safely.

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,349
Hi, Hyeon Min!

345
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,659
Lucky you, Hyeon Min! Daddy picked up fried chicken for you.

346
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,130
Who do you like more? Mommy or Daddy?

347
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,829
Mommy!

348
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,429
- I knew it! - I'll do better.

349
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,098
- Do you need a hand? - No, I'm good.

350
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,970
Come on. Let's have this fried chicken.

351
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,910
We found Do Jun.

352
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,009
We'll get there soon too.

353
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,450
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

354
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,480
Okay.

355
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,720
Do Jun is okay. You can put your worries to rest now.

356

Hello...

358

Are you here alone? Your parents aren't here with you?

359
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,309
Can I have one serving of gukbap?

360
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,849
Sure. You can take that table over there.

361

Hello...

362

Do Jun.

What are you doing here?

364
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,420
I was so worried.

365
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,799
Get up. Let's go.

366
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,359
Let's go home.

367
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,670
Let's...

368
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,339
talk at home.

369
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,640

What's wrong, Do Jun?

372
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,109
What is it?

373
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:07,819
I'm relieved.

374
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,859
Mom's alive.

375
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm so relieved.

376
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,299
Mom's relieved too.

377

Thank goodness...

378
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,779
I have you.

379
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,549
Don't cry.

380
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,960
That poor thing must've been so scared. Look how he ran away.

381
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,170
Well done.

382
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,869
Way to go.

383
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,308
Your son and grandsons came to see you after ten years.

384
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,549
How could you read a book after kicking them out like that?

385
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,480
My son and grandsons? Who?

386
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,150
I only scolded my eldest grandson,

387
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,859
Seong Jun. No one else.

388
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,358
You can't expect all your children to be the same.

389
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,598
Let at least one of them do what they want.

390
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,629
I fed them and paid for their education,

391
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,730
so I must get my money's worth.

392
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,569
I never invest in things where I can't get my money's worth.

393
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,509
You'd better not coddle Yoon Ki.

394
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,910
The others will turn out like him.

395
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,640
The only person in this family who I know nothing about...

396
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,210
is me, 4-2 Jin Do Jun.

397

Am I living as Jin Do Jun now because I'm possessed?

- Oh, look at you. - Gosh, stop!

- Run! Go! - Hey, where are you going?

404

- Oh, nice one. - Let's cheer for your brother!

- Nice. - Well done.

406

Or did I simply travel back in time?

407
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,579
If not that... Have I been reincarnated?

408
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,750

Do Jun, what happened today... It must've been a lot for you.

413

At first,

414
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,250
I felt the same way.

415
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,750
"What am I doing here?"

416
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,690
"I don't belong in this world."

417
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,589
I couldn't understand them. It was very frustrating.

418
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,799
You felt the same way?

419
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,199
Does that mean...

420
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,339
It felt so foreign to me. I was scared,

421
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
and it was uncomfortable.

422
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,640
I almost regretted marrying your dad.

423
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,180
But now, it's not so bad.

424
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,359
I've found a reason to accept them as my family.

425
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,289
A reason to accept them as your family?

426

I'm certain that you'll find your reason too, one day.

All the companies are dropping their prices for their 64K DRAMs.

Soonyang Semiconductor started exporting them this month.

431
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,729
Japan and the US are already dominating the market.

432
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,029
So if they're charging less than half of what we're asking for,

433
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,240
Soonyang Semiconductor will not survive in the market, sir.

It's 9pm, sir.

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,518
Is Im Pil Sung in New York now?

438
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,388
I'll tell him to give you a call at once.

439

No, don't wake him up.

440
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,519
Just tell him to fax it over when he wakes up.

441
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,329
- Fax? What do you need, sir? - His resignation letter.

442
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,860
Pardon me?

443
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,339
I didn't know that I had a knife held to my throat...

444
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
until I read that newspaper.

445
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,039
Do you think it's acceptable?

446
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,920
Did he go to the US to eat hamburgers?

447
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,119
I'm done paying for his hamburgers.

448
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,158
I saw the news, Father.

449
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,989
The American companies slashed their price from 3 to 1.80 dollars.

450
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,800
And the Japanese companies said they'd sell it for 0.30 dollars.

451
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,199
If we sell ours at the price the Japanese companies are offering,

452
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,599
we'll lose 130 million dollars this year alone.

453

I'm afraid we've come too far.

The initial investment alone...

459
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,050
Right, so let's cut our losses and call it quits.

460
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,420
Let's stop trying to fill the bottomless pit.

461
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,320
Youngjin Semiconductor has given up too.

462
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,960
They're being sold to a Japanese company.

463

I'm here to apologize to Grandpa.

Isn't it so obvious?

Clearly, he memorized what his father told him to say.

500
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:49,070
they came all the way here. It means the tables have turned.

501
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,038
It tells me that Roh Tae Woo is at a disadvantage.

502
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,609
I'm not surprised. After all the protests and uprisings...

503
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,948
to end the military dictatorship,

504
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,179
who'd want to vote for another Military Academy graduate?

505
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,150
Unless the entire nation is suffering from amnesia collectively.

506
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,289
The two Kims will agree on single candidacy soon.

507
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,718
The opposition power will win this time, Father.

508
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,159
That being said,

509
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,389
shouldn't you decide which candidate to support now?

510
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,959
Between DJ and YS, choose the one who's more likely to win...

511
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,400
Right. So who would that be?

512
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,199
DJ, obviously.

513
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,368
He is supported by all the student and civic groups...

514
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,909
that helped establish the direct election system.

515
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,039
Dong Ki, you should never get into politics.

516
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,610
We should support YS, not DJ.

517
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,049
I know DJ has many fans, but he also has many enemies.

518
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,050
When it's a neck-and-neck fight, the one with less enemies will win.

519
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,590
Aren't you saying that because you dislike DJ?

520
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,529
I heard Kim Dae Jung was against...

521
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,429
nominating Chang Je since he worked as a public security prosecutor.

522
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,300
Why are you roping Chang Je into this?

523
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,000
I am saying these things for the sake of the company's future.

524
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,670
- Father! - Be quiet.

525
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:58,239
I'm sorry for causing you concern, Father.

526
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,738
- Mr. Lee. - Yes, sir.

527
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,449
As for their approval ratings,

528
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,150
get Soonyang Economic Research Institute to look into it.

529
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,119
Tell them to find out which one of them deserves my money more.

530
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,389
Yes, sir.

531
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,920
Now, get out.

532
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,960
- Oh. - Hey, aren't you Yoon Ki's son?

533
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,929
I'm here to apologize to Grandpa for what happened yesterday.

534
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,269
Oh, my. Yoon Ki always had a sly side to him.

535
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,468
After not visiting us once for ten years,

536
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,280
he now sends his son here every day.

537
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,150
He came all the way here by himself because his parents told him to?

538
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:39,320
He sure takes after his father.

539
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,179
Good-looking and calculating.

540
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,090
Your youngest son's child is here to see you, sir.

541
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,860
I only have two sons. I didn't know I had another son!

542
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,000
I will talk to him and send him home, sir.

543
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,070
Come with us. Let's go downstairs.

544
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,969
Please tell Grandpa...

545
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,739
that I'm here to pay for the vase that broke yesterday.

546
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,250
That punk.

547
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,879
Hey! You little brat.

548
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,889
Hey, do you even know how much that vase costs?

549
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,519
Five bills?

550
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,859
It can't cost more than that.

551
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,260
Five bills? What? Five dollars?

552
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,230
Or 50 dollars?

553
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,099
No, five million dollars.

554
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,969
What? Five million?

555
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,239
Wouldn't that be enough to fund a presidential election campaign?

556
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,610
What? Presidential election campaign?

557
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,949
Please let Grandpa know.

558
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,159
If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign.

559
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:59,530
Roh Tae Woo will become President.

560
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,530
Did you eavesdrop on the adults' conversation?

561
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,969
Clearly, your parents couldn't teach you any better.

562
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,610
Is this how your parents taught you?

563
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,909
No one teaches their children to be so brazen.

564
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,949
Just like how no one tells their children...

565
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,649
to steal their grandfather's things.

566
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,320
- Do Jun. - What?

567
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,519
Young Ki, you must be getting old.

568
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,590
He's just a kid. Why are you getting so worked up?

569
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,489
He's read some newspapers, so he's trying to sound like an adult.

570
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,158
Once DJ and YS agree on single candidacy,

571
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,069
Roh Tae Woo can't win.

572
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,500
I assure you that he won't win.

573
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,000
Single candidacy?

574
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,340
Do you think the two of them will actually reach an agreement?

575
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,550
I do not think so.

576
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:59,050
Now, that should be enough to compensate him for the broken vase.

577
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,019
I'll be off, then.

578
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,460
Goodness.

579
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,429
Oh, my. Yoon Ki did a great job, bringing up such a smart boy.

580
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,639
Oh, sorry.

581
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,239
Of course, it's nonsense.

582
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,738
So many people are rooting for single candidacy.

583
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,110
They won't betray the majority opinion.

584
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,279
Both YS and DJ...

585
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,079
have come this far because of their devotion...

586
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,920
to the democratization of the nation.

587
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,389
They won't gamble on their political careers.

588
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,719
Exactly.

589
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Mr. Oh, take Mr. Chairman's grandson home.

590
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,900
Sir, there's breaking news about the presidential election.

591
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,539
You should see it.

592
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,340
What's the matter?

593
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,678
Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung of the Democratic Party...

594
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,409
decided against single candidacy earlier today.

595
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,848
Kim Dae Jung clearly expressed...

596
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,820
that he was against the party convention,

597
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,348
which means they will both run for President.

598
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,518
Father.

599
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,988
Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung met again...

600
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,428
- Father! - to negotiate the details...

601
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:13,230
regarding single candidacy but failed to reach an agreement.

602
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,529
Their talk ended when they decided...

603
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,468
to postpone the deadline to next Monday,

604
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,269
which is when Kim Dae Jung would have to reply by.

605
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,710
Wait, stop!

606
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,980
Mr. Chairman would like to speak with you.

607
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,849
Right now.

608
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,920
Tell me.

609
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,460
How did you know they'd decide against single candidacy?

610
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,159
I wouldn't be able to concede. That's why.

611
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:48,699
Because I'd get greedy.

612
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,429
When three candidates are running for class president,

613
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,000
the top two candidates will never join hands...

614
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,139
because they both believe that they will win.

615
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,639
Rather, they'll do whatever it takes to make each other lose.

616
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,480
They'll bad-mouth each other and fight.

617
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,119
Then their teachers and classmates...

618
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:12,050
will realize that they, in fact, don't deserve the position.

619
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,389
Just like that, they'll drag each other down.

620
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,630
So the one who was least likely to win will end up winning.

621
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:20,829
You mean he'll win by default.

622
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,670
Roh Tae Woo will become President, by default.

623
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,739
So I should back Roh Tae Woo. Is that right?

624
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,409
If I were you, I'd give him the money before he became number one.

625
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:38,550
A lot more than the amount he may be expecting.

626
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,750
He'll be grateful if you give it to him when he's still number three.

627
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,989
But if you wait until he becomes number one,

628
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,489
he'll take it for granted.

629
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:58,400
- Mr. Lee. - Yes, sir.

630
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,440
Tell Mr. Oh to have the car ready.

631
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,170
Yes, sir.

632
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,949
- Hey. - Mr. Oh, have the car ready.

633
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,280
Let me ask you one more question, then.

634
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,920
I believe I've already paid you for the broken vase, Grandpa.

635
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,889
It's nothing difficult. It's just a quiz.

636
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,789
Then there must be a prize for getting it right.

637
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,230
Because it's a quiz.

638
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,969
I don't like to do things for free either.

639
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,038
We talked about how number 3 can win by default because number 1 and 2...

640
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,869
are busy fighting, right?

641
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,439
But there's this saying too.

642
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,150
"The shrimp is squashed to death when two whales fight."

643
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,320
Then do you think there's a way...

644
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:52,860
for the shrimp to beat the whales?

645
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,670
You're just like other kids, after all.

646
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,550
Hey.

647
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,559
Come here.

648
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,260
How did you know...

649
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,929
the candidates won't be unified?

650
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:39,429
Yoon Ki, no.

651
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:42,500
Did your father tell you so?

652
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,110
My brother said so.

653
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,010
Your brother?

654
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,610
This is what we do in times like these.

655
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:56,650
"It's obvious at a single glance."

656
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,719
What's with this punk?

657
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,460
That's a buzzword by Hwang Ki Soon.

658
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,090
Hwang Ki...

659
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,360
You punk! That's not the way you should talk to your elders.

660
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:10,130
Do you think there's a way for a shrimp to win against a whale?

661
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,469
I guess you can't give up on the semiconductor, Chairman Jin.

662
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,010
Why do you think I'm so set on semiconductor?

663
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,679
Last summer, in Mokpo, Ulsan, and Changwon,

664
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,449
when the laborers of our factories put on headbands...

665
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,449
and stood there protesting...

666
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:36,190
with cranes and excavators, asking me for a raise...

667
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:37,730
and the formation of a labor union,

668
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,969
I only thought about this...

669
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,369
in my head.

670
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,480
I am done doing business by using laborers.

671
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,579
Then...

672
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:56,909
From now on,

673
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,480
we must do business with technologies to make a living.

674
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
Semiconductor is...

675
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,519
the future business of Soonyang.

676
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,729
I see.

677
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,329
Do you ask if it'll be worth any money?

678
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:20,239
Am I the only one who sees this?

679
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,969
Why is there nobody else who can think like this old man?

680
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,578
We have to make an astronomical investment,

681
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,179
but we do not know if it'll be a success.

682
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:36,119
The semiconductor business is nothing but a risk,

683
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,219
no, more like gambling at this point, Chairman Jin.

684
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,629
Once our finances look better...

685
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,360
by overseas construction business with the government's cooperation,

686
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:50,329
why don't you resume the semiconductor business then?

687
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,800
Do you know what democratization is?

688
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,440
I'm not sure.

689
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:00,380
Before, only a single soldier was after the money in my pocket.

690
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,949
That turned into three civilians.

691
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:07,650
That's democratization.

Please give this to the president.

694
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,550
That I believe he will surely put an end...

695

Our chairman was touched deeply by your character...

699
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:04,710
when you said you will not take any political retaliation.

700

for the sake of peace in Korea just as you wanted.

702
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:18,089
The campaign of Roh Tae Woo of Democratic Justice Party was...

703
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,960
held in the square in front of Gwangju Station.

704

As soon as the campaign began at 2pm,

705
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:26,730
young people and university students came out protesting...

are busy fighting, right?

the answer to Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's quiz.

00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,829
Then did something change...

825
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,099
because I came here?

826
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,400
Was I too late?

827
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,670
If I had remembered a little earlier,

828
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,769
could I have saved Chairman Jin?

829
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,239
Get it together!

830
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,090
- No! - No, Father!

831
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,960
Father!

832
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:20,630
Father.

833
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,329
Father.

834
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,630
- Father. - Father!

835
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,800
Did someone die around here?

836
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,368
Why are you all crying?

837
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:34,179
Father, I checked the final list of passengers from Baghdad just now.

838
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,880
So? Are you disappointed...

839
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,308
that I came back alive?

840
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,679
Don't say it like that, Father!

841
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,650
Because of you, we were all just...

842
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,750
Good grief. You were all worried for nothing.

843
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,260
Your father is yet to become a ghost.

844
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:57,730
Your mom's face is what looks like a ghost.

845
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,538
There was a change in his schedule due to business,

846
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,380
so he had to arrive in Seoul earlier.

847
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:12,210
We switched to another flight at the stopover, Abu Dhabi,

848
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:15,820
so we were able to avoid this disaster.

849
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,288
Great job.

850
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,519
- Father. - Father.

851
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,400
Father.

852
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,929
What a relief, Father.

853
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:36,500
I heard you suddenly had a business in Seoul.

854
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,769
I don't know whose business it is, but I'd like to go bow to them.

855
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:42,479
It's Youngjin Semiconductor.

856
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,010
They're selling the business, right?

857
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,050
I hear they will do it soon.

858
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,750
I bought it today.

859
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,348
Youngjin Semiconductor.

860
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:52,848
- What? - What?

861
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,789
Wait, weren't you going to give up on the semiconductor business?

862
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:59,360
Father, you're going to jump in on this fight of whales?

863
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,929
I'm going to make the shrimp bigger...

864
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,369
so that the shrimp won't die in a fight between whales.

865
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,900
- Father. - No matter how long it takes...

866
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:10,969
or how much I have to invest,

867
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:16,710
I will make this shrimp as big as a whale.

868
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,578
But Father, right now, it's not...

869
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,550
I just came back from my death.

870
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,449
Do you think there is anything I'll be afraid of?

871
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,780
(Pending Approval)

872
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:03,019
I finally found out the answer to the quiz you asked, Grandpa.

873
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,860
A way for a shrimp to beat the whales.

874
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,429
It's to make the shrimp bigger.

875
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:12,000
Then it won't die in the midst of a whales' fight.

876
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,639
If you do not give up, time will be on the shrimp's side.

877
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,170
The proposal of the buyout of Youngjin Semiconductor...

878
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,340
ends at 5pm on the 29th.

879
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,380
Once you see this note,

880
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:29,119
I believe that you will change your flight.

881
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,489
Chairman Jin.

882
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,730
Are we stopping over at Abu Dhabi?

883
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,130
Yes.

884
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,269
Find the earliest flight to Seoul.

885
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,940
Congratulations, Mr. President.

886
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,780
During your presidency,

887
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:37,789
please allow Soonyang to monopolize...

888
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,590
the semiconductor business.

889
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,289
Thank you.

890
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,840
Just as you said,

891
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,639
I handed over the fund for the presidential election myself.

892
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,849
Why did you...

893
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,989
tell me to fund...

894
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,760
the second and third runners who aren't going to make it?

895
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:19,558
Once the first place graduates,

896
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,860
there will come a day for the 2nd and 3rd to win.

897
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,440
By any chance,

898
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,940
do you know what the future holds?

899
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:47,289
You knew the single candidacy will fall under.

900
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,889
You knew Roh Tae Woo would be elected.

901
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,369
And...

902
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,210
(I finally found out the answer to the quiz you asked, Grandpa.)

903
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:13,809
you knew CAL 828 will blow up.

904
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:18,949
You knew everything.

905
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,489
Is that true?

906
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,190
Answer me!

907
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:43,579
I did know.

908
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,480
Not the future,

909
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:52,920
but I knew what was in your heart.

910
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,889
There is no way for a shrimp to win against whales.

911
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,329
You gave me that quiz...

912
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,300
trying to grasp for straws because you knew...

913
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,070
your new attempt seemed reckless.

914
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,340
You weren't looking for an answer.

915
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,110
You were looking for approval and support.

916
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,409
All I knew was...

917
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,079
how you felt in your heart.

918
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,869
Why is he seeing him alone in the study?

919
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,769
I mean, without Mr. Lee.

920
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:44,309
- What's with Father? - Tell me about it.

921
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:46,469
That rarely happens for us too.

922
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,239
Young Ki.

923
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:57,349
You got the answer,

924
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:00,820
so you deserve the prize.

925
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,730
How much do you want?

926
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:06,559
I don't need money.

927
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:11,199
Once I am old enough to use that money,

928
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:13,070
its monetary value would have dropped.

929
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,170
Is that so?

930
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:18,809
I'd like land.

931
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,909
A place with lots of plants and trees.

932
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,019
I like this area, right here.

933
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:41,629
That land was used to make pottery. It's useless.

934
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,399
(Map of Seoul)

935
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,868
(Gyeonggi Province, Seongnam, Bundang-dong)

936
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,369
Do you want the land in Bundang that badly?

937
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:52,340
Let's see.

938
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:55,210
How does 160,000m² sound?

939
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,110
There is one more thing I'd like, Grandpa.

940
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,380
I think I'm done paying you out.

941
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:06,289
Then let's make it a deal.

942
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,199
You need to have something that I do not have...

943
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,270
for a deal to be made.

944
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,840
Do you think there is anything I do not have?

945
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,409
Because you can't buy this with money.

946
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,949
I'll bring you something that the Soonyang family doesn't have.

947
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,719
The acceptance letter to the most prestigious college,

948
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,420
Seoul National University, School of Law.

949
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:51,069
You're right.

950
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,539
An acceptance letter, I cannot buy that.

951
01:08:56,869 --> 01:08:57,970
Can you do this?

952
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,739
What can I give you in return?

953
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,649
Gather round, everyone.

954
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:27,600
Jeong Rae.

955
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:29,699
Yes, Father.

956
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,470
Starting with the family gathering this weekend,

957
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,239
make sure you set out...

958
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,350
enough utensils for Do Jun's family as well.

959
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:48,819
Why won't you answer me?

960
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,890
Every week?

961
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,699
Do Jun here is my grandson.

962
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,600
Do you understand now?

963
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,420
Family.

964
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:24,630
4-alpha was right.

965
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,960
There must be a reason why I became this family.

966
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,699
The reason why I became family with the Jins.

967
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,239
Right here.

968
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,810
One of these people...

969
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,090
killed me.

970
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:14,139
How do you feel about entering SNU's law program as the top?

971
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,879
Tell us your secret.

972
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,779
How did you get in as the top of the class?

973
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,149
- Say something. - Please introduce yourself.

974
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,189
Well.

975
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,560
I'm sure you all know my name.

976
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,859
So is this what you're looking for?

977
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,170
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's grandson,

978
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,869
College of Law, the class of 1996. My name is Jin Do Jun.

979
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,909
I was born as Jin Do Jun...

980
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,680
not as spirit possession, time traveling,

981
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,510
or reincarnation.

982
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,979
This life is my opportunity.

983
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:59,390
(Reborn Rich)

984
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:31,289
Play. Have fun.

985
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:34,019
Go on group blind dates, regular blind dates,

986
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,788
casual dates, and go out with someone.

987
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:37,020
We've met before, right?

988
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,489
Did you meet her? When?

989
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:41,159
In 20 years' time.

990
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:42,659
Do Jun, you're back!

991
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,828
Why does Father play favorites with the youngest, Do Jun?

992
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,170
Do Jun has exchanged the money in the account into dollars.

993
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:51,409
I'd like to invest in companies in the US.

994
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:54,038
Never bet on things that you aren't sure about.

995
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,409
I have a lot of money, Mr. Oh.

996
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,739
There is a problem.

997
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,249
Just why?

998
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,710
It's a foreign investment company.

999
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,419
Mr. Chairman...

1000
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:05,318
would like to pass Soonyang down to someone who is like him.

1001
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,149
Do you simply have good discernment?

1002
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:09,220
Or are you just lucky?

1003
01:13:36,949 --> 01:13:40,119
