(Episode 14)

3
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,129
Do Jun told me to drop you off...

4
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,570
safe and sound.

5
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,408
When you get there,

6
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,680
you'll see Do Jun's employees from Miracle waiting for you.

7
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,450
I guess you'll be away for quite a while.

8
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,319
No one at Jeongsimjae seemed to know about it.

9
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,890
Why didn't you tell them?

10
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,200
Do Jun told me everything.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,510
Mother, I have to say...

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
You scare me.

13
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,709
Your Soonyang Insurance shares...

14
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,549
I heard you handed them over to Do Jun.

15
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,318
From the day my birth mother...

16
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,890
brought me to Jeongsimjae to this very moment,

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
I have always...

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,760
felt uncomfortable around you and found you inaccessible.

19
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,430
You see,

20
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,669
I've done my very best to take good care of you.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,870
I treated you just like I treated my own children.

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,139
I always bought you nice clothes and fed you good food.

23
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,610
But with your eyes, you always told me this.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,418
"If you have a conscience, you should not forget my kindness."

25
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,259
"So don't you dare dream of succeeding the throne at Soonyang."

26
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,289
All my life,

27
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,400
I've lived as if I was protesting against you, Mother.

28
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,569
Going against Father's wishes and studying films.

29
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:47,770
Marrying someone you and Father disapproved of. All of it.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
But it turns out,

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,810
I'm even worse than you.

32
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,189
The cruel bunch who can do anything for their children.

33
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,060
I suppose all parents are like that after all, Mother.

34
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,360
Now that I've become one of such parents,

35
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,500
I can truly understand...

36
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,939
how hurt you must've been by my existence...

37
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,150
in and of itself, every single moment.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,449
Mother,

39
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,520
I respect you for enduring it all through these years.

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,150
(Report on Lee Pil Ok's Borrowed-Name Account)

41
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,818
Regarding Lee Pil Ok's borrowed-name account,

42
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,960
we found out that there was a large transaction recently.

43
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,899
The Soonyang Insurance shares she had purchased...

44
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,759
(All transferred to Jin Do Jun)

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,730
Here. She's transferred them to Jin Do Jun.

46
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,209
(All transferred to Jin Do Jun)

47
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,939
Ma'am.

48
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,139
Lee Pil Ok isn't in the country.

49
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,579
- What? - She already left the country.

50
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,920
I confirmed it with Immigration just now.

51
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,990
Darn it.

(Jin Do Jun)

53
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,199
It was you, wasn't it?

54
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,939
Your grandmother.

55
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,509
Lee Pil Ok, the prime suspect in the proxy murder case.

56
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,209
You helped her flee the country.

57
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,550
Did you cut a deal with her?

58
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,819
Because of her Soonyang Insurance shares?

59
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,189
I tried so hard to catch her,

60
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,199
yet you cut a deal with her.

61
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,970
You, of all people,

62
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,870
know why I wanted to catch her so much.

63
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,910
You've got nothing to say, right?

64
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,750
Just this once. We're almost there, Min Yeong.

65
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,448
It'll all be over once I'm appointed CEO.

66
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,290
I won't let you down anymore.

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,759
You're wrong.

68
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,959
You'll become even more spiteful.

69
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,300
Because you'd want to keep what you have.

70
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Hyeon Min.

71
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,930
You said you wanted to live like Grandmother...

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,759
from now on.

73
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,999
You knew everything about her,

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,399
but you still said that to me.

75
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,339
What did you mean by that?

76
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,879
Are you going to kill me or something?

77
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,149
I could.

78
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,430
If you...

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,430
get in the way of that baby...

80
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,600
becoming the owner of Soonyang, that is.

81
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,970
I don't care who it is.

82
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,569
I can do anything.

83
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,339
Just like your grandmother.

84
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,620
So you'd better get your act together.

85
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,089
It starts with you.

86
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,490
Are you anxious?

87
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,889
Since we're going all in,

88
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,360
one ace card won't do.

89
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,470
Then what?

90
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,069
Don't worry.

Mr. Jin Do Jun is another candidate.

101
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,720
All right. We'll vote to decide.

102
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,690
Is everyone ready?

103
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:16,489
He lashed out at Chairman Jin in the hospital room?

104
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,830
- Was it the shock that killed him? - Is this true?

105
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,870
This certainly disqualifies Jin Do Jun for the position.

106
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,200
Is this really true?

107
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,210
We need an explanation.

108
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,610
- Explain this. - Everyone, let's not vote.

109

To bring order back to this room so that we can proceed...

110

I hereby exercise my authority as the chairperson...

111

and ask Mr. Jin Do Jun to provide an explanation.

It is not true.

114

We don't believe him. Can he prove it with evidence?

115
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,469
How are we supposed to believe him?

116

Quiet down, please.

117
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,909

In the late chairman's room at the hospital,

123
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,730
there was a camera recording everything,

124

which the hospital staff use to monitor their VIP patients.

Mr. Jin Do Jun.

131
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,529

Mr. Jin Do Jun here ordered me to get rid of it.

136
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,320
Then I can do what I want with it, right?

137

Please delete the footage.

138

Otherwise, why would he ask me to delete the footage?

Please be quiet.

141
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,419

could make or break the future of the company.

149

to think about who would be...

150
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
the best person for the role before you vote.

151

You've decided to join hands with me?

157
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
I am now too old and tired to keep on working...

158

as a mere farmer.

159

Please give me some shares.

I helped Soonyang grow to what it is today.

161
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,629
I wish to own a plot of land in the company, no matter how small it is.

162

I suppose you liked my gift.

00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,370
Do Jun, have you thought about this?

169
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,970
Would Chairman Jin Yang Cheol have told me...

170
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,610
to delete the security footage?

171
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,690
So after all,

172
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,129
we're the owners of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

173
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,230
Goodness.

174
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,659
Congratulations.

175
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,599
We jointly own 30 percent of the shares.

176
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,139
Add the CEO's friendly stakes, then we're at 37 percent.

177
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,340
Do Jun is no match for us now.

178
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,279
We used Mr. Lee...

179
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,048
and labeled him as an immoral buffoon...

180
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,279
in front of all the shareholders,

181
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,819
so he'll have to lie low for the time being.

182
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,518
We now have the voting rights in all the subsidiaries...

183
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,189
under the holding company.

184
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,629
My, this is nice.

185
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:27,299
Right, as long as one of us doesn't betray the other.

186
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,169
Young Ki, no one's got our backs now.

187
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,539
We only have each other.

188
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,379
Right?

189
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,799
Congratulations.

190
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,730
Thank you.

191
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,799
About the shares we discussed the other day...

192
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
- Right. - Yes.

193
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,480
(Report on Director Lee Hang Jae's Embezzlement)

194
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,119
My grandfather thought it was just a borrowed-name account...

195
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,019
in your name.

196
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,389
But I suppose you thought the account was yours.

197
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,159
I understand you get crumbs on your hands when handling bread.

198
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,240
Just resign. I'll consider it your severance package.

199
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,470
Or would you rather be on the news as an embezzler?

200
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,289
Was this your plan from the get-go, from the moment...

201
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,220
you offered me the CEO position?

202
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,759
You just needed a knife to get rid of Do Jun?

203
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,129
The family fighting during Grandfather's funeral...

204
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,359
wouldn't be a pretty sight.

205
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,109
(Managing Director Lee Hang Jae)

206
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,450
My whole life, I was completely dedicated to Soonyang.

207
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,250
I joined the company way before you were even born.

208
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,589
Your grandfather and I grew Soonyang into what it is today.

209
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
So why...

210
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,660
Why should I be treated like this? Just why?

211
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,970
I apologize.

212
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,839
I guess you feel deeply wronged.

213
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,440
Are you that desperate to be treated like an owner?

214
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,720
Then you should be born again.

215
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,150
(Candidate Jin Do Jun)

216
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,440
Grandfather truly is an interesting man.

217
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,910
He said he wanted you to be the CEO of the holding company.

218
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,079
So what's with the will, then?

219
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,279
I thought long and hard.

220
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,480
If he was just joking, that's mean. And if it's a prank, that's cruel.

221
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,089
After long, careful consideration,

222
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,259
I decided to step in as his eldest grandson.

223
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,828
I wanted to show you in front of the shareholders...

224
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,430
how Grandfather's will should be interpreted.

225
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,230
Now, you're no match for us in this war.

226
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,500
You cannot exercise any management or voting rights.

227
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,069
Most importantly, you can no longer say...

228
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,549
that you're Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's favorite grandson.

229
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,950
There is only one thing you can do now.

230
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,720
Hand over all your shares in the holding company.

231
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,420
I'll pay a handsome price.

232
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Grandfather wrote in his will that you should...

233
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,970
live a life that has nothing to do with Soonyang.

234
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,539
How about you honor his last wishes?

235
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,109
As a dutiful grandson should.

236
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,619
You seem quite confident.

237
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,690
I've been racking my brain but still can't figure out...

238
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,759
what Grandfather really meant by what he wrote in his will.

239
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,670
Oh, this one thing I know.

240
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,710
I know what kind of choice...

241
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,950
Grandfather would make in this situation.

242
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,890
My dear fellow members of the National Assembly.

243
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,629
Vote against the bill to ease the separation...

244
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,199
of industrial and financial capital.

245
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,758
(Mayor Choi Chang Je's Announcement for Presidential Candidacy)

246
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,469
Put a stop to Soonyang's plan to establish...

247
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,869
a financial holding company.

248
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,768
This bill was devised to justify...

249
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,209
Soonyang's succession plans that seek to avoid...

250
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,380
the legal responsibilities that come with it.

251
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,308
The conglomerates are trying to push the bill through...

252
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,180
in order to avoid the astronomical inheritance taxes.

253
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,380
We need systems and rules in place...

254
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,389
to keep the conglomerates in check...

255
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,189
in order to alleviate economic polarization...

256
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,890
so that we can build a world where the economically weak...

257
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,459
can coexist with them.

258
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,430
(I will make economic democracy come true.)

259
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,460
I, Choi Chang Je,

260
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,629
promise you that I will open the threshold...

261
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,900
through economic democratization!

262
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,939
Earlier today, Mayor Choi Chang Je held a press conference,

263
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,868
where he stated he was against the bill...

264
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,078
to ease the separation of industrial and financial capital...

265
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,308
as it'd create legal loopholes for Soonyang...

266
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,108
prior to announcing he was running for President.

267
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:51,278
He stated that the late chairman, Jin Yang Cheol,

268
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,018
pushed for the establishment of the financial holding company...

269
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,489
to avoid having to pay astronomical inheritance taxes.

270
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,419
Some suspect that the company might have taken...

271
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,358
expedient measures to establish its financial holding company.

272
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,058
There are growing suspicions surrounding...

273
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,699
potential corrupt practices within Soonyang.

274
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,258
The National Assembly has voted against the bill...

275
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,469
to ease the separation of industrial and financial capital,

276
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,669
so the establishment of Soonyang Financial Holding Company...

277
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,369
fell through.

278
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,740
If our plans for the holding company fall through...

279
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,338
What should we take care of first?

280
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,879
We could've avoided at least a billion dollars...

281
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,778
in inheritance taxes by using the shares.

282
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,249
As soon as the market opens tomorrow,

283
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,679
all the stocks connected to the holding company will plummet.

284
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,150
Soonyang Insurance will drop to below 70 dollars per share.

285
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,759
The moment they vote against the bill,

286
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,419
we'll lose four billion dollars in cash.

287
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,359
Darn it! They say you should never trust your brother-in-law.

288
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,759
Why is Chang Je suddenly out to get us?

289
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,240
Shouldn't you know him better by now?

290
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:49,839
Do you really think...

291
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,839
that Chang Je came up with this plan?

292
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,180
You all think that?

294

Hey, nephew. People now call me...

the icon of economic democratization.

296
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,489
They say, with just a few words, I managed to persuade them...

297
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,329
to vote against the bill that was supposed to pass.

298
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,759
Anyway, how did you come up with an idea like this?

299
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:17,429
You used people's anger toward Chairman Jin Yang Cheol...

300
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,839
as an impetus...

301
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,299
to unite public opinion.

302
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,970
People do like heroes,

303
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,508
but they get a real kick out of watching a hero fall.

304
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,549
That's right.

305
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,910
But no one would ever imagine...

306
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,419
that the person who made the hero fall...

307
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,950
was none other than his favorite grandson.

308
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,220
Right?

309
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,429
Oh, the party leader is here.

310
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430

Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's long-cherished ambition,

314
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,279
was actually a part of the company's plan to avoid inheritance taxes...

315
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,249
is quickly making the countless mourners across the country...

turn away.

317

No one can deny that the late chairman, Jin Yang Cheol,

was a successful business leader.

319
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,199
However, we also cannot deny that he tried...

320

to influence politicians until his final moments...

321
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,868

That's why I want to change my will.

332
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,690
Why does Do Jun bother you so much, sir?

333
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,598
Do you know why that punk...

334
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,599
is trying so hard to save Soonyang Motors?

335
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,539
He knows his grandfather is dying, so he feels bad for me.

336
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,369
That's why he's peeing on his frozen foot.

337
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,109
That little brat.

338
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,450
Don't try to change my mind.

339
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,348
That punk is not getting a single penny from me.

340
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,118
Sir, Do Jun cares for you as your grandson...

341
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,259
You fool!

342
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,429
It's not like bullets care about stuff like that...

343
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,930
when you're fighting a war!

344
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,068
The two things that a fighter has no use for...

345
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,900
are his appendix and compassion. Sympathy!

346
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,809
You cannot afford to drag such useless emotions to a war.

347
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,410
It'll only weigh you down.

348
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,950
But if you leave nothing for Do Jun as this will states,

349
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,179
the succession plans will face obstacles, sir.

350
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,890
I will push him to the edge of a cliff.

351
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,019
That brat...

352
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,160
He'll do anything to survive.

353
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,529
I want him to see how he can be when he's hit rock bottom.

354
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,700
I know...

355
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,599
he...

356
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,710
wouldn't hesitate to sell me...

357
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,680
if he could buy Soonyang.

358
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,309
If he tramples all over me to go forward,

359
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,349
there will be nothing he can't do.

360
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,619
Only then...

361
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,529
can he protect Soonyang.

362
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,099
Sir, it's ready.

363
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,639
This video can serve as your legal will.

364
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,940
- Okay. - Shall we begin, then?

365
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,250
Sir.

366
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,559
Just relax and say what you'd like to tell Do Jun.

367
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,829
Do Jun?

368
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,740
Who is...

369
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,869
Do Jun, Chairman Jin?

370
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,130
Do Jun?

371
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,880
He's my grandson.

372
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,220
The one who takes after me the most.

373
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,700
My grandson.

374
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,650
It's Chairman Jin's legacy...

375
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,960
he left for you, Do Jun.

376
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,319
It's this one.

377
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,890
(Hangang Bank)

378
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,079
Chairman Jin made sure I handed it over to you...

379
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,980
once you understood the meaning of his will.

380
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,700
Soonyang Micro.

381
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,140
There was a document that wasn't on the list.

382
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:12,379
It was an old document that had passed the preservation year.

383
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,808
So at first, I thought of discarding it.

384
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,779
But there was a record that a fairly large amount of money...

385
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,950
had been stored for a long time.

386
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,099
Soonyang Micro is a dummy company...

387
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,268
that only exists on paper.

388
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,140
Someone is siphoning Soonyang's money overseas...

389
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:42,140
through this paper company, sir.

390
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:45,039
Go retrieve Soonyang's assets that have been siphoned off overseas.

391
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,750
That is your first mission as the senior finance manager.

392
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,259
Are you sure?

393
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,230
Is this truly the legacy Grandfather...

394
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,000
had left for me?

395
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,630
Chairman Jin had worked hard preparing it for quite a long time.

396
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,799
To give it to the successor over Soonyang.

397
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,740
Now, no one in Soonyang is aware...

398
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,779
of that money's existence.

399
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,309
And, of course, the money can't get tracked.

400
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:25,818
It's a perfect slush fund...

401
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,549
that can't get imposed by gift or inheritance tax.

402
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,220
Chairman Jin had made sure...

403
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,519
I understood multiple times.

404
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:36,588
To hand you that...

405
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,859
only when you have attained the lesson...

406
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,960
behind his will.

407
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,569
But why did he leave it to me?

408
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,808
If it were such a perfect slush fund,

409
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,109
nobody would have found it if you had kept it, Mr. Lee.

410
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,109
Was it your last loyalty to Grandfather,

411
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,579
or something like that?

412
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,089
If I were to tell you that was the case after so long,

413
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,490
would you believe me?

414
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,930
Being born a servant was not my choice.

415
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,769
But I could choose the owner to serve.

416
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,180
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki or Jin Dong Ki.

417
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,349
I can't hand over Soonyang to them.

418
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Aren't we on the same page, Do Jun?

419
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,460
He has been elected as the 16th presidential candidate of our party.

420
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:53,940
- Choi Chang Je! - Choi Chang Je!

421
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,470
Are you happy?

422
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,980
Mayor Choi Chang Je, the icon of economic democratization.

423
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,848
I only found out today that...

424
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:05,250
Korea still had a sense of justice.

425
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,078
I glamorized and made you, a self-supporting student...

426
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,250
from the countryside, the mayor of Seoul.

427
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,119
So how could you betray your wife's family?

428
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,420
Such a man shouldn't become the president.

429
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,129
That shrewd Do Jun...

430
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,629
didn't like what he had.

431
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,029
So he gathered everyone and turned everything over.

432
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,570
He egged you on...

433
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,768
to bring the holding company to naught...

434
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,010
and repeal the separation of industrial and financial capital.

435
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,138
No. It was me.

436
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,709
Bringing the financial holding company...

437
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,908
to naught was my idea from beginning to end.

438
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,279
A tycoon should never own a bank.

439
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,819
That's the political conviction of Choi Chang Je,

440
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,050
the tycoon sharpshooter.

441
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,289
Let's hear about your political conviction.

442
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,230
So who will become the president?

443
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,699
For goodness' sake.

444
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,469
You're really something. You really are.

445
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,768
Is that something to ask me right at this moment?

446
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,039
Yes. Right at this moment,

447
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,209
I must tell my brothers, who might end up paying one billion dollars...

448
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,280
as inheritance tax because of you,

449
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,150
that I, Jin Hwa Young, am still a useful card...

450
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,348
so that your second political life can begin.

451
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:17,420
Stop it.

452
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,590
So tell me. Who will win the presidential election?

453
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,960
Who must we deliver the money to?

454
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,230
The one in favor...

455
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,400
has already been decided, no?

456
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,439
Who's the one in favor? Tell me.

457
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,538
This is the men's room!

458
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,210
Who is it?

459
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,909
Are you sure he's in favor?

460
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,650
The ruling party candidate is causing a sensation right now.

461
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,218
Come on. It's a meager sensation.

462
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,948
Who can go up against us...

463
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,719
by catching a mere piggy bank?

464
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,960
Daeyoung Group...

465
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:59,259
sent off two dump trunks of bills a couple of days ago.

466
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,059
This country is still a long way off.

467
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,730
That candidate in favor.

468
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:04,968
Isn't he known to be upright?

469
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:08,599
The more reason he'll love money that's new and crisp.

470
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,039
Let's go with the candidate in favor before it's too late.

471
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,110
Do we not need insurance...

472
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,349
for the other candidate?

473
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,949
Let's give them a small token of our sincerity.

474
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,018
If Grandfather had been alive,

475
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,849
he would've fully supported one candidate.

476
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,130
Young Ki.

477
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,190
We're in the same boat now, okay?

478
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,900
There won't be a need to turn back.

479
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,440
You and I are of the same mind, after all.

480
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,409
Gosh, really. Our father must be proud.

481
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:54,619
Proud of the close bond the three of us have.

482
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:56,949
Geez, Hwa Young.

483
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,959
I thought the media would die down...

484
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,000
if Uncle lost the candidate election.

485
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,730
But he's still at the center of the attention.

486
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,098
A tycoon should not own a bank.

487
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,940
Forty-one percent of the general public agrees.

488
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:17,609
Seventy-one percent of economics professors agree.

489
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,980
I'm going to make a constitutional appeal.

490
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,308
I so will, period.

491
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,880
How come? Isn't it a chance for us?

492
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,050
The holding company establishment went to pieces.

493
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,988
Joint shares and voting rights...

494
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,889
with Uncle Young Ki will mean nothing.

495
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,659
We need to find a way to survive.

496
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,329
So what? Do you have one in mind?

497
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,659
Don't worry, Father.

498
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,800
Right now, there's only one way to become Soonyang Group's head.

499
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,109
It's to have the shares of Soonyang affiliates...

500
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,480
and become the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

501
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,009
Uncle Dong Ki doesn't even come close...

502
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,409
to your Soonyang Corporation shares.

503
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,980
Dong Ki isn't someone...

504
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,949
who will easily give up the head position to me.

505
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,320
By now, I bet he's figuring out the numbers like crazy.

506
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,189
Say that again. Do what?

507
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,960
Let's separate financial affiliates...

508
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,329
from Soonyang Group and make them independent.

509
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,339
We can use public opinion as the pretext.

510
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,710
Rather than the hopeless Soonyang Group head,

511
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,739
doesn't the chairman of a financial group...

512
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,980
sound good?

513
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,320
Gosh. Well, I...

514
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,250
For Soonyang to become a national company,

515
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,690
I'll sacrifice myself.

516
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,369
What brings you here so early, Mr. Oh?

517
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,429
Is something going on?

518
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,840
Your face is telling me you haven't heard of the news.

519
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:56,739
What news?

520
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,678
The board of directors of Soonyang Investment...

521
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,679
dismissed me from the CEO position.

522
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,518
It's not only Soonyang Investment.

523
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,590
It includes Soonyang Fire Insurance and Soonyang Asset Management.

524
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,759
The board of directors rose up and replaced all the CEOs.

525
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,788
I know.

526
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:14,959
Both the board of directors of Soonyang Investment...

527
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,158
and Soonyang Fire Insurance...

528
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,058
are former CEOs or the owners' families.

529
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:20,260
They're under Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki's influence.

530
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,599
Yes.

531
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,869
That means Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki has started to move independently.

532
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,670
Oh, let me get you some coffee. Please wait.

533
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:32,909
Everyone!

534
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,380
Please become wealthy!

535
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,449
Promise!

536
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,150
Daeyoung thinks about your success.

537
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:44,219
Daeyoung Card.

538
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,789
Mr. Oh. It's time we sell it.

539
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,590
Soonyang Card.

540
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,599
(Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong)

541
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,369
You're being transferred, Prosecutor Seo.

542
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,139
Maybe you bit too hard into Soonyang until now.

543
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,480
(Supreme Prosecutor's Office Central Investigation Division)

544
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,380
Thanks to you,

545
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,809
I get to work here.

546
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,519
Are you that pleased?

547
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,288
I'm glad.

548
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,190
I was worried I might have imposed on you.

549
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,860
You weren't too happy about it, were you?

550
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,189
But it's a promotion.

551
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,460
Is it?

552
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,658
I thought it was a demotion.

553
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,130
A demotion? No way.

554
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,629
This is the Prosecutor's Office's flower,

555
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,139
Central Investigation Division. It has great power.

556
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,409
We won't know until the presidential election is over.

557
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,638
But I heard the next government...

558
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,379
would abolish the Central Investigation Division.

559
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,078
That rumor has been going on since the civilian government.

560
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,380
This time, it's not just a rumor.

561
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:49,219
I got transferred to this division.

562
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,618
If the Central Investigation Division...

563
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,659
were going to keep striving,

564
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,159
I would not be here.

565
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,599
I'm going home first. You should too.

566
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,389
It'll all be over once I'm appointed CEO.

567
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,059
I won't let you down anymore.

568
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,889
You're wrong.

569
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,659
You'll become even more spiteful.

570
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,860
Because you'd want to keep what you have.

571
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:49,110
Hey. If I want to go independent as Soonyang Financial Group,

572
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,610
there's an urgent business we need to settle.

573
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,319
Is it liquidating...

574
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,379
Chairman Jin Young Ki's shares in the financial affiliates?

575
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,789
You are half right and half wrong.

576
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,259
Can I buy Young Ki's shares with the money I have right now?

577
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,319
No, it's impossible.

578
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,959
I need a cash cow that will earn me money...

579
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,289
until the separation is complete.

580
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,359
So, is the cash cow slash golden goose...

581
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,269
you're thinking of inside Soonyang Group?

582
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,170
Soonyang Card.

583
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,670
Nothing beats a card company in cash flows.

584
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,209
So I'm going to buy Soonyang Card first.

585
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,780
Do you think Do Jun will sell it?

586
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,109
If it's a cash cow even you have eyes on,

587
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,809
I doubt Do Jun will put it out for sale.

588
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,920
I think he'll sell it.

589
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,389
You'll sell it?

590
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,059
You'll sell Sooyang Card to me?

591
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,389
Yes.

592
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:48,139
It hasn't been that long since you took over Soonyang Card.

593
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:49,840
Thanks to Cheongwadae...

594
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:52,468
lifting all regulations to improve the domestic market...

595
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,440
before the presidential election,

596
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,210
the growth of card companies has been steep.

597
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,449
But you're going to hand it over to me?

598
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,489
Why?

599
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,019
You're going to buy it at a high price, aren't you?

600
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:16,429
Honestly, even the holding company establishment went down the drain.

601
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,229
So I don't think you, who's quick with numbers...

602
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,969
and has a great sense of reality,

603
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:25,340
will waste time clinging to becoming the head of Soonyang Group.

604
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,808
If I were in your shoes, Uncle Dong Ki,

605
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,409
I would go independent from Soonyang Group...

606
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,849
and split off into a financial group.

607
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,848
To do so, I thought you would need Soonyang Card...

608
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:40,360
that could bring in cash at any time,

609
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,690
even if you had to liquidate your share.

610
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,030
You.

611
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,169
Couldn't you, Do Jun, separate...

612
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,269
Soonyang Financial Group and manage it?

613
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,940
You already have Soonyang Card,

614
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,170
the cash cow.

615
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,480
Me,

616
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,149
who got branded an evil guy blinded by legacy...

617
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,949
at the shareholders' meeting?

618
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,549
Will Soonyang Group's board of directors,

619
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,590
united with loyalties for Grandfather,

620
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,619
choose me as the head...

621
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,030
and CEO of Soonyang Group?

622
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,259
I don't think so.

623
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,400
You were the punk...

624
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,169
who had cut off the holding company establishment...

625
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,099
your grandfather had worked so hard on.

626
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,239
Even so, you're giving it up just like that?

627
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,750
Because I threw away my dream of succeeding Soonyang Group.

628
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,250
I'm going to return to my original place.

629
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,090
As Miracle's investment specialist, Jin Do Jun.

630
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,729
So what's most important to me right now...

631
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,730
isn't Soonyang but money, Uncle Dong Ki.

632
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,230
And as you already know,

633
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,800
the more money, the better.

634
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,249
He's probably going to ask...

635
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,649
for more than 800 million dollars for selling off Soonyang Card.

636
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,219
What do you think, Mr. Baek?

637
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:19,119
Should I go for it or not?

638
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,789
More than that, Vice-Chairman Jin.

639
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,190
In 2003, the Year of the Black Sheep,

640
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,690
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's...

641
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,199
new year's fortune will change.

642
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,269
So what?

643
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,730
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki has a fate eulmokilju.

644
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,868
He has been in the shade of a large tree,

645
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,738
unable to make his way.

646
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,340
But starting in the Year of the Black Sheep,

647
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,439
water will seep into the thirsty tree,

648
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,280
which will bring him great luck.

649
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,649
What's this all about, Mr. Baek?

650
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,879
Hold on.

651
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,178
Out of all the Year of the Black Sheep,

652
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,449
the yin and yang...

653
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:51,920
of the Five-elements will attract to each other the most this year.

654
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,558
And in all probability,

655
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,760
there might be a storm like the IMF crisis next year.

656
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:58,888
Let's be prepared.

657
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,230
What about my fortune?

658
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,768
Should I buy Soonyang Card? Does it say I should?

659
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:05,030
Father.

660
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,238
Your fortune next year...

661
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,739
is mugyejihwa. It's full of fire.

662
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,210
It meets metal and blazes.

663
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:17,980
It looks like you're in luck with the finance industry.

664
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,179
What are you two doing?

665
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,150
How can you decide to buy out Soonyang Card like this?

666
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,558
You need the opinions of experts.

667
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,759
Mr. Baek is an expert.

668
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,059
He's an analyst who was formerly an accountant.

669
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,559
Ye Jun, you said that Do Jun won't sell Soonyang Card.

670
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:38,300
But look. Everything is unfolding according to his words.

671
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Eight hundred million dollars is too much money to leave up to luck.

672
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:43,239
I know how good Mr. Baek is...

673
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,280
because we've worked together all along.

674
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,250
You're admitting that...

675
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,949
you've been running the company like this to this day.

676
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,619
- Does the Internal Inspection know? - Jin Ye Jun!

677
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,920
You punk. Get out.

678
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,329
You're the only one who doesn't qualify to be here now.

679
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:16,739
Vice-Chairman Jin, do you remember?

680
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,579
When the US stock market crashed after the September 11 attack,

681
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,538
if you went with my advice,

682
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,849
you wouldn't have lost Soonyang Investment...

683
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,710
to Miracle Investment.

684
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,980
Make a call.

685
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,250
I'm buying Soonyang Card.

686
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,690
Do you really think Soonyang Card is only worth 800 million dollars?

687
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,659
Okay, then.

688
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:45,400
Let's negotiate the details when we meet next time.

689
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,539
Yes, give me a call.

690
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,150
You're selling Soonyang Card to whom?

691
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,119
Is it Uncle Dong Ki?

692
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:11,659
He can't answer, which means I'm right, Father.

693
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,670
Hey.

694
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,340
What brings you here today?

695
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,670
He'd like to go with you on his way to work.

696
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,820
I hear Do Jun will sell Soonyang Card.

697
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,829
I heard that...

698
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,759
you stepped in as the new owner.

699
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,900
What are you saying?

700
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,769
Who said that? Do Jun?

701
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,369
Do you still believe what Do Jun says?

702
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,969
It's fine if it isn't you.

703
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:01,408
I thought a go-getter like you...

704
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:04,079
was trying to break away as a financial group,

705
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,210
so I had to hurry over from the morning.

706
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,119
This is unsettling. I should use this chance...

707
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,389
to purchase Soonyang Card.

708
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,218
You're going to buy Soonyang Card?

709
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:17,260
That way, there would be zero chance for the affiliation to break away.

710
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,130
I also don't want to be mistaken about you over a rumor,

711
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,800
which will lead me down the evil path.

712
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:24,900
Nothing good can come from that between us.

713
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,739
Dong Ki, don't forget.

714
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,809
It's only meaningful when we are united.

715
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:36,349
Both Soonyang and us brothers.

716
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,960
Hey, Jin Do Jun!

717
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,429
What do you want?

718
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,699
Are you trying to put Young Ki against me over Soonyang Card?

719
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,909
I wouldn't.

720
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,809
I was taught to always stop fights, but strike a bargain.

721
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,539
What?

722
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,280
Thanks to that, Uncle Dong Ki, you ran over here at this hour.

723
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,820
In that case, why don't we start the proper negotiation?

724
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,219
Shall we?

725
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,629
You offered 800 million dollars for Soonyang Card,

726
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,260
so let's start the bargain from twice that price.

727
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,929
Twice?

728
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,630
I want 1.6 billion dollars.

729
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:36,710
That's the price for Soonyang Card offered by Jeongsimjae.

730
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,879
If you need more time to think...

731
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,150
Can I pay half and half?

732
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,250
I'll transfer 800 million today, and the rest next time.

733
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:53,960
Okay, sure. As long as the collateral is solid.

734
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,590
Are you demanding the shares of the financial affiliations?

735
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,058
Hey, you punk!

736
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,098
I'll take the collateral as Soonyang Corporation's shares.

737
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,130
Two percent of your share.

738
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,769
I don't care for the financial group.

739
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,769
Don't worry about it.

740
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,840
Then why?

741
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:14,880
Among all of your moveable and fixed assets,

742
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,949
isn't that the most valuable as collateral?

743
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,449
The shares of the Corporation.

744
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,750
I'll get it ready and call you.

745
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,058
I do have one more condition.

746
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:28,289
Good grief, what?

747
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,360
I need some untraceable money,

748
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,300
apart from the sale price for Soonyang Card.

749
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,039
A slush fund?

750
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,440
It truly is the high season.

751
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,408
Even an investment company like Miracle is...

752
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:53,619
preparing political funds for the presidential election?

753
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,820
According to Mr. Oh Se Hyeon, in the US,

754
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,690
the Wall Street is the funding behind the presidential election.

755
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,159
That 45 percent of political funds come from the Wall Street.

756
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,260
It means the main industry has changed.

757
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:07,429
From manufacturing to finances.

758
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,460
Do you know...

759
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,169
to whom and how you should transfer the money...

760
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,869
to make sure there's no trouble later?

761
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,139
Trouble?

762
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,939
You need to bribe them...

763
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,039
without a delivery mistake and not letting anyone else know.

764
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,449
Well, I guess your father doesn't have what it takes...

765
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,719
to teach you something like that.

766
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,119
And Mr. Oh may know a lot about the Wall Street,

767
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,289
but he's probably a layman when it comes to Yeouido.

768
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,530
This is a man we've worked with since your grandfather's days.

769
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Call him.

770
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,029
(Kang Sin Woo)

771
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,239
I see.

772
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,110
(Apple)

773
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,859
He made a slush fund by using dormant accounts...

774
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,489
of Soonyang Fire Insurance and Soonyang Investment.

775
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,329
I see. Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki is nothing like how he looks.

776
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,698
I thought he was the timid, nerdy type.

777
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:21,099
But he's a man with great spirit.

778
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,510
He borrowed the dormant accounts of his clients to do this deed?

779
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,538
And it was during the IMF crisis,

780
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:28,840
while everyone was wailing.

781
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,480
Goodness, so bold.

782
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,809
He's not afraid of anything.

783
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,579
He probably couldn't imagine...

784
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,079
that of all people,

785
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,289
CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle became the CEO of Soonyang Investment...

786
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,559
and find his biggest weakness.

787
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:48,030
His daughter is something too.

788
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,329
She's in a different league compared to other rich kids.

789
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,170
You said she passionately volunteers in third-world countries, right?

790
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:58,639
She picks out only the countries where she can evade taxes.

791
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,839
Thanks to her,

792
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,510
we made ten million dollars in slush fund without trouble.

793
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:07,219
The fruit of someone else's work is always the most delicious.

794
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,119
I find this even more delicious.

795
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:11,449
What is this?

796
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,618
Come on.

797
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,960
- Roh Moo Hyun! - Roh Moo Hyun!

798
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:18,760
- Roh Moo Hyun! - Roh Moo Hyun!

799
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,559
Man.

800
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,230
I was easily persuaded by Dong Ki once again.

801
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,670
Good grief.

802
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,170
What now? Go with the flow before it's too late?

803
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,340
Two brothers should get on the same boat?

804
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,448
How much money did I load on that boat?

805
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:40,750
You should be helping me in some way as my older brother.

806
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,618
- What now? - There's no need to turn back?

807
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,419
We should unite as brothers?

808
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,320
Okay, sure. Why don't you pray...

809
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:49,820
that we'll both jump in the water and die?

810
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,630
You said the candidate in favor was decided.

811
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,859
Didn't you say the law of an election is...

812
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,570
that the general trend cannot be overturned?

813
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,469
I did. But don't you know?

814
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:03,099
Everything comes with an exception. Should've heard me out to the end.

815
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:04,969
What did you say?

816
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,339
The law of the Korean president elections is...

817
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,808
that the big trend cannot be overturned.

818
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:12,250
However, that is only until a sharp gust blows.

819
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,518
The opposition party had the general popularity,

820
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,550
but the ruling party's candidate turned out to be a gust.

821
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:20,090
So go tell your brothers that...

822
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,419
we should lie low for a while as the wind blows.

823
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,059
Go tell them yourself.

824
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:29,730
They lost 30 million dollars at your word!

825
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Goodness, look who this is.

826
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,480
Yes, congratulations, Mr. President.

827
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,110
Yes, right. I should have called first.

828
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:46,349
Yes.

829
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,480
Yes. Pardon?

830
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,289
Me?

831
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,159
Yes, I'll do my best if you leave me to it.

832
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:00,559
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

833
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,500
Yes. Goodbye.

834
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,900
What? He wants...

835
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:13,909
to appoint me as the Minister of Justice.

836
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,210
Did he call the right man?

837
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:21,480
You two are affiliated with opposite parties.

838
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,819
I doubt you two speak the same language.

839
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,889
That's why.

840
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,920
He said I'm the face of unification of the two parties.

841
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,599
How so?

842
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,670
Credit card delinquency rate continues to rise up,

843
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:42,268
and it recorded an all-time high in just two years.

844
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:44,908
This is the breakdown of Lee's credit card usage.

845
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,308
He maxed out all four credit cards...

846
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:48,879
in cash advances,

847
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,549
then paid one card off with another, and was banned from new loans.

848
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,479
Your credit card is two months overdue.

849
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,549
Until last year, credit defaulters rose...

850
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,789
by 60,000 to 70,000 people a month.

851
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:00,158
But this year, this increased by 100,000 people a month,

852
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,519
reaching a total of three million at the end of last month.

853
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:14,239
You encouraged me to buy Soonyang Card.

854
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,309
What was that about metal and whatnot?

855
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,710
It's set ablaze?

856
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,848
I'm in luck with the financial industry?

857
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:29,579
What is this? What now?

858
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,489
Nothing you say is right.

859
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,929
Actually, the energy of fire was a bit too strong,

860
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,989
which melts the metal disappear.

861
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,130
Hey, this guy.

862
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:47,869
Is that what you should say now?

863
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,610
Wait.

864
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:55,480
So what is this? Will Soonyang Card go bankrupt?

865
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,980
Contact the government for another support. Now.

866
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,979
Financial Supervisory Service is giving us pressure...

867
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,988
- that we help ourselves first. - Help ourselves?

868
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:07,888
You should liquidate the shares of other affiliations first...

869
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:08,920
You!

870
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,760
Then how will I be separated as a financial group?

871
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,969
I can only think of one way...

872
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,369
out of this mess.

873
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,980
(All cash advance service for all Soonyang Card is now suspended.)

874
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:33,078
You can't suddenly stop the cash advance service!

875
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:35,618
You aren't allowed to do this without our agreement!

876
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:38,489
- He's right! - I need the money now!

877
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,118
After the halt on cash advance service,

878
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,730
the stock price for all affiliations have plummeted.

879
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,229
He can't even take control of some credit card company.

880
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,900
How can he want to separate as a financial group?

881
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,960
Is Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki in his office?

882
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,409
You finally showed your face, my brother.

883
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:05,578
You never bothered to call when I desperately looked for you...

884
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:07,219
to pay back the credit card bond.

885
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:11,749
But you ran over at once once the stock prices dropped.

886
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,889
How much do you need...

887
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,389
to bring back the cash advance service?

888
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,829
I need 400 million dollars now.

889
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,760
You're about to go bankrupt because you don't have 400 million?

890
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,469
Didn't you dream of creating a financial group?

891
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,440
How can you let this go bankrupt over just 400 million dollars?

892
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,050
Once Soonyang Card goes bankrupt, it'll put you in worse trouble.

893
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,289
Two percent of my shares for Soonyang Corporation is...

894
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,989
What about those shares?

895
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,389
When I bought Soonyang Card,

896
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,090
I gave it to Miracle as the collateral.

897
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,269
I'm saying two percent of Soonyang Corporation...

898
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,929
will end up in Do Jun's hands.

899
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:10,010
Since I'm the elder of this family,

900
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:11,849
I thought I should figure this out.

901
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,280
My brother is about to go bankrupt with Soonyang Card any day now,

902
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,619
but my nephew,

903
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,820
you still need 800 million dollars from selling Soonyang Card?

904
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,929
Don't worry. I'll buy out that bond.

905
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,198
You will?

906
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:34,840
The government and the media are all over me saying...

907
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,070
I should step on on the group level and restore the card company.

908
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,679
How should I take responsibility for those dead-end people...

909
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,879
who didn't know their worth and maxed out their cards,

910
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,250
paying off one with another?

911
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,618
We broke the champagne a little too early...

912
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:54,619
and went through the IMF crisis, yet people still are this foolish.

913
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,630
The entire country is in a moral hazard.

914
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,300
I can't do that, Uncle Young Ki.

915
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,039
I cannot give you the shares for Soonyang Corporation.

916
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,939
Does this mean you still haven't given up on Soonyang?

917
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,280
I took this money in return for giving up Soonyang.

918
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,579
We need to do the math right.

919
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,190
I need 800 million dollars for selling Soonyang Card,

920
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,730
but what you want from me is...

921
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,489
Soonyang Corporation's shares I took as collateral, right?

922
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:36,800
That's what you need to become the chairman.

923
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:42,699
I want twice as much, 1.6 billion dollars.

924
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:46,538
What? 1.6 billion dollars?

925
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:49,579
You'll be the next chairman and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's successor.

926
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:53,280
You can't put a price on such a position.

927
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:10,300
(Signed by Jin Do Jun, Jin Young Ki)

928
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,280
I think 1.6 billion dollars would have helped...

929
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,079
Soonyang Card get back on their feet.

930
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,349
But you used this money...

931
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,650
to buy Soonyang Group's chairman position.

932
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:40,559
Right.

933
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,570
Did you say the entire country is in a moral hazard?

934
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,969
I think so too, Uncle Young Ki.

935
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,800
(Soonyang Card)

936
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:29,110
(You're killing small business owners!)

937
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:36,249
(Give me my money, you jerks.)

938
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,389
(I need to put out my life to pay back my credit card bill.)

939
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,698
(You issued it as you like, but you won't take responsibility.)

940
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:53,800
(I'm neck-deep in debt, and you're responsible.)

941
01:03:57,869 --> 01:03:59,469
(Do you need money? Call immediately.)

942
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,389
(Do you need money? Call immediately.)

943
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,030
(Do you need money? Call immediately.)

944
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,269
Goodness.

945
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,869
(Contacts: Dad)

946
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,119
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

947

(Hospital Statement)

948
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,579
Hey, Dae Kyun. Yes, it's me, Hyeon Woo.

949
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:14,920
Have you been well?

950
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,079
Well, by any chance,

951
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:20,690
I was wondering if I can borrow some money.

952
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:22,889
Hey, Tae Hyun.

953
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,889
Can you let me borrow just 5,000 dollars?

954
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,099
Can you let me borrow some money?

955
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:30,328
I'm calling for the livelihood loan program.

956
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:32,500
Can a contract worker like me take out a loan?

957
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,900
Is that so?

958
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,340
No, I see.

959
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,340
Yes, have a good night.

960
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,650
Yes, goodbye.

961
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,510
What happened, Father?

962
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,980
Why won't you pick up your phone?

963
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,050
Where have you been all along?

964
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:26,090
You left the sick kid at the hospital alone.

965
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:28,320
Let's talk at home.

966
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,690
Hyeon Min will be discharged tomorrow.

967
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,829
What about the hospital bill?

968
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:42,539
How can he be discharged? We don't have any money.

969
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:46,239
I took care of everything.

970
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,639
You don't have to worry.

971
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,849
(Do you need money? Call immediately.)

972
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,389
Father.

973
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:00,619
We need to talk.

974
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,630
(Seoul Hospital)

975
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,369
Father, by any chance,

976
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,610
did you take out a private loan?

977
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:25,579
I'll pay back everything.

978
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,579
You don't have to mind it.

979
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,489
You're going to pay it back?

980
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,960
You're a credit delinquent.

981
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:39,159
You're unemployed.

982
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:42,659
How are you going to do that?

983
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:45,769
What's your plan?

984
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,699
Then what else could I do as a father?

985
01:07:51,139 --> 01:07:52,268
I needed to do something.

986
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,539
Just don't do anything!

987
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,079
Father.

988
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,510
Will you just stay still?

989
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,190
Everyone else is a decent parent, so you don't need to be one!

990
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,989
Dad, please.

991
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,329
All you need to do is breathe and stay alive.

992
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,559
Help me live, okay?

993
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,840
That night, my poverty was...

994
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,069
a jerk.

995
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,060
Yes, I'm the chauffeur.

996
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,759
Yes, I'm almost there.

997
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,869
May I ask once again for the location?

998
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,868
It's bitter.

999
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:55,140
Excuse me.

1000
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,639
One more drink, please.

1001
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,310
Did anyone call for chauffeur service?

1002
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,180
- Over here. - Hello.

1003
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,579
Mr. Yoon?

1004
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,810
Goodness, it is you.

1005
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,180
Do you work as a chauffeur?

1006
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:08,819
You have two jobs?

1007
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,049
- Hello. - Can you do your day job right?

1008
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:15,020
You need good performance to sign with us again.

1009
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,389
I dread how kids these days are...

1010
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,859
only concerned about money.

1011
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,229
Why? It's nice to be rich.

1012
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,569
Mr. Yoon, I hope you get rich.

1013
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:28,670
Please enjoy.

1014
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,000
Hey...

1015
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,689
Hey. Hey!

1016
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,488
Hey, what's wrong?

1017
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,698
- What's wrong? - Hey, you need to stop the car.

1018
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:31,069
- Has he gone insane? - Stop the car now!

1019
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:40,170
- Hey, let's go. - Hey, get out of the car.

1020
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,679
Get out. Get out of here.

1021
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,978
- Hey, darn you. - Stop it.

1022
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:45,979
Get out!

1023
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,578
What kind of a psycho are you?

1024
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:49,479
Hey, you.

1025
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:52,020
- Man, I'm going to kill you. - Ju Young, stop.

1026
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,759
- Man, I'll get you. - Ju Young, stop.

1027
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,319
- Let's go. - Good grief.

1028
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:57,760
Call another chauffeur.

1029
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,090
Man, he's making me mad.

1030
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,779
I inherited wealth.

1031
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,520
Poverty was passed down to you.

1032
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,289
We live...

1033
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,529
in the same time,

1034
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:36,359
under the same sky,

1035
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:38,970
but in different worlds.

1036
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,239
We're worlds apart, like the previous life and this life,

1037
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,439
in a faraway orbit.

1038
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:59,789
(Reborn Rich)

1039
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,618
Why are you so proud...

1040
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,589
of your infamous loan shark family of Myeong-dong?

1041
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:42,658
We used that dirty money to buy out everything...

1042
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:45,100
to turn my husband into the chairman.

1043
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:48,769
The group will be succeeded to the eldest son once again.

1044
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,970
My father, me, and my son.

1045
01:12:51,069 --> 01:12:52,938
As soon as we receive two percent of the Corporation,

1046
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:56,279
we'll announce the new chairman of Soonyang Group, Chairman Jin.

1047
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,850
I'm the biggest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

1048
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,649
Call her.

1049
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,449
There's someone you want to meet on a day like this, right?

1050
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,419
You're under emergency arrest...

1051
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,189
for the illegal handover of political funds.

1052
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,659
We meet again like this,

1053
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:14,329
as a prosecutor and a suspect.

1054
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,029
