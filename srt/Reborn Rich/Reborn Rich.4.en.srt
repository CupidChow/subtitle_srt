2
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,560
What you want...

3
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,859
isn't just Hando Steel?

4
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,369
In the end, what you want...

5
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,769
is Soonyang?

6
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,780
You want to become the owner of Soonyang?

(Episode 4)

8
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,150
It may be...

9
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,359
a bigger and bolder desire.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,260
And that's why...

11
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,629
I need Hando Steel.

12
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,739
It's my present.

13
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,879
I prepared it to welcome you back to Korea.

14
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,260
You're one with worldly desire but not so deep pockets.

15
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,659
This over here is your actual gift.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,469
The doughnut shop from 34 Midway Avenue in New York?

17
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,180
When did a shop open up in Korea?

18
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,680
Soonyang FNC signed a licensing deal.

19
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,580
I asked my grandfather a favor.

20
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,180
It was brought in just for you, Mr. Oh.

21
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,990
Did you learn it from your grandfather?

22
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,120
The basic rule of investment.

23
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,930
The basic rule of investment?

24
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,929
In order to understand the flow of money,

25
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,770
there is something you must first be aware of.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,599
The people who have control over it.

27
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,500
Understanding the market...

28
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,069
is the same as understanding the players within it.

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,239
You've displayed that...

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,740
by demonstrating how well you understand me.

31
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,330
Oh Se Hyeon, was it?

32
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,330
Yes, Mr. Vice-Chairman.

33
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,729
Look into him.

34
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,370
I want to get inside his head...

35
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,539
and know about who he meets.

Goodness.

That's it.

My goodness.

44
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,769
Our cars went dashing as soon as the race began.

45
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,170
The development team wasn't lying.

46
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,208
The engine power...

47
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,509
of our latest model, Athene, surpasses that of bigger cars.

48
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,579
You must be proud, Father.

49
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,909
If it wins the race today,

50
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,818
that alone could be what you talk about...

51
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,849
at the launch this evening.

52
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,519
We're off to a great start.

53
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,459
Father, it's about Hando Steel.

54
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,129
Now that Power Shares is involved,

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,170
we might need to increase the cost of acquisition.

56
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,639
I'll leave you to handle it.

57
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,910
But know that the responsibility is yours.

58
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,910
Sure. I'll move forward, then.

59
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,818
It's not just...

60
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,379
the sports channels and magazines that are here.

61
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,350
Even economic journalists are present.

62
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,959
They agreed beforehand...

63
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,459
to cover the race and the launching event.

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,699
- Good. - The media will eat this up.

65
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,800
It has drama, right?

66
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,000
Father, I wonder what tomorrow's headline will be.

67
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,508
"Soonyang Motors the Worst in Its Field..."

68

"Comes Back from Behind in Style on the Tracks!"

69
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,448
How about this, then? "The Black Sheep of the Family,"

70
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,180
"Soonyang Motors."

71
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,579
"The Speed Fanatics of Soonyang..."

72
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,189
"Once Again Waste Their Time and Money."

73
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,519
The money to keep these tracks open,

74
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,629
the racing team operating costs, and sponsoring tournaments.

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,259
Clinging onto a business for years that hasn't yielded a profit...

76
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,930
isn't like you at all.

77
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,470
Hwa Young.

78
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,269
- You... - Sir.

79
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,110
It's chilly outside. Maybe you should head inside.

80
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,310
- Allow me to escort you. - We should go.

81
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,889
- What's wrong with her? - Well, it's...

82
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,300
Chang Je is your one and only son-in-law.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,768
Even sons-in-law are considered sons,

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,099
and you have the power...

85
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,439
to give someone a seat at the National Assembly.

86
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,239
How can you not care at all?

87
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,508
Honey, that's enough.

88
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,810
Chang Je...

89
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,750
I mean, does the racing team mean more to you than your daughter?

90
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,208
You.

91
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,749
Hwa Young, you are...

92
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,519
my one and only daughter among my sons.

93
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,019
Father...

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,829
Let it continue to be that way.

95
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,560
Let yourself remain as my only daughter among my sons.

96
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,839
Don't get greedy by wanting more.

97
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,550
Are you saying...

98
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,979
that you have no intention...

99
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,990
of helping Chang Je become an assemblyman?

100
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,850
Never?

101
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,319
You are my daughter for sure.

102
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,189
I'm glad I won't have to say it twice.

103
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,208
Honey, don't be too upset.

104
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,078
Your father still adores you...

105
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,708
as his one and only daughter.

106
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,549
It's just me who he disapproves.

107
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,720
So what if I'm his only daughter?

108
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,350
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,920
Don't you know what he means by the word?

110
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,258
Of course I do.

111
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,588
"Gomyeong" in Korean is the garnish that tops off a fancy dish.

112
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,230
What would that imply, then?

113
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,929
My brothers are the entree.

114
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,268
Since I'm his daughter,

115
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,329
I'm the garnish that complements them.

116
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,199
That's what he meant.

117
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,639
Gosh, I had no idea.

118
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,079
I wonder if he's aware of how clever you are.

119
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,180
That's what I'll do.

120
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,449
I should let him know.

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,750
That his daughter...

122
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,259
isn't the garnish but the entree.

123
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,559
Honey, please.

124
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Goodness me.

(Soonyang Tire)

00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,289
It just finished its 24th lap.

127
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,120
It must complete three more for the race to be done.

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,590
Isn't now the time for that saying?

129
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,000
"It's not over..."

130
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,669
"until it's over."

131
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,480
Sir, Chairman Ju Yeong Il of Daeyoung Group is here.

132
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,450
Hey, there, Chairman Jin.

133
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,590
I see you came down here early.

134
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,659
Chairman Ju Yeong Il of Daeyoung Group.

135
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,558
During the Korean War,

136
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,700
he defected from North Korea completely broke...

137
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,870
and found the group that is now number one...

138
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,299
in financial circles.

139
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,869
The two driving forces...

140
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,969
behind the development of the Korean economy...

141
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,580
who rival each other in every way.

142
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,049
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol and Chairman Ju Yeong Il.

143
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,990
The two historic legends...

144
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,919
are right before my very eyes.

145
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,090
Goodness, I couldn't be more ashamed.

146
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,629
My boys should've known better...

147
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,928
than to drive at full speed while in your backyard.

148
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,039
They sped up as if nothing else mattered.

149
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,740
Youngsters these days...

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,870
are just as ill-mannered as their boss.

151
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,179
- I apologize for that. - Nonsense.

152
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,250
From what I can tell by the look on your face,

153
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,950
my boys have been gracious hosts today.

154
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,720
I heard the news.

155
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,259
You're going to take over Hando Steel?

156
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,960
You just can't give up on Soonyang Motors.

157
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,999
After acquiring Hando Steel,

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,230
you hope to grow your business.

159
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,000
All so that you could bring me and my group down.

160
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Chairman Ju.

161
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,240
I am not a common thug.

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,479
I'm a businessman.

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,279
And businessmen should make profits.

164
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,110
Judging by the money you're bleeding,

165
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,720
one could safely call this an old man's hobby.

166
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,350
Chairman Ju.

167
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,820
Not all good news surround you either.

168
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,500
Daeyoung has a high cash liquidity risk...

and can't even dream about acquiring Hando Steel.

170
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,440
Is that true?

171
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,970
Those racing cars.

172
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,179
They don't have reverse gear.

Once you get behind the wheel, you can't go in reverse.

174
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,049
And that's that.

175
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,049
So,

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,659
you're adamant about challenging us in this field.

My youngest grandson...

179
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,559
who enrolled into SNU's law school at the top of his class said this.

180
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,309
"It's not over..."

181
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,309
"until it's over."

182

What a burly young man he is.

185
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,929
I almost mistook him for your bodyguard. We should sit.

186
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,298
It could be because of the frame or the engine overheating,

187
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,538
but the car is leaking gas.

188
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,639
It seems as though they must retire.

189
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,279
- Retire? - Yes.

190

Withdrawing midway? Are you out of your mind?

197

Aren't you aware of who's watching the race?

198
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,039
But sir, it could lead to...

199
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,309
Keep racing. You'll cross the finish line.

200
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,639
Withdraw from the race, and the team will be dismantled.

201
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,480
You won't receive any financial support, so be it!

Here's a piece of advice you should consider.

206

Even with ample time,

207
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,039
your cars will never be better than ours.

Do you know why?

209
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,909
Because at Daeyoung,

210
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,879
there are five of me.

211
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,719
But no matter how closely I look,

212
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,250
at Soonyang,

213
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,960
there is only one of you.

214
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:58,960
Don't you agree?

215
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,830
That's something to consider.

Please don't worry.

You resolved the matter?

That's right. The reporters won't put the photos in the paper,

223
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,909
and driving error will be reported...

224
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,409
as the cause.

225
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,580
- Is that so? - Yes.

226
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,950

the Athene launching event will be held.

Weren't you scheduled to escort the chairman here?

246
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,769
Well, while outraged, he told me...

247
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,709
to go without him.

248
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,740
So?

249
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,210
You left the old man at the deserted tracks all by himself?

250

Would you rather I fire you?

but the chairman is nowhere to be seen.

258
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,599
Where did he go then when the event is about to begin?

259
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,369
He must be gravely upset...

262

will commence without him.

263

find it odd that he's not present at the event?

Put together a press release.

269
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,209
Write that due to personal reasons...

271
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,750
will only fuel the imagination of the reporters, Uncle.

They might jump to conclusions that the car breaking down...

273
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,380
was due to a defect...

274
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,589
and that...

275
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,920
it sparked a strife between father and son.

his original mindset.

336
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,889
Acquiring Hando Steel...

337
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,690
in the hopes of making Soonyang Motors better.

338
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,519
Do you also believe that it is a waste of money?

339
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:57,930
Run along, then.

340
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,299
I have 2 sons who will soon be over 50.

341
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:04,528
If they can't even manage...

342
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,940
a launching event without me, then...

343
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,599
Well, my life was for nothing.

344
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,000
I do not see it as a luxurious hobby.

345
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,940
I believe Soonyang Motors is the engine.

346
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,250
It provided the power and energy you needed...

347
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,480
to make it this far.

348
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,420
The engine?

349
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,220
The rice mill in Incheon.

350
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,429
Soonyang Motors began...

351
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,029
with you purchasing two trucks to deliver rice.

352
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,160
With you providing mobility,

353
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,200
the rice mill became a grain market,

354
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:12,170
and you were making deliveries with a dozen trucks.

355
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,039
Soonyang Transportation was born...

356
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,009
which led to you showing interest...

357
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,049
in petrol, chemicals, and machinery.

358
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,018
With a delivery system in place,

359
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,949
you were able to expand your business...

360
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,589
to the distribution of consumer goods.

361
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,190
And that is how Soonyang Group was built.

362
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,690
Soonyang Transportation...

363
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,900
was the engine that kept Soonyang Group running.

364
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,259
Until you were forced to forfeit the rights over...

365
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,140
to the military regime after the May 16 coup.

366
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,549
The experience you had back then must be why you're against...

367
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,789
Uncle Chang Je running for office.

368
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,390
Politics should be kept close, but not too close.

369
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,769
Well...

370
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,069
That's why...

371
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,740
I thought you'd come here to see that old delivery truck.

372
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,609
Why?

373
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,650
For memories' sake?

374
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,690
That's what men nearing death do.

375
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,130
You cheeky fool.

376
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,470
Was that your way of beating around the bush...

377
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,940
to say I'm old and dying?

378
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,509
Shoot.

379
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,209
Grandpa, I meant...

380
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,079
I'm late. Shouldn't I give a speech about the new car?

381
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,819
- Pardon? - The engine? I like that.

382
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,819
From now on, if anyone asks,

383
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,059
can I say what you said?

384
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,930
Okay.

385
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Mr. Lee.

386
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm returning with the chairman now.

387
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,579
That's right.

388
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,819
Soonyang is a late starter when it comes to automobiles.

389
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:49,190
A sturdy heavy machinery company does well with automobiles too.

390
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,599
I admit that as well.

391
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,430
But about me, Jin Yang Cheol,

392
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,700
there's one thing those who lecture me...

393
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,940
that I should only do what I'm good at don't know.

394
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,509
Automobiles...

395
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,390
are no longer heavy machinery.

396
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,359
It's electronics.

397
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,890
Electronics and semiconductors are what Soonyang does best!

398
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,299
Soonyang Motors...

399
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,569
is Soonyang's...

400
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,509
engine!

401
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,059
(Athene, Soonyang Motors)

402
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,180
It doesn't look good, Do Jun.

403
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:22,920
Hello.

404
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,489
The big picture your grandfather has for Soonyang Motors...

405
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,359
really needs Hando Steel.

406
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,200
How are we to beat Power Shares that has a sack of dollars?

407
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,469
If we lose Hando Steel to Power Shares,

408
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,200
your grandfather will be furious.

409
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,269
Don't you think?

410
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,710
Wouldn't it be fortunate?

411
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,309
What?

412
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,720
You know, Daeyoung.

413
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,619
I thought they'd given up on Hando because of their poor finances.

414
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,558
You saw it today.

415
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,259
Grandpa with Chairman Ju Yeong Il.

416
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,059
Hando Steel.

417
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:13,039
Wouldn't it be better to lose it to Power Shares than to Daeyoung?

418
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,099
Sir, a report on 4-2's movements.

419
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,569
Something unexpected came up in the afternoon and...

420
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:51,269
I'll call you right back. Bye.

421
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,579
("Will Foreign Investors Take Hando Steel?")

422
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,710
(CEO Jin Dong Ki)

423
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,089
Daeyoung, Korea's largest company...

424
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:39,189
formally expressed its intention to the creditors...

425
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,160
to take over Hando Steel.

426
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,758
There will be a fierce three-way bidding war...

427
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,599
between Soonyang and Power Shares who have already made a bid.

428
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,098
Daeyoung Group offered 600 million dollars,

429
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,670
which is 100 million more than Power Shares' offer.

430
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,969
This makes Daeyoung the likely company to take over...

431
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,410
Are you watching the news?

432
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,980
Yes.

433
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,549
As I thought, Daeyoung joined the bidding war.

434
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,289
Where did Daeyoung suddenly get so much cash?

435
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,118
Didn't you say just a few days ago they had cash flow problems?

436
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,928
They must be betting all they have on taking over Hando.

437
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,089
They got the cash through a consortium.

438
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,159
A consortium?

439
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,529
LNK Consortium. It just entered Korea,

440
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,598
so they can't confirm who is actually funding Daeyoung.

441
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,300
This is Daeyoung we're talking about!

442
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:30,440
If we ever let Daeyoung take Hando Steel...

443
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:48,889
Find out.

444
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,630
Consortium or not, who's funding Daeyoung.

445
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,030
And why they chose...

446
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,599
this timing to invest.

447
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,639
Yes, sir.

448
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,948
Aren't you letting your emotions take a bit too much control?

449
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,649
Won't you regret this later on?

450
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,550
Darling. I told you already.

451
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,489
I'll show Father who I am.

452
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,389
Do you think anything...

453
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,590
can beat buying Hando Steel?

454
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,999
Nothing stood out about the consortium...

455
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,670
that's working with Daeyoung to buy Hando Steel.

456
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,300
But...

457
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,570
Mr. Vice-Chairman.

458
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,879
Soonyang Department Store...

459
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,150
recently liquidated some of its shares and properties.

460
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,179
Soonyang Department Store has such a healthy cash flow,

461
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,519
industry experts found it unusual.

462
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,050
- Soonyang Department Store? - Yes.

463
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,789
Call them.

464
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,760
Say I'd like to meet CEO Jin Hwa Young.

465
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,099
Yes, sir.

466
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,638
Sir. Power Shares contacted Hando's creditors' bank...

467
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,940
and increased their bid to 650 million dollars.

468
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:13,840
Then...

469
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,809
how much must we bid in order to win?

470
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,079
It'll have to be at least 700 million.

471
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:26,719
The maximum amount we can put together is 580 million, sir.

472
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,860
Power Shares increased their bid.

473
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,230
Soonyang's chances look even worse.

474
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,530
We can't lose Hando to Power Shares.

475
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,440
Call this guy.

476
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:47,110
Tell him to report to the chairman.

477
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,519
These photos alone aren't enough...

478
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,889
to say Do Jun is connected to Power Shares' Oh Se Hyeon.

479
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,860
Power Shares?

480
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,530
Where is the company based?

481
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,199
New York, sir.

482
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,170
Where did Do Jun travel with his father recently?

483
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:17,539
New York, sir.

484
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,150
When two coincidences overlap,

485
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,420
is that still a coincidence?

486
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,359
A scholarship?

487
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,929
It's a special scholarship from the law school alumni association.

488
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,190
This year, you're the recipient.

489
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,399
Me? Why?

490
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,329
They say it's from the alumni association,

491
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,069
but it's actually from graduates who work at law firms.

492
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,269
Your father works at Seoul District Prosecutors' Office's Special Unit.

493
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:49,968
Isn't it obvious why?

494
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:52,510
Sign here. This is the receipt.

495
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,510
Hi, Do Jun. Are you done photocopying?

496
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,610
- Yes, I'll return it now. - Okay.

497
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,249
Thanks. Goodbye.

498
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,889
Bye. See you.

499
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,130
Grandpa.

500
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,719
I have four sons who failed to get in,

501
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,089
but I got to see the inside of Korea's best university...

502
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,590
thanks to my grandson.

503
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,429
Do you go on blind dates or things like that to meet girls?

504
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,469
Gosh, no.

505
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,739
I can barely keep up with my lectures.

506
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,510
Okay. Don't fall too hard for anyone.

507
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:00,908
I'm worried...

508
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,980
you'll be like your father and end up being useless.

509
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,920
Are you still angry with my father?

510
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,519
Do Jun.

511
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,860
Do you know how I got to where I am now?

512
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,269
I never forgave those...

513
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,510
who went against me.

514
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,980
Even if that person shares my blood...

515
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,380
and is a sibling...

516
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,650
or an offspring.

517
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,130
By the way, I got a call.

518
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,739
You withdrew all 24 million dollars.

519
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,199
In US dollars.

520
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,840
What did you spend it on?

521
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,710
Tell me.

522
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,489
In New York,

523
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,159
with my father,

524
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,769
I invested in a movie.

525
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,210
I thought I had a smart grandson.

526
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,280
I don't.

527
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,719
Your parents.

528
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,519
They're blessed with a good boy.

529
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,510
Flowers for Suite 3910.

530
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,750
Yes?

531
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,030
What are you doing here, Min Yeong?

532
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,469
These flowers are for you, sir.

533
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,340
Where shall I put them?

534
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,389
I'm glad we met. I have something to say.

535
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,989
I refused the alumni scholarship.

536
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,389
I thought you of all people...

537
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,559
should be told.

538
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,730
I don't have exceptionally good grades,

539
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,429
and I'm not struggling.

540
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,809
Accepting a scholarship just because my dad is in the Special Unit...

541
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,238
is a privilege you think so terribly of.

542
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,138
So what? Are you saying I should admire you for working...

543
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,750
instead of accepting a scholarship?

544
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:26,019
No.

545
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,289
Don't give me another presumptuous advice.

546
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:32,190
While almost everyone else works,

547
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,090
you sit in a crazy expensive suite...

548
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,590
to host Rachael's birthday party.

549
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,960
A rich heir who does that...

550
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,630
has no right.

551
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,639
Young expat.

552
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,969
Do we have to increase the bid?

553
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:55,380
Oh...

554
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,849
I'm working part-time, like you.

555
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,480
- It's from Rachael? - Yes.

556
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,489
A flower basket on her boss' birthday?

557
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,389
What do you think?

558
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,329
It's a lack of imagination.

559
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:18,030
Almost as bad as assuming flowers are a man's gift to a woman.

560
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,179
Who was that?

561
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,590
Happy birthday, sir.

562
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,619
This is a coupon for a free meal at our hotel.

563
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,869
(Restaurant Invitation)

564
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,440
Do you know her?

565
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,110
I have for a long time.

566
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,219
I'm against it. We can't go any higher.

567
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,260
Increasing the bid from here is no longer an investment.

568
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,788
What is it, then?

569
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,488
It's a gamble, a donation, madness.

570
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,698
Whatever you want to call it, it's something I'd never do.

571
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,730
I take full responsibility. It's my money.

572
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,300
This is my career.

573
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:28,468
I can stake my career on it.

574
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,939
The company will flop, and if you invest...

575
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,308
more than 700 million, you'll never get your money back.

576
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,610
What should we do, then? I must buy this company!

577
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,719
If you're going to insist on such a risky investment,

578
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:44,150
why did you fly me over from New York? Why?

579
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,389
Because I can't do this myself.

580
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,058
You needed me to shield you so the market...

581
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:55,800
doesn't figure out you're Jin Yang Cheol's grandson?

582
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,070
Do you know who the most dangerous investors are?

583
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:05,239
People born into money...

584
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,638
who never experienced failure once,

585
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,550
and therefore can never even imagine that they could be wrong.

586
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,380
People like you, young expat.

587
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,050
You're people I can never accept as a partner.

588
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,519
Please leave this room.

589
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,570
Is the owner...

590
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,409
of the chessboard...

591
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,409
Do Jun?

592
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:52,389
Mr. Oh?

593
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,530
Soonyang's Chairman Jin Yang Cheol wishes to see you.

594
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,940
This number includes the loan on the real estate.

595
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,409
Power Shares' Oh Se Hyeon is here.

596
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:14,980
It was an unplanned visit, and the secretaries had no idea.

597
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,779
Could this be a sign the chairman...

598
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,250
will get involved in the Hando Steel bid himself?

599
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,750
I guess he was displeased with our approach.

600
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,000
So...

601
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,769
I will ask you point blank.

602
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,480
The financier who provided the funds for you to invest with.

603
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,420
Is it my grandson Do Jun?

604
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,349
If it were about that,

605
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,150
you could've asked him yourself.

606
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,359
Aren't you the one person who could tell me...

607
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,360
about him most honestly?

608
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,730
Because I'm a friend-turned-enemy?

609
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:11,469
You're scary.

610
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,698
My grandfather always took my side, no matter what.

611
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,800
Mr. Oh.

612
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,610
You're right.

613
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,280
Power Shares Korea is run with Do Jun's money.

614
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,750
However, the company he invested in through Power Shares...

615
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,889
isn't Hando Steel.

616
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,759
It's a small website where you can buy...

617
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,199
and sell books.

618
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,630
I don't even remember what it was called.

619
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,170
Codabra?

620
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:47,869
Books?

621
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:51,339
Yes, he believes that online distribution channels...

622
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,179
will replace all the offline distribution channels one day.

623
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,578
He said Codabra's company value would reach billions of dollars...

624
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,510
when that day came.

625
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,480
He said it would act as...

626
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,420
Right, as the engine of every industry.

627
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,260
It's absurd, isn't it?

628
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:08,820
That's why we decided to go separate ways.

629
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,888
As you know,

630
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,099
boys need their wild dreams and fantasies...

631
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:15,730
to grow into men.

632
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,329
But to investors, it's like poison.

633
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,800
Then...

634
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,369
What about Power Shares' decision to invest...

635
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,780
in Hando Steel?

636
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,009
Even those on Wall Street...

637
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,849
are immensely interested in the Northeast Asian market.

638
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,279
It's one of such approaches...

639
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,780
and something I want to get done with a sense of duty.

640
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:42,090
But then again, I do understand why you can't help but suspect...

641
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,559
your own grandson.

642
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,730
The son interfering with the father's long-cherished ambitions.

643
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,340
The younger son ruining the eldest son's accomplishments.

644
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,010
That's what happens within conglomerate owner families.

645
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,079
Sir.

646
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,320
Speak of the devil.

647
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,219
Go on.

648
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,860
The one interfering with his father's ambitions...

649
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,269
and deliberately ruining things for his eldest brother.

650
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,000
Who is it?

651
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,239
I suppose you didn't know.

652
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:40,820
It's a known fact among most foreign investors.

653
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,820
The one who started the consortium and funded Daeyoung Group.

654
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,389
It's someone in the Soonyang family.

655
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,199
(Daeyoung)

656
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,369
This is why...

657
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:04,110
life is so interesting.

658
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,079
Who knew...

659
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,579
I'd get help from the Soonyang family?

660
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,420
But what if Jin Yang Cheol finds out?

661
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:20,719
Will you be all right?

662
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,829
(Daeyoung)

663
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,260
Soonyang Fire Insurance.

664
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,139
It's CEO Jin Dong Ki.

665
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,988
(Daeyoung)

666
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,130
Let me ask you one thing.

667
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,099
Why did you decide...

668
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,070
to betray your father...

669
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,369
and help Daeyoung?

670
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,039
The eldest son succeeding.

671
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,209
This isn't Joseon Dynasty.

672
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,238
(Daeyoung Group, Jin Dong Ki)

673
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,209
Shouldn't the one with proven management abilities...

674
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,179
succeed the throne?

675
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,250
For the sake of Soonyang, of course.

676
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,500
I will tell Mr. Jin Dong Ki to come here at once, sir.

677
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,670
You should...

678
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,539
stop Dong Ki before it gets too late.

679
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:44,440
Don't bother.

680
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,380
Let Young Ki figure it out.

681
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:00,760
Whether he manages to bring me Hando Steel...

682
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:06,059
or lose everything to his younger brother,

683
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,369
let him figure it out.

684
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,170
But aren't you angry, sir?

685
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,078
What Dong Ki did...

686
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:23,250
He's a businessman, after all.

687
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,489
If a businessman put his parents...

688
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,599
and siblings...

689
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,170
before his profits,

690
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:51,570
he'd never make money.

691
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,360
Hansung Bank said...

692
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,500
that the most they could do was two million dollars.

693
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,139
So? How much more do we need?

694
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,679
To beat Daeyoung and Power Shares,

695
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,010
we must offer at least 700 million dollars.

696
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,780
Seven hundred million?

697
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,349
Let's offer...

698
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,788
seven hundred fifty million dollars.

699
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:41,959
We can't do that, sir.

700
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,928
Six hundred fifty million would be the most we could do now.

701
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:46,598
We've maxed our loans...

702
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,259
There are nonmonetary institutions and loan sharks.

703
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,799
That's too risky.

704
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,198
The chairman would never...

705
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:54,500
I call the shots!

706
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,269
I, Jin Young Ki, make the decisions.

707
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:02,340
Even if I must sell all of my shares, I'll make sure to...

708
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,380
Why would you sell your shares?

709
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,949
For whose sake?

710
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,920
Give us some privacy. My brother and I have some catching up to do.

711
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,280
I'll give you...

712
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,019
fifty million dollars.

713
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:47,320
I'll help you acquire Hando Steel.

714
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,260
And you...

715
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,860
will help Chang Je with his political career.

716
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,630
It's a good deal for both of us.

After the long talks and negotiations, Soonyang Group...

720
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,250
has finally won the bidding war over Hando Steel.

721
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:16,649
This acquisition will synergistically benefit Soonyang...

722
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,190
especially in the heavy equipment and automotive industries.

723
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:20,960
Congratulations, sir.

724
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:24,159
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki did it.

("Soonyang Group Successfully Acquires Hando Steel")

726

Oh, look who's here!

00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,849
The star of the day.

728

Let's go inside. We should celebrate.

- Dong Ki. - Yes?

732
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,669
Thanks.

733
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,969
Come on. Don't mention it.

Thanks to you,

735
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:12,809
I bought Hando Steel...

736
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,409
at a very expensive price.

737
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:21,219
Why? Are you surprised?

738
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,489
That I know?

739
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,820
Young Ki, it's...

740
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,190
You fool.

741
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:30,559
If you're already this surprised, how am I to tell you...

742
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,889
that Father knows too?

743
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,440
The employees are thrilled.

744
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,210
Father, we should consider absorbing all of Hando Steel's employees...

745
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,150
in a positive light.

746
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:53,920
I commend Young Ki...

747
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,219
for thinking this way.

748
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,119
Don't you agree?

749
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:02,659
That's going to cost us.

Give it to your husband.

So Hando Steel...

758
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:22,039
ended up in Jin Young Ki's hands after all.

759
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:29,780
Jin Young Ki is timid and weak.

760
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,449
Who knew he'd make such a bold move to acquire Hando Steel?

761
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,460
Congratulations.

What kind of magic did you use?

765
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:59,510
You taught me what to do.

766
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,309
Me? What? When?

767
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:04,809
How to invest.

768
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,249
Understanding the market...

769
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,079
means that you understand people.

770
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,090
I simply did exactly what you told me to do.

771
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,900
Hello, I'm Ha In Seok from the Secretary's Office.

(Personal driver to CEO Jin Dong Ki)

774
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,610
I knew that Ha In Seok...

775
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,179
was Jin Dong Ki's man.

776
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,679
Jin Dong Ki set up a trap to get me,

777
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,849
and I used it against him.

778

781
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,199
Wouldn't it be better to lose it to Power Shares than to Daeyoung?

782

Those who are blinded by greed...

783
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:01,869
can't differentiate between prey and bait.

784
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,039
As I thought,

785
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,239
Daeyoung joined the bidding war.

786
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,940
Who knew...

787
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:11,980
I'd get help from the Soonyang family?

788
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,320
Oh, and...

789
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:21,659
I'm not sure if it was a coincidence or fate,

790
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,590
but the universe sent me help.

In other words, you used Jin Dong Ki's greed...

807
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,690
to provoke Jin Young Ki's insecurities?

808
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,059
Because understanding people...

809
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,598
is the number one rule in investing.

810
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:40,269
So you didn't lose Hando Steel to Soonyang.

811
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,809
Rather, you made them end up with a debt of 750 million dollars...

812
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:47,110
by upping the value of Hando Steel.

I'm glad...

865
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,840
that you have no interest in running the company.

866
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:02,369
You still haven't given up?

01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,949

872
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:16,920
Isn't that a big deal?

873
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,789
A big deal.
