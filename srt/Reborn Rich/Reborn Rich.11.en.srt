2
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,570
Thanks, Hyeon Min.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,269
I told him...

4
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,469
to pay handsomely for the painting.

5
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,379
Okay.

6
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,489
I heard you wanted to see me.

7
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Yes.

8
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,799
As they say, whoever tied the knot must untie it.

9
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,500
I should undo the knot I tied.

10
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,870
Before it's too late, we should make sure Seong Jun...

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
can return to where he belongs, my niece-in-law.

12
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,750
But Grandfather is still very angry.

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,489
Do you know...

14
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,459
when people become desperate?

15
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,760
When they have no plan B.

16
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,429
But my father happens to have...

17
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,700
two useful grandsons.

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm not quite following.

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,710
Don't worry too much.

20
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,550
Seong Jun has me. And more importantly,

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,449
his powerful in-laws have got his back,

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,419
which my youngest nephew Do Jun doesn't have.

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,099
Father, you should see this.

24
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,399
This is all over the Internet right now.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,530
Everyone is calling Seong Jun...

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,599
"the best third-generation leader for the new millennium."

27
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,369
His easygoing nature...

28
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,668
and how he takes care of his employees and even their families...

29
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,969
are setting a new trend.

30
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,909
Hey.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,150
Father.

32
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,919
It's time Seong Jun...

33
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,319
returned to the head office.

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,829
Public opinion has turned against us because of Do Jun.

35
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,900
It'll look good in the media.

36
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,030
"Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's eldest grandson."

37

"Soonyang's third-generation heir is being trained."

38
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,199
"Look, here's the real deal."

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,979
Father, should we talk to Seong Jun's in-laws?

40
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,179
- Hyeon Min. - Yes.

41
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,280
Forget it.

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,689
Would you believe it if you saw it in Hyunsung Daily?

43
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,429
Everyone knows that your son...

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,430
is married to the daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

45
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,330
Father.

46
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,800
Then what do you plan to do with Seong Jun?

You now have Grandfather's permission...

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,399
to transfer to the head office in Gwanghwamun.

52
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,539
As for your new position, he'd like to discuss with you first.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,600
So think about what you'd want.

54
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,110
Make sure you tie up all the loose ends.

This was you, right?

57
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
So? You came here to gloat?

58
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,459
At this late hour?

59
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,828
Now that my exile has come to an end thanks to you...

60
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:55,430
and your family,

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,040
do you want me to bow to you on my knees?

62
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,269
Sure, do it.

63
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,149
I bet the girls you used to fool around with have no idea...

64
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,980
how annoying it is...

65
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,449
and how much it costs...

66
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,819
to be your wife.

67
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,519
Is it fun to live like this?

68
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,360
This keeps getting more interesting.

69
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm here to warn you.

70
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:30,399
I worked hard to create this opportunity for you. Don't blow it.

71
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,709
Get it together, will you?

(Soonyang Corporation)

73
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,810
There's nothing. I couldn't find anything.

74
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,649
What?

75
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:50,980
Hold on.

76
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,819
One moment.

77
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,229
As for New Data Technology's stock,

78
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,289
it's true that Miracle bought in low and sold high.

79
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,529
It's also true Miracle bought a large number of shares.

80
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,899
But to prove that they rigged the market...

81
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,499
Yes, we'd need evidence that they influenced...

82
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,709
the stock adjustment somehow.

83
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,870
But there is none.

84
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,179
No borrowed-name accounts, which are used for stock manipulation.

85
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,779
And no cross trades.

86
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,979
Most importantly, when Miracle bought a large amount of the stock,

87
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,319
the stock price didn't even go up.

88
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,220
So there is no evidence that Miracle manipulated the stock price...

89
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,490
Sorry.

90
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,800
Of course, you already know. I rambled too long, didn't I?

91
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,898
You've been cleared of all charges.

92
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,269
I wanted to tell you as soon as I could,

93
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,339
so I rushed here.

94
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,810
Have you eaten?

95
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,850
Did you have dinner?

96
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,199
This was the last day...

97
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,310
of you investigating me as a prosecutor.

98
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,139
It won't happen again.

99
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,810
I promise.

100
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,409
Thank you.

101
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,139
Let's go.

102
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,250
A financial holding company?

103
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,219
On the outside, it'd look like a financial company.

104
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,190
But it'll be like the control tower of Soonyang's succession plans.

105
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,220
Then...

106
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,929
who will run that company?

107
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Do Jun, how about you run it?

108
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,740
Pardon?

109
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,980
Why? You don't want to?

110
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,850
Once we arrive at the rice mill in Incheon,

111
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,350
we'll hold a press conference first.

112
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,460
A board meeting has been scheduled for next week as well.

113
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,559
Formally introduce yourself and get to work.

114
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,730
Get a certificate of incorporation for the company too.

115
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,070
As for the shareholders' meeting...

116
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,240
You can take care of the prep for that too, right?

117
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:08,950
Are you sure...

118
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
you want to let me run the company?

119
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,389
I can see the burning greed for money in your eyes.

120
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,320
You're so greedy for money that you don't fear me,

121
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,399
and you're ruthless even with your family and relatives.

122
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,730
You're cantankerous...

123
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,539
just like me.

124
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,840
Soonyang Financial Group.

125
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,809
I'm going to...

126
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,080
give it to you.

127
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,009
Now, I know...

128
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,250
the reason why...

129
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,279
I remember nothing about 4-2, Jin Do Jun.

130

(Jin Do Jun, 4-2, Deceased)

131
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,059
It's because I died.

132
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,029
And...

133
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,669
things that are bound to happen...

134
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,669
always happen, without fail.

is reporting live from the scene.

143
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
So the police have confirmed the identities of the passengers?

144
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,070
Earlier today, on a road on the outskirts of Incheon,

145
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,268
a multi-vehicle collision occurred, and one of the vehicles belongs...

146
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,610
to Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, who was headed to Soonyang Museum.

147
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,378
A, the driver of the freight truck...

148
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,649
who was driving on the other side of the road, died on the spot.

149
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,949
Chairman Jin and his grandson, Jin Do Jun,

150
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,048
who was also in the car at the time of the accident,

151
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,950
have been transported to a hospital nearby.

152
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,619
The police suspect that the accident occurred...

153
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,089
because A was driving under the influence of alcohol.

154
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,259
They will launch an investigation to find out...

155
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,600
He'll be okay, right?

156
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,730
His grandfather owns Soonyang Group.

157
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,970
He'll be treated by the best doctors in the country.

158
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,240

You should brace yourself for the worst, Mother.

166
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,269
It was a big accident.

167
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,379
Let me in, Director Jung.

I must see my husband.

169
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm sorry, ma'am.

170
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,960
Mr. Chairman needs absolute rest at the moment.

171
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,189
For the time being,

172
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,460
no visitors are allowed, including all family members.

173
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,129
How is he?

174
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,669
How badly is he hurt that we can't even see him?

175
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,570
Must he undergo emergency surgery or something?

176
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,370
At the moment, Mr. Chairman is...

177
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
in a coma.

178
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,149
Are you saying he may never wake up? My father?

179
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,889
Then should we prepare for the worst, Director Jung?

180
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,129
What's with you, Young Ki?

181
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,559
As if you were waiting for this to happen.

182
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,398
If they can't treat him here, we should take him to the US.

183
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,599
That's what we must do, as his children!

184
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,840
This also means that the chairman of Soonyang is in a coma.

185
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,179
When the stock market opens on Monday, our stocks will plummet.

186
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,649
And in an emergency situation like this,

187
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,350
I should make decisions on his behalf as his eldest son.

188
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,720
Now, tell us, Director Jung.

189
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,929
Will he wake up?

190
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,629
At the moment,

191
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,100
all I can tell you is that my team and I will do our very best.

192
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,168
Do Jun... Where is Do Jun?

193
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,580
We received a call from the Secretary's Office.

194
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,639
What was Do Jun doing there at that hour?

195
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,609
- We heard... - What happened, Young Ki?

196
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,779
We heard Do Jun was in the car with Father.

197
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,649
Do Jun is okay, right?

198
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,820
Say something!

199
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,419
Oh, dear.

200
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,049
The surgery went well.

201
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
I see.

202
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,519
Thank you. Thank you so much, Doctor.

203
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,229
As for the neurosurgical concerns I had,

204
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,158
the injury on the back of the head is only external.

205
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,158
Thankfully, there is no intracranial hemorrhage.

206
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,169
So all in all, the surgery went well.

207
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,529
I see.

208
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,070
Will he experience...

209
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,840
any post-surgical complications?

210
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,710
At the moment, I don't think you should be too worried.

211
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,139
But let's wait and see.

212
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,349
If there's anything you need while treating or helping him recover,

213
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,878
don't hesitate to let me know.

214
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,379
We'll give you all the support you need.

215
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,320
He must have a key position in the company.

216
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm just hugely indebted to him.

217
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,870
Oh, they're moving him to the recovery room now.

218
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,119
Grandfather.

219
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,250
Grandfather.

220
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,890
Grandfather. Please...

221
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,358
Grandfather.

222
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,569
- Grandfather. - Sir, are you all right?

223
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,229
Call an ambulance.

224
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,269
- Yes. - Grandfather.

225
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,400
Hurry up!

226
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,269
- Sir. - Grandfather!

227
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,140
Grandfather.

228
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,279
Grandfather.

229
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,828
Mr. Ha was bringing a suit for the press conference...

230
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,740
as per Mr. Lee Hang Jae's order.

231
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,710
This was found in one of the pockets of the truck driver...

232
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,339
who is now dead. You should take a look.

233
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,109
I thought you should know...

234
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,950
before the police launched their investigation.

235
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,849
This wasn't an accident.

236
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:15,690
Mr. Chairman's car was targeted.

237
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,799
(Seoul 27, G 3395)

238
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,069
(Seoul 27, G 3395)

239
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,380
Someone must be behind this.

240
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,079
Find out who ordered this and bring them to me.

241
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,859
I know...

242
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,130
that everything that happened in my previous life...

243
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,839
will happen in this life too.

244
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,809
In my previous life,

245
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,539
I died at your hands, as Yoon Hyeon Woo.

246
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,680
In this life,

247
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,349
I was born again as Jin Do Jun.

248
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,990
And I refuse to die at your hands once again.

249
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,700
I must live.

250
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,970
I will survive no matter what...

251
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,039
and find the answer.

252
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,180
I'm here, Grandfather.

253
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,950
Hey, Do Jun.

254
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,019
The secret...

255
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,329
behind my second life.

256
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
Considering the impact it'd have on the stock market,

257
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,568
I suggest we keep...

258
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,109
Mr. Chairman's condition confidential for the time being.

259
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,940
Then what about the press release?

260
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,108
We'll write that he's staying at Soonyang Medical Center...

261
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,680
to recover as per his doctors' advice.

262
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,819
What are some of the things...

263
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,920
on Father's schedule that I should take care of urgently?

264
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,588
Mr. Chairman was supposed to announce the establishment...

265
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,490
of our financial holding company at a press conference today.

266
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,729
And he would've gotten the board members to agree on it...

267
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,029
at the board meeting next week.

268
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,099
Let's postpone the board meeting.

269
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,970
Establishing the financial holding company...

270
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,838
Let's put it on hold for now.

271
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,869
Yes, I agree.

272
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,008
It can be done once Father wakes up.

273
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,439
It's nothing urgent.

274
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,608
You all know that...

275
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,608
Mr. Chairman firmly believes the financial industry is...

276
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,049
- where Soonyang's future lies... - He's just trying to trick us.

277
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,149
Who here doesn't know that?

278
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,289
Watch your mouth.

279
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,719
- Father isn't well. - My point, exactly.

280
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,159
Father is bedridden now. Nothing good will come out...

281
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,430
of people talking about it.

282
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,960
Chang Je, I heard the politicians aren't keen on it either.

283
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,699
They say it violates the separation of industrial and financial capital.

284
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,869
Yes, that's right.

285
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,969
That's why Father said...

286
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,239
he wanted to support...

287
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,739
a presidential candidate who'd ease the rules.

288
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,009
Then it would be resolved right away, I suppose.

289
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,379
He asked you one question. Why ramble on...

290
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,980
and spoil the mood?

291
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,809
All right.

292
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,420
My point is...

293
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,318
Whether we want to push Cheongwadae...

294
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,789
or influence the National Assembly,

295
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,690
we can't do it without Father.

296
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,059
Am I wrong, Young Ki?

297
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,258
- Mr. Lee. - Yes, sir.

298
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,329
As for the board meeting,

299
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,930
we'll proceed as planned.

300
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,970
- Young Ki. - We cannot...

301
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,000
leave Father's position vacant.

302
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,569
I'll fill in for him.

303
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
My gosh.

304
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,288
Young Ki, Father has blindsided you so many times.

305
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:09,289
Do you still not get the picture? Are you dumb?

306
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,459
He wants Do Jun to run the financial holding company.

307
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,099
Do you not understand what that means?

308
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,269
I bet you have no idea.

309
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,239
He'll sponsor the candidate...

310
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,508
who'd ease the regulations on the separation...

311
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,409
so that the head of the financial holding company...

312
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,909
could go on to rule Soonyang Group. In other words, he has chosen...

313
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,579
that fool Yoon Ki's son, Do Jun, as his successor.

314
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,749
You're so afraid of Father that you have nothing to your name.

315
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,318
Now, you'll take what rightfully belongs to your son...

316
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,819
and put it in Do Jun's mouth?

317
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,459
Aren't you too embarrassed to even face Seong Jun?

318
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,588
That's enough, Uncle Dong Ki.

319
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,690
You too! Get it together!

320
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,028
Or you'll end up becoming a puppet like your father.

321
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,099
What did you say?

322
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,499
You little...

323
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,269
Enough, both of you!

324
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,039
Your father was right about you guys.

325
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,980
I know I birthed you guys,

326
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,509
but what is wrong with all of you?

327
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,979
Knowing that your father is on the verge of dying,

328
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,749
how dare you worry about what you might lose...

329
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,089
or gain first?

330
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,589
Mom.

331
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,160
I can't believe I have to see this.

332
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,058
Calm down, Mother. You might faint at this rate.

333
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,099
Forget it.

334
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,730
Get out, all of you!

335
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,768
I'm afraid your father would never wake up...

336
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:26,470
because he doesn't want to see the fools that you are!

337
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,509
Don't say that, Mom!

338
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,180
Mom, go home and get some rest.

339
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,779
We can't even see him anyway!

340
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,048
Let's go home, Mother.

341
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,420
I'm sure...

342
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,319
Yoon Ki and Hae In will stay here anyway.

343
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:46,059
You look so weary, Mother.

344
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:50,490
We'll take you home. Let's go to Jeongsimjae, okay?

345
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,829
Forget it.

346
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,500
All my life, I've always stayed right by his side.

347
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,000
He'll look for me the moment he wakes up.

348
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,509
Heed my advice. Do not raise your voices in front of me again.

349
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,990
Mother must still care for him very much, even at her age.

350
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,189
Let's be honest. Without my mom's support,

351
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,230
he wouldn't have been able to grow Soonyang to what it is today.

352
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,099
No way.

353
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,299
You should be good to me too.

354
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,199
Don't you remember what Mr. Baek said?

355
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,470
You're blessed with rich parents and a wise wife.

356
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,868
Mr. Baek is never wrong, you know.

357
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,768
What do you think will happen with my father?

358
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,910
Will he wake up?

359
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,539
Yes, I believe so.

360
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,609
What?

361
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,950
- He'll wake up? - Yes.

362
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,848
According to his reading, he's extremely strong.

363
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,788
He'll never succumb to accident injuries or illnesses.

364
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,018
And he certainly...

365
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,920
won't pass away this year.

366
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,990
Darn it, why...

367
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,400
Why are you telling me this now?

368
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Because you asked me just now, sir.

369
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,869
Don't step in, honey.

370
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,098
Let them start the financial holding company or whatever.

371
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,839
Just stay out of it.

372
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,439
If Father wakes up,

373
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,809
he'll be very angry.

374
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,409
It's so easy for you to say.

375
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,838
You have no idea how I feel right now.

376
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,179
Mr. Baek, whom you trust so much, told me...

377
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,549
that once Do Jun survived a life-threatening incident,

378
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,450
he'd become unbeatable...

379
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,219
What was it?

380
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,990
- Astronomical wealth... - Yes!

381
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,659
- What? - Money will fall into his lap.

382
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,690
That's right! Do I really have to...

383
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,200
let that lucky brat eat up the financial holding company too?

384
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,500
Darn it.

385
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
Let me see.

386
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,710
You have to attend the executive meeting in the morning.

387
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,430
Just finish this and go to bed early, Father.

388
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,599
Don't worry, Seong Jun.

389
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,869
Your uncle is right.

390
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:54,079
I will cancel the board meeting.

391
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,079
I will go ahead and cancel the plan...

392
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,690
to establish the financial holding company.

393
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,690
Father.

394
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,130
I should have...

395
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,160
protected you.

396
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm too embarrassed to even face you.

397
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,079
But earlier, I agreed with what you said.

398
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,019
Follow Grandpa's wishes regarding the financial holding company.

399
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,990
They might end up being his last wishes.

400
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,529
You are...

401
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,460
his only rightful successor, Father.

402
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,348
Sir, as per your instructions,

403
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,548
the police have concluded that the truck driver was drunk...

404
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,349
and experienced brake issues, which caused the accident.

405
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,559
They will go ahead and close the case.

406
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,390
The police suspect the sedan that took off was a stolen vehicle.

407
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,029
They're watching the CCTV footage to track it,

408
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,599
but Mr. Woo thinks...

409
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,609
since it was a highly elaborated accident,

410
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,410
- the car is probably scrapped... - Stop.

411
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,680
You can stop there.

412
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,259
We should tell Grandmother. She must be devastated.

413
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,759
She's a speaker.

414
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,929
Once she finds out,

415
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,199
even Tom and Mary in New York will find out.

416
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,930
Are you trying to mess it up?

417
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,009
Warn Mr. Woo,

418
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,508
so it won't leak.

419
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,539
Yes, sir. You don't need to worry.

420
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,779
It won't only humiliate the family...

421
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,410
but put an end to Soonyang.

422
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,490
How are we going to ask our clients and shareholders to trust us?

423
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:18,819
Do you really think...

424
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,589
one of the three children planned this?

425
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,500
The situation is evident.

426
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,900
Mr. Yang never caused even a minor accident since he worked for me.

427
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,329
It wasn't even his first trip.

428
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,470
Why on the way to the press conference of all times?

429
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:40,239
I can never give up on the financial holding company,

430
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,950
and they'll never hand it over to Do Jun.

431
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,519
I'm going to the board meeting...

432
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,189
and say the one who stops the establishment...

433
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,319
of the holding company is the culprit of this accident.

434
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,890
That's what I think.

435
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:58,930
I'm going to the board meeting no matter what to his face.

436
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,629
When they see their father is fine,

437
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,000
they will flip out.

438
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,240
You'll be laughing in your sleep.

439
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,440
This is a rare sight.

440
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,180
Because it's me. Only Jin Yang Cheol can do this.

441
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,690
He must be tired.

442
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,920
Yes.

443
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,890
I will come back tomorrow.

444
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,759
Rest well, sir.

445
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,140
Goodnight, Mr. Lee.

446
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,819
Director Jung told me you weren't well.

447
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,960
Is that why you're rushing...

448
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,440
to establish the holding company...

449
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,900
and leaving the Soonyang chairman position to me?

450
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,049
As soon as you get up tomorrow,

451
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,049
make a call.

452
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,089
To the press team in the PR Department.

453
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,950
Okay?

454
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,690
Look at this.

455
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,829
The car is smashed into pieces.

456
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,670
But no one is dead.

457
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,500
That is Soonyang's car.

458
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,569
Soonyang Motors.

459
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,549
You know?

460
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,750
My gosh.

461
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:05,589
I can't believe it was possible.

462
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,720
It was possible.

463
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,299
Gosh.

464
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,099
Okay, Grandfather.

465
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,200
I'll call the press team to prepare the press release.

466
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,940
Soonyang Motors' highest priority was safety.

467
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,140
Behind it...

468
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,609
was Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's struggle...

469
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,420
who never gave up...

470
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:38,250
despite inferiority in the market in the past ten years.

471
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,769
You should go to sleep.

472
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:03,880
Do Jun.

473
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:10,219
Promise me...

474
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,289
that you'll be careful.

475
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,000
Don't trust anyone.

476
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Okay.

477
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,710
All right.

478
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,619
Okay.

479
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,789
You should get going.

480
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,659
(Soonyang Medical Center)

481
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,840
Do Jun.

482
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,110
Yes, Grandfather?

483
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,510
Do you...

484
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,219
still...

485
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,059
want to buy Soonyang?

486
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,940
Are you okay? Are you hurt a lot?

487
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,940
Let me see.

488
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,888
You should've told me if you were okay.

489
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,690
I couldn't reach you all day. I was worried about you.

490
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,369
It wasn't just an accident.

491
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:38,940
Was it?

492
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,699
Having trouble sleeping?

493
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,599
Normally, you'd be in bed by now.

494
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,739
I guess you're worried about Do Jun.

495
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,179
The oldest daughter-in-law of Soonyang is different.

496
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,420
You're too worried about your brother-in-law to sleep.

497
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:31,989
Haven't you heard the doctor saying Do Jun was okay?

498
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,389
That's why...

499
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,090
I'm more worried.

500
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,469
After the accident today, I thought Soonyang would be yours.

501
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,909
Didn't you?

502
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,909
I thought you couldn't sleep...

503
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,980
for that reason.

504
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,900
Only a minor scratch on all passengers.

505
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,969
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol in a coma due to a car accident.

506
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,610
Is it a scratch or coma?

507
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,179
What am I supposed to buy?

508
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,078
Only ten minutes left until the market opens.

509
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,780
Will you keep a secret?

510
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,750
What are you doing here? I thought you were in the hospital.

511
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:41,119
I thought it was a big accident. Wait.

512
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
What?

513
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,629
Are you really okay?

514
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,230
Oh, my dear Mr. Oh.

515
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,739
Geez.

516
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,039
Then I'm buying 10,000 shares of Soonyang Motors today.

517
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,880
Seriously. I'm disappointed.

518
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,349
Don't forget that you promised me to keep your secret.

519
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,419
The fact that they instigated the murder of their father...

520
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,320
covered up as a car accident?

521
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,388
Or how the father...

522
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,159
took the bait in an attempt to catch his kid?

523
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,960
A secret or whatever, this is a crime.

524
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,828
A secret or a crime,

525
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:23,469
it'll all come to light on the day of the board meeting.

526
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,570
Until then, I'll be at the hospital by Chairman Jin's side.

527
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,039
So what am I to do?

528
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,739
Soonyang Investment will call this meeting.

529
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,650
The item is the planning of making a holding company.

530
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,710
Please take up everything...

531
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:40,980
related to Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

532
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,319
Is that why you put me here as the CEO...

533
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,219
as soon as we took over Soonyang Investment?

534
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,090
Well, in the end, yes.

535
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,260
Becoming the owner of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

536
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,929
Just as you wanted, young expat.

537
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,599
You'll soon have Soonyang Group in your hands.

538
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,739
Are you sure about Father?

539
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:08,809
You don't have to ask again.

540
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,349
I heard it this morning from the police commissioner himself.

541
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,379
The paramedic who was on the scene said...

542
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,678
he didn't suffer...

543
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,190
from any injuries like broken bones after that huge accident.

544
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,360
Director Jung said he was in a coma.

545
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,159
Even if what you said is true, why would he dare to lie...

546
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,929
against our family?

547
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,900
(Soonyang Medical Center is a world-renowned medical center.)

548
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,670
Father is...

549
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,500
testing us right now.

550
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:34,840
Testing us?

551
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,238
Everything came into the light with the financial holding company.

552
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,339
The succession war has begun.

553
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,409
So?

554
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,138
While he has fallen asleep,

555
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,779
and while nobody else can visit him here,

556
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,379
he wants to see which one of you shows your devotion...

557
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,218
by coming in and visiting him every single day.

558
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,320
It's a sort of loyalty test.

559
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,920
- A loyalty test? - Yes.

560
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,929
- My father? - Yes.

561
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,329
Stop talking nonsense.

562
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,968
Haven't you read "King Lear?" By Shakespeare?

563
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,928
Why do you think these are called the classics?

564
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,839
I'm seeing through the essence of human nature now.

565
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,440
You're so frustrating. Goodness.

566
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:13,339
I need to see my father just once.

567
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,439
I'm not trying to cross over to North Korea...

568
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,780
or visit the Moon.

569
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,749
I just need to visit...

570
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,919
the ICU of this hospital once.

571
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,650
- Dong Ki. - What?

572
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,159
I heard...

573
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,329
an odd rumor today, Director Jung.

574
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,868
That Chairman Jin's body...

575
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,070
did not have any external injury from the accident.

576
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,670
Can he still fall into a coma despite the lack of injury?

577
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,110
Director Jung.

578
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,309
Did you lie to all of us about Father's coma?

579
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,380
Man.

580
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,380
I finally get it.

581
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,219
He's in a coma...

582
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,519
due to his chronic illness, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, right?

583
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,659
Vice-Chairman Jin.

584
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,530
Wait, what do you mean?

585
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,429
His chronic illness?

586
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,030
Wait.

587
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,598
Why is Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki...

588
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,739
the only one who knew about this, Director Jung?

589
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,078
Chairman Jin made a special request that I do not inform anyone else...

590
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,509
about this illness.

591
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,809
Yet you went against his special request...

592
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,420
and told Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki about it.

593
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,860
If my father finds out about this much later,

594
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,729
he will feel utterly betrayed.

595
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,260
I thought it would help with Chairman Jin's health care...

596
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,868
if at least one of his children knew about his condition.

597
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,130
I'll keep the secret.

598
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,099
However,

599
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,670
let me...

600
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,039
see my father.

601
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,110
Now. Immediately.

602
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,880
Let's do that.

603
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,730
Chairman Jin's family...

604
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
will make a visit to the ICU.

605
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,110
It's just this once.

606
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,409
Let's go now.

607
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:30,980
Let's go.

608
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,519
(Emergency Intensive Care Unit)

609
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,760
Why did you keep Father's illness to yourself?

610
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,459
What were you thinking?

611
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,859
I made a good pass for you to finally score.

612
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,030
What's important is that we're here.

613
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,559
- What is this? - I thought visits were prohibited.

614
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,629
Was that wrong information?

615
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,698
Good grief.

616
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:54,899
Your family insisted on seeing Chairman Jin.

617
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,768
As a doctor, do you think...

618
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:59,679
Father is in a state to receive visitors?

619
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,138
No.

620
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,150
There's a danger of infection if he sees outside visitors.

621
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,749
On top of that, he absolutely must rest now.

622
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,090
Hey, are you the doctor here?

623
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,089
Don't step out of the line and get into this.

624
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,590
I'm speaking...

625
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,429
as the chairman of Soonyang Medical Center.

626
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,099
If you go against your conviction as a doctor...

627
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,769
and allow them to make a visit to the ICU,

628
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,939
then I will dismiss you immediately as the chairman.

629
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,539
- You! - If you...

630
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,139
make another scene at the hospital in regards to Father,

631
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,210
be ready for consequences.

632
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,250
You will...

633
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,849
never get to set another foot inside Soonyang Medical Center.

634
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,090
We managed to get over this thanks to Director Jung's call.

635
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,460
This family is unpredictable,

636
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,130
so who knows when they'll barge in again?

637
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:56,469
Thank you, Father.

638
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,840
Please keep this a secret until the day of the board meeting.

639
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,039
I cannot believe this.

640
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:04,940
Our family is...

641
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,510
quite ambitious, and there are many aspects...

642
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,579
that are tough for me to understand.

643
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,079
However, I never thought...

644
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,519
they were capable of doing something so atrocious...

645
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,559
against your grandfather. If I had, I...

646
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,300
It wasn't a car accident?

647
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,300
You knew that,

648
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,139
yet you agreed to close the police investigation?

649
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,269
Well, there's a backstory.

650
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,109
You said you'll make sure your family doesn't touch Do Jun.

651
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,010
Yet this is what it came down to?

652
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,579
I will...

653
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
report to the police.

654
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,050
Father...

655
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,090
I was the one who insisted on stopping the investigation, Mother.

656
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,559
Do Jun, it was you?

657
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,400
Why?

658
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,570
Because I wanted to live.

659
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,409
If the culprit is one of us in the family,

660
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,110
they'll be able to evade the police investigation.

661
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:20,480
No matter who it is,

662
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,519
that person will have the money and power of Soonyang too.

663
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,719
The police investigation was stopped,

664
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,559
but General Manager Woo Byeong Jun has been looking.

665
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,229
It won't take a long time to find those...

666
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,030
who planned or abetted this accident.

667
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,340
So please let Grandfather have his way, Mother.

668
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,440
Your grandfather is the scariest of them all,

669
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,380
and he's not trustworthy.

670
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,650
I know. But...

671
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,289
he needs me the most at this point, Mother.

672
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,050
You know that Grandfather...

673
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,130
uses any means and ways to get what he wants.

674
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,300
He'll do his best...

675
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,630
to keep me safe.

676
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:20,110
Just as Do Jun says, let's give him our trust this time.

677
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,949
I should at least request more bodyguards.

678
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,690
You should go, Father.

679
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,849
Hyeong Jun.

680
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,820
Mom and Dad are gone. You should go.

681
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,960
I'm here as your caregiver.

682
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,489
Don't mind me.

683
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,230
I'm fine. I'm not hurt in any way.

684
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,059
I'm not fine.

685
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,329
I'm in pain.

686
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,269
What?

687
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:23,670
You really can't take a hint.

688
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,480
And you really don't care about your brother.

689
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,179
My album fell through.

690
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,179
Why?

691
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,420
Did something happen?

692
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:37,550
As you can see from looking at my face,

693
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,989
I'm a singer with good looks.

694
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,289
But another singer made his debut with the same image.

695
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,590
He preoccupied my market.

696
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,059
Because of him,

697
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,599
I've totally become a bust.

698
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,099
Gosh. Look at that.

699
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:59,269
That was a charming performance.

700
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,849
- Jin Do Jun. - Yes?

701
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,320
Come here.

702
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,090
- Why? - Because your brother said so.

703
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,159
Yes, sir.

704
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,570
Do Jun, I'll continue to do music.

705
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,000
So I'll make a fortune too.

706
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,340
Okay.

707
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,769
You can have...

708
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,210
all of my money.

709
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,079
What?

710
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,320
Later, much later,

711
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,690
when Mom and Dad leave us their inheritance,

712
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:48,460
you can have everything too.

713
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,530
Let's not live in torment over some money.

714
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,900
You can have...

715
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,300
all of my money.

716
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:07,309
Hyeong Jun.

717
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,579
So...

718
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,119
you have to give me your money too.

719
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,499
- Let go. - I can't.

720
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,460
- Let go of my hand. - I can't let go of your hand.

721
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,500
Just take this orange.

722
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:33,670
I thought you were cool for once.

(Amount Unpaid: 151.932 dollars)

726
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,968
I looked up the bank statement...

727
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:13,139
of the truck driver for the past year.

728
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,179
It's just as we expected.

729
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,980
He didn't receive a huge amount through his bank...

730
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,980
or anything else in particular.

731
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,820
Even if the instigator paid him, I'm sure it was in cash.

732
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,119
What about the call history?

733
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,260
The last number he talked to on the day of the accident...

734
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,859
sharply rose in the frequency and amount of calls it made...

735
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,929
in the past month, so I looked that up too.

736
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,530
It was a burner phone.

737
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,110
I also found out that the truck driver was an ex-convict.

738
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,840
He was charged for gambling.

I've only seen him around here.

746
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,809
You shouldn't ask me.

747
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,239
Oh, there he is.

748
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,949
He was close to that customer.

Yes, thank you.

already pretending like he's an abdicated king...

who put his son on the throne.

753

You should've seen him, Young Ki.

754
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,469
Then you'll probably put a halt on the board meeting...

755
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,670
and the financial holding company.

756
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,380
He can't even hold to what he has.

757
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,039
He doesn't have enough power.

758
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,789
Well...

759
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,929
Do you still feel sour about it?

760
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,360
I'm very disappointed too.

761
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,629
I didn't bring that up just to benefit myself.

762
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,769
What?

763
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,400
I mean...

764
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,038
No one else in the world may know,

765
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,268
but the three of us, the three siblings know...

766
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,579
how cruel our father is.

767
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,149
He always graded us over our entire life,

768
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,679
evaluating us every single day.

769
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,348
And he now wants to abandon us...

770
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:38,489
and go with Do Jun?

771
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:41,859
Why should we put in hard work...

772
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,559
to give a feast to a stray dog like him?

773
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,730
You must call off the board meeting first.

774
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,000
It's a great chance. We can use Father's illness as an excuse.

775
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,400
In just three months,

776
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,639
he'll stop talking about the financial holding company.

777
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,710
What if Father wakes up?

778
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,750
Do you think he'll forgive the three of us for the coup?

779
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,889
We'll hold the board meeting as planned.

780
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,860
And we'll put mercenaries...

781

in the front of our coup.

782
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,059
Mercenaries?

783
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,869
They're holding the board meeting as planned.

784
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,269
- Really? - Yes.

785
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,939
They'll hold the meeting,

786
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,509
but they will tamper with the votes of the directors...

787
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,909
to abort the attempt of building the financial holding company.

788
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,679
They must feel burdened to come off as your opposition...

789
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,519
on the outside.

790
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,019
They aren't completely dull.

791
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,219
It won't be easy to humor the directors for the next few days.

792
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,730
But bad news.

793
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,859
Once I show up...

794
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,630
at the board meeting, their votes are all mine.

795
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,768
Once the holding company's plan passes the board meeting,

796
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:03,469
we'll then vote to place Do Jun as a CEO candidate.

797
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,539
This time, I'm going to cast my vote on you.

798
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,210
Don't worry.

799
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:15,749
We always place an impossible candidate...

800
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,618
for the sake of the board meeting.

801
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:20,658
That way, it won't be confusing for the shareholders...

802
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:22,589
as the management cast an overwhelming amount of votes...

803
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,530
for a candidate they want. Is that right?

804
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,070
So that's all settled. Be prepared for the board meeting.

805
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,899
- Yes. - We should...

806
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,738
buy him a new suit to make him look sharp.

807
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:37,739
Yes, sir.

808
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,179
I'm fine, Grandfather. Maybe next time.

809
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,409
Next time? When?

810
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,880
You can try to live until you're 100.

811
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,420
But that "next time" never comes.

812
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,189
Why isn't Mr. Woo coming back with any news?

813
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,059
I'll contact him.

814
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,500
Please have this as we talk.

815
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,199
Sure.

816
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,199
It looked like he was in debt.

817
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,909
Did he tell anyone that he was in need of money?

818
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,139
I need money too.

819
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,039
Is there anyone who doesn't need money?

820
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,679
It's a rule for gamblers to never deal with money.

821
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,549
Let me ask you too.

822
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,889
The police put an end to this investigation already.

823
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,759
Why is Soonyang snooping around?

824
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,260
This accident concerns an employee of Soonyang.

825
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,929
I need to put together a report for those high ups.

826
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,159
It must be tough for you.

827
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:38,070
And it must've been even harder without any CCTV on the site.

828
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,070
If you don't have more questions, may I go now?

829
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:46,570
- Thank you for cooperating. - Sure.

831
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,129
Hey, move quickly.

832
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,359
We're closing the office as of today.

833
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,800
You're all on a break until you get further notice. Move!

834
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,009
Who are you?

835
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,280
Who are you people?

836
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,449
The accident on the outer road of Incheon.

837
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,690
Did you plan and abet the accident in this office?

838
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,759
What is this nonsense...

839
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,760
You knew there were no CCTVs on the site of the accident.

840
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,659
An ordinary intersection in Korea...

841
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,269
would have a CCTV in that region,

842
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,269
but a civil servant made a mistake and left it out as an exception.

843
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,869
If you're aware of that, you're either with the police...

844
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,010
or the person who planned the accident.

845
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,880
Who's behind you?

846
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:06,349
How did he meet with the instigator of the accident?

847
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,658
He was given instructions and paid...

848
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,300
by using coin lockers.

849
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,649
There are no traces of transactions for antique artworks.

850
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,480
It's impossible to track the origin of the fund.

851
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,480
Whoever this is...

852
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,519
has a knack for hiding...

853
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,260
the source of the fund.

854
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:00,909
I never imagined I would face a day...

855
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,780
to have you at my gallery, Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

856
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,820
This is interesting.

857
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:13,960
Nobody used to pay any attention to folk paintings like these,

858
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,219
but they rose to value like this...

859
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,789
thanks to you, CEO Mo, a savvy investor.

860
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:32,070
I hear you're highly interested in paintings with flowers and birds.

861
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,449
This is one of your collections, right?

862
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,980
A painting of flowers and birds is made...

863
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,320
hoping that the flowers and birds will bring the family...

864
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:48,489
longevity, blessings, and love.

865
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,260
I especially loved the bold colors...

866
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,630
and lively theme for this painting,

867
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,659
so this is my most cherished possession.

868
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,239
If this is the gallery's collection, it must be in the storage.

869
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,440
What is it?

870
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,510
I came upon a situation that this painting...

871
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,780
could have been used for an illegal transaction.

872
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:14,050
An illegal transaction?

873
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,820
I received a report that murder instigators...

874
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:20,789
who put on a front as a car accident paid the price with this painting.

875
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,630
May I check and see...

876
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:26,960
if this painting is here?

877
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,929
It's not here.

878
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,199
It was stolen a month ago.

879
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,940
Then why didn't you tell me about the theft up front?

880
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,610
If a collection was stolen from this gallery,

881
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,349
would you be able to trust it?

882
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,530
You got here earlier than I thought.

883
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:06,030
I sent all the paintings to the directors...

884
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,699
who are expected at the board meeting.

885
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,099
I carefully picked out...

886
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,769
undisclosed works of well-known artists.

887
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:14,879
They have money...

888
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,280
and friends to show it off to,

889
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:21,380
but they're at an age without any taste to parade.

890
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,250
Do people really like receiving these paintings?

891
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,860
It can always be turned into money,

892
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,130
but they can forget the guilt...

893
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,130
of receiving a bribe.

894
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:42,969
Money is the only thing that is aesthetically perfect.

895
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,170
What?

896
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,340
It's something a professor said during a class in college.

897
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,980
In the end, there's only one thing that is aesthetically perfect.

898
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,550
Money.

899
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,989
It's only money.

900
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,960
It's a good quote.

901
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,590
Although it must've been tough to agree with as a college student.

902
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,300
Understanding Classical English and American Literature, C minus.

903
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,400
On the day we first met at the airport,

904
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:12,030
it was that grade you ridiculed me for.

905
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,670
A long leather coat, a leopard-print hat,

906
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,409
wearing red lipstick.

907
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,809
You picked out clothes that don't suit you on purpose,

908
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,809
hoping I would turn you down first.

909
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,650
You remember everything?

910
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:33,788
You stood before me with a face that says,

911
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,460
"I was never turned down by anybody."

912
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,329
I could tell by your eyes that you never made an effort...

913
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,530
to be liked by anybody, and you'll never do so.

914
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:49,199
I thought you were interesting, but no.

915
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,710
I was envious.

916
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:56,280
You were envious of that?

917
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,349
There's nothing much to the grandson of Soonyang's chairman.

918
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,519
Our children will be fine.

919
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,760
In the future, someday,

920
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,489
you, me, and our children.

921
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:21,269
They won't have to grow up with such a big-name grandfather.

922
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:26,510
Then they won't have to be conscious twice as much for their father.

923
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,750
I wanted to tell you this after returning to the headquarters.

924
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:39,090
Okay. I'll go now.

925
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,429
Who did you give it to?

926
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:55,670
The flower and bird painting.

927
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:01,610
The famous folk painting of my gallery's collection.

928
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,849
Why do you ask?

929
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,150
Just because.

930
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:09,579
This was the first time you took a painting...

931
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,119
without running it by me.

932
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,889
Who did you give...

933
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,960
the flower and bird painting to?

934
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,070
Does this mean CEO Jin Seong Jun is...

935
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:33,469
behind this accident?

936
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,440
What I can tell you now is...

937
01:04:37,449 --> 01:04:40,979
that the culprits of the accident received it like a postdated check.

938
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,980
Also,

939
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,550
that the owner of this painting is...

940
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,190
CEO Mo Hyeon Min.

941
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,289
Goodness.

942
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,760
So who made an attempt...

943
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,329
to kill me?

944
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,670
Chairman Jin.

945
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,079
I'm scared.

946
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:21,789
Why?

947
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Why are they trying to kill me?

948
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:33,429
Grandfather.

949
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:35,340
Are you all right?

950
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,409
Who... Who are you?

951
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,650
Mr. Lee.

952
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,578
Do you know him?

953
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:50,989
He's Do Jun, Chairman Jin.

954
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:52,848
Your youngest grandson.

955
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:55,288
No, he's not.

956
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,718
No.

957
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,058
Not him. He's the frightening kid...

958
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,960
who's trying to kill me!

959
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:06,369
Go!

960
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,869
Get out!

961
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:15,610
Get out of here!

962
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,780
Get out! Go!

963
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:24,650
(Reborn Rich)

964
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,619
His brain is in general malfunction, a delirium.

965
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,618
I am Jin Yang Cheol!

966
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,960
You're going to a board meeting at nine o'clock at night?

967
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,529
If your delirium kicks in during the board meeting,

968
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,289
you'll have to step down as the chairman too.

969
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:08,699
Was his name Jin Seong Jun?

970
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,928
Young expat, there is no way...

971
01:07:10,929 --> 01:07:13,129
you will win the votes by number.

972
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,738
I agreed to the formation of a holding company,

973
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,840
yet I dragged you down from the CEO's position.

974
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,808
Does this make me the culprit or not?

975
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:19,840
Who is it?

976
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,379
Who tried to kill me?

977
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,150
Can we really call Grandfather the same Chairman Jin Yang Cheol?

978
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,280
He's not in his right mind.

979
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,690
I won't ask you to keep me alive.

980
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:34,820
Two hours. Just for two hours.

981
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,760
Let me live...

982
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:42,300
as myself, as Jin Yang Cheol.

983
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,889
(Reborn Rich)
