00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,060
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,399
Y2K is an issue whereby computers are unable to recognize years 2000s.

3
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,670
Today is a day before Year 2000.

4
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,000
The world is on high alert...

5
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,909
for a possible attack from Y2K, the millennium bug.

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,109
An unprecedented situation...

7
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,438
whereby nuclear bombs and nuclear missiles are fired...

8
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,879
due to malfunctioning computers might occur.

9
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,579
What? It's coming.

10
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,150
It's coming.

11
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,849
It's finally tomorrow.

12
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,420
(Episode 9)

13
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,090
Are you moving into an air-raid shelter or something?

14
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,099
And stay there for about a year?

15
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,329
An air-raid shelter. Why didn't I think of that?

16
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,268
Should I call Grandfather now?

17
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,099
It's Soonyang. I'm sure they're prepared.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,669
Do Jun wasn't worried at all.

19
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,139
What does he know?

20
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,939
Book smarts have poor intuition.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,310
Why? They don't need to guess answers when taking exams.

22
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,449
They're not trained for it.

23
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,909
So you have good intuition?

24
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,450
The 1999 eschatology that Nostradamus prophesied.

25
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,689
He meant this.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,459
Nuclear explosion due to Y2K.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,829
Nostradamus?

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,900
You believe that?

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,098
The Great Fire of London in 1666.

30
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,168
The French Revolution in 1789.

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,339
The Second World War in 1939 and Hitler's appearance.

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,870
He predicted everything correctly.

33
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,769
And someone like him prophesied...

34
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,780
that the world will end in July, 1999.

35
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,139
- July? - Yes.

36
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,409
July has passed.

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,250
Seriously...

38
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,349
Mother, he's European. There must be a time difference.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,960
Did he follow the lunar calendar?

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,188
(Unlimited Compensation!)

41
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,999
The media and customers were very interested...

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,159
in the unlimited compensation policy that Soonyang offered.

43
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:42,869
Insurance, investment, and electronic-related affiliates...

44
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,598
which could be affected by Y2K...

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,909
especially received a lot of inquiries.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,239
We are facing this situation for the first time...

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,409
since computers were invented.

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,610
Isn't the risk too big for a promotional event?

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,319
We cannot estimate how bad the damage will be from Y2K.

50
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,318
Unlimited compensation is a bit...

51
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,789
This ad was planned by the Chairman's office...

52
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,860
and not by the PR Department, right?

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,490
Yes.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,159
By the Chairman's office itself?

55
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,869
Other companies are making a fuss about making a law...

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,699
saying they don't have to compensate for any damage caused by Y2K.

57
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,269
Unlimited compensation?

58
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,569
(Soonyang Investment)

59
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,810
Gosh.

60
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,210
Isn't that too reckless?

61
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,780
You said you'd take responsibility.

62
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,849
Regardless of how much the compensation is,

63
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,520
you're going to pay for it.

64
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,490
Instead, if Y2K passes by without any issue,

65
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,000
you should do me a favour.

66
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,129
The button is pressed.

67
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,099
The pendulum starts swinging.

68
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,610
- President Kim Dae Jung is present. - Five, four,

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,639
- three, - Three,

70
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,180
- two, one. - two, one.

71
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,050
Everyone.

72
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,879
The 21st century has begun.

73
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,189
The start of the new millennium.

74
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,560
Year 2000 is here.

75
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,729
We can hear their voices.

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,500
Y2K. Millennium bug.

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,899
The end of the world.

78
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,838
Nostradamus, that con artist.

79
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,480
Darn it! What was that?

80
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,539
The 21st century has begun.

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,810
(Reborn Rich)

82
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:38,649
Okay.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,889
You saved your money.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,518
The computation of investment business...

85
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,528
and insurance companies is fine,

86
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,500
and the semiconductor factory has no issue as well.

87
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:56,170
I think you earned more than ten million dollars just now.

88
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:57,839
Thanks to me.

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,709
(Unlimited Compensation!)

90
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,839
Could any other advertisement be as effective as this?

91
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,319
What is it?

92
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,889
Do you want anything for your graduation?

93
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,399
What is the favour you want from me?

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,240
Happy New Year, Grandfather.

95
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,620
(Document for approval)

96
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,758
January 1, 2000.

97
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,970
The temperature is 22°C, and humidity is 62 percent.

98
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,810
- Good morning. - Happy New Year, Ms. Jin.

99
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,009
Looking forward to working with you this year as well, Director Im.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,578
The 2000 sales strategy meeting...

101
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,349
with the district directors of Soonyang Market will be held...

102
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,948
in the conference room on the 11th floor at 9am.

103
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,659
- Right. Cancel that. - Sorry?

104
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,920
I called the managers of Soonyang Investment.

105
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,290
It's a closed door meeting, by the way.

106
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:31,930
Gosh.

107
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,039
Ms. Jin, some directors came from Gwangju, Busan,

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,669
and Jeju Island yesterday...

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,939
to attend today's meeting.

110
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,810
- So? - Sorry?

111
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,378
Do the transportation and accommodation fees...

112
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,949
come from their pockets? I pay for them.

113
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,319
What's the problem?

114
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,560
Last year, I earned more money from New Data Technology stocks...

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,829
than the department store sales.

116
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,959
Think before you work. Get your priorities straight.

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,930
I apologize.

118
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,230
Well, Ms. Jin.

119
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,610
You have made enough. You should stop investing in stocks...

120
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,540
It'll go up to 300 dollars.

121
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,779
I need to get back my share of the department store...

122
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,519
that I gave to Miracle Investment as collateral.

123
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,888
As soon as it goes up to 300 dollars,

124
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,129
I'll get back my share, and that's it. The end.

125
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,660
Three hundred dollars?

126
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,128
This is a phenomenon that has never happened in Korea before,

127
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,800
so any prediction is meaningless.

128
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,838
Looking at the data, if you just consider the corporate value,

129
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,800
the current stock price is a bubble.

130
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,008
The stock price could plummet...

131
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,339
and half the current price anytime.

132
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,610
"Plummet?" Are you sure?

133
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,250
How low will it drop?

134
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,910
- Well... - Ms. Jin.

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,250
Pardon me for asking, but how much did you invest?

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,689
Am I the one making the report here?

137
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,489
No. I'm sorry.

138
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,329
Aren't you experts in investment? Why can't you answer me?

139
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,529
Will it go up to 300 dollars?

140
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,829
Three hundred dollars.

141
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,800
Will it go up to 300 dollars?

142
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,970
Will it?

143
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,240
As KOSDAQ Composition hits 2,834,

144
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,279
the stock price of New Data Technology keeps rising.

145
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,220
Yesterday, the trading market closed with the price of 280 dollars.

146
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,889
Did you say it will go up to 300 dollars to CEO Jin Hwa Young?

147
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,519
Yes.

148
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,190
It will go higher at this rate.

149
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,859
The stock price of New Data Technology...

150
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,159
isn't decided by the market.

151
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,059
It's decided by the era.

152
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,059
The IT era.

153
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,840
If vague fear called upon the Y2K myth,

154
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,340
greed for infinite possibilities...

155
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,809
is appearing in the form of New Data Technology and venture companies.

156
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,979
Since the start of the new millennium.

157
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,249
It is predicted to continue rising.

158
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,620
Please sell all of the New Data Technology stocks...

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,580
that Miracle Investment owns, Mr. Oh.

160
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,949
Now?

161
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,288
Unreasonable investment and rapid growth...

162
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,289
The truth of the Y2K myth was revealed.

163
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,090
The New Data Technology frenzy will show its true colours soon too.

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,299
Sell them off.

165
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,440
Wait.

166
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,969
CEO Lee Myung Soo of New Data Technology...

167
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,739
is suspected to be involved in accounting fraud.

168
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,768
Prosecutors are investigating the issue.

169
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,178
Soonyang Electronics that pushed forward...

170
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,808
with a technological alliance with New Data Technology...

171
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,778
scrapped the plan.

172
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,579
The plan to merge New Data Technology and One Road,

173
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,249
the biggest mobile carrier in Korea, fell through in the end.

174
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,548
As the stock price of New Data Technology continued to fall,

175
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,090
KOSDAQ Composition fell below 520.

176
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,089
Its stock price today is 5.50 dollars,

177
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,059
which is an 18 percent drop from its highest price.

178
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,038
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong...

179
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,309
of FTCD at Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

180
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,679
FTCD stands for Financial and Tax Crime Department.

181
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,779
It's a department that investigates crimes related to finance, stocks,

182
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,419
and tax.

183
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,850
I'm a newly-appointed prosecutor that was appointed this year.

184
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,059
Was that okay? Or should I try one more time?

185
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,970
(The Era of Gender Inequality)

186
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,639
(The Era of Gender Inequality, Together, we can end it.)

187
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,080
(Prosecutor's Office)

188
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,190
I was assigned cases, right?

189
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,389
Are the investigation records here? Where are they?

190
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,529
Well...

191
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,169
In the cabinet over there.

192
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,549
Excuse me, Prosecutor Seo.

193
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,049
You're going to tomorrow's interview with the women's magazine, right?

194
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,750
There will be a photoshoot.

195
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,049
The theme is a female prosecutor.

196
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,419
The magazine company prepared this, or so I heard.

197
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,490
The chief prosecutor is in the office, right?

198
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,369
For the past three months since my probation period ended,

199
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,539
you never assigned me...

200
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,570
a proper case.

201
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,409
Do you know that?

202
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,009
So?

203
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,649
I don't feel like I'm worth my salt,

204
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,820
and I feel bad that I can't face you.

205
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,919
I am ashamed of myself.

206
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,360
Teach me what I'm lacking,

207
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,558
and I'll do my best to correct it.

208
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,570
What are you saying, Prosecutor Seo?

209
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,970
Your existence alone is FTCD's pride.

210
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,539
Didn't you know that?

211
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,940
You're more than worth your salt.

212
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,549
You have an interview with a women's magazine tomorrow, right?

213
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,778
After Prosecutor General resigned from his post because of lobbying,

214
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,989
the public opinion was terrible.

215
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,620
Especially those women that love to talk.

216
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,689
You show them...

217
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,929
how women-friendly prosecution is.

218
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,759
I'll do my best.

219
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,168
Darn it.

220
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,210
(The Era of Gender Inequality, Together, we can end it.)

221
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes.

222
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

223
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,149
Who's calling?

224
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,830
Welcome.

225
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,759
This way, please.

226
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,590
Long time no see.

227
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,330
Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

228
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,730
I didn't know...

229
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,929
you still had my number.

230
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,340
I thought you knew.

231
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,110
Your number was still the same,

232
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,450
so I thought you had a call you were waiting for.

233
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,809
Let me go.

234
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,908
Get a grip.

235
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,109
Losing money was enough.

236
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,709
Do you want to lose the department store as well?

237
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,009
Let me go!

238
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,919
You need to make up for the money you spent on the stocks first.

239
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,989
If you keep postponing the payment...

240
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,989
to the stores in the department store,

241
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,919
they will take legal action against the department store.

242
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,158
Are you okay with that?

243
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,789
Are you threatening me, Director Im?

244
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,700
It means the prosecutors will come to notice...

245
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,440
that you embezzled the company funds.

246
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,649
We still have time.

247
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,120
Only two of us know that.

248
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,599
You want me to investigate the embezzlement...

249
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
of CEO Jin Hwa Young of Soonyang Department Store?

250
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,200
Are you tipping it off to me?

251
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,350
So we're here today as a prosecutor and an informant.

252
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,720
Then I should make it clear.

253
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,319
We'll split the bill.

254
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,558
I can't make the informant pay for me.

255
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,189
(Dessert: Cheesecake, cocoa meringue)

256
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,029
The price is not mentioned.

257
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,940
The person in front of me sure is a grandson of a conglomerate family.

258
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,509
You meet people at a restaurant where price doesn't matter...

259
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,609
and report a family member to prosecution...

260
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,480
as a suspect of a severe crime.

261
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,850
So you'll jump in and join the war of succession?

262
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,559
Using the prosecution... No, using me?

263
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,789
Why? I can't do that?

264
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's say, for the sake of Korea's financial justice,

265
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,669
I put up my beloved family...

266
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,240
on the judgement seat...

267
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,110
despite the excruciating pain.

268
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,779
Does the result of the investigation change?

269
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,620
If you're not confident, I understand.

270
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,049
It's no other company but Soonyang that you have to fight against.

271
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,590
You passed the bar exam as first place in the country...

272
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,400
and are talented enough to be assigned to FTCD.

273
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,529
But it still must be too much for a newly-appointed prosecutor, right?

274
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,569
I understand, I mean it.

275
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,970
I'll be off first.

276
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,309
How much...

277
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,420
was the estimated amount of CEO Jin Hwa Young's embezzlement again?

278
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,319
Let me use a third-generation heir...

279
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,630
to realize justice.

280
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,059
Prosecutor Seo, here.

281
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,999
This is the fund analysis of CEO Jin Hwa Young I got...

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,368
from tracking her transaction history.

283
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,709
Did you find any suspicious activity that points to embezzlement?

284
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,339
No, I couldn't.

285
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,109
Soonyang is an expert in this regard.

286
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,079
Instead,

287
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,819
I found a very interesting account.

288
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,630
Look here.

289
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,088
Since last September and October,

290
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,159
from Soonyang Department Store's corporate account,

291
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,258
ten million dollars...

292
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,929
was split into 300,000 and 400,000 dollars...

293
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,139
and were transferred to dozens of accounts.

294
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,639
Are they clients of the department store?

295
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,909
These dozens of accounts have different account holder names...

296
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,139
and banks,

297
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,880
but they have one thing in common.

298
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,150
That is...

299
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,849
the location of each branch.

300
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,818
Look here. Hoehyeon-dong, Chungmuro, and Euljiro.

301
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,048
All of these places are...

302
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,618
It's Myeong-dong.

303
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,288
She set up a huge money laundry place in the private loan market.

304
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,328
Bingo.

305
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,630
So where did the laundered money go?

306
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
Right. Here.

307
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,769
Soonyang Deco.

308
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,338
Outside, it's a business partner of Soonyang Department Store.

309
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,509
Inside, we don't know.

310
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,808
Because all transactions of Soonyang Deco...

311
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,179
are the funds from Soonyang Department Store...

312
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,079
that went through money laundering here.

313
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,750
It's a paper company.

314
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,049
She set up a phantom company named Soonyang Deco...

315
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,819
and embezzled the company funds.

316
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,890
Mr. Song. Put out a warrant on them.

317
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,959
We'll seize and search Soonyang Department Store...

318
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,390
and subpoena CEO Jin Hwa Young for investigation.

What are you doing?

322
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,140
What's happening?

323
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,650
Someone reported a suspicion of embezzlement.

324
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,150
How dare you ransack my office without me!

325
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,349
Do you know who I am?

326
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,349
You're CEO Jin Hwa Young, right?

327

00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,298
We're requesting your attendance as the suspect...

331
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,730
of embezzlement.

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,038
Goodness.

334
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,239
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

335
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,508
I was too busy with the national affairs...

336
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,849
that I neglected my family.

337
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,078
Don't mention it.

338
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,849
Seocho-dong has fresher air, but Gwanghwamun sells better liquor.

339
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,190
Yes, come with the others.

340
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,890
Let's meet up.

341
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,559
Yes. Thank you.

342
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,230
See you.

343
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,839
Are you managing your minions or not?

344
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,650
Do you even know what I just went through?

345
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,849
The investigation will be done behind closed doors.

346
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,259
Wrap it up internally before the press catch wind.

347
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,859
Put back the money you spent, and the charges will be dropped.

348
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,130
The money?

349
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,799
The money?

350
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,700
Would this be happening to me if I had the money?

351
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,440
The money you lost in the stock market.

352
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,809
Was it the department store's funds?

353
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:20,979
Oh, my gosh...

354
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,390
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

355
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,720
Go to your father and ask for help.

356
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,130
What shall I say?

357
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,990
What shall I tell him?

358
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,400
Should I tell him I embezzled company funds?

359
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,470
That I lost 140 million dollars in the stock market?

360
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,339
How do you still not know my father?

361
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,839
The day he finds out will be the day my life ends.

362
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,710
Good for you.

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,049
What a great family you come from.

364
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,318
You have no qualms about breaking the law,

365
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,848
but you won't dare do anything to upset your father.

366
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,990
I don't care.

367
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,289
You must help me.

368
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,460
You have prosecutor friends.

369
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,859
Plus, aren't you the Mayor of Seoul?

370
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,969
If you can't use your authority,

371
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,269
why'd you waste a fortune to get into politics?

372
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,299
Pull yourself together, Jin Hwa Young!

373
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,309
You should've grown up 30 years ago.

374
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,749
I'm the Mayor of Seoul and the next presidential candidate.

375
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,319
I made my name by attacking the rich and you...

376
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,588
You being investigated for embezzlement is bad news for me.

377
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,758
That you lost over 100 million in the speculative stock market?

378
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,818
It's a calamity.

379
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,829
You're about to cut my political life short.

380
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,930
- Honey. - Hands off.

381
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,630
You, get out.

382
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,139
Go to your father and play sweet and coy or beg on your knees.

383
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,798
Ask him to save you just this once.

384
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,268
Only then will I let you...

385
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,710
spend the rest of your life as Mayor Choi Chang Je's wife.

386
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,980
- Honey. - I said go!

387
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,390
Get my car. Head to Jeongsimjae.

388
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,589
- I can't. - Ms. Jin.

389
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,029
I can't go to Jeongsimjae.

390
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,460
Not Jeongsimjae.

391
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,539
As much as 140 million dollars?

392
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,769
That's more than I expected.

393
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,440
I heard Soonyang Department Store makes quite a lot.

394
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,150
Did you have any other business issues?

395
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,420
Shall I wire you the money now?

396
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,390
You can do that? Right now?

397
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,890
I told you.

398
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,630
If you want anything from us, all you must do is pay the due price.

399
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,299
I'll buy it off you for 140 million.

400
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,868
The Soonyang Department Store shares you own...

401
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,670
under borrowed names, all 25 percent.

402
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,980
Not again. You want more shares?

403
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,180
For just 140 million?

404
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,650
Listen.

405
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,250
You told me to pay the due price.

406
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,649
Do you even know how much the department store shares...

407
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,349
are traded for right now?

408
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,390
They trade for less than 15 dollars per share.

409
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,259
Do you remember the stipulation...

410
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,059
on the contract you signed when we lent you the 400 million?

411
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,470
To ensure the collateral's value in case stock prices dropped,

412
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,609
we added a conditional clause.

413
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,579
(Bond of Debt)

414
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,778
If stock prices go below 15 dollars, the 30 percent stake...

415
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,519
you offered as collateral is transferred to Miracle.

416
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,078
The repayment period has lapsed,

417
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,049
and your shares are worth less than 15 dollars each.

418
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,160
Legal action will be taken to transfer your 30-percent stake...

419
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,160
in Soonyang Department Store to us.

420
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,000
Is this it?

421
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,670
The reason you want...

422
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,269
my hidden 25-percent stake for 140 million dollars?

423
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,710
On top of the 30 percent you took behind my back,

424
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,879
you'll take another 25 percent...

425
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,950
to take over my department store with 55 percent ownership?

426
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,690
You still are a hunter.

427
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,660
This is a hostile takeover.

428
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,359
We stayed true to our partnership.

429
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,700
And it was always you who came to us first.

430
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,839
When I take over... No.

431
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,309
When I hunt down a company, I have just one rule.

432
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,779
My prey are companies undervalued due to incompetent management.

433
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,578
Like your department store that,

434
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:45,950
despite high sale figures, fail to pay off their debts.

435
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,450
Behind me is Soonyang Group,

436
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,019
and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

437
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,029
Congratulations. You have a great set of parents.

438
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,230
Do Jun.

439
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,069
Do Jun.

440
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,109
Get rid of him. That fool.

441
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,740
Aren't you Miracle's majority shareholder?

442
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,910
Must I deal with a puppet of a CEO?

443
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,720
Let's keep the department store collateral deal between us.

444
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,819
Between you and I, family.

445
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm sorry, Aunt.

446
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,559
Miracle's arbiter...

447
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,769
is and will be Mr. Oh.

448
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,440
Isn't that why you visited him in the first place?

449
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,839
Instead of me, your family?

450
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,068
Do Jun. I...

451
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,240
If I were you,

452
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,650
I'd hand over the 25-percent stake for 140 million.

453
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,380
Before prices fall even further.

454
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,319
Mr. Oh...

455
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,890
never buys anything unless it's worth the money.

456
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,069
Goodbye.

457
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,019
The chairman's blood flows in you.

458
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,619
What?

459
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:29,650
You got a prosecutor involved.

460
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,558
("The Female Wave, The Male Organization Shifts")

461
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,190
You must know many other prosecutors.

462
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,629
Why did you go to her?

463
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,759
("The Female Wave, The Male Organization Shifts")

(Jin Hwa Young, Embezzlement and Dereliction)

465
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,400
I plan to subpoena her tomorrow...

466
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,209
and question her for embezzling...

467
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,640
using a paper company.

468
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,650
If my suspicion is confirmed,

469
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,950
I'll follow protocol to have her booked.

470
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,779
Not bad.

471
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,750
The people high up are quite interested in you.

472
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,289
Don't forget that how female prosecutors are...

473
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,960
and will be treated depends on you.

474
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,329
I'll do my best, sir.

475
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,048
Goodness...

476
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,349
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

477
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,960
Hey!

478
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,859
Goodness, you poor...

479
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,359
You look dreadful.

480
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,930
Oh, dear...

481
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,799
So what if I own a stock firm?

482
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:55,309
I had no idea at all.

483
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,508
I heard the rumour a prosecutor was onto you,

484
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,548
and I thought they were playing around...

485
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,750
to drop share prices.

486
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,519
A rumour?

487
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,890
Who would play around?

488
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,258
Someone who wants the stock prices...

489
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,089
of your department store to plummet.

490
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,529
Someone who owns a stake in it,

491
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,799
or wants to buy more for cheap.

492
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,269
If stock prices go below 15 dollars,

493
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,139
the 30 percent stake you offered as collateral...

494
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,470
is transferred to Miracle.

495

Miracle's Oh Se Hyeon.

496
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,440
If I were you,

497
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:35,480
I'd hand over the 25-percent stake for 140 million.

498
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,950
Before prices fall even further.

499
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,349
Jin Do Jun, that jerk!

500
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,160
It's okay. Don't you worry.

501
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,758
We worked so hard to build up that department store.

502
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,430
Would I just let Miracle gobble it up?

503
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,329
Shall I give you the money to get you out of trouble first?

504
00:29:58,569 --> 00:29:59,640
You'll do that?

505
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,309
Your worst days are over.

506
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,670
Dong Ki.

507
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,440
Spend more time with your husband.

508
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,109
And toss me whatever you still own of the department store.

509
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,950
- What? - I'm more reliable than Do Jun.

510
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,160
We're full siblings born from the same parents.

511
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,059
- Dong Ki. - Yes.

512
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,099
That crazy... Hwa Young!

513
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,440
Darn her.

514
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,839
You must know New Data Technology.

515
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,879
It began at 1.50 dollars,

516
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,619
then reached 10 dollars in a week, so that's seven times.

517
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:49,519
It'll surely rise up to at least 40 dollars.

518
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,259
Well,

519
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,990
I hear they'll take the flight up to 300 dollars.

520
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,989
But who knows when this defective aircraft...

521
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,160
will take the plunge?

522
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,400
But I guess it's high risk, high return.

523
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,539
That punk Do Jun.

524
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,038
This was his plan from the start.

525
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,609
He did all this to take over the department store...

526
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,579
No.

527
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,650
It was me.

528
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,480
He set the trap for me!

529
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:33,299
Do you see it, Father?

530
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,900
It's all Do Jun's fault.

531
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,009
All because of Do Jun,

532
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:47,640
you lost 140 million dollars in the stock market,

533
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,578
your stake in the department store,

534
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,680
and now...

535
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,019
a prosecutor is investigating you?

536
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,858
- Is that it? - Yes. I feel so wronged!

537
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,920
Hwa Young!

538
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,029
Will you please answer my question?

539
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,730
Did Do Jun twist your arm...

540
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,339
to force you to buy those shares?

541
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,068
Then did he sign the contract to make you...

542
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,838
- dip into company funds? - No.

543
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,348
Do you have proof Do Jun set a prosecutor after you?

544
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,480
- No, but that's... - I just...

545
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,349
don't get it.

546
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:32,059
How is...

547
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,689
Do Jun at fault?

548
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,789
- Father. - Stop it!

549
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,829
You're using your nephew as an excuse?

550
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,369
How callous of you.

551
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,200
You lost 140 million of my precious money...

552
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,970
and you learned nothing at all?

553
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,278
Father.

554
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,349
Father!

555
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,720
Lend me the money.

556
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,250
The 140 million.

557
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,759
What?

558
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,390
One hundred and forty million?

559
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,200
If your only daughter were to go to prison,

560
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,429
you wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

561
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,538
Wouldn't that be better than your old dad...

562
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,500
spending time behind bars?

563
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:23,609
What?

564
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,679
Have you forgotten that when I gave you the department store,

565
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,640
I made it a separate entity?

566
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,578
If 140 million were to go from me...

567
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,078
to you for no good reason,

568
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,920
that becomes embezzlement and dereliction!

569
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,359
Stand up.

570
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,599
Hwa Young.

571
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,630
I don't worry about you at all.

572
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,500
Why don't I?

573
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:53,940
You have a husband.

574
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:57,639
Didn't I let you marry him when he was a prosecutor...

575
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,109
so we could use him at a time like this?

576
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,049
Your money got him into City Hall.

577
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,220
Wouldn't he help you out?

578
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:09,690
Wouldn't he?

579
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,550
Father...

580
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,989
You married into his family, and you're his problem now.

581
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,500
- Cry all you want there. - Father.

582
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,929
I won't give you a cent.

583
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,710
Mom.

584
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,750
I might go to prison.

585
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,820
Father said he won't help me.

586
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,929
Get a grip.

587
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,090
Get a grip!

588
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,299
The old man has no grace at all.

589
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,768
No. Could you, Mom...

590
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:00,900
Come and sit down.

591
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:04,809
What should I do?

592
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:10,979
Oh, dear...

593
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,579
Father has always been merciless.

594
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,090
So what if he values family and all that?

595
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,449
My Seong Jun is...

596
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,589
getting all mouldy in the warehouse.

597
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,329
He's willing to send his only daughter to prison.

598
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,658
A grandson is an extra stretch.

599
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,500
You have nothing to worry about, Hwa Young.

600
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,468
You have two reliable older brothers.

601
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,539
"Reliable?"

602
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,139
Oh, they're reliable?

603
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,280
Mom, do you know what Dong Ki said?

604
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,349
As if Young Ki would be better...

605
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,849
That's enough, Ms. Hwa Young.

606
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,619
Don't embarrass yourself in front of the new addition.

607
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,630
Have some jujube tea.

608
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,659
It'll help you calm down.

609
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,559
Yes.

610
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,030
Take a long sip of the hot tea...

611
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,969
and pull yourself together.

612
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,909
Will you call the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office?

613
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,250
No.

614
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,789
I'm a referee.

615
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,789
I'll keep a whistle in my hand...

616
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,260
and stand right here.

617
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,199
My goodness...

618
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,239
You must be getting old too.

619
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,579
You worry too much.

620
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,050
Will you be okay with how things turn out?

621
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,489
Be a nice father and expand Soonyang?

622
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,190
I can't have my cake and eat it.

623
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,260
That's pure greed.

624
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,719
Aunt.

625
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,329
I'll accompany you to the prosecutors' office.

626
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:58,308
Dear Heavenly Father.

627
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,380
Please help me and save me from this mess.

628
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,389
The investigation's not open, so there will be no press.

629
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,530
Try to relax.

630
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,860
It's quite a small world.

631
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,829
The prosecutor who subpoenaed you...

632
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,769
was Do Jun's law school classmate.

633
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,510
Is that true?

634
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,320
Ms. Jin.

635
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,820
Do you admit to...

636
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,989
embezzling 140 million dollars of Soonyang Department Store funds?

637
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,729
Do you admit to using a paper company...

638
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,929
called Soonyang Deco in the process?

639
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,079
Soonyang Deco.

640
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,250
On paper, it holds five construction licenses.

641
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:05,249
But another document shows...

642
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,819
it only hired and paid employees who worked for less than...

643
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,988
twenty hours a month.

644
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,018
(Record of Paid Salaries)

645
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,690
In this case, it's one or the other.

646
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,929
It's a shell company that exists only on paper,

647
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,158
or you're an immoral boss who breaks the Labour Standard Law...

648
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,860
and Minimum Wage Act.

649
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,360
There's one more possibility.

650
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,139
This case is built on...

651
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,209
a false report.

652
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,480
Do you deny all the charges?

653
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,909
I'm alerting you to a new crime.

654
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:39,920
What if someone...

655
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,349
approached a naive newly-appointed prosecutor...

656
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,559
and lied that I embezzled company funds?

657
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,658
What if they used this investigation to shake the stock market...

658
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,860
to cause Soonyang Department Store's stocks to fall?

659
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:59,269
What if they planned all this to obtain my shares...

660
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,598
at the value of nothing...

661
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,639
so that they can take over the department store?

662
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:08,210
What happens then?

663
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,579
Then...

664
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:13,179
that person will be punished for fraudulent and...

665
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,650
illegal transactions.

666
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,619
Okay.

667
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,059
I did not...

668
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,630
embezzle any funds.

669
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
We'll find out soon.

670
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,699
My investigators...

671
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,669
are at the address on Soonyang Deco's file.

672
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,769
I see.

673
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,210
Once we prove Soonyang Deco is a paper company,

674
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,110
that should also prove the report...

675
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,980
that you embezzled is not fraudulent.

676
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,949
- Hello? - Ms. Seo.

677
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,158
The Soonyang Deco office.

678
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,558
- Make the call. - Okay.

(Soonyang Deco)

680
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,300
It's not a paper company.

681
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,170
Okay, thank you.

682
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,369
Do you get it now?

683
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,179
I am not guilty of embezzlement.

684
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:17,980
I am the victim here.

685
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,448
Those who are pushing for a hostile takeover...

686
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:23,150
are attacking me to take Soonyang Department Store away from me.

687
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,519
They're using you, Prosecutor Seo.

688
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,360
I heard you and Do Jun...

689
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,500
went to the same law school.

690
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,429
You see,

691
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,309
you should've summoned the one who sent in the false tip, not me.

692
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,909
You should've charged that person with fraud and unfair trading.

693
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,110
How did you come up with such a brilliant idea?

694
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,019
You didn't study law, did you?

695
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,989
I consulted my family's lawyer.

696
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,420
I don't know much about the law.

697
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:04,690
But I do know Do Jun quite well.

698
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:07,659
Do Jun?

699
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,698
When he was deceiving Grandfather and the others in the family...

700
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:12,429
while acting like an ordinary college student,

701
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:14,969
I could see right through him.

702
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,210
Those things can't be hidden.

703
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,250
He's incredibly smart, detail-oriented,

704
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,489
diligent, magnanimous, and brave.

705
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,090
He's got all the qualities...

706
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,860
that Grandfather would love.

707
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,599
I suppose you were...

708
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,769
immensely interested in Do Jun. You seem to know a lot about him.

709
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,170
Yes.

710
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,639
And that's why there should be no place for him at Soonyang.

711
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,849
I'm sure you'd agree.

712
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,268
By now, they should've summoned and questioned Jin Hwa Young.

713
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:18,570
How come it's so quiet?

714
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,439
Shouldn't she be coming to us saying she doesn't want to go to jail...

715
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,309
and asking us for the 140 million dollars?

716
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,178
"Give me the money, and I'll give you my shares."

717
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,909
That was the happy ending I was expecting, you know?

718
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,480
I don't like surprises.

721
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,360
Miracle Investment?

722
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:48,059
Yes, it's an investment company founded in 1997.

723
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,169
Recently, 30 percent...

724

of Jin Hwa Young's shares in the department store...

725
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,840
were transferred to Miracle.

726
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,309
That's a lot of shares to be transferred at once.

727
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:00,510
Soonyang Department Store owned Miracle some money.

728
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,809
When their stock price dropped, Miracle gained ownership...

729
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,309
over the shares they had used as collateral.

730
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,879
Oh, right. You asked me to find out if it had anything to do...

731
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,219
with the Soonyang Group owner's family.

Jin Do Jun.

735
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,110
What if...

736
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,610
they planned all this to obtain my shares...

737
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,638
at the value of nothing...

738
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,710
so that they can take over the department store?

739
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,320
So you'll jump in and join the war of succession?

740
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,559
Using the prosecution... No, using me?

741
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,019
Why?

742
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,190
I can't do that?

743
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,940
I figured you'd want to know what happened with Jin Hwa Young,

744
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,039
since you were the tipper.

745
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,110
Oh, that.

746
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,780
In conclusion, we couldn't get anything out of it.

747
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,219
There were definitely circumstances that made me suspect embezzlement,

748
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,199
but am I just not good enough yet? I couldn't prove it.

749
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,900
I suppose I still have a lot to learn...

750
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,840
before I can go up against the Soonyang family.

751
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,739
I bet you think that too.

752
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,480
Hey.

753
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,619
Why did you tip me off?

754
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,989
The third-generation heir to Soonyang Group.

755
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,929
You can influence many competent prosecutors with just your name.

756
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,469
So why me?

757
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,110

You, Seo Min Yeong,

759
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,750
will become an admirable prosecutor.

760

One that the rich are afraid of.

763
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,829

764
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,000
That's why.

831
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,239
I'll sell everything valuable. I need two months at the most.

832
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,650
Two months is a long time for those people.

833
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,078
To you, it's just enough time...

834
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,579
to start dressing differently for a new season.

835
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,219
But for poor people,

836
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,659
they'll become poorer...

837
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,429
by the day at an accelerating rate.

838
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,529
Poverty has compound interest.

839
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,769
So? Are you saying poor people can't even wait two months?

840
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,570
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of dealing with them.

841
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,339
Because they're so impatient,

842
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,269
they'll suffer in poverty for the rest of their lives.

843
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,440
Good grief.

844
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,179
Then why do you think you can be sitting there now?

845
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,459
You handed over 30 percent of the shares...

846
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,460
to Miracle as soon as the split-off took place.

847
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,929
Then you lost 140 million dollars in stocks,

848
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,239
yet you can still sit there looking so confident.

849
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,400
There's only one reason for that.

850
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,650
You were born into the Soonyang family. That's why.

851
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,980
And you did nothing to earn it.

852
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:28,619
It was pure luck.

853
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,489
A lucky chance that those people did not have.

854
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:36,960
So?

(Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong)

997
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,719
Could you contact Ms. Jin Hwa Young at Soonyang?

998
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
Yes, ma'am.

999
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,860
Ma'am, a package arrived for you earlier...

1000
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,389
Oh, you already got it.

1001
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,730
What was inside?

1002
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,630
I've managed to fill in the blank.

1003
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,840
Evidence to prove that the tip was false.

1004
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,339
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1005
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,679
Embezzlement?

(Chairperson Lee Hang Jae)

1008
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:15,880
No.

1009
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:19,589
It is not true.

1010
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,388
(Emergency Board Meeting to Discuss CEO's Dismissal)

1011
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:23,519
A false tip was sent to the prosecutors...

1012
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,889
to make our stock price drop.

1013
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:28,059
It was orchestrated by Miracle Investment...

1014
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,769
where my nephew, Jin Do Jun, is the majority shareholder.

1015
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,869
To steal my shares, which they're holding as collateral.

1016
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:37,440
And thanks to it,

1017
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:41,110
he's sitting here now as the majority shareholder...

1018
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:42,808
of Soonyang Department Store.

1019

(Witness)

1020
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,449
Is this true?

1021
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:53,550
Instead of answering this question,

1022
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,189
I will prove that Ms. Jin is indeed guilty...

1023
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,059
of embezzlement.

1024
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,699
Right here and now.

1025
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,840
Do you have solid evidence?

1026
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:11,170
Well...

1027
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:16,210
The one who's been managing...

1028
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:19,849
the department store's finances as per Ms. Jin's orders,

1029
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,190
Director Im Myeong Sook, will give a statement. Would that do?

1030
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,889
Why is he suddenly bringing up Director Im?

1031
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,718
- Why is she here? - What is going on?

1032
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,829
- I thought she was on our side. - My gosh.

1033
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,760
- What? - Gosh.

1034
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,960
Director Im disappeared right before my eyes.

1035
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,329
(Witness)

1036
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,710
How come Director Im isn't here yet?

1037
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,619
Hello? Police?

1038
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:12,130
I'd like to report someone missing.

1039
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:15,059
Someone disappeared right before my eyes.

1040
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:22,699
We'll keep you safe until the board meeting is over.

1041
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:33,750
There is only one reason the witness isn't here yet.

1042
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,550
There is nothing to prove.

1043
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:40,619
Now, do you see the truth?

1044
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:43,720
The truth behind this accusation of embezzlement.

1045
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,890
It all started with a false tip-off.

1046
01:08:51,869 --> 01:08:53,670
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office...

1047
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:57,399
has already launched an investigation into it.

1048
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,148
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong of FTCD...

1049
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:08,420
at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1050
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,829
We have secured solid evidence that the tip was false.

(Reborn Rich)

1052
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,850
Here is the plan for establishing the financial holding company.

1053
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,658
The manufacturing industries are now dead.

1054
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:24,728
We must start a money lending business to survive.

1055
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:26,028
Bingo.

1056
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:28,259
The owner of the financial holding company...

1057
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,699
will become the owner of Soonyang Group.

1058
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:35,369
And this will be a good opportunity for Miracle.

1059
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,039
We received a complaint.

1060
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,368
A third-generation conglomerate family member...

1061
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,868
is one of the people who manipulated stock prices.

1062
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,438
The rich are always greedier.

1063
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:43,710
I am Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

1064
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,180
Will you cooperate?

1065
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,448
A trial doesn't only take place in court.

1066
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:49,750
If the picture he wants to paint is the same as mine,

1067
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:54,020
it wouldn't be a bad idea for Dong Ki to take my seat.

1068
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,819
Miracle Investment...

1069
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,288
Soonyang Investment will acquire the company.

1070
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,300
Do Jun.

1071
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:05,229
Do you think I trust you?

1072
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:36,130
