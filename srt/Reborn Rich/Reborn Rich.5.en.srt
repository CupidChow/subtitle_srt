00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,189
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,129
Korea's exports went up...

3
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,959
by over 30 percent in the 1st half of the year,

4
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,428
which was the highest among the nation's major trading partners.

5
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,570
People said Korea...

6
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,170
had never been so prosperous since its very first kingdom was founded.

7
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,568
People believed that the economy would continue to grow...

8
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,469
and that everyone would become richer.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,879
The Miracle on the Han River.

10
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,150
No one doubted the nation's seemingly rosy future.

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,848
The government has finally decided to seek financial assistance...

12
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,879
from the International Monetary Fund.

13
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,120
We should all scrimp and save.

14
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,358
We should join forces...

15
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,358
and overcome this crisis together at this difficult time.

16
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,628
Upon admitting that the country is basically bankrupt,

17
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,159
- the IMF... - The country is bankrupt?

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,230
Until that day came.

19
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,230
Darn it!

20
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,238
Who knew...

21
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,738
a country could go bankrupt? This is unheard of!

22
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,079
The world no one had ever experienced or imagined before.

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,048
In return for the 21 billion-dollar aid package,

24
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,249
the IMF is requesting that Korea implement complete market opening,

25
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,018
promote labor market flexibility,

26
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,650
- and reform the conglomerates... - Those scoundrels!

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,189
Do they think we're their colony?

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,659
Their economic colony.

29
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,158
They think they can strip us bare...

30
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,200
because they're giving us a few dollars.

31
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,870
So?

32
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,879
What can we do to survive?

33
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,819
No one else in the country predicted this national crisis...

34
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,259
and has been preparing for it...

35
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,789
except for me.

36
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,609
Please sign this.

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,810
This agreement states that Mason Oh is the CEO of Miracle Investment.

38
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,150
I wanted to ask you something.

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,759
The foreign exchange crisis. You knew about it, didn't you?

40
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,560
You exchanged 24 million dollars to US dollars, which is a lot of money.

41
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,598
You came all the way to New York to meet me...

42
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,870
and made such a risky investment...

43
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,770
to earn US dollars in preparation for this day.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,370
Right?

45
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,840
Even Cheongwadae, financial officers,

46
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,409
and experts didn't see this coming. No one expected this.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,649
But you, a college student in his early 20s,

48
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,750
saw it coming.

49
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,960
Don't you think it's odd?

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,759
Your question was wrong, Mr. Oh.

51
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,258
Last year, Korea's foreign exchange reserves...

52
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,759
stood at 30 billion dollars,

53
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,740
whereas its liabilities were measured at 170 billion dollars,

54
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,000
which means that the country's credit rating has been dropping.

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,439
The total amount of unpaid wages has surpassed 700 million dollars.

56
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,280
Even a young college student could see that a crisis was imminent.

57
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,990
So how come those at Cheongwadae and the financial officers couldn't?

58
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,189
Don't you think it's odd?

59
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,889
No?

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Good point.

61
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,499
Thanks to your foresight,

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,199
you're now one of the people who hold the most US dollars in Korea.

63
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,970
Congratulations.

64
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,578
It's all part of Miracle Investment's assets.

"HW?"

67
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,120
They're not your initials. What does that mean?

68
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,060
"HW?"

69
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,899
You're easier to read than I thought.

70
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,569
I know what it stands for. Howard Hughes. Right?

71
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,569
HW as in Howard.

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,410
He must be your role model.

73
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,149
Right. Because you were born as a millionaire's heir, just like him?

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,989
Or because he fashionably used his money and power...

75
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,518
to get his hands on everything he wanted, all his life?

76
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,189
Well, I'd say it's both.

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,929
All right, Howard.

78
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,459
What's the first company Miracle Investment will acquire?

79
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,370
They believe it could be resumed in the near future.

80
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,708
Ahjin Motors, Korea's second biggest automaker,

81
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,610
has filed for court receivership.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,578
Unable to repay the loan of 4.5 billion dollars,

83
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,879
the company finally sank...

84
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,419
You want to buy Ahjin Motors?

85
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,990
With all the debts?

86
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,019
Hold on. No, right?

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,529
You said you were after something bigger than Soonyang.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,670
Don't tell me it was Ahjin Motors.

89
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,139
Why? Why Ahjin?

90
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,439
It suits our company.

91
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,870
Miracle.

92
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,639
Look.

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
A miracle?

94
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,120
Ahjin? Ahjin Motors, seriously?

95
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,060

(Ahjin Motors)

97
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,429
- Goodness. - Let's go.

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,799
- We did our best. - Let's get going.

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,229
- Come on. - Let's go.

100
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,599
- Curse you! - You scumbags!

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,838
- Let's go. - What should we do now?

102
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,338
How am I going to earn a living?

103
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,670
- Darn it. - Gosh.

104
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,980
- What do we do now? - Seriously, what am I going to do?

105
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,050
Darn it!

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,350
- Gosh. - I can't believe this.

107

(February 1998)

110
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,629
This year, prices will continue to rise,

111
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,769
and more people will lose their jobs.

112
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,009
Everyone's earnings will decrease, and more companies will go bankrupt.

113
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:17,839
All of us will have to shed a lot of sweat and tears...

114
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,250
while going through this difficult time.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,189
He finally became President after three failed attempts. But for what?

116
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,060
He was handed over a key to an empty shed.

117
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,389
Goodness. How unlucky.

118
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,729
He'll want to be remembered...

119
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,060
as the president who filled the shed and taught the rich a lesson.

120
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,828
They're calling this a breakfast meeting.

121
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,899
But clearly, they summoned all of us to discipline us.

122
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,500
At this early hour...

123
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,709
Anyway, do you sleep well these days?

124
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,240
You know, Ahjin Motors' situation.

125
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,110
It could happen to us too, you know.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,419
Even Ahjin, the second biggest auto company, has collapsed.

127
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,790
Will Soonyang Motors be all right?

128
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,790
After listening to you, I am concerned indeed.

129
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,919
(Cheongwadae, The Republic of Korea)

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,389
Daeyoung Motors is the number one auto company.

131
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,060
The company should go global and bring in dollars, if anything.

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,730
But they're busy power-tripping in this small country.

133
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,810
Going global will be hard, right?

134
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,379
Should Soonyang show you how it's done?

135
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,720
Chairman Jin, you're surely way more magnanimous than I am.

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,659
Your younger son.

137
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,259
He came to me and said he wanted to take over Hando Steel.

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,830
Had he been my son,

139
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,100
I would've taught him a lesson and disowned him long ago.

140
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,070
That brat dared to stab his brother in the back.

141
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,669
But you protected him because he's your son.

142
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,679
It certainly...

143
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,179
changed my opinion of you.

144
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,090
- You... - Mr. President is here.

145
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,059
What does Cheongwadae think?

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,429
They didn't even bring up the IMF and company succession, right?

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,470
Will they reform the conglomerate system?

148
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,440
Do they want us to lose all our subsidiaries?

149
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,939
Oh, right. I heard we might have to give up our private assets too.

150
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,210
That won't happen, right?

151
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,980
Did you already agree to everything?

152
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,779
- Father. - Dong Ki!

153
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,820
You...

154
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,629
Cheongwadae seemed determined.

155
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,129
They plan to restructure the major corporations,

156
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,500
and Soonyang won't be an exception.

157
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,649
What will Cheongwadae do about Ahjin Motors?

158
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,679
If they sit on the issue, the company will rack up more debt.

159
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,719
Then no one would want to acquire the company.

160
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,159
The domestic automotive industry is suffering big-time.

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,158
Who'd be willing to acquire Ahjin Motors?

162
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,090
Who'd be crazy enough to do that, unless they were shot in the head?

163
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,200
Me.

164
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,029
Ahjin Motors.

165
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,840
Soonyang will buy the company.

166
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,109
Father, you wish to buy Ahjin with all that's going on?

167
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,908
If a businessman sits in a safe zone and doesn't budge,

168
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,109
his butt will rot.

169
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,750
Father, the interest on their loan is 30 percent.

170
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,979
Ahjin has nothing but debts.

171
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,519
Do you want to volunteer to take care of the bomb?

172
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,589
At the moment, we should focus on maintaining Soonyang Motors...

173
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,519
Cheongwadae wishes to restructure everything.

174
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,960
And as you guys said, the domestic automotive industry is dead.

175
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,970
Why don't you understand what this means?

176
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,500
Ahjin Motors isn't the bomb.

177
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,370
Soonyang Motors is.

178
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,370
The worst performing automaker in the country, Soonyang Motors!

179
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,879
Taking over Ahjin Motors?

180
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,220
It's not a choice.

181
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,190
We must do it to survive.

182
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,190
To survive.

183
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,730
Okay?

184
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:29,990
Do you understand?

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,899
(Ahjin Motors, Changes in Shareholders)

186
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,409
Your grandfather, Chairman Jin.

187
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:50,610
He'll be determined to acquire Ahjin Motors.

188
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,190
Because it's the only way to protect Soonyang Motors.

189
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,119
Acquiring Ahjin Motors, the number two company in the industry,

190
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,789
means their market dominance will go up.

191
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,320
And if they share the production lines,

192
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,889
they can reduce costs too.

193
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,299
Most importantly, they'd have to grow Soonyang Motors...

194
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,668
to avoid restructuring.

195
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:09,700
(Soonyang)

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,110
That being said...

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,580
If I were one of those people at Cheongwadae,

198
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,549
I'd give Ahjin Motors to Chairman Jin.

199
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,719
Not a new investment firm like us...

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,519
with no experience in management whatsoever.

201
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,220
Are you confident?

202
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,929
Are you sure we won't lose Ahjin Motors to Soonyang?

203
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,759
I assure you that Soonyang will never acquire Ahjin Motors.

204
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,269
They'll soon realize that they've fallen prey...

205
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,070
to the winner's curse.

206
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,940
The internal reserves?

207
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,450
- All of it? - Yes.

208
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,049
The bidding war over Hando Steel...

209
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,049
was extremely fierce, Father.

210
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,820
With the foreign exchange differences soaring,

211
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,759
we had unexpected expenses, sir.

212
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
What can we do?

213
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,730
Try to take out a loan from a bank.

214
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,038
We've maxed out our limits at all the major banks,

215
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,840
so we can't take out an additional loan, sir.

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,850
Is that also because of Hando Steel?

217
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,419
Yes, sir.

218
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,720
Our real estate properties.

219
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,460
Let's sell them.

220
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,659
The thing is,

221
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,100
we already used the valuable ones...

222
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
- as collateral to take out... - So?

223
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:54,210
Are you saying we can't afford to acquire Ahjin Motors?

224
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,340
I'm sorry, Father.

225
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,849
We wouldn't have had any problems without the financial crisis.

226
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,320
If only Dong Ki hadn't egged on the chairman of Daeyoung...

227
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,719
to increase the bid for Hando Steel...

228
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,689
Father, I was just...

229
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,889
Enough, both of you!

230
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,399
It's all my fault.

231
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,799
Father.

232
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,340
Hang Jae.

233
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,710
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,480
You are...

235
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,720
my son.

236
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,659
(Arrivals Exit)

237
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,549
Mr. Jin Seong Jun?

238
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,419
You're waiting for your secretary, right?

239
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,389
They'll be a bit late.

240
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Yes, sorry! Oh, boy.

241
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,268
Sorry. We apologize.

242
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,840
- We're sorry. - My gosh.

243
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,740
You guys.

244
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,008
- You can't block the road! - We're sorry.

245
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,079
- Sorry, we'll hurry. - I'm very busy right now!

246
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,850
They're getting stalled.

247
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,979
Our suitcases got switched at the airport,

248
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,989
so we meet by fate...

249
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,620
and leave a deep impression on each other. That's the story.

250
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,090
Before our families set us up officially.

251
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,888
- "We?" - Jin Seong Jun,

252
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,159
the Soonyang family's eldest grandson,

253
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,700
and Mo Hyeon Min, the only daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

254
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,970
Us.

255
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,339
Hearing that you'd be turned off by marriage talks...

256
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,240
between the two families,

257
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,739
my family came up with this idea in a rush...

258
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
because they really want to marry me off to your family.

259
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,409
You're showing me all your cards. Then this game will be no fun.

260
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,749
In your third year of college, you took...

261
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,120
"Understanding Classic British and American Literature." C minus.

262
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:26,960
That was your grade, right?

263
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,090
No wonder you have poor comprehension skills.

264
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,830
I'm trying to tell you that we should turn the tables.

265
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,909
You look as though you're thinking, "Where did this nutjob come from?"

266
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,580
You have good comprehension skills.

267
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,710
Yes, you can see.

268
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,279
Tell the elders in your family.

269
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,288
I love myself too much to bet my future on you just because...

270
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,620
you're from the Soonyang family.

271
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,119
Why can't you take care of it yourself?

272
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,230
My family isn't really in a position to turn it down.

273
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140
You look better in person. I guess you're not photogenic.

274
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,430
I'm sorry, sir. Did I keep you waiting long?

275
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,969
You may not believe it,

276
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,038
but some stupid newspaper delivery truck...

277
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,400
Of course, I believe you. It was Hyunsung Daily, right?

278
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,639
Oh, how did you know?

279
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,609
Let's go. The elders must be waiting.

280
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,440
Yes, sir.

281
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,250
- Grandma. - Oh, my.

282
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,219
My gosh. You did it, sweetheart.

283
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,960
It must've been so hard.

284
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,160
You lived on hamburgers while studying in that faraway country.

285
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,598
You've lost weight.

286
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,969
No. I gained 5kg, Grandma.

287
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,429
It's water weight.

288
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,799
You're swollen because you haven't been eating well.

289
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,608
Jeong Rae, what are you waiting for? He must be hungry.

290
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,909
- Let's feed him first. - Okay.

291
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,680
Mother, he should go say hello to Father first.

292
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,980
- All right. - He's in his study, right?

293
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes, that's right.

294
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,650
- Go on. - I'll be right back.

295
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,369
Grandpa. It's me, Seong Jun.

296
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,170
I'm coming in.

297
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,410
You're back!

298
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,380
Oh, my. Yes, welcome back.

299
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,519
Let me take a look at you.

300
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,390
My gosh, look at you.

301
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,528
You've done well finishing up...

302
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,269
the studies you always dreaded doing.

303
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,470
My eldest grandson.

304
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,970
My true studies begin now.

305
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,369
I'll stand right by your side to learn everything I must know.

306
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,910
Good. Let's wait and see...

307
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,380
how you earn your keep, my eldest grandson.

308
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,250
Good.

309
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,649
Go get some rest. You must be tired from traveling.

310
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,690
Okay.

311
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,089
Seong Jun, you are...

312
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,589
the pillar of our family.

313
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,799
So you can get married with the same attitude.

314
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:58,900
Do you understand?

315
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,740
You must have found a suitable candidate, Grandfather.

316
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,880
Okay. Go on now.

317
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,519
She doesn't look like the type who would cherish her husband.

318
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,289
And especially not the type who'd be dedicated to her in-laws.

319
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:26,858
While I was gone, you've mastered the art of discerning characters.

320
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,529
Goodness. Hey.

321
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,169
If your father hadn't fallen out of your grandfather's favor,

322
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,200
I wouldn't let you go into this marriage.

323
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,279
Do I have to end up humoring my daughter-in-law too?

324
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,039
Jeez.

325
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,109
Look at this girl.

326
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,118
Nothing about her says that she's easygoing.

327
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,180
Look at this.

328
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,220

495
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,048
- Why did you take part in this? - Ms. Lee Hae In!

496
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,518
- Look over here. - Over here too!

497
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,650
- Please look here. - Ms. Lee Hae In!

498
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,788
(Repay National Debt with Gold, Restore Economy with Our Hearts)

499
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,789
When times are tough for our country,

500
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,460
I learned that it is our duty to show the least of effort.

501
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,559
That was the valuable teaching of my mother-in-law.

502
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,368
- Another word, please. - Ms. Lee Hae In!

503
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,768
- Please say something too! - Ms. Lee, over here.

504
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:27,038
- Look over here. - Please look here.

505
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,238
- Ms. Lee. - Over here.

506
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,609
- Anything else? - Look over here.

507
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,908
- Please look here. - Please add another word.

508
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,308
That is why all of us decided...

509
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:35,678
to take part in this campaign.

510
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,678
- Ms. Lee Hae In! - Hae In, over here!

511
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,518
- Hae In! - How do you think it'll turn out?

512
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,689
- Anything else to say? - Ms. Lee!

513
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,960
- Please look over here. - Over here too.

514
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:52,929
- Hello. - You're here.

515
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,828
The news of your wife and daughters-in-law...

516
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,570
taking part in the gold-collecting campaign...

517
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,339
will be reported on the front page as the top news...

518
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,909
for Hyunsung Daily tomorrow.

519
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,539
This story will become a great catalyst in the campaign...

520
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,949
since the participation began to subside, Chairman Jin.

521
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
Why don't you put out a huge photo instead?

522
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,989
Not a lot of words.

523
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,988
I hear one photo is...

524
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,789
more powerful than ten words.

525
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,860
You are such a wise man, Chairman Jin.

526
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,699
It wasn't me. It's from my eldest grandson,

527
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,929
whom I wish to marry to your family.

528
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,409
So? Will he be a good match for her?

529
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,250
I'm sorry. I'm late.

530
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,019
Speak of the devil. My humble daughter, Chairman Jin.

531
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,789
Hello.

532
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,489
- Take a seat. - Yes.

533
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,139
I'm glad.

534
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,079
First, let's write up the paperwork for the acquisition of Ahjin Motors.

535
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,119
Okay.

536
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,590
Seong Jun, come over here.

537
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,719
Yes, Grandfather.

538
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,098
Did you want me, Grandfather?

539
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,039
Yes, you should meet her.

540
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,750
How do you do?

541
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,119
My name is Jin Seong Jun.

542
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,489
My name is Mo Hyeon Min.

543
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,090
You must leave now.

544
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,780
I'm late, Grandfather.

545
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,409
Hey, Do Jun.

546
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:24,380
Yes?

547
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,719
Do you still invest with Oh Se Hyeon as your proxy?

548
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,360
You already know.

549
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,929
Mr. Oh and I have different views on investing.

550
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,299
We split up a while ago.

551
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,559
That Oh Se Hyeon is...

552
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,030
trying to take Ahjin Motors over. Did you know about this?

553
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,170
Are you worried...

554
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,178
that he'll become a hindrance to Soonyang Motors?

555
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,639
He acts smart, but he's foolish.

556
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,710
He plays the money game but knows nothing about business.

557
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:00,750
What now? Employment buyout?

558
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,320
- Is that what he's doing? - Yes, sir.

559
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,090
How does that make any sense?

560
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,530
Do Jun, there is nothing for you to learn from this.

561
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,659
Do not associate with him.

562
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:20,639
Why are you so against the employment buyout?

563
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,009
Doesn't it benefit the company...

564
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,710
if productivity rises through peace between the union and management?

565
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,050
You always told me about righteous management,

566
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,250
and I thought that was it.

567
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,969
When you bring up a servant,

568
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,369
you mustn't give him great housing and a full stomach.

569
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,210
Do you know why?

570
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,309
Because he'll begin to think he's the master.

571
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,349
Layouts are not a big deal.

572
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,019
It clearly shows them who their true master is.

573
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,590
Righteous management?

574
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,530
To me,

575
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,369
money is righteousness.

576
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,820
(Righteous management)

577
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,710
You're a big man now,

578
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,139
Do Jun.

579
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,280
I'd just pass you by if I meet you out on the street.

580
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,250
I'll recognize you.

581
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,719
Sir!

582
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,860
You're an unforgettable face.

583
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,800
I heard you got into SNU law at the top of the class,

584
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,940
and you quite look like one.

585
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,809
Justice. Righteousness.

586
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,610
You must fancy such values.

587
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,480
I'm glad...

588
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,349
that you have no interest in running the company.

589
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,900
Did you say his youngest grandson is...

590
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,468
a student at SNU's law program?

591
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:06,699
He's not just a student there.

592
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,269
He got in at the top of his class.

593
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,439
Chairman Jin must've been thrilled. That Scrooge of a man...

594
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,610
gave him 160,000m² of land in Bundang.

595
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,250
Think of how much that's worth.

596
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,678
Land in Bundang?

597
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,888
Before the urban planning began,

598
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,760
his youngest grandson picked out Bundang.

599
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,320
See?

600
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,960
A family that's blessed with money is different.

601
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,530
Why do you ask?

602
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,829
I'm guessing you find this marriage intriguing.

603
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,320
Why don't we change the story...

604
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,619
with a different male lead?

605
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,039
(Cafe Peace)

606
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,369
I'll take Vienna coffee.

607
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,909
One Vienna coffee, no cinnamon powder.

608
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:24,209
You take this every single day, 365 days a year.

609
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,719
You come by without missing a day, and it's always that menu.

610
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:30,149
Tomorrow at 8am, Main Library.

611
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,619
I like to sit by the window.

612
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,289
Your coffee is on me today.

613
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,159
Why? You thought I didn't know?

614
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,369
You come by every single day because of me.

615
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,099
Me?

616
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,710
Listen to this guy. Yes, you.

617
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,340
You always come to my side of town alone.

618
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,678
You always come only during my shift,

619
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,119
then order this greasy Vienna coffee without skipping a day.

620
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,750
How will you explain this cliche story?

621
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,388
You could probably drink about 12 of these...

622
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:11,360
with the points you've accumulated.

623
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,159
Really?

624
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,969
I see.

625
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:24,510
Wait, are you saying...

626
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,679
you liked Vienna coffee, not me?

627
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,050
Seriously?

628
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:31,480
I really didn't know.

629
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,420
I can start using the points next time I come.

630
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:37,920
All right!

631
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,230
Right, did you say you like to sit by the window?

632
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,699
I'll save a seat for you at the library.

633
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,570
You look very tired from working your part-time job.

634
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,239
See you tomorrow. Thanks for the coffee.

635
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,309
Did you just see him ask me out?

636
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,880
I think you're the one who asked him out.

What did you say?

00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:40,250
What do you mean? At this point in time?

640

- What? - What's going on?

Grab me the newspaper. Hyunsung Daily from this morning.

Just as Soonyang Group needs Hyunsung Daily,

644
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,210
I thought you would need me.

658
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,730
the public sentiment is the most crucial.

659
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,928
Let us save Ahjin Motors!

660
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,670
- Save it! - Save it!

661
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,110
Hey, Jin Do...

662
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:19,619
Where are you going?

663
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,960
("US Hedge Fund, Miracle Investment About to Acquire Ahjin Motors!")

664
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,928
Now, this is what I call a good news article.

665
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,329
Hyunsung Daily is...

666
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,070
a true patriot.

667
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,840
I can't leave it up to corporations only to save our country.

668
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,010
The media should take part as well.

669
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,239
- Prosecutor Choi. - Yes.

670
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,210
This is how hard Hyunsung Daily works,

671
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,618
so you should give him an exclusive scoop.

672
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,349
He's one of us now.

673
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,960
Well, if the two great young people end up tying the knot,

674
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,230
I wouldn't want anything more as a parent.

675

(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

676
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,238
The prosecution has been conducting...

677
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,070
an internal investigation to indict Ahjin's Chairman Song Hyun Chang.

678
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:19,880
Chairman Song Hyun Chang?

679
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,948
Yes, in the process of guaranteeing their insolvent affiliations,

680
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,250
he made a few rash choices.

681
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:26,848
His fraudulent accounting and embezzlement are...

682
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,980
enough to have him detained and interrogated.

683
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,919
If the chairman is arrested for corruption,

684
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,689
how will anybody turn Ahjin Motors into a public corporation?

685
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,929
- Correct. - It'll need to find a new owner.

686
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,929
- Let's eat up. Please, eat. - Yes.

687
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,170
That old man has a fiery temper.

688
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:54,209
We can't let Soonyang acquire Ahjin Motors like this.

(Ahjin Motors Acquisition Plans)

690
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,980
Please find a way, Mr. Oh.

691
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,019
I've been curious ever since the acquisition of Hando Steel.

692
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,820
Do you have one of those common rich heir birth secrets?

693
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,329
Chairman Jin is your grandfather.

694
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,459
Ahjin Motors.

695
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,359
If we at Miracle can't buy it,

696
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,070
we can let Soonyang. Why are you so against that?

697
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,809
Because they're against employment buyout.

698
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,250
- What? - Soonyang...

699
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,750
will fire every single Ahjin Motors employee.

700
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,789
You never wanted Ahjin Motors from the start.

701
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,760
You just wanted to keep everyone employed?

702
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,500
Why didn't you tell me that? Aren't I your partner?

703
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,639
If I'd known that, I'd have never gotten into this.

704
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,268
I'm a mergers and acquisitions expert.

705
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,409
I'm what the media calls a company hunter.

706
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,109
I buy up insolvent corporations because it makes money.

707
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,579
Ahjin Motors, yes. Employee buyout, no!

708
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:07,149
I agreed to keep the staff...

709
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,920
because it was the best way to buy Ahjin Motors.

710
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,820
If the miracle you want is to keep everyone at Ahjin hired,

711
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,590
too bad, because that miracle won't happen.

712
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,099
Why not?

713
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,968
The romantic Korean notion...

714
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:27,269
of "job for life" won't fly in the international market.

715
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,170
Our partnership ends today.

716
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,238
I can't run a three-legged race...

717
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,979
with someone running in the other direction.

718
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,750
It's one or the other. You break a leg or a skull.

719
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,789
I have no choice.

720
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,800
I'll go to Chairman Jin...

721
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,630
and negotiate this myself.

722
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,739
You'll negotiate?

723
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,170
You'll show yourself to Chairman Jin?

724
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:07,279
You'll announce that the person...

725
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,280
who has been messing with him is his youngest grandkid Jin Do Jun?

726
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,118
This is Jin Yang Cheol. Can you handle him?

727
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,849
Soonyang needs money and...

728
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,420
I need the people to keep their jobs.

729
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,360
There's no other way.

730
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,360
Why are you so obsessed?

731
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,269
Is there another reason for all this?

732
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,070
Why are you risking so much money on something so futile?

733
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,579
What I want.

734
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:52,488
The long fight between Ahjin's acquisition negotiators...

735
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,189
and labor union regarding employee buyout...

736
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,260
finally broke down today.

737
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,359
Ahjin Motors' acquisition negotiators...

738
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,268
officially refused the labor union's demand of employee buyout,

739
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,368
and it looks inevitable that Ahjin's employees...

740
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,940
of about 2,500 will lose their jobs.

741
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,868
Mom!

742
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:13,069
I'm coming. The kimchi soup tastes great today.

743
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,639
The labor union vowed to go on strike.

744
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,479
Ahjin Motors' union's motto is "layoff is murder,"

745
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,419
and they announced to block off the entrances...

746
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,348
to the facility and fight until negotiators...

747
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,590
agree to go back on their plans to lay off staff.

748
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:30,828
Since the labor union decided to take strong action,

749
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,159
the site is rife with violence,

750
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,300
and emotions are running high.

751
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,980
Mom!

752
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,909
Mom!

753
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,949
Wake up, Mom. Mom!

754
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:01,789
The wish that was much bigger and desperate than..

755
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:05,130
wanting Soonyang.

756
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,019
That's the reason...

757
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,489
I can't back out of...

758
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,059
this futile fight.

759
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:46,500
Why are you here?

760
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,639
I have something to tell Grandfather.

761
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,340
He went to Cheongwadae.

762
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,079
Why, out of the blue?

763
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:02,679
He tried so hard to take over Ahjin Motors.

764
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,349
It looks like the President gave his approval.

765
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,929
The President got involved with Ahjin Motors?

766
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,659
Chairman Jin.

767
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,799
We need you to make a huge decision.

768
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,929
Well...

769
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,940
As you already know,

770
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,070
Chairman Song Hyun Chang has indisposed,

771
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:29,579
so we can't postpone the acquisition of Ahjin Motors any longer.

772
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,750
Then the acquisition process.

773
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,320
Can we move right ahead?

774
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:41,760
Someone else will be here to negotiate that process.

775
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,130
Here he is.

776
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,260
Chairman Jin.

777
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,369
Didn't you advise me...

778
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,869
not to power trip in a small country...

779
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,570
but to go out into the world and earn some dollars?

780
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,280
Grandfather seems to be disgruntled with the President.

781
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:11,420
You should go home.

782
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:16,519
Ahjin Motors.

783
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,929
Is it official that Soonyang will acquire it?

784
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,769
You're quite interested in how things go.

785
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,809
I heard the President ordered Soonyang and Ahjin Motors' merger...

786
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,980
with Daeyoung Motors at the helm.

787
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,769
Is it the water or the butter?

788
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:02,739
It has no soul.

789
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,010
You made me want to go back.

790
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,539
It all worked out.

791
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,090
Yes. You really have no soul.

792
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,349
But...

793
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:24,360
you have the Korean spirit.

794
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,360
It's not bad.

795
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:42,940
Eat up.

796
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,709
It's time for you to make...

797
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,550
the most important decision of your life.

798
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,988
It won't be a three-legged race.

799
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:54,190
I plan to keep going in the other direction.

800
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,059
Let's row instead.

801
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,360
Then we can face other directions...

802
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,739
and still partner up.

803
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,110
I won't give up fighting for Ahjin's employees.

804
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,639
Instead, I'll give you...

805
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:20,119
shares to a global top ten...

806
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,920
automobile company.

807
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,630
If you could keep Soonyang Motors...

808
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,300
and acquire Ahjin Motors,

809
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,070
would you do business with Miracle Investment?

810
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,280
I have...

811
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,780
no money to fight Daeyoung...

812
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:57,320
and no cause to fight the President.

813
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,489
Turn Soonyang Motors into a global top ten car company.

814
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,530
Is that even possible?

815
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,300
Do you take me for the kind of person...

816
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,909
to fall for your dollar-spewing con?

817
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,920
I am...

818
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,889
Jin Yang Cheol.

819
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:45,829
I must meet with the President.

820
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,639
Do you think I could hand over a company...

821
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,639
I spent my life building up...

Because the economy is in shambles,

824
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,920
you want me to lay off the staff?

825
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,889
I can't do that.

826
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,199
You want to reform us conglomerates?

That won't be easy.

Chairman Jin.

829
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,469
We hate spending just one cent for the good of the country,

830
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,169
but to make one cent,

831
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,380
us businessmen are willing to give our lives.

832
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,079
Mr. President.

833
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,518
When dealing with a businessman, you must make a deal.

834
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:36,579
A deal?

835
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,319
Running a country...

836
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,889
Have conglomerates swap subsidiaries...

837
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:44,190
that need to be downsized.

838
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:47,900
Then offer a cheap loan and tax discount to companies...

839
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,400
that agree to do so.

840
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,969
Companies that were against your reform will give in,

841
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,639
and you will become...

842
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,249
a President that pulled off the conglomerate reform...

843
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,880
that the IMF wanted.

844
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,960
Isn't that a big deal?

845
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,460
A big deal.

846
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,670
The big deal you suggested.

847
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,469
Will the President bite?

848
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,539
The current government is the first to successfully change the regime.

849
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,880
They'll need something to show the people that they're doing well.

What is it you want, Chairman Jin?

Give me Ahjin Motors.

856
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,880
I'll merge it with Soonyang Motors...

857
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,090
and add Soonyang Electronics' technology...

858

to make a global top ten automobile company.

Sir. Miracle will provide the funds you need to acquire Ahjin.

862
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,550
When you offer a deal,

863
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,090
it means there's a condition.

864
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,860
Seventeen percent of Soonyang Motors' shares...

865
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,299
and employment buyout of Ahjin Motors' staff.

866

Employment buyout?

867
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:07,099
Do you think...

868
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,499
I'll accept that condition...

869

870

you will accept the deal.
