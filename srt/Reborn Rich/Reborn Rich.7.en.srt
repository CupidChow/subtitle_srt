00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,130
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,399
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,250
You know Miracle Investment, right?

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,019
They're the majority shareholder of Jaea Construction...

5
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,049
that messed with you so nicely and took over...

6
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,459
New Seoul Town's management rights.

7
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,430
Then...

8
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,730
do you also know who the company's real owner is?

9
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,870
You're talking like you know who it is.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,069
Who is it?

11
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,979
I'm Miracle's majority shareholder,

12
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,849
Jin Do Jun.

13
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,319
You...

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,889
What?

15
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,360
You're...

16
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,629
The majority shareholder hiding behind Oh Se Hyeon...

17
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,860
is you, Do Jun?

18
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,370
Is that it?

19
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:51,310
Using Chang Je to humiliate me...

20
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,909
and taking the New Seoul Town project...

21
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,849
That was you, Do Jun?

22
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,959
You used my reluctance to give up on cars...

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,530
and used Ahjin Motors as bait to take Soonyang Motors' shares.

24
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,329
You forced me to buy Hando Steel...

25
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,500
at an exorbitant price to drain our funds.

26
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,468
You did all that with Oh Se Hyeon as a pawn...

27
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,610
to toy with me to do this and that?

28
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,509
The punk who dared to challenge me...

29
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,550
was Jin Yang Cheol's youngest grandson.

30
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,659
Jin Do Jun.

31
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,900
Was it really you?

32
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,840
Yes, Grandfather.

33
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,610
They were all...

34
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,508
decisions I made as Miracle's majority shareholder.

35
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,650
Why?

36
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,919
Why did you do such a thing? Why?

37
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,759
Did you think...

38
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,659
this would make me...

39
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,430
leave Soonyang to you when you're not my eldest grandson?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,230
No, Grandfather.

41
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,879
I'd like to buy...

42
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,949
Soonyang.

43
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,579
What?

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,089
I will buy Soonyang.

45
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,790
With my money.

46
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,600
(Reborn Rich)

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,370
Who is...

48
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,810
Miracle's true owner?

49
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,079
You really don't know?

50
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,180
You got knocked out the moment you stepped into the ring.

51
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,990
I thought you'd know all about your opponent by now.

52
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,730
Isn't that the only way you can try to get your own back?

53
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,230
You're a nicer person than I thought, Seong Jun.

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,069
You don't suit me.

55
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,079
You asked me to see you as a person, not as a title.

56
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,519
That's my answer.

57
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,120
I want to date a man who suits the position without being...

58
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,319
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's eldest grandson.

59
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,259
Did you...

60
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,899
just reject me?

61
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,970
Let's end it on a high note.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
So we can smile if we meet again.

63
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,250
You reject me and then say you'll see me again?

64
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,350
You're interesting to the very end.

65
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
What?

66
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,160
You'll buy Soonyang?

67
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,699
With your money?

68
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,979
Did getting your hands on over ten million dollars...

69
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,920
at a young age make you think money is nothing?

70
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,518
To you, is Soonyang a large piece of candy...

71
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,819
you can get at a corner store?

72
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,829
It's not because money is nothing,

73
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,100
nor because I think lightly of Soonyang.

74
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,470
You started as a delivery boy at a rice mill in Incheon...

75
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,009
and built up Soonyang Group that pays 200,000 employees.

76
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,279
I know better than anyone how much sweat and tears...

77
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,449
you shed on the way.

78
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,819
One day,

79
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,790
my eldest uncle will become chairman.

80
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,930
The eldest inherits all, and that's our family's... No.

81
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,430
That's your rule.

82
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,930
You know that so well, so why?

83
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,240
But Grandfather.

84
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,980
Will Soonyang then...

85
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,250
be the same Soonyang it is now?

86
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,579
Just because he inherited your family name...

87
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,250
doesn't mean he inherited your entrepreneurship.

88
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,100
You're concerned more than anyone.

89
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,899
Unlike any other founder of a large company,

90
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,069
you haven't given Uncle anything. Isn't that the reason?

91
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,029
Do you remember what I said?

92
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,798
Anyone who goes against me,

93
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,169
I never forgive, whether he be a sibling or a son.

94
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,240
Do you think a grandson is any different?

95
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,340
Go back to studying law.

96
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,320
So it doesn't get in your way, as of today, I will confiscate your pawn.

97
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,490
If Oh Se Hyeon doesn't egg you on,

98
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,360
you'll grow out of this phase soon enough.

99
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,690
Drop the charges and have him released, Grandfather.

100
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,499
I'll sign over the business rights...

101
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,970
to New Seoul Town's 320,000m² housing complex...

102
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,210
to Soonyang Construction.

103
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,840
Do you think that's a valid deal?

104
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,980
You study law at the best university in Korea,

105
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,320
and you know so little about it.

106
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,960
He was arrested for bribing the Mayor of Seoul.

107
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,059
Chang Je will be replaced for taking the bribe,

108
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
and Oh Se Hyeon will be locked up for giving it.

109
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,200
Then New Seoul Town as a whole will become Soonyang's.

110
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,740
If you ask me to release Oh Se Hyeon for just 320,000m²,

111
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,570
would I accept the deal?

112
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,179
I haven't even...

113
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,549
started bargaining, Grandfather.

114
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,119
Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je's emergency press conference...

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,750
will begin shortly.

116
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,090
Please wait a little longer.

117
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,990
What's the agenda for this press conference?

118
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,398
Is it urgent enough to hold an unscheduled press conference?

119
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,159
- Is it about the mayor? - Please tell us in advance.

120
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,969
- I have a question. - What's it about?

121
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,639
The mayor will come down and announce it himself.

122
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,710
Well...

123
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,110
The agenda of the emergency press conference.

124
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,450
You want to know, right, Mr. Lee?

125
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,820
The result of the prosecution's internal investigation came out.

126
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,129
But there was a real estate speculation force using...

127
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,699
undisclosed internal data...

128
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,500
in the New Seoul Town District.

129
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,730
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

130
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,739
(Land Register, Soosaek District, Eunpyeong-Gu Office, Seoul)

131
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
(Land Register)

132
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,008
You see, the family members...

133
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,819
of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's wife...

134
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,620
appeared on that list.

135
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,789
The mayor is involved in a corruption scandal.

136
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,129
What was that? Oh, the press conference.

137
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,899
Let him hold one numerous times.

138
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,210
Do you think Chang Je has any power?

139
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,610
If Miracle's majority shareholder giving money to Mayor Choi...

140
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
turns out to be Chairman Jin's youngest grandson,

141
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,250
it's a different story.

142
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,059
The daughter-in-law was immersed in land speculation,

143
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,559
using private internal information.

144
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,629
The youngest grandson committed a shameless act of bribing...

145
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,369
the son-in-law, the mayor of Seoul, to win...

146
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,870
a development project on that land.

147
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:15,139
People will believe the mastermind was Soonyang Group's chairman,

148
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,639
Jin Yang Cheol.

149
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,490
To the government that needs...

150
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,860
to revitalize real estate policies as an economic stimulus,

151
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,330
Soonyang will become the guinea pig they'll punish.

152
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,769
You might never get another chance...

153
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,639
in Gangnam reconstruction projects...

154
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,509
or various government led construction projects.

155
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,980
Are you still...

156
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,990
going to indict CEO Oh for offering bribes?

157
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,638
To deal with real estate speculators...

158
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,710
using undisclosed data, the Seoul Metropolitan Government...

159
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,408
excluded Soosaek District and only chose Sangam District...

160
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:28,408
as New Seoul Town's development district target.

161
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,678
Are you not revealing the list of real estate speculators?

162
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,548
Is it true a high ranking society member was involved in it?

163
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,918
- Please answer the question. - We want a statement.

164
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,860
I, Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je, will promise you.

165
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,490
I will fulfill my responsibility...

166
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,159
so that the homeless common people...

167
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,529
no longer shed tears because of real estate speculators.

168
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,070
Both investigations on Mayor Choi's bribery scandal...

169
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,878
and the real estate speculation...

170
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,440
of Vice-Chairman's wife's family...

171
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,580
were closed without charges.

172
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,029
Tell me who.

173
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,730
You see...

174
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,370
My parents...

175
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,069
My family...

176
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,240
Are you even...

177
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,870
lying to me?

178
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:31,809
Father.

179
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,009
Your family?

180
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,980
You know what?

181
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,918
Who do you think can make...

182
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,018
300 million dollars in cash with just a phone call...

183
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,960
in Korea right now?

184
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,759
Excuse me?

185
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,200
Not me nor Daeyoung Group's Ju Yeong Il.

186
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,700
The financer of Myeong-dong private loan market, Son Ho Chun.

187
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,799
Your father.

188
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,600
My in-law.

189
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,009
The world is a nasty place, no?

190
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,678
Those who need urgent money...

191
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,308
suck up to your father. But behind his back,

192
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,649
they point fingers at him for being a loan shark.

193
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,049
Even so,

194
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,749
there's one thing your father never does.

195
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,820
Do you know what that is?

196
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,859
The only way he makes money is by lending money.

197
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,529
He never look elsewhere. Why?

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,070
Because that's the financer Son Ho Chun's honour and pride.

199
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,969
You're his daughter.

200
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,370
How come you know so little about him?

201
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,210
Who was it?

202
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,548
Who was it that egged you on...

203
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,179
to use your family names to speculate these lands? Tell me.

204
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,250
Tell me who it was!

205
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,230
(Sangam and Soosaek District Development Plan)

206
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,340
Grandfather is in the second floor study, right?

207
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,739
Why do you ask?

208
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,109
I have something to tell him.

209
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,279
Gosh, not now.

210
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,149
I don't know what it's about, but do it later.

211
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,349
After telling your mother off,

212
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,019
he summoned your father.

213
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,090
If you get dragged in for no reason,

214
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,389
I will be too upset to do anything.

215
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,799
It's all my fault, Father.

216
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,440
I had this burning desire...

217
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,070
to make up for the loss caused...

218
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,610
when acquiring Hando Steel and couldn't stop myself.

219
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,809
Was that the only solution you could think of?

220
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,889
Don't you know what the world is like today?

221
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,220
What are you? A pheasant's baby?

222
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,759
Did you think nobody would know if you kept your head down?

223
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,200
Enough. Get up now.

224
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,769
A man shouldn't go down on his knees so quickly.

225
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,779
Here.

226
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,289
It might rain, Father.

227
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,359
You know, right?

228
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,759
That my knees are more accurate than the weather center.

229
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,759
You should bundle up...

230
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,029
when you leave for work tomorrow.

231
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,670
It will be tough on you for a while if your asthma relapses.

232
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,739
I'm here, Uncle.

233
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,680
Gosh, my youngest nephew.

234
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,150
I'm glad I listened to you and came up with a plan.

235
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,220
But how did you think of it at such a young age?

236
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,019
Well, not everyone can become a majority shareholder of Miracle.

237
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,029
It's just an investment as a way of studying.

238
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,230
If you're interested in business, why not join Soonyang?

239
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,369
You know my family situation.

240
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,670
Grandfather excluded me from the succession order.

241
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,239
Really, he's an impossible man.

242
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,809
Once he loses trust in someone, he sees the end of them.

243
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,149
Geez. He'll try to drag me down...

244
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,679
throughout my term.

245
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,779
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

246
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,650
It worries me.

247
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,619
Then...

248
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,589
soar high enough so he can't drag you down.

249
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,230
Me, who doesn't even have a base in the party?

250
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,630
How high can I go up?

251
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,440
To the highest end with the support of the people.

252
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,940
If 7,000 houses are supplied...

253
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,450
through the New Seoul Town project,

254
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,250
it will be a great help to solve the real estate problem.

255
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,890
What's more, DMC Construction...

256
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,059
is the symbol of advanced technology and business.

257
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,989
If the mayor of Seoul...

258
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,489
solves the problem of people's livelihoods...

259
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,089
and has a vision for the future,

260
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,559
where else should he advance to...

261
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,529
other than the Blue House?

262
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,369
Do Jun.

263
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,710
New Seoul Town and DMC.

264
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,910
Presidential candidate Choi Chang Je.

265
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,380
It'll become your biggest achievement, Uncle.

266
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,460
Mayor Choi Chang Je is going to become the president?

267
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,759
Do you really think he'll become a presidential candidate?

268
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,900
It's like I prescribed him a sedative.

269
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,640
Mayor Choi.

270
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,508
This was the first time he won...

271
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:03,710
against those he feared.

272
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,380
He must feel as anxious as his sense of achievement.

273
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,149
I had to blind him with a greater ambition...

274
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,210
to get rid of that fear.

275
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,920
We need to use him as our man...

276
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,819
until the completion of DMC.

277
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,630
Here.

278
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,829
Instead of tofu, since you're from the US.

279
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,740
Be honest with me.

280
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,269
You're not 22, right?

281
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,578
If I rip off that good looking mask,

282
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,710
maybe I'll find a 40-year-old man inside you.

283
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,579
Or is this your second life?

284
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,849
Tell me which one it is.

285
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,130
You said partners must be honest with each other.

286
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,960
It's both of them.

287
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,500
Stop bluffing.

288
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,839
Forget it. You're in your 20s.

289
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,549
Why did you do it?

290
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,220
The land in Soosaek District...

291
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,150
- was my... - Your grandfather.

292
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,390
He will forgive me.

293
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,670
But not you.

294
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,509
Be very careful not to do anything...

295
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,410
that'll make you lose your grandfather's trust.

296
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:49,849
You know what I mean, don't you?

297
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,519
The only asset I have...

298
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,819
is you.

299
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,630
The house and company...

300
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,230
are your grandfather's.

301
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,569
But I...

302
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,400
only have you.

303
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,079
The eldest grandson of this family.

304
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,519
It's raining, Seong Jun.

305
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,329
The sky is so fickle.

306
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,140
It's so hard to get along with.

307
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,440
My sin...

308
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,880
runs deep.

309
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,920
In this whole world,

310
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,900
the only father who made his son live a sentence...

311
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,269
and turned him into a cripple was me.

312
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,480
What should be blamed...

313
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,549
is that period.

314
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,389
During the military regime, someone had to take responsibility...

315
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,159
so long as Soonyang was the target.

316
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,289
You simply...

317
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,599
did your utmost best to protect the group...

318
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,099
by offering Soonyang Transportation.

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,639
I will make sure...

320
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,109
word doesn't travel outside regarding Do Jun's matter.

321
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,349
Why?

322
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:11,589
Have I lost face even in your eyes, Hang Jae?

323
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,029
(Soonyang Group)

324
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:25,970
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

325
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,109
Your children will never succeed...

326
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,640
Soonyang.

327
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,909
Let me help you, Mother.

328
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,979
I can finish it on my own in no time.

329
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,048
I know what to do. Look.

330
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,119
Snap. Like that.

331
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,920
Thanks to your great family love,

332
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,230
I lost my beloved family.

333
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,099
Now,

334
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,210
I have become incapable of returning to my family.

335
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,279
I will never allow...

336
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,450
your children to share Soonyang...

337
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,660
happily and at peace.

338
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,259
This is the real reason...

339
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm trying to buy Soonyang.

(Soonyang Hospital)

341
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,979
If you don't have any plans in the afternoon,

342
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,079
I'll prepare several checkups since you've come all the way here.

343
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Why?

344
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,390
Did you purchase a new piece of expensive equipment?

345
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,420
Excuse me?

346
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,889
- Mr. Lee. - Yes?

347
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,230
Give Director Jung a bonus.

348
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,490
Gosh. You're good at business.

349
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,829
And with a rich old man to boot.

350
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,369
In that case, please give me an envelope full of money.

351
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,410
But I'm not here as the head of the group today.

352
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,440
Not as a patient, either.

353
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,349
I came as a guardian.

354
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,220
He's so weak.

355
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,130
Will he be able to act as a proper chairman after I die?

356
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm worried.

357
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,240
From what you see,

358
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,069
is Vice-Chairman Jin the son who resembles you the most?

359
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:50,379
I thought you were handing over your position to the son...

360
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,380
who took after you the most in the end.

361
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,819
Are you going to...

362
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,189
stick to primogeniture until the end?

363
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,250
Who is it?

364
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,390
The one who resembles me.

365
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,369
Is there even one who does?

366
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,269
Even if there is one,

367
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,970
my children won't accept it.

368
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,009
They will torture and fight each other...

369
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,180
until their last breath.

370
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,519
Isn't that a fiery pit?

371
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,690
The fiery pit is for me to go to after my death...

372
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,329
and not my living children.

373
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,538
Oh, right. When is the meeting...

374
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,039
with the presidents of the subsidiary companies?

375
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,109
It's at 3pm. Do you have something else to do?

376
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,809
Yes, I do.

377
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,990
Father. What brings you here?

378
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,660
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

379
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Sorry?

380
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,230
When you married someone I disapproved.

381
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,939
When you jumped into the movie industry...

382
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,339
instead of the family business.

383
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,009
Do you know remember what you told me?

384
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,349
"I will live as a person who has nothing to do with Soonyang."

385
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
That was my promise.

386
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:32,680
Then why?

387
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,980
Why?

388
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Why are you breaking it now?

389
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,529
At least you know how shameless you are.

390
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,160
You're using your son rather than involving yourself.

391
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,569
What are you talking about, Father?

392
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,299
Your son, Do Jin.

393
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,710
He declared he was going to buy Soonyang.

394

What?

Is that not enough?

403

You barely know your own son, don't you?

404
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:38,779
I'm scared.

405
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:42,019
Scared that I might become a father like you.

406
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,759
The one who had abandoned me and left Soonyang...

407
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,099
was you, Yoon Ki.

408

411
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,890
made Father speechless.

412
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,869
You should read this.

413
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,609
You have such poor political sense.

Are you sure you can even be re-elected?

What?

He gave Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation to Yoon Ki's family.

417

Do you know what this means?

418
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,419
That's for the medical center and HR Development Center.

419
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,589
It's not worth much.

Why did he do that?

444
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,230
Why? Why all of a sudden?

445
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,410
As soon as he secured enough money for the succession.

No.

448

You're right.

make you very upset?

Wait.

502
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,210
What's the reason?

503
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,249
A big advertiser demanded...

504
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,780
that they withdraw.

505
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,189
Or else, they would stop all ads from their affiliates...

506
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,260
and even production support.

507
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,219
An advertiser?

508
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,589
If they're getting their affiliates involved,

509
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,260
it means they're a big conglomerate.

510
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,839
All cable channels and film studios...

511
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,768
that were planning to move into DMC decided...

512
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,909
to retract the plan.

513
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,479
I heard media related academic organizations...

514
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,650
were going to move in as well.

515
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,679
They are scholars who only study.

516
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,150
How did you persuade them?

517
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,549
I promised them industry academic cooperation, research grant,

518
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,150
and overseas training.

519
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,889
Okay.

520
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,059
Supporting academics is a way for a company...

521
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,929
to contribute to society as well.

522
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,300
- I will remember that. - Good.

523
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,299
Goodness, DMC is going to end...

524
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,840
even before they start the construction.

525
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,280
What should we do?

526
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,879
It's your uncle's first business...

527
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,179
after he became the mayor.

528
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,280
I'll meet him.

529
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,820
- Will you? - Yes.

530
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,420
Families help each other when they're in trouble.

531
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:06,730
Seong Jun,

532
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,000
how are things going with her?

533
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,440
The daughter of Hyunsung Daily's CEO.

534
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,469
Why isn't there any news about your marriage?

535
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,110
Do you guys not get along?

536
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,150
No, Grandfather.

537
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:25,980
We're seeing each other well.

538
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,550
Is that so?

539
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,049
A man who manages his family well...

540
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,860
does business well too.

541
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,030
My eldest grandson is all grown up.

542
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:39,460
Okay.

543
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,239
What do you think, Hang Jae?

544
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,739
It will serve as a strong warning to Do Jun.

545
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,280
If the DMC project doesn't work out,

546
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,549
Miracle Investment will suffer a heavy blow...

547
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,848
because they spent a lot on the initial investment.

548
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,550
I mean Seong Jun.

549
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,349
My eldest grandson.

550
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,920
He was better than the CEOs of the affiliates.

551
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,389
He catches on quickly...

552
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,659
to the hidden meaning of your words.

553
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,670
Thank goodness...

554
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,199
that Young Ki has...

555
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,409
a smart son like Seong Jun.

556
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,539
- Really? - Yes.

557
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,449
Chairman Jin is taking Seong Jun with him?

558
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,019
According to the Secretary's Office, that is right.

559
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,260
Call Seong Jun's office.

560
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
I should eat with him.

561
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,530
Well...

562
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,428
Wouldn't it be better for him to position himself...

563
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:50,429
as Chairman Jin's grandson rather than your son?

564
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,339
"Chairman Jin started teaching his favourite grandson..."

565
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,109
"for him to succeed his place." This kind of an image.

566
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,909
So I can't even call my son as it is?

567
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,610
I'm sorry. I acted out of line.

568
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,090
Human Resource Department.

569
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,889
Kim Ju Ryeon of Secretary's Office.

570
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:21,829
Change his post right now.

571
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,940
A deputy manager-level secretary dedicated to Vice-Chairman.

572
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,480
Thank you, sir!

573
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,550
I'll pledge my allegiance to you.

574
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,280
Is this really Korea?

575
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,420
Not the Republic of Soonyang?

576
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,419
How can they give up on moving into DMC...

577
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,218
with just one word from Soonyang?

578
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,960
Cable channels , film studios, and even academic organizations.

579
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,389
It's not one word. It's money.

580
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,259
There are only 830,000 paid subscribers...

581
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,599
of cable channels.

582
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,799
The advertising industry died out because of the IMF crisis.

583
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,800
An advertiser like Soonyang is like their king.

584
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,239
You need to listen to your king to be saved, no?

585
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,238
Not to mention film studios which Soonyang can interfere...

586
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,980
with investment and distribution.

587
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,109
Soonyang's money is spread all around Korea...

588
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,280
like blood vessels.

589
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,719
That's how Soonyang can move Korea.

590
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,888
Why is high and mighty Soonyang interfering...

591
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,989
with a trivial matter like moving into DMC?

592
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,730
He answered...

593
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,030
to my declaration of war.

594
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,980
It's Mayor Choi Chang Je.

595
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Hello.

596
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:49,448
Is it true?

597
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,549
(Digital Media City)

598
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,049
I heard all the broadcasting stations...

599
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,618
and media-related companies...

600
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,189
that were supposed to move into DMC...

601
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,489
withdrew their plan.

602
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,460
Are you going to give up on DMC, which is the landmark...

603
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,130
of New Seoul Town?

604
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,440
The DMC project won't fall through.

605
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,400
Digital Media Center is a future business...

606
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,210
that Miracle Investment is conducting with confidence.

607
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,308
We're planning to look...

608
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,849
for other broadcasting stations and media companies...

609
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,650
who wish to move in before the construction starts.

610
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,590
Keep your word.

611
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,519
I'll keep my word with Seoul's citizens.

612
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,090
If there isn't any broadcasting station...

613
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,229
willing to move in before the construction starts,

614
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm going to hand over the DMC business to another company.

615
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,500
To a construction company bigger and more powerful...

616
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,070
than Miracle Investment.

617
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:49,279
You're the one who taught me...

618
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,780
what the DMC project means...

619
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,349
to Choi Chang Je, the mayor of Seoul.

620
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,820
Please do a good job. I'm hanging up.

621
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,159
What did Mayor Choi say?

622
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,929
He taught me...

623
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,329
why Soonyang interfered so hard with the companies moving into DMC.

624
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,409
Mayor Choi is planning...

625
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,980
to hand over the DMC project to Soonyang.

626
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,110
The New Seoul Town project...

627
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,280
comes back to the company it belongs to, Uncle.

628
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,320
I should give you a boost...

629
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,190
when I have the power.

630
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,819
Once the DMC project becomes successful,

631
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,230
your position in the company will become more solid.

632
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,759
"Jin Seong Jun didn't get the post just for being Chairman's grandson."

633
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,599
Let's show them. Yes?

634
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,869
I understand why Grandfather was against it.

635
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,079
I guess everyone becomes like this when they're drunk in power.

636
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,679
What?

637
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,349
You can't tell what situation you're in now, can you?

638
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,719
No.

639
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:04,690
It's not you but I...

640
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,820
and Soonyang...

641
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,530
that have your life in our hands, Mayor Choi Chang Je.

642
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,300
Nephew.

643
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,598
New Seoul Town project was dirtied...

644
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,769
with real estate speculation from the start.

645
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:22,569
Imagine the DMC project worth almost five billion dollars...

646
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,570
falling through.

647
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,979
Won't you end up as a Seoul mayor who became a lame duck...

648
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,780
as soon as your term started?

649
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I...

650
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:34,820
Grandfather is giving you one more chance.

651
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:37,949
Because you're his family.

652
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:49,769
If you need the power of Soonyang, don't hesitate to ask.

653
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,929
Come to Jeongsimjae to ask.

654
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,469
As you always did.

655
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,150
You'll buy Soonyang? With your money?

656
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,519
Do you think you can buy it with money?

657
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,190
Try it then.

658
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,300
But pay a lot for it.

659
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,210
You're drinking? You should be.

660
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,750
You're about to lose two percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

661
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,380
But don't drink so much yet.

662
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,820
You'll want to drink more after listening to this.

663
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,759
Looking for companies that can move into DMC is...

664
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,260
rather simple, actually.

665
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,488
We just need to look for broadcasting stations...

666
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,929
that can be financially independent without Soonyang's ads.

667
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,629
And what's that station?

668
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,030
There's none.

669
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,530
Seriously...

670
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,299
Stations that have enough influence to move into DMC...

671
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,170
are all managed by Soonyang.

672
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,340
It got me thinking...

673
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,980
that Digital Media City, your ambitious work,

674
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,679
might be too early for Korea as of now.

675
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:17,489
What do you mean?

676
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,889
I promised to be honest as a partner, so I'll tell you.

677
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,658
Before deciding on what to invest,

678
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:26,230
I always look at this cheat sheet.

679
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,130
A cheat sheet?

680
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,698
I don't mean complex figures with difficult names...

681
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,428
like the stock market index, economic growth rate,

682
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,569
and current account balance.

683
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,110
I look at the real economic index that can be seen at once.

684
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,349
- What is that? - Signboards.

685
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,630
Signboards are your cheat sheets?

686
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,299
You can see everything from signboards.

687
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,959
The flow of market, consumers' needs,

688
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,269
and the outlook of an industry.

689
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:06,239
So signboards, no...

690
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:11,670
So what does today's cheat sheet say?

691
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,769
Look.

692
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,379
All the new signboards on the streets...

693
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,550
are for internet cafés.

694
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,250
Does this make sense?

695
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,448
Is this truly a country that wants to become the IT powerhouse?

696
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,789
I've never seen an internet café in New York, not once.

697
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,689
Things have advanced so much,

698
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,919
so why do people still not have a computer at home...

699
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,360
that they need to go to internet cafés?

700
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,260
This is why...

701
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,360
Digital Media City won't happen.

702
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,779
("99 Pro-gamer Korea Open")

703
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,050
There's nobody to defend it now.

704
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,780
(Internet café)

705
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,780
(Internet café)

706
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:56,889
(Internet café)

707
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,400
Your cheat sheet is correct, Mr. Oh.

708
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:13,340
You can run a broadcasting station without Soonyang's ads.

709
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:19,039
It might even gain enough influence to move into DMC.

710
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:20,710
There's such a station?

711
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Where?

712
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,179
(Digital Media City)

713
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:29,349
Is E-sports even possible?

714
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,889
Game companies weren't interested in online game relay broadcasting...

715
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,760
that we offered.

716
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:38,460
Gosh.

717
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:42,500
But maybe because their target audience matches,

718
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,369
a cartoon broadcasting station is showing interest.

719
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,169
And they will actively accommodate our suggestion to minimize...

720
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,169
the profit from ads and earn...

721
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,409
from gamers' subscription fee and relay rights instead.

722
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,980
- I see. - Okay.

723
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,179
Right, one more thing. They have a condition.

724
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:04,849
Regarding the move into DMC... Miracle's D double-J.

725
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,219
They want to discuss with you, the majority shareholder.

726
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,829
- The majority shareholder? - Yes.

727
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:27,139
(Modern Gallery, Exhibition in progress)

728
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,880
Miracle Investment's majority shareholder, Jin Do Jun.

729
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,219
What's going on?

730
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,658
I'm here to meet the representative of a game company...

731
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:16,559
who will move into DMC.

732
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,090
I'm that representative.

733
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,000
My uncle has a broadcasting station that mainly airs animations.

734
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:29,539
I heard Miracle Investment was looking for a gaming channel,

735
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:31,170
so I asked him for a favour.

736
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,110
Reorganization and composition of staff.

737
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:38,679
They're all completed.

738
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,820
I'm qualified enough to be here, right?

739
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,099
Do you take after your mother?

740
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,340
You were pretty talented in acting.

741
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,750
You said you weren't interested in succeeding Soonyang.

742
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:12,808
But you're standing in front of me...

743
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,119
as the majority shareholder of Miracle Investment.

744
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,119
How did you find out?

745
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:21,860
I told you.

746
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,659
Hyunsung Daily is good at getting information.

747
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,429
Think about it.

748
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,769
The power to move public opinion.

749
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:32,698
Chairman Jin would want a lot more than that...

750
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,269
to join hands with my family.

751
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:37,309
I'm not the one...

752
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,670
he wants to marry off to you.

753
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:49,550
We're getting ready to start broadcasting channels...

754
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:51,519
for Hyunsung Daily's financial and sports magazines.

755
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,320
I already have my father's permission.

756
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,389
First, we'll move Hyunsung Daily's HQ to DMC.

757
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,159
Then we'll get ready...

758
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,159
to open the channels at DMC.

759
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,400
Then Miracle won't have any problems with the construction...

760
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,969
and parcelling out of DMC.

761
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,500
Four channels...

762
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,710
and Hyunsung Daily too?

763
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,650
Now, do you understand...

764
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,789
why you really need me?

765
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,259
What do you say?

766
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,059
I'd say it's an irresistible proposition.

767
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,650
It sure is a proposition...

768
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,420
I can't turn down.

769
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,260
(Exhibition in progress)

770
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,639
What would you like to order, sir?

771
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,110
Well...

772
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,980
Vienna coffee,

773
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,780
without cinnamon.

774
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,190
That's what Min Yeong always ordered for you. Right?

775
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,860
Is she not here today? I don't see her.

776
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:47,860
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

777
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,969
Min Yeong quit to start studying for the bar exam.

778
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,570
She said everyone in her family passed the bar while in school.

779
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:56,639
Really?

780
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:00,579
All right, then.

781
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:11,789
Here.

782
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:16,389
Oh, you can use it next time.

783
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,590
Oh...

784
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:24,070
There will be no next time.

785
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,050
What would you like...

786
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,559
Oh, do you work here part-time?

787
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,360
Like someone once told me,

788
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:59,030
I don't want to take my privileges for granted anymore, sir.

789
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,210
I thought about it, and you weren't entirely wrong.

790
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,010
I'm glad I learned the lesson before I began a career in law.

791
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,380
And for that, I'm grateful.

792
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:20,360
My gosh. You seem quite touched by what I said, sir.

793
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,089
Your name tag is upside down.

794
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,090
(Seo Min Yeong)

795
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,699
Vienna coffee, please.

796
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,738
How much is it? 1.20 dollars?

797
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,000
It's 1.20 dollars.

798
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,909
Without cinnamon, please.

799
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,940
You owe me 80 cents.

800
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,280
Yes.

801
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,730
Hello.

802
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,638
I used to work here.

803
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,400
Here's the key for the supply storage room.

804
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,969
- I forgot to return it. - I see.

805
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,039
Oh, he was here a few moments ago.

806
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,909
Why didn't you tell him that you quit?

807
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,409
He came all the way here for nothing.

808
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,980
Who? Who was here?

809
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,150
You know, the guy who always gets Vienna coffee.

810
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,320
When I told him you quit,

811
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,289
he looked like he'd just gotten dumped or something.

812
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:41,900
It sure is a proposition...

813
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,670
I can't turn down.

814
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,949
So what can I offer?

815
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:04,789
For every deal, there's a price to pay.

816
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:13,699
You know this too.

817
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,429
We'll be...

818
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,670
good partners.

819
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,539
"Good partners?"

820
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,409
So in a nutshell,

821
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:36,750
you want me to do as you say, let you keep me on a leash,

822
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,320
and obey your family's advice at all times...

823
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,519
just so you can...

824
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,929
become the granddaughter-in-law of the Soonyang family,

825
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,730
while knowing that I'm being tailed and watched by people you hired.

826
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,170
- That's... - To me,

827
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,909
it sounds like you want to own me before you own Soonyang.

828
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,780
I'm afraid I must decline your proposition, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

829
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,420
I have no interest in becoming your puppet.

830

(From Jin Seong Jun)

831
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,960
I'm waiting for the day we can meet again.

832
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,530
From Jin Seong Jun.

833
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:59,670
I didn't know I'd see it again so soon.

834
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:02,239
Your smile, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

835
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,139
We promised to meet again with smiles on our faces.

836
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,679
Today is...

837
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,719
that day, right?

838
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,089
Oh, yes!

839
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,929
Men's premium underwear!

840
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,029
A five-piece trunk set is...

841
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,059
Hyeong Jun.

842
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,368
I was wondering what you were watching. A home-shopping channel?

843
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:32,169
Do not let your guard down.

844
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,170
You startled me.

845
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,968
It'll sell out the moment you let your guard down.

846
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:38,039
A spectacular action-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

847
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,968
Coming to theaters this summer.

848
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,908
It'll surpass your imagination in every possible way.

849
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,948
A fantastic adventure movie.

850
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,079
"Home Shopping."

851
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,050
Hyeong Jun only watches shopping channels these days.

852
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,419
Hey, you don't need a lot of stuff.

853
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,090
Hey, shopping isn't about buying things you need.

854
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,429
It's all about buying things you want.

855
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,130
Do you understand, my little brother?

856
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,539
- Do Jun. - Yes.

857
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:13,539
Your father wants to speak to you about something.

858
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,320
Your grandfather was here.

859
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:33,529
Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation at Soonyang Medical Center...

860
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,900
and HR Development Center.

861
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,670
Your grandfather handed it over to us.

862
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,840
(Power of Attorney, Jin Yoon Ki)

863
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,579
It's a warning.

864
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:51,280
Your grandfather is warning us not to get greedy...

865
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,579
over Soonyang.

866
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,550
- Father... - I heard everything.

867
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,489
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a heads up.

868
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:06,760
Must you...

869
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,599
go against your grandfather's wishes?

870
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,110
I understand why you're worried.

871
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,210
You know better than anyone how scary...

872
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,710
Grandfather can be.

873
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,150
I understand that you're against it.

874
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,949
Let's do it.

875
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,219
I looked into it.

876
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:35,960
I think I can afford to acquire a cable movie channel...

877
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,730
for DMC.

878
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:40,260
Although it won't be of much help.

879
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,829
Always remember...

880
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,300
that I've got your back, Do Jun.

881
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:54,510
Honey, did you decide...

882
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,210
to give in and let Do Jun have his way?

883
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,679
Honey, it's...

884
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:02,050
You two.

885
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:04,750
Promise me.

886
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,019
Do Jun, promise me that you'll never become like...

887
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:10,260
everyone on your father's side of the family.

888
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:15,159
And you, honey. Promise me that you'll protect Do Jun.

889
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,530
So your father and siblings...

890
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,599
can't hurt our son.

891
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:53,369
The 4th son of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, 4-0.

892
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,469
His wife, 4-alpha.

893
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,739
And me,

894
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,409
Jin Do Jun.

895
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,610
They're my parents.

896
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,599
(Groom Jin Seong Jun, Bride Mo Hyeon Min)

897
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:25,369
I should get a wedding gift for my eldest grandson.

898
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,829
Is there anything you need?

899
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,900
We'll start out at Jeongsimjae,

900
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,669
so we don't need anything.

901
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,969
No, don't say that.

902
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,010
You are becoming a real adult, Seong Jun.

903
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,679
I must do something for you.

904
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:39,909
Tell me what you want.

905
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,250
Then, Grandfather.

906
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,250
Please give me the right to play a part...

907
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,960
as one of the adults in the family.

908
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,989
As one of the adults in the family? It's no big deal.

909
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,829
It's about taking responsibility.

910
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,099
If Seong Jun wishes to share the burden with us,

911
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:02,899
he should get some shares too. Right, Dong Ki?

912
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,969
Yes, sure thing.

913
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:09,539
So? Did Father say he'd give him some?

914
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,949
Of course.

915
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,980
I think he wants to announce it at the reception...

916
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,750
when the whole family is there.

917
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:19,788
Hwa Young.

918
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:23,760
Have a drink with me at the reception. It's been too long.

919
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:27,300
Sounds like it'll be a coronation ceremony, not a wedding.

920
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,730
Will Father really announce...

921
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:34,599
at the wedding that Seong Jun is next in line for the throne?

922
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:41,779
Of course, Seong Jun is his eldest grandson.

923
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,409
Your father will take great care of him.

924
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,379
All right. Don't be late.

925
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,050
I'll see you at the wedding.

926
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,960
About Seong Jun's fiancée.

927
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,288
I should ask her to visit us tomorrow.

928
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:00,800
Why? Do you already want to be an overbearing mother-in-law?

929
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,070
No, I want to be a good daughter-in-law to you.

930
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:10,000
All your paintings are too good to be just kept in this room.

931
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,569
You should have a solo show.

932
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,439
Your granddaughter-in-law runs a gallery.

933
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,848
Gosh, stop. A solo show? Please.

934
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,780
This is just a hobby.

935
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,980
Don't be so modest. You should think about it, Mother.

936
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,219
Jeong Rae, has Mr. Yang called?

937
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:29,889
He said he'd be home by lunch. How come he's not back yet?

938
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:31,530
Oh, you're right.

939
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,690
Father always calls if he's going to be home late.

940
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,209
I received a call from Jeongsimjae.

941
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:53,650
They're asking when the chairman will be home.

942
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,949
What should I tell them, sir?

943
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,260
We found...

944
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:12,369
a brain arteriovenous malformation, sir.

945
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,239
Will surgery fix it?

946
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,510
The thing is...

947
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:23,880
The location is quite risky if we were to perform surgery.

948
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,280
So I have no choice...

949
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,719
but to rely on luck.

950
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,889
Is that it?

951
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:41,760
We will do our very best to monitor it closely.

952
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,000
In my head,

953
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,670
there is a ticking time bomb...

954
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,809
waiting to go off.

955
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,989
(Reborn Rich)

956
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:18,829
As you ordered,

957
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,659
I prepared a share transfer agreement for Mr. Jin Seong Jun.

958
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,060
Sir!

959
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,698
(Share Transfer Agreement)

960
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:28,699
Don't you know whom I love the most...

961
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:30,039
out of all my children?

962
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,509
What on earth did you do?

963
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,278
The one who can make Soonyang bigger and better than I can...

964
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:36,909
will get everything.

965
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,448
That Do Jun takes after me.

966
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:42,750
Do you think that makes sense?

967
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,250
Grandfather, you were right.

968
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:48,720
I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money.

969
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,289
Do not step over the line!

970
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:54,300
You guys are different from us.

971
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,500
Don't you dare delude yourself into thinking...

972
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,100
that you can be a rightful heir.

973
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:33,069
(Reborn Rich)
