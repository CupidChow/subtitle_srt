(Reborn Rich)

2
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,959
I'll do it if you're not in a hurry.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,069
How do you feel?

4
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:37,145
Do you remember anything?

5
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:40,340
Can you remember your name?

6
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,170
You will be fine.

7
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,480
- Don't move. - Don't move.

8
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,079
- Don't move. - Stop.

9
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,719
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

10
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,740
You remember me, right?

11
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
We've met before.

12
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,439
I hope you at least remember my face...

13
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,349
because I saved you,

14
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,379
although you probably had no idea.

15
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,590
I know who you are.

16
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,159
The Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

17
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,400
Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

18
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,409
Hey, Hyeon Min.

19
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,310
Yes.

20
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,580
Sorry. Things suddenly got busy here.

21
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,460
Yes. Father?

22
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,430
You don't need to put him on the phone.

23
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,860
I'll come by and say hi when I'm back in Korea.

24
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,269
Yes. All right.

25
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
Wait, Hyeon Min.

26
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,769
Yes.

27
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,209
Can you tell Father that I'm doing well here?

28
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,910
Tell him not to worry about me.

29
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,550
Let him know that I'll make sure to visit him when I'm back.

30
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,220
Okay, all right.

31
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,269
One's your plane ticket,

32
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,909
and the other one is your emergency passport...

33
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,379
issued by the Korean consulate.

34
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,579
Check the details.

35
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,379
I'll go downstairs and find out if you're ready to be discharged.

36
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,089
Prosecutor Seo.

37
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,790
Here.

38
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,360
Thank you.

39
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,399
I've never seen that look on your face before.

40
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,009
"I will never let my guard down."

41
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,540
You looked as though you were clad in a full suit of steel armor.

42
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,709
But right now, you look like you've completely let your guard down.

43
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,579
Why? Do I make you uncomfortable?

44
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,990
Are you worried that I'd make you repay me for saving your life?

45
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,589
Don't worry.

46
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,529
I didn't do it for you. In fact, I did it for myself.

47
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,100
I really need your testimony.

48
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:13,438
That's why I reached out to the agents...

49
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,910
at the National Intelligence Service to help me track you down.

50
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,089
Thanks to them, I was able to witness the incident and save you.

51
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,459
Did you say you needed my testimony?

52
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,430
Chairman Jin Young Ki.

53
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,430
I plan to indict him for unlawful business succession.

54
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,699
Since you're the Senior Finance Manager of Soonyang Group,

55
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,910
the court will no longer be able to say there's insufficient evidence...

56
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,480
once you testify.

57
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,050
You're here to take care of things for Soonyang's paper company, right?

58
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,119
To be more accurate, you're here because of Soonyang's slush fund,

59
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,088
which was created through illegal activities...

60
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,589
such as tax evasion and diverting funds to offshore accounts.

61
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,829
That slush fund was connected to the company's succession process, right?

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,899
I thought...

63
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,970
you could only interrogate people in the interrogation room.

64
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,100
Let me rephrase my question.

65
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,810
Who was it?

66
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,810
Who? And why did someone...

67
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,379
try to kill you when you came here to withdraw the slush fund?

68
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,149
Do you know, Mr. Yoon?

69
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:42,800
Prosecutor Seo.

70
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,569
I never question the owner family's orders.

71
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,180
I can neither decline nor judge them.

72
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,779
No matter the situation... And no matter what it entails,

73
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,079
I do...

74
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,490
what I'm told to do...

75
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,759
because that's my job.

76
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,689
So how far have you gone?

77
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,269
You said you never questioned...

78
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,269
or judged the owner family's orders.

79
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,180
How far such a loyal man like you go for your master?

80
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,410
I'm curious.

81
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,220
(Reborn Rich)

82
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,320
(Final Episode)

83
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,330
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,730
Yes. Who are you?

85
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,799
We're from the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

86
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong from the Central Office.

87
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,109
He is an important witness in a case I'm investigating.

88
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,240
What is this about?

89
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,080
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo, we have a warrant for your arrest.

90
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,408
You're under arrest for embezzlement according to...

91
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,750
the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes.

92
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,119
Embezzlement?

93
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,548
We received a report that you embezzled...

94
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,889
the 700 million dollars from the sale of Soonyang Micro.

95
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,518
No way. That money was...

96
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,928
We looked into it and found the 700 million dollars...

97
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,629
in your personal bank account.

98
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,399
May I see the warrant?

99
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,700
(Arrest Warrant, Yoon Hyeon Woo)

100
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,210
Darn it.

101
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,779
Get him!

102
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,990
It's that way.

103
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,480
Excuse me, sir. May I borrow your phone?

104
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,679
Hyeon Woo, where are you?

105
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,120
Do you know who's here now?

106
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,899
They said they were from Soonyang. The internal affairs department.

107
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,668
They told me you embezzled some kind of company fund...

108
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,570
and that there was an arrest warrant issued against you.

109
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,940
What is going on?

110
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,909
Hyeon Min.

111
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,409
I need your help.

112
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,789
Wait! My goodness.

113
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,159
Here. Oh, dear.

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,028
It's pouring.

115
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,539
Mr. Yoon. If you hear from your son tomorrow,

116
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,710
you have to call us right away.

117
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,469
He should talk to the company before the prosecutors get to him.

118
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,580
That way, we can help him avoid criminal punishment.

119
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,549
I feel bad that you're doing all this to help my son.

120
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,389
I apologize. I'm really sorry.

121
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,059
Please put in a good word for him when you're back at the office.

122
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,329
My son would never touch the company's money,

123
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,428
and such a huge amount at that.

124
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,500
You see, my son...

125
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,029
When all his peers were busy studying,

126
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,798
he had to be the breadwinner in the family...

127
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,539
instead of me, his incompetent father.

128
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,740
If he was capable of being selfish and greedy,

129
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,349
he would've run away a long time ago.

130
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,949
Mr. Yoon, we already told you everything.

131
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,819
The evidence must be false. My son would never do such a thing.

132
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,758
I swear, Hyeon Woo would never do such a thing.

133
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,089
Wait, please help him.

134
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,429
- Put in a good word for him. - Goodness.

135
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,259
Please put in a good word for him.

136
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,559
Please.

137
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,870
Please help him.

138
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,299
Please, I beg you.

139
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Please help him.

140
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,350
Father.

141
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,129
Why are you standing in the rain? What if you catch a cold?

142
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,129
Oh, I was... I'm sorry.

143
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,600
Hyeon Woo.

144
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,139
Here's what you asked for.

145
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
And...

146
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,279
You should take my phone. You'll need a phone.

147
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,220
Okay, thanks.

148
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,350
Father.

149
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,220
Don't bow to others because of me.

150
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,399
I have to go, Father.

151
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,970
Bye.

152
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,159
Good work today.

153
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,379
Mr. Yoon.

154
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,049
What are you doing here?

155
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Mr. Kim.

156
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,519
I must right the wrong.

157
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,860
Life is such an interesting game.

158
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,730
You can never predict anything.

159
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,628
When Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun ditched me...

160
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,769
and chose you,

161
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,038
I thought you'd end up becoming...

162
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,539
Soonyang Group's very first executive without a college degree.

163
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,039
What...

164
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,679
did I do wrong?

165
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,419
I went there to withdraw the slush fund...

166
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,620
as per Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's orders,

167
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,529
and I faithfully carried out the orders.

168
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,830
So why...

169
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,330
Why did I nearly get killed like that?

170
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,639
I've been racking my brain, but I really don't understand.

171
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,710
You, Mr. Yoon...

172
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,679
Shouldn't you know better by now?

173
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,549
You still don't know what the Soonyang family is capable of?

174
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,029
(Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun)

175
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,829
("Model Case of Business Succession Strictly Abiding by Law")

176
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,370
I bet they wanted to conceal the illegal slush fund.

177
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,100
They can certainly hide it if you're gone, you know.

178
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,408
Then Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun can say that...

179
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,308
he inherited Soonyang in a lawful, transparent manner...

180
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,080
as he proclaimed...

181
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,679
and deceive the world.

182
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,460
The truth is,

183
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,758
you weren't sent there...

184
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,559
to collect the slush fund as the company's Senior Finance Manager.

185
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,070
You were sent there as the owner family's butler...

186
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,200
and as the Jin family's servant...

187
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,440
to take the fall for the illegal fund of 700 million dollars.

188
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,879
That's why Vice-Chairman Jin needed you.

189
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,049
That was the only reason.

190
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,820
That's why I need you to fix it.

191
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,759
If only I hadn't met you 20 years ago,

192
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,330
I wouldn't have come this far.

193
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,509
You brought this upon yourself.

194
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,878
If you never told Vice-Chairman Jin...

195
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,950
about the Soonyang Micro ledger,

196
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,789
we wouldn't be talking here like this now.

197
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,069
I suggest you just give up.

198
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,599
If Jin Seong Jun is the one you're going up against,

199
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,140
you won't get your revenge.

200
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,910
After all, revenge isn't for those who have been wronged.

201
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,049
Only those with power can take revenge.

202
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,420
Who's here at this hour?

203
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,819
The door is open. Come on in.

204
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,230
Sir, what's the matter?

205
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,670
Go that way.

206
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,670
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

207
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,068
The suspect in the Soonyang Corporation embezzlement case,

208
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,339
Yoon Hyeon Woo.

209
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,940
We've put out an APB on him...

210
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,549
but haven't been able to track him down yet.

211
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,720
He embezzled 700 million dollars,

212
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,849
so he'll rot in jail for at least 20 years.

213
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,689
What do you mean?

214
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,389
He pocketed 700 million dollars, so...

215
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,130
No, I'm asking you about the 700 million dollars.

216
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,130
Why are you saying Yoon Hyeon Woo pocketed the money?

217
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,399
He sent the money from the sale of the paper company...

218
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
to his own account and withdrew the whole thing in cash.

219
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,528
Are you sure?

220
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,140
All embezzlers conceal the money they took.

221
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,480
The Eastern Office is convinced that he embezzled the money.

222
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,940
Why would he run away if he's got nothing to hide?

223
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,509
- Get going first. - All right.

224
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,589
Yes, Seo Min Yeong speaking.

225
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,890
I'm here to turn myself in.

226
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:48,670
You said you wanted to indict Chairman Jin Young Ki and his son.

227
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,999
They set up an illegal slush fund...

228
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,839
through Soonyang Micro.

229
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,069
I'm here to submit evidence to back it up.

230
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,410
You came too late.

231
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:02,210
You're a suspect now.

232
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,980
You're suspected of embezzling that slush fund.

233
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,549
So do you think it can serve as evidence?

234
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,950
That money.

235
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,960
To whom did you send it?

236
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,289
You withdrew the 700 million dollars in cash.

237
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,029
Had I taken that money,

238
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,368
I wouldn't have come here voluntarily,

239
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,039
knowing the risks.

240
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,980
At the hospital, you asked me...

241
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,809
who tried to kill me, why they did it,

242
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,180
and if I knew how it was connected to the slush fund.

243
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,859
The person who needed the 700 million dollars...

244
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,359
without the name, Soonyang Micro.

245
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,500
To siphon off the money,

246
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,299
that person ordered Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min to kill me.

247
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,740
Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min? I suppose he works for Soonyang.

248
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,910
Then first,

249
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,179
let's find him.

250
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,278
This is an attempted murder case, not an embezzlement case.

251
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,819
And you're the victim, not a suspect.

252
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,789
Is that why you're here? Because you feel wronged?

253
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,789
No.

254
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,099
I'm here because I need power.

255
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,230
Someone told me...

256
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,598
that revenge is for those with power,

257
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,039
not those who have been wronged.

258
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,220
I just sent you a detailed statement...

259
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,519
for the slush fund, which I had backed up to the cloud.

260
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,440
I also sent you the files on everything I've worked on...

261
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,170
at Soonyang, including the ones for owner risk management.

262
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,950
I've done everything I could.

263
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,349
"It's all on you now."

264
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,349
"Let's see how far you can go."

265
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,650
That's what your face is telling me now.

266
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,430
I don't doubt that you can pull it off.

267
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,700
I know very well that you're Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

268
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,309
I heard the security team was called to your house last night.

269
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,250
I was just about to bring it up.

270
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,818
You beat me to it.

271
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,849
I was one step behind.

272
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,490
I heard it was the employee they'd sent to collect the slush fund.

273
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,058
I also heard Internal Affairs reported him...

274
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,829
for embezzling the fund.

275
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:04,829
Would it be okay...

276
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,329
if your sources reported these things to me first?

277
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,000
Now that you've changed lanes,

278
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,470
it's time to pick up the pace.

279
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,508
When that happened last night,

280
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,779
you should've called me instead of Soonyang's security team.

281
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,779
I bet that employee is Seong Jun's Achilles' heel.

282
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,220
We should've won him over to our side.

283
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,250
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,890
Before the shareholders' meeting takes place,

285
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,660
we must get Seong Jun ousted no matter what.

286
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,960
Only then will I get an opportunity.

287
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,599
Do not forget what I said.

288
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,250
She's working very hard, isn't she?

289
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,029
I'm sure you heard everything,

290
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,869
but Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo came to see me last night.

291
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:23,339
It sounded like he went through a rough patch overseas.

292
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,579
I think he nearly died.

293
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,680
Seeing him,

294
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,950
I was vividly reminded of what happened 20 years ago.

295
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,420
Do you remember, sir?

296
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,858
The youngest grandson of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

297
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,859
A third-generation member of the Soonyang Group family.

298
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:48,500
He suddenly died a few days before his inauguration ceremony,

299
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,298
but no one...

300
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,609
even talked about that incident,

301
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,440
because I...

302
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,380
took care of everything.

303
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,319
Next time,

304
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,359
you can give me these updates in my office, Mr. Kim.

305
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,449
Thank you.

306
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,519
I got a lot of work done while you were asleep.

307
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,190
Pick one. Which one do you want to hear first?

308
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,759
Good news or bad news?

309
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,960
Let's hear the bad news first.

310
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,460
I suppose you're an optimist.

311
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,400
You seem confident that you can take care of it.

312
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,529
Okay, what do you need me to take care of?

313
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,140
Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min has already fled the country.

314
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,809
So as for who's behind him and where the 700 million dollars is,

315
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,409
we can't track down either of them at the moment.

316
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,609
In other words,

317
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:44,480
I won't be able to get the embezzlement charges dropped...

318
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,880
or get the APB lifted.

319
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,619
You're quite impatient.

320
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,859
You haven't heard the good news yet.

321
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,890
Your embezzlement case.

322
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,230
I'm the prosecutor in charge of the case now.

323
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,799
I went through the files on owner risk management.

324
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,739
I'd guessed that would be the case,

325
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,368
but the prosecutor at the Eastern Office...

326
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,910
had received the Soonyang scholarship.

327
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,240
We're not concerned that you'd try to flee or destroy evidence.

328
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,279
And you've been cooperative,

329
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,849
so we'll investigate the case without keeping you in custody.

330
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,789
The APB on you has been lifted.

331
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,460
Unless there's another evidence that you indeed embezzled the money,

332
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,190
the charges will be dropped due to lack of evidence.

333
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,699
Oh, as for Soonyang Micro's slush fund of 700 million dollars,

334
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,670
I'll continue to investigate to track down the money.

335
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,038
You said I was Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

336
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,039
I should live up to my reputation.

337
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,579
You can go home now.

338
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,109
I'll contact you if I need to interview you as a witness.

339
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,589
Go home and get some rest. Don't think about anything.

340
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,019
It'll take some time for you to fully recover.

341
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,900
A trainee gave me this as a gift on his last day here.

342
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,009
I hear music enthusiasts listen to this vinyl record these days.

343
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,710
I was a huge fan.

344
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,779
Were you a fan too? Since the release of "I Know?"

345
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,589
Someone I know was a fan.

346
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,789
The woman I loved.

347
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,029
She was a huge fan.

348
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,769
I expected no less...

349
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,970
because this is what I used to do at Soonyang.

350
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,809
(Visitors)

351
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,349
They want me...

352
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,880
to get scared and keep my lips sealed.

353
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,970
I spent a week in the hospital as Yoon Hyeon Woo.

354
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,329
I lived as Jin Do Jun for 17 years.

355
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,880
Was it a dream?

356
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Or was I possessed?

357
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,950
Or did I travel in time all by myself?

358
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,119
I still haven't found the answer.

359
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,720
Is it my sole responsibility to remember...

360
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,529
this graphic past life?

361
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Here's...

362
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,499
(Economist)

363
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,000
someone I want to ask.

364
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,109
Director, you have a guest.

365
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,609
He's from Soonyang.

366
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,359
You're from Soonyang?

367
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,599
It's been ten years.

368
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,068
Ten years since I sold all of my Soonyang shares...

369
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,769
and moved into this forest.

370
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,900
Why did I do that?

371
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,139
So I wouldn't see Soonyang buildings...

372
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,440
or use things made by Soonyang in my life.

373
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,410
But...

374
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,049
you're polluting it all, Soonyang Man.

375
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,690
Must I...

376
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,619
put up with it?

377
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,690
I wouldn't be able to, Mr. Oh.

378
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,569
I'm a former Soonyang Man...

379
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,939
who got shot in the head...

380
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,670
while running the owner's slush fund errand.

381
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,349
These are Midtown Donuts.

382
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,190
Get it out of my sight.

383
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,358
Better yet, just throw them away.

384
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,359
Okay.

385
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,730
I never thought you'd hate it.

386
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,999
Someone I know loves the donuts from here.

387
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,900
Then why did you come to see me and not them?

388
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,769
Because I wanted to know.

389
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,609
The real reason you left Miracle.

390
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,150
Do you think...

391
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,849
Korea Discount disappeared?

392
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,180
No, not at all.

393
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,220
This country is hopeless.

394
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,759
Then why are you here?

395
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,000
"It is time for Korea Discount to disappear from the market."

396
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,900
"Miracle Investment will move up that day."

397
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,500
I remember those words were yours.

398
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,269
But you were the one who had disappeared.

399
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,880
An outstanding value investor leading a vulture fund,

400
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,240
CEO Oh Se Hyeon.

401
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,509
If you think you know who I am after reading...

402
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,819
several books of mine, you are wrong.

403
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,288
The one who had talked big about...

404
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,990
knowing all about Korea's market after writing several books was you.

405
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,299
That is why you've been hiding in this arboretum for years.

406
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,160
What did you say?

407
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,099
You're scared the world will find out...

408
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,500
that the value investment theory...

409
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:25,979
you claimed was actually you behaving as a New Yorker...

410
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,640
who didn't fit in the Korean market.

411
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,519
But most of all, you're scared it'll be proven...

412
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,420
with money and income.

413
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,589
That is why you're hiding.

414
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:45,799
And while using your partner's death as the pretext.

415
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:54,400
Nobody will know you have failed if you live while hiding...

416
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,880
among these trees for the rest of your life.

417
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,550
Wait. Didn't you want me to get rid of it earlier?

418
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,889
Whatever.

419
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,118
What was I supposed to do?

420
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,889
The smell of it was enough to make me start drooling.

421
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,559
You asked why I was hiding in this arboretum.

422
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,800
It was to find a way not to watch...

423
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,469
the disgusting and nasty siblings fight for the management right.

424
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,610
If there isn't any management right,

425
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,809
there won't be a fight.

426
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,179
I almost lost my life in the owner's succession fight.

427
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,320
It's my turn now.

428
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,190
The management right they're holding on for dear life.

429
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,960
I'll make sure they let go of it this time.

430
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
How?

431
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,360
I have you, Mr. Oh.

432
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,940
Please prove my idea into numbers.

433
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,070
Accurate data...

434
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,070
for investment.

435
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,010
You.

436
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,150
Who are you?

437
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,519
Happy birthday dear Mom

438
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,929
Happy birthday to you

439
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,230
Happy birthday, Mom.

440
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,239
Let's only put two candles on the birthday cake.

441
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,638
Because, Mom,

442
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,579
your face looks like you're still in your late 20s.

443
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:45,179
Forget about the candles.

444
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm a mom who's outliving her son.

445
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,449
It's not a day to celebrate.

446
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:54,658
I was in a hurry and couldn't buy a bouquet.

447
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,690
Wait a second.

448
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,109
It's your birthday. I couldn't possibly ignore it.

449
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,239
After all this time?

450
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,210
When I warned you that your family was dangerous...

451
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,110
and begged you to protect Do Jun,

452
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,050
you ignored it.

453
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,050
That was why Do Jun...

454
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,719
You're right. It's all my fault.

455
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,829
- But honey... - Look.

456
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,800
You're still a coward.

457
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,828
You know why and who caused Do Jun's accident,

458
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,230
don't you?

459
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,598
Using our young Do Jun...

460
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,969
and stepping foot inside Jeongsimjae...

461
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,539
was all because of your greed for Soonyang.

462
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,050
You stole...

463
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,320
Do Jun away from me.

464
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:19,380
Yes, I am Lee Hae In.

465
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,250
Who are you again?

466
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,719
From what I know,

467
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,050
Do Jun left his Soonyang shares with you.

468
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,960
Three percent of the corporation's shares.

469
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,699
I heard you stepped down from your position.

470
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,299
I'm sure you came to secure my shares...

471
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,169
as a friendly share...

472
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,239
with the shareholders' meeting just around the corner.

473
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:53,979
So whose side are you on?

474
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm...

475
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,050
on Do Jun's side.

476
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm one of his people, aren't I?

477
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm planning...

478
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,320
to find a new owner for Soonyang.

479
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:12,829
Your shares and voting rights.

480
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,558
It's time to use them properly.

481
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,699
Is that even possible?

482
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,268
Think about the shares...

483
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,900
Chairman Jin Young Ki and his son has.

484
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,639
Mine aren't a match to theirs.

485
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,840
- Come over here. - Okay.

486
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,809
(Depriving Soonyang Owner Family's Management Rights)

487
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,809
Under the current law, everything is fine.

488
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,079
You're right. This is...

489
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,119
what you are talking about, right?

490
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,419
Instead of the board of directors...

491
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,889
dominated by the Soonyang owner's family,

492
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,658
we will convene a shareholders' meeting...

493
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,360
through the minority shareholders' solidarity conference.

494
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,899
Due to their nature, minority shareholders...

495
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,569
are not interested in...

496
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,070
equity structure or voting rights.

497
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,439
We will select a provocative agenda to suit...

498
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,340
the interests of the minority shareholders...

499
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,369
who are extremely sensitive to stock revenue.

500
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,238
"While Soonyang owner's family saved billions of dollars..."

501
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,909
"in inheritance tax,"

502
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,710
"how much did I lose from Soonyang's stocks?"

503
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,249
- We'd like a comment. - Please say something.

504
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,948
- A comment, please. - How do you feel right now?

505
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,049
- What is this for? - What are you aiming?

506
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,960
We will make them take legal and economic responsibility...

507
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,218
for the property damage...

508
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,260
the minority shareholders suffered...

509
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,359
and give up their management rights.

510
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,558
This is the first time...

511
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,799
minority shareholders' solidarity conference...

512
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,968
has convened a shareholders' meeting against a tycoon's conglomerate.

513
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,229
Do you think it's possible to strip the management rights...

514
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,038
and voting rights of the owner's family...

515
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,369
with the minority shareholders' power?

516
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,599
It will be a miracle.

517
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,710
I'd like to see such a miracle happen in Korea's market.

518
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,079
That is why I, Oh Se Hyeon, have returned to Miracle.

519
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,049
Please say a comment to the owner's family.

520
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,718
- Over here, please. - Why are you going this far?

521
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,719
(The minority shareholders' solidarity conference...)

522
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,719
(can convene a general shareholders' meeting.)

523
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,259
The minority shareholders' solidarity conference...

524
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,760
is nothing to worry about, Vice-Chairman.

525
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,360
Rather than shareholders, they are more like speculators.

526
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:06,139
Is there anything else as easy as settling it with money?

527
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,238
Do you not know who's leading...

528
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,809
the minority shareholders' solidarity conference?

529
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,849
It's that Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle.

530
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,578
Who knows what he'll use to pressure me this time?

531
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,920
That, too,

532
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,960
can be settled with money.

533
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:32,599
So that nobody dares shake you up, including Oh Se Hyeon,

534
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,828
you simply have to purchase the shares...

535
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,070
needed to protect the management rights.

536
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,339
The minority shareholders' solidarity conference...

537
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,880
withdrew their request for the general shareholders' meeting.

538
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,710
Soonyang Corporation's board of directors...

539
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,719
provided money to the minority shareholders.

540
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,889
As expected, they're sensitive about the profit in front of them.

541
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:00,360
They get easily swayed.

542
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,090
Do you still think...

543
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,929
the minority shareholders are our hope?

544
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,400
This one...

545
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:10,800
was bait.

546
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,738
The extraordinary shareholders' meeting...

547
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,199
was the bait we threw at them.

548
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,570
Wait a bit longer. They'll start biting soon.

549
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:41,300
Prosecutor Seo. A noticeable flow has recently been detected.

550
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:43,229
An organization has purchased a large number...

551
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,030
of Soonyang Corporation shares. Here.

552
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,339
It's common for organizations...

553
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,869
to exchange shares before the shareholders' meeting.

554
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,768
But the numbers are not small at all.

555
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,440
Look, it's 600 million dollars.

556
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,340
I don't think this organization can mobilize this much in cash.

557
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,779
A piece of noteworthy personal information...

558
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,880
is the head of the organization.

559
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,848
It has been identified as a cousin...

560
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:02,480
of Director Mo Hyeon Min, Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's wife.

561
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:07,389
A large investment has flowed into the organization recently.

562
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,389
On March 28,

563
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,730
a total of 700 million dollars.

564
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,769
The person who needed the 700 million dollars...

565
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,400
without the name, Soonyang Micro.

566
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,238
To siphon off the money,

567
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,309
that person ordered Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min to kill me.

568
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,980
Wasn't March 28 when you went on an overseas business trip?

569
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,980
Should we book Vice-Chairman Jin as a suspect?

570
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:40,219
No. The other party is the vice-chairman of Soonyang.

571
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,119
I have no power against him.

572
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:49,260
It's been ages since I gave you the homework.

573
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,929
But you only got in touch now.

574
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,170
You're taking your sweet time.

575
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,868
Will you be able to prosecute...

576
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,768
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun before the shareholders' meeting?

577
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,139
I didn't know we were meeting to check my homework.

578
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,809
I thought you were...

579
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,050
going to cooperate with the prosecution investigation.

580
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,750
There's no need to get offended.

581
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm only saying it for your sake.

582
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:14,920
I haven't heard of a woman...

583
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,090
becoming the Prosecutor General yet in your field.

584
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,460
It's an uneven playing field...

585
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,799
and a glass ceiling. There's no hope.

586
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,469
So why keep working there?

587
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,980
A woman can't become the Prosecutor General,

588
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,840
but she can become the President of this country.

589
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:40,679
If you want it, you don't have to worry about getting nominated.

590
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,848
Prosecutor Seo.

591
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,348
It's come to an age...

592
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,359
where storytelling is necessary for politics.

593
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,419
He's right.

594
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,730
You've got a great character, Prosecutor Seo.

595
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,860
Soonyang's Grim Reaper, wasn't it?

596
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,729
But it would've been better...

597
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,638
if you had a stronger showpiece.

598
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,070
Suspicion of Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's illegal succession.

599
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,738
Is getting him sentenced...

600
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,710
to jail enough to be a showpiece?

601
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,308
Yes, somewhat.

602
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:12,150
Please don't hesitate to ask for my support when you need it.

603
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,750
You haven't changed at all from 20 years ago, Mr. Choi.

604
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,118
It was around when...

605
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,030
Chairman Jin Young Ki succeeded Soonyang Group.

606
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:26,429
The car accident that killed Director Jin Do Jun.

607
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,159
You encouraged me to see the end of the investigation.

608
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,198
But the very next day,

609
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,468
you exercised...

610
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:33,769
the Minister of Justice's investigation command...

611
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,069
and stopped all investigations.

612
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,480
- You see, back then... - So?

613
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,280
What is it that you want?

614
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,579
Suspicion of Soonyang Corporation's illegal succession.

615
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,820
Please hold a hearing in the National Assembly.

616
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:51,389
Why a hearing out of the blue?

617
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:54,289
Both Soonyang and the higher-ups of the prosecutors' office...

618
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:58,460
should know the whole nation is watching.

619
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,159
The investigation must not get suspended due to external pressure.

620
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,329
Only then...

621
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,340
will Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun get arrested, as you wish.

622
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,980
This is the first time Soonyang Group...

623
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,150
has been called for a hearing.

624
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,078
It's a priceless experience...

625
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,619
Grandfather nor Father went through.

626
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,920
It's such an honor, Mr. Kim.

627
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,559
We had predicted such a thing to happen.

628
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,089
I heard Mr. Choi Chang Je...

629
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,960
worked harder than ever to set up this hearing.

630
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:38,069
With the shareholders' meeting ahead of us,

631
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,968
Mr. Yoon's accident was a favorable factor...

632
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,869
for your desperate family members...

633
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,969
to use to damage your reputation.

634
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,279
So it's all my fault?

635
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,550
It means we're almost there, Vice-Chairman Jin.

636
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,219
The management structure reformation is almost over.

637
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,920
And we bought enough shares needed to protect...

638
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,719
the management rights.

639
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,360
Nobody can stop you from becoming the next chairman.

640
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,400
We can send Chairman Jin Young Ki...

641
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,070
to rest anytime we want. Don't you agree?

642
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,149
In this hearing,

643
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,018
various suspicions related to Soonyang's illegal succession...

644
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,960
will be brought up as well.

645
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,389
People will now become aware of what intelligent methods...

646
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,260
Soonyang has used to evade...

647
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,299
inheritance and gift tax.

648
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,969
But not many will think it's a crime worth punishing.

649
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,500
People believe inheritance is human instinct.

650
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,239
Rather, they'll feel bummed for not being that lucky person.

651
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,340
Prosecutor Seo.

652
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:59,380
The guest you're scheduled to meet at 5pm is in the reception room.

653
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,149
I can't miss this meeting.

654
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,050
Please ask him if you have any further questions.

655
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,650
Okay.

656
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,519
Prosecutor Seo.

657
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,059
We won't see each other until the hearing, will we?

658
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,900
Oh, right. Mr. Yoon.

659
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,639
You've really done a great job until now.

660
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,510
Thanks to you, we've come this far against Soonyang.

661
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,789
Let's keep up the good work.

662
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,630
Of course.

663
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,360
Then I'll see you on that day.

664
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,750
Oh, you see.

665
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,159
It suits her well.

666
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,059
Prosecutor Seo's nickname.

667
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,559
You mean Soonyang's Grim Reaper?

668
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,030
Yes.

669
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,360
People really know how to hurt others.

670
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,269
Prosecutor Seo.

671
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:26,698
She had a fiance.

672
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,539
Don't be shocked at who he was.

673
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,409
He was the grandson of Soonyang Group.

674
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,238
Amid the siblings' succession war,

675
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,110
he met a dubious accidental death.

676
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,780
I heard it was about 20 years ago.

677
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,380
The investigation ended due to Soonyang's pressure.

678
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,948
That is why she goes all out to make things right...

679
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,659
when it comes to Soonyang.

680
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,159
She doesn't wear black every day...

681
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,829
to look like the grim reaper.

682
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,300
It's her way of mourning.

683
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,460
I see.

684
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:07,079
You're having him stand as a witness at the hearing, right?

685
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,579
He's the sole survivor and witness of the scene.

686
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:21,260
Did you find it?

687
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,969
Did I have to find out about the hearing through the news?

688
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,699
Answer me.

689
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,968
How can you call us a family?

690
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:39,570
We don't have time for your complaints.

691
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,709
The talk about the hearing alone...

692
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,380
is making the stock price plummet.

693
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,579
We need to come up with a plan to protect...

694
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,719
the stock price first.

695
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,449
Whether it's a hearing investigation or a prosecution investigation,

696
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,920
horrible incidents like attempted murder...

697
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,530
have nothing to do with Soonyang. It was an individual's deviance, no?

698
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,869
Let's make a public apology...

699
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,269
and make Seong Jun resign.

700
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,408
Now I finally understand why...

701
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,340
you all came here in a hurry this late at night.

702
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,309
Seize the chance, right?

703
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,550
Seong Jun has fallen into a trap.

704
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,079
But you're putting pressure on him to take away the management rights.

705
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:25,789
So what family?

706
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,789
It's not as if we don't have our reason.

707
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,090
He has a history.

708
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:32,460
Everyone here knows, right?

709
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,760
Why Do Jun died 20 years ago.

710
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,629
- Back then, Seong Jun... - Hey.

711
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,670
Ji Na.

712
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,539
Our nephew Do Jun passed away in a three-car rear-end collision.

713
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,139
You all know it well.

714
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:50,980
Let's be careful, okay?

715
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:54,819
If words start to get out, everything will get out of hand.

716
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,690
It will be the end of Soonyang and us,

717
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,119
not only Seong Jun.

718
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,300
It's the same as 20 years ago.

719
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,280
Just like today, you were all convinced I had killed Do Jun.

720
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,409
There was no evidence, but no doubt either.

721
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,349
But why?

722
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,320
Tell me.

723
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,880
Why?

724
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,590
Didn't everyone here want to kill Do Jun?

725
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,760
- Am I wrong? - Enough, Seong Jun!

726
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,400
I'm sorry, Mother. Excuse me first.

727
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,809
Watch your mouth, will you?

728
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:56,480
Aren't we a family? So how could you suspect him?

729
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,429
Don't you...

730
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,269
have something to tell me?

731
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,039
It wasn't me, Father. I swear.

732
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,280
Don't you believe me?

733
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:36,919
It wasn't me.

734
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,150
Do Jun's accident had nothing to do with me, Father!

735
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:41,460
Is that so?

736
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,610
(Soonyang Venture Investment, Jin Seong Jun)

737
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,210
It was found...

738
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,679
at the scene of Do Jun's accident.

739
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:12,549
How will you explain...

740
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,119
this business card... was found in the driver's seat...

741
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,260
of the car at fault?

742
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,230
Even your name was...

743
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,599
on the driver's bank account details.

744
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,670
Father.

745
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,280
I know.

746
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,780
I know how much you detest Do Jun.

747
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,889
Everyone in this family knows how you feel.

748
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,360
Yes, it must be frustrating.

749
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:51,360
Nobody...

750
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:54,400
would believe you in this situation.

751
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:05,840
That's right.

752
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,050
Seong Jun. Don't worry.

753
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,650
You have me, your father.

754
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:18,250
I will not let you live as a murderer.

755
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,559
For now,

756
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,429
I'd better have the management rights.

757
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,739
Only then will the people not suspect you.

758
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,670
From now on,

759
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:42,079
only listen to me.

760
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,079
Seong Jun.

761
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,538
Inform them that you can't make it to the hearing...

762
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,840
if it's stressing you out too much.

763
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,880
It's not a legal obligation anyway.

764
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,280
Aren't you curious?

765
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,919
Aren't you curious about whether I incited the murder...

766
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,420
of our employee or not?

767
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,760
It doesn't matter.

768
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,789
What matters to me... No.

769
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,059
What matters to us is...

770
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,099
not to make any reasons for having you disqualified...

771
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:39,869
from being appointed as Soonyang Group's chairman.

772
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,369
You won't be attending the hearing.

773
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:45,170
It's been decided.

774
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,679
Mr. Kim.

775
00:56:57,889 --> 00:56:59,090
I've made up my mind.

776
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,289
Let's attend the hearing.

777
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,499
- Here they are. - They're here.

778
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,199
(Children's Day)

779
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,280
- Please make way. - Over here.

780
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:22,710
Make way.

781
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,848
Do you admit to inciting the murder?

782
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:27,480
- I'm from Jaeil News. - Look over here.

783
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,518
- Please say something. - Vice-Chairman Jin!

784
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,788
Look this way.

785
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:32,348
An investigation hearing on the alleged illegal succession...

786
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:33,888
of Soonyang Group...

787
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:35,319
is currently underway...

788
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,929
at the National Assembly's main meeting hall.

789
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,658
An intensive question-and-answer session...

790
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,299
is expected at today's hearing...

791
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,529
on various suspicions...

792
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,299
surrounding Soonyang's expedient succession...

793
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,729
and the attempted murder discovered...

794
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,569
during the recent illegal overseas slush funds investigation.

795
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,808
The next chairman appointment of Soonyang Group,

796
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:52,238
scheduled to take place...

797
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,609
at Soonyang Corporation's shareholders' meeting next month,

798
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,308
is expected to change significantly...

799
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:58,010
depending on the results of today's hearing.

800
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,149
It's Vice-Chairman Jin!

801
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,349
It's Vice-Chairman Jin.

802
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:05,650
- Over here. - Give us a statement.

803
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:07,259
Do you admit to the suspicions?

804
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,920
How do you feel right now?

805
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,859
Vice-Chairman Jin, any comments to make?

806
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,629
- Please say something. - Vice-Chairman Jin!

807
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,799
- How do you feel? - What do you plan to say?

808
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,598
- We'd like a comment. - Are you ready for the hearing?

809
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,070
Are the suspicions true?

810
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,529
Vice-Chairman Jin!

811
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,439
Are you involved in the attempted murder?

812
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,369
Do you have anything to say about the suspicions?

813
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,579
I didn't know you had such a talent, Mr. Yoon.

814
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,119
Who would've thought you'd conduct a hearing against Soonyang?

815
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,050
How do you feel?

816
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,690
Your advice really helped, Mr. Kim.

817
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,860
"Revenge is for those with power,"

818
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,429
"not for those who have been wronged."

819
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,500
By any chance, do you know why?

820
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,509
Soonyang Micro's ledger.

821
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:01,980
The reason why you went to Vice-Chairman Jin and reported.

822
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:04,050
I was wondering if you knew the reason.

823
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:08,179
Because of your conscience?

824
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:11,650
No.

825
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:15,590
You went over to wag your tail at Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun...

826
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,789
who'll be your new owner.

827
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:23,300
You needed a new connection to replace the collapsed chairman.

828
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:27,099
And you probably wanted to show something to other staff...

829
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,239
who sneered at you because you're only a high school graduate.

830
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,909
I needed you to know...

831
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:43,519
who you really are before you went inside.

832
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,860
That way, you can be yourself as you give them answers.

833
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,809
(A Hearing for Soonyang Group's Expedient Succession and Slush Fund)

834
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,480
(Witness)

835
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,449
What were you in charge of...

836
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,489
when you were on a business trip abroad, Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

837
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,389
I was in charge of reverting 700 million dollars...

838
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:24,690
back to Soonyang.

839
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:28,260
Witness, did you succeed?

840
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,170
No, I couldn't.

841
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:33,739
Why not?

842
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,710
I was abducted by assailants, got shot,

843
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,039
and lost my consciousness.

844
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,479
The one who hired local assailants to shoot you...

845
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,819
and took 700 million dollars of slush fund...

846
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,219
was someone you were acquainted with?

847
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,360
- Is that correct? - Yes, it is.

848
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,590
A staff member of Soonyang Group's Future Asset Management Department.

849
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,000
He said it was an order from his superior.

850
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,699
Who do you think it was?

851
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,309
I think it was Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun.

852
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,610
- Jin Seong Jun? - He really thinks so?

853
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,249
- Really? - He said Jin Seong Jun.

854
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,579
You. How can you be so sure?

855
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,650
Do you have any grounds for your argument?

856
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,558
(Witness)

857
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,559
Witness.

858
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,899
Recently, an organization bought out 600 million dollars worth...

859
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,960
of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

860
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,500
Were you aware of this?

861
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,300
Yes, I found out through a public announcement.

862
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,199
So you had no idea before the announcement?

863
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,210
When the head of the organization is your wife's relative?

864
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:49,980
I've been too busy with work,

865
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,880
so I did not get to look after my in-laws.

866
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,948
Do you mean this has nothing to do...

867
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,988
with defending your managerial rights?

868
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,219
Who would believe that?

869
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:04,489
Soonyang Corporation's shares are considered solid, wanted by anybody.

870
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,000
I believe this was simply a wise investment.

871
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,130
The public sentiment began to change as soon as the hearing began.

872
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,739
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun is a hot potato on social media.

873
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,509
His fashion in the hearing.

874
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,309
His composed manners as a grandson of a rich family.

875
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:21,440
The public sentiment did change...

876
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,480
in the opposite direction of our expectation.

877
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,050
Who is the next witness?

878
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,419
This witness will testify that Soonyang was...

879
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,789
behind the attempted murder of Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo.

880
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,459
An agent of the National Intelligence Service...

881
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,030
who witnessed the accident and saved Mr. Yoon...

882
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:55,639
The witness just contacted us that they could not make it...

883
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,780
due to unforeseen personal circumstances.

884
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,389
These people moved the date around to return to Korea for the hearing.

885
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:10,889
These personal reasons must be Soonyang.

886
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,039
Without the testimony of the agents,

887
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:31,309
we have no other way of proving Soonyang's murder instigation.

888
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,309
It happened once before 20 years ago.

889
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,449
A murder surrounding the succession.

890
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,349
It was covered up as a car accident, but it was obviously a murder case.

891
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,159
If the hearing ends like this,

892
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,559
it's too unfair for you, Mr. Yoon.

893
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,989
We found the sole witness and survivor...

894
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,730
of the accident.

895
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,469
He'll come and bear witness to the situation of that day.

896
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,739
Then let us begin the questioning for the next witness.

897
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,869
Witness, please be seated.

898
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:47,019
(A Hearing for Soonyang Group's Expedient Succession and Slush Fund)

899
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,260
(Witness)

900
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,530
What do you think you're doing?

901
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,960
My poor son died an unfair death.

902
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,269
I had to lift his grudge...

903
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,099
before I passed away.

904
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:11,150
Witness, please tell us who you are.

905
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,250
Well, right.

906
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,150
Ha In Seok.

907
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,190
My name is Ha In Seok.

908
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:25,929
The grandson of Soonyang Group,

909
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,559
Director Jin Do Jun's secretary.

910
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,239
Wait, so nobody knows who Director Jin Do Jun is?

911
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,710
Twenty years ago,

912
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,949
he was killed.

913
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:47,079
- What? - What's he saying?

914
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,579
- He was killed? - Jin Do Jun?

915
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,988
Witness, only answer the questions we ask.

916
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:54,019
Why?

917
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,860
You're going to shut me up again?

918
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,489
I've stayed quiet enough for the last 20 years.

919
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,329
I still...

920
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:06,099
I still remember it like it was yesterday.

921
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,969
That car accident.

922
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,039
It wasn't an accident.

923
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,380
It was a murder case.

924
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:16,409
- Murder? - Is he serious?

925
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,578
- What? - What's he saying?

926
01:06:19,579 --> 01:06:21,779
- Can he prove that? - He was murdered?

927
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,549
- That car accident? - Director Jin Do Jun?

928
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,590
Witness.

929
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:28,360
Did you just say it was a murder case,

930
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,489
not a car accident?

931
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,530
Do you know who did it?

932
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,139
The accomplice is...

933
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,780
sitting here right now.

934
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,969
You remember me, right?

935
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,579
You know, you were there with me at the scene of the car accident.

936
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,429
Director Jin Do Jun.

937
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:42,059
Director Jin.

938
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:45,169
You can't stay here. You must leave.

939
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,229
Let go of me!

940
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,440
You cannot let them take you down just as they did on that day.

941
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,599
Let go of me!

942
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,669
Director Jin, you can't stay here!

943
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,510
You cannot stay here, Director Jin!

944
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,679
Director Jin! You must leave!

945
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:15,659
Thank you.

946
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:19,800
Mr. Ha In Seok is suffering from alcoholic dementia.

947
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,069
Everything he said on the witness stand...

948
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:26,510
will not be taken into account as a valid testimony.

949
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,939
I should have checked his condition a bit more thoroughly.

950
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,079
I thought this hearing may be our last chance,

951
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,649
so I got ahead of myself.

952
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:45,489
Are you afraid the culprits won't be punished? Is that why?

953
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,060
Because I felt bad.

954
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,199
If I resolved this case...

955
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,199
twenty years ago,

956
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,339
I wouldn't have met you now...

957
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,239
as another victim of Soonyang.

958
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,050
That's why I worked harder on this.

959
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:09,449
Because I felt bad.

960
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:38,109
Yes, I just arrived.

961
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:41,350
Is this the right place? I don't see anyone here.

962
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,359
Yes, I...

963
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:10,569
Mr. Yoon.

964
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,069
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo.

965
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,810
Yoon Hyeon Woo, answer me!

966
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:22,779
Someone... Someone just died here.

967
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:26,720
Someone... Someone just died.

968
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:32,689
Someone died because of me!

969
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,399
Why didn't you tell me...

970
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,310
that this was my job?

971
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,979
That I was to work as bait for someone's murder?

972
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,720
You should've told me from the start.

973
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:00,319
What would change?

974
01:12:04,829 --> 01:12:05,829
If I had known,

975
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:10,199
I would not have followed your orders.

976
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:16,539
Then your contract with Soonyang will expire as of this month.

977
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:20,839
You'll have to go back to your ragged home...

978
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,738
with your sick brother and dad who is a credit defaulter,

979
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:25,779
living as a contract worker for subcontractors for life,

980
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,619
then bequeath your disgusting poverty your kid,

981
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:33,189
proud of the fact that you were a good man.

982
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:43,329
You only live once.

983
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:50,439
You should get to live well like the others do.

984
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:12,430
Is this the police?

985
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,659
I have something to report.

986
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:51,300
Sir?

987
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,869
Please speak. Hello?

988
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,970
Hello?

989
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,538
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

990
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:33,840
Do not ask questions.

991
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,479
Do not make a judgment.

992
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,948
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

993
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:40,579
Do not ask questions. Do not make a judgment.

994
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,118
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

995
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:44,689
Do not ask questions. Do not make a judgment.

996
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,460
That day,

997
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,890
what I wanted to wipe away...

998
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,869
wasn't the scar left on my hand.

999
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,270
It was the face.

1000
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:10,079
It was Jin Do Jun's face...

1001
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,649
that looked at me.

1002
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,119
I don't know the passcode to your house.

1003
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,390
(Doorlock)

1004
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:23,559
(Set temporary passcode)

1005
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,590
(Temporary passcode: 0919)

1006
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
I sent you a temporary number. You can check.

1007
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,170
(Front door, temporary passcode: 0919)

1008
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:34,869
One and nine.

1009
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,939
Zero, nine, one, nine.

1010
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,710
It's open.

1011
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,250
So what do I have to do now?

1012
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:13,710
So you're asking me to send you whatever's in here to your phone?

1013
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:18,079
Before we resume the hearing, I have an announcement to make.

1014
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,349
The witness from this morning, Ha In Seok,

1015
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,750
was confirmed with a history of alcohol dementia.

1016
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,448
Everything he said in the hearing is...

1017
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:29,688
difficult to be discerned as facts.

1018
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:32,289
Therefore, his testimony will not be accepted.

1019
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,430
Soonyang Corporation and Jin Do Jun...

1020
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,529
Someone... Someone just died here.

1021
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,770
Someone... Someone just...

1022
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:42,969
Someone died. Can you call an ambulance?

1023
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,970
Someone just died. Please.

1024
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,380
Someone died...

1025
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,439
because of me!

1026
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,849
Someone just died!

1027
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,379
(A Hearing for Soonyang Group's Expedient Succession and Slush Fund)

1028
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,579
What is this?

1029
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:05,890
Did you say it's difficult to trust Ha In Seok's witness account...

1030
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:11,300
of the accident 20 years ago because of his alcoholic dementia?

1031
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,439
In that case,

1032
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:18,439
what about the accomplice's confession?

1033
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,670
- What? - What?

1034
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,680
What now?

1035
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:24,649
I am the accomplice...

1036
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,619
who was on the scene of Director Jin Do Jun's death.

1037
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:32,789
- What's he saying? - Is he serious?

1038
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:35,359
The phone conversation...

1039
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,989
recorded on my phone from the accident is the proof.

1040
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:41,459
What is he saying?

1041
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,460
Mr. Yoon. Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo.

1042
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:45,670
Pull yourself together and talk to me.

1043
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:47,329
Is anybody around you?

1044
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,770
Leave the area before anyone sees you.

1045
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:54,779
Do not get worked up. Keep your calm as you move.

1046
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:02,920
Good work.

1047
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,789
I hope...

1048
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:11,319
Seong Jun understands his father's profound consideration.

1049
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:13,529
- Mr. Kim. - Yes, sir.

1050
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:14,659
I am...

1051
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:19,470
Jin Yang Cheol's son. His eldest son.

1052
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,810
(A Hearing for Soonyang Group's Expedient Succession and Slush Fund)

1053
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,649
Mr. Jin Seong Jun! Is this true?

1054
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:37,680
Were you aware of your father, Chairman Jin Young Ki's crime?

1055
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:40,119
Were you two in this together...

1056
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:41,759
to take the management rights?

1057
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,288
Witness, answer me.

1058
01:18:43,289 --> 01:18:44,789
- Witness! - Witness!

1059
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,789
- Answer me, Mr. Jin Seong Jun! - Witness!

1060
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:51,568
- Why won't he say anything? - Did you do it?

1061
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:52,729
Go ahead and answer.

1062
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,939
Did he really do that?

1063
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:04,510
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1064
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:06,479
Is this your revenge?

1065
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,890
You finally managed to live like a decent human...

1066
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,520
thanks to the money Soonyang gave you.

1067
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:16,560
How dare you do this?

1068
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:17,920
Put the cameras away.

1069
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,589
Put the cameras away!

1070
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,189
- Goodness. - Get him.

1071
01:19:21,699 --> 01:19:24,399
This is why you never treat your associates well.

1072
01:19:25,029 --> 01:19:27,970
The rich man's dog thinks he became a rich man.

1073
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:34,369
I raised a dog that grew up to bite its owner.

1074
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:39,009
- You cannot do this! - Move!

1075
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,350
Let go. Let go of me!

1076
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,979
Let go!

1077
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,050
The world can't take me down!

1078
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,788
During the hearing of Soonyang's illegal succession,

1079
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:53,390
crucial evidence was presented to prove...

1080
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,698
Chairman Jin Young Ki's murder instigation...

1081
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,369
of Jin Do Jun's murder in 2004.

1082
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,389
Boycott Soonyang's products!

1083
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:25,459
- Boycott! - Boycott!

1084
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,429
Do not buy or sell...

1085
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:28,858
- Soonyang's products! - Do not buy or sell!

1086
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:32,669
The anger against the owners of Soonyang led to a boycott,

1087
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,369
and the group finally caved in.

1088
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,568
Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki and other owner's family...

1089
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:38,969
held a press conference.

1090
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,639
They announced they will step down...

1091
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,479
from managing the businesses as of this day.

1092
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,449
(Divorce Agreement)

1093
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,478
(Sighed by Mo Hyeon Min)

1094
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,519
Hence, the great-grandson of the former chairman...

1095
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,059
will not succeed the group,

1096
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,789
and they'll also join an extensive ethics recovery program.

1097
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,129
(Jin Do Jun rests here.)

1098
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,599
The special prosecutor also plans on conducting...

1099
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,528
further investigation on the death of Jin Do Jun...

1100
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,970
as it was exposed during the hearing.

1101
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,538
During the shareholders' meeting,

1102
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:14,169
Soonyang Group decided to leave the management...

1103
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,810
to a management specialist.

1104
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:18,549
Stock prices for Soonyang and its affiliation...

1105
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,309
finally began to rise in the market,

1106
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,079
closing up higher by the end of the day.

1107
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:24,180
Everything unfolded just as you wanted.

1108
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:29,520
You took the Jin family's the management rights...

1109
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:32,529
without holding a single share in your hand.

1110
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,029
I couldn't make enough money...

1111
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,399
to buy enough shares in 20 years of my days in Soonyang.

1112
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:40,970
However,

1113
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:45,409
I was fully trained on how the owner's family...

1114
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:46,970
thinks and moves.

1115
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:50,840
So allow me to buy those thoughts.

1116
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:03,289
Yes, Father. I'm on my way home.

1117
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,359
Would you like some fruit?

1118
01:22:05,829 --> 01:22:09,359
I'm sorry I keep making you pay for things.

1119
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,170
I'm sorry that I'm late. But I'll be home for dinner.

1120
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,199
Yes, I'll see you soon, Father.

1121
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,609
Bye.

1122
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,979
I finally know now.

1123
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:31,050
It wasn't possession or time traveling.

1124
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:34,850
It was...

1125
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,060
repentance.

1126
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,760
My repentance for Jin Do Jun.

1127
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:44,359
And...

1128
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:47,470
repentance...

1129
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:52,770
for me, Yoon Hyeon Woo.

1130
01:23:04,949 --> 01:23:06,090
Yes, Mr. Oh.

1131
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,220
I hear Daeyoung adopted all kinds of expedients...

1132
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,359
to leave the group to the great-grandchildren.

1133
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,499
Exactly. As long as taxes are paid, there is no problem...

1134
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,699
in inheriting one's assets.

1135
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,300
The problem is succeeding management rights.

1136
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,640
Mr. Oh, let me call you back.

1137
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,210
Bye.

1138
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:36,050
(Seo Tai Ji celebrates his 30th debut anniversary.)

1139
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,640
Have you been well?

1140
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,340
Yes.

1141
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,510
You're a bit different from the Prosecutor Seo I know.

1142
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,850
Thanks to you, I graduated from my job as Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

1143
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,460
You look better now.

1144
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,159
They're nice clothes.

1146
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,270
Hey, Prosecutor Seo.

1147
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,350
